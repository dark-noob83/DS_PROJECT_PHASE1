Click here and scroll down to see the price for a Falcon Heavy launch ($83 million) and that the payload it will be able to carry to LEO is 117,000 pounds. That works out to $709 per pound, less than the $1000 per pound BTE goal for the Heavy Lifter to be used for launching the Enterprise components into space. reusing might be the better way, but it may be that the exstra weight for heat shields, landing gear, and so and the extra costs of the reusable technology will make it more cost effective to use it in space. remember that a pound in space is worth 1000 $.
If the SLS is able to meet the $500 million target, it would end up being cheaper to fly than the space shuttle. The shuttle program cost about $209 billion (in 2010 dollars) over its lifetime and made a total of 135 flights, yielding an average cost per launch of more than $1.5 billion. Two or three flights per year. View full size image. The giant rocket NASA is building to carry astronauts to Mars and other destinations in deep space may cost $500 million per launch when it's flying regularly, space agency officials said Tuesday (Sept.
On an average it costs up tp 150 million.... 11. 0. How much does it cost to go to space depends upon the weight of the person. Presently, the cost involves, $20,000 per pound. On an average it costs up tp 150 million dollars for a person to go to space. 
For a space elevator, the cost varies according to the design. Bradley C. Edwards received funding from NIAC from 2001 to 2003 to write a paper, describing a space elevator design. In it he stated that: The first space elevator would reduce lift costs immediately to $100 per pound ($220/kg). 
Report Abuse. Estimates I have heard say that is costs $10,000US per pound of weight just to get the craft into orbit. If you consider that the average astronaut weighs in at 150 pounds, and you can have up to 7 people riding that comes out to $10,500,000 in just weight of passengers. The launch vehicle (shuttle, external tank, solid rocket boosters, plus payloads) can weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds...ouch, that's a lot of money.
Today, it costs $10,000 to put a pound of payload in Earth orbit. NASA’s goal is to reduce the cost of getting to space to hundreds of dollars per pound within 25 years and tens of dollars per pound within 40 years. Going to Mars, the stars and beyond requires a vision for the future and innovative technology development to take us there. Scientists and engineers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., are paving the highway to space by developing technologies for 21st century space transportation.
The cost depends on the rocket, and on the percent capacity of said rocket, but here's a few numbers for you, cost in U.S. dollars/kg to LEO (Wikipedia *). It should be noted that not all rocket prices are publicly available, in fact, most aren't. 1  Falcon Heavy: \$2200. 2  Falcon 9 v 1.1- \$4,109. 3  DNEPR- \$3,784.
