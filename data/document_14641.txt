Arthropathy. OverviewArthropathy is a collective term for any disease of the joints. The disease may be localized to one joint, as with post-traumatic arthritis, or may affect multiple joints, as with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Degenerative arthropathy can also occur secondary to malunion of a nearby fracture that results in altered biomechanics of the joint. Neuropathic arthropathy is the rapid degeneration of joints due to a loss of sensation associated with certain diseases, resulting in impaired position sense and pain perception.
Think of arthropathy as just another word for arthritis or osteoarthritis. The facet joints are joints on either side of each level of the spine that alow for movement of the … spine. Facet arthopathy is just arthritis of these joints and a term often used by people reading x-rays or MRIs. 1 Facet Arthropathy: An Arthritic Back Facet arthropathy (FA) is a form of degenerative arthritis that affects the spine. 2  It targets the facet joints of the spine and causes arthritis-like pain in the back. 3  Facet ….
Psoriatic arthritis (also arthritis psoriatica, arthropathic psoriasis or psoriatic arthropathy) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that will develop in up to 30 percent of people who have the chronic skin condition psoriasis. 
degenerative arthropathy. a degenerative disease of the joints, e.g. degenerative disease of the stifle or hip joint in the ox. The disease may be primary when there appears to be a metabolic defect in the articular cartilage. Secondary arthropathy occurs consequentially to a disease of the supporting bone. developmental arthropathy. results from abnormalities in development or growth that cause structural injury or abnormal function in a joint, e.g. conformational abnormalities, chondrodystrophy, osteochondrosis, growth disorders, legg-calve-calvé perthes disease and patellar. luxation
see degenerative arthropathy (above). developmental arthropathy. results from abnormalities in development or growth that cause structural injury or abnormal function in a joint, e.g. conformational abnormalities, chondrodystrophy, osteochondrosis, growth disorders, legg-calve-calvé perthes disease and patellar. luxation
chondrocalcific arthropathy progressive polyarthritis with joint swelling and bony enlargement, most commonly in the small joints of the hand but also affecting other joints, characterized radiographically by narrowing of the joint space with subchondral erosions and sclerosis and frequently chondrocalcinosis. developmental arthropathy. results from abnormalities in development or growth that cause structural injury or abnormal function in a joint, e.g. conformational abnormalities, chondrodystrophy, osteochondrosis, growth disorders, legg-calve-calvé perthes disease and patellar. luxation

A. Arthropathy just means “joint problem.” Doctors often use arthropathy interchangeably with arthritis, which means joint inflammation.. There are some forms of arthropathy that are distinct from arthritis: 1  Neuropathic arthropathy: Nerve damage from diabetes or another nerve condition results in slow damage to joints. 
neuropathic arthropathy chronic progressive degeneration of the stress-bearing portion of a joint, with hypertrophic changes at the periphery; it is associated with neurologic disorders involving loss of sensation in the joint. Called also Charcot's arthropathy. developmental arthropathy. results from abnormalities in development or growth that cause structural injury or abnormal function in a joint, e.g. conformational abnormalities, chondrodystrophy, osteochondrosis, growth disorders, legg-calve-calvé perthes disease and patellar. luxation
