This Code has been rewritten to reflect the changes in the 2007 Act and, very importantly, there is now a separate version specifically for Wales. The Mental Health Act Code of Practice for Wales came into force in November 2008. So to summarise, from November 2008, the important mental health statutory documents for Wales are: • the Mental Health Act 1983, as amended by the Mental Health Act 2007. • the Welsh Mental Health Act Code of Practice. This Guide will now explain what, in practice, has remained the same and what has changed. We will look first at the Mental Health Acts and then at the Code of Practice

Abstract. The Mental Health Act (1983) and the Mental Capacity Act (2005) (both amended by the Mental Health Act (2007)) together provide a comprehensive framework for the care and treatment of people with a mental disorder in England and Wales. Both Acts were amended by the Mental Health Act (2007), which introduced Community Treatment Orders, modified the existing consent provisions under the MHA and added Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DOLS) to the MCA.
A Bill to amend section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983; and for connected purposes. 
The Mental Health Act 1983 (which was substantially amended in 2007) is the law in England and Wales that allows people with a ‘mental disorder’ to be admitted to hospital, detained and treated without their consent – either for their own health and safety, or for the protection of other people. Section 136 of the Mental Health Act allows the police to take someone from a public place to a place of safety, if they think he or she needs immediate care or control. A 'place of safety' might be a mental health hospital, an accident and emergency department, or a police cell.
The 2007 Mental Health Act made several key changes to the 1983 Mental Health Act, which laid down provision for the compulsory detention and treatment of people with mental health problems in England and Wales. Other amendments included in the 2007 Mental Health Act. The 2007 MHA was also used to introduce deprivation of liberty safeguards through amending the 2005 Mental Capacity Act, while the rights of victims were extended by amending the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.
