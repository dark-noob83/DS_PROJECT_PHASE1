Ideally, we should all have a blood pressure below 120 over 80 (120/80). This is the ideal blood pressure for people wishing to have good health. At this level, we have a much lower risk of heart disease or stroke. If your blood pressure is optimal, this is great news.
Abnormal Levels. A blood pressure reading of 120/80 and below is considered normal. There are three degrees of abnormal blood pressure, or what is termed high blood pressure, or hypertension. The stage of pre-hypertension is valued at a range of 120 to 139 systolic and 80 to 89 diastolic.
If your blood pressure is above 120/80mmHg, you will need to lower it. Most adults in the UK have blood pressure readings in the range from 120 over 80 (120/80) to 140 over 90 (140/90). If your blood pressure is within this range, you should be taking steps to bring it down or to stop it rising any further.
Doctors generally consider a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg or less to be normal and healthy. More attention is usually paid to the systolic pressure, but both numbers are important. Either a systolic pressure above 120 or diastolic pressure above 80 may be cause for concern if readings remain consistently high.
The bottom number, called the diastolic pressure, is the measurement as the heart relaxes between beats. Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension.
For a long time, normal blood pressure was defined as 120/80 (systolic/diastolic). In 2006, the American Heart Association (AHA) changed the definition of normal blood pressure to less than 120/less than 80, and this standard is used globally.
