You can refrigerate box cake batter for a few hours or so. (The manufacturers have actually done this in their test labs.) With scratch cakes this is not recommended as the leavening agents start to work almost immediately.
Storage: Room Temperature. Storage Note: Cakes with this type of filling can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 days as long as the frosting can be stored at room temperature; after 4 days the jelly will have a tendency to start to mould. The filling can be refrigerated if the frosting on the cake calls for it.
Depends. If your recipe uses baking soda, it should be fine, as baking soda's reaction that causes rising does not begin until heated. If your cake uses baking powder,however, the reaction is activated by contact with liquid. So it begins as soon as you mix the batter.
A. You can store cake at room temp or in the fridge or freezer. Cake will keep at room temp for up to 2 days, loosely covered. Both frosted and unfrosted cakes will keep up to 5 days in the fridge if they're tightly covered. All cakes with custard or whipped-cream filling or topping should be refrigerated. Frosted and unfrosted cakes can be frozen for up to 2 months.
