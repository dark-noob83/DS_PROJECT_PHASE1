For something like a snowflake, the terminal velocity is usually very slow. According to the attached reference [2], the terminal velocity of snowflakes varies between 1.5 mph and 9 mph, depending on the shape and density of the snowflake (for comparison, human beings fall at about 125 mph). The typical mass of a snowflake is 3 mg [5]. It would have a kinetic energy of about 6.7419e-007 Joules at terminal velocity, and a falling 220 lb man has a kinetic energy of about 1.56e6 Joules at terminal velocity.
In a typical winter storm, snowflakes begin their descent from a cloud layer about ten thousand feet above the ground. Assuming an average fall speed of 3.5 feet per second, a snowflake would take more than 45 minutes to reach Earth. Dear Ron, Snow expert and Colorado assistant state climatologist Nolan Doesken states the vast majority of snowflakes fall at speeds between 1 to 6 feet per second. A snowflake's surface area and its mass are the most important factors in determining the rate of fall.
Report Abuse. Well, in an airless environment, a snowflake would fall at the same speed as say, an anvil. Because we have air, however, and the snowflake is much lighter, the wind will greatly effect the snowflake (less so for the anvil). The typical mass of a snowflake is 3 mg [5]. It would have a kinetic energy of about 6.7419e-007 Joules at terminal velocity, and a falling 220 lb man has a kinetic energy of about 1.56e6 Joules at terminal velocity.
It might be noted that snowflakes fall much slower than raindrops, which fall at 5 to 20 mph [6], so raindrops can deliver more force than snowflakes can for precipitation objects (snowflakes or raindrops) of the same mass. The typical mass of a snowflake is 3 mg [5]. It would have a kinetic energy of about 6.7419e-007 Joules at terminal velocity, and a falling 220 lb man has a kinetic energy of about 1.56e6 Joules at terminal velocity.
Large flakes act like parachutes and fall slower, but kernel-like snow pellets known as “graupel” can fall much faster. Temperature, too is a factor. Heavy, wet snowflakes – the kind that fall when temperatures are above freezing – fall faster. Surprisingly, snowflake fall speed is independent of horizontal wind. Even during high winds, they still fall at one to six feet per second. 
In contrast to dry snow and rain, thefall speeds for wet snow have larger standard deviations and are poorly correlated toparticle size for D ≥ 2.4 mm (Fig. 9a). The average fall speed of wet snow with Dbetween 2.4 mm and 11 mm is 2 m s -1 (Fig. Accumulated joint size and fall speed distributions of observed particles after quality control is applied (Sec. 2). (a) Rain-only event at McKenzie Bridge, Oregon between 0300-0800 UTC 17 December 2001, and (b) dry snow event at Storm Peak, Colorado from 0000-1400 UTC 27 February 2003.
Just to make it a lot simpler, we'll assume the earth's orbit is a circle, with the sun at the center. Then the average speed is (circumference of the orbit) per year. R … adius of the orbit = 93 million miles Circumference = 2 pi R = 186 million pi miles And there it is ! The average speed is 186 million pi miles per year, with respect to the sun. Speed of falling rain drops depends on size and weight of the rain drops that is the bigger the faster and vice versa.However the average speed of falling rain drop range from … 4.5 to 19 mph. 15 people found this useful.
http://www.wonderquest.com/falling-raind... The average snowflake falls at a speed of 3.1 miles per hour. (5 kilometers) http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/scie... Hail can falls much faster, because its diameter can be larger. Its fallspeed is approximately given by 1.4 D0.8 at sea level, the exact relationship depends on hail density and shape. The following is: It depends on the size and weight of the raindrop how fast it falls: the heavier, the faster. At sea level, a large raindrop about 5 millimeters across (house-fly size) falls at the rate of 9 meters per second (20 miles per hour). Drizzle drops (less than 0.5 mm across, i.e., salt-grain size) fall at 2 meters per second (4.5 mph). A raindrop starts falling and then picks up speed because of gravity
