Introduction [edit]. The Northern blot, also known as the RNA blot, is one of the blotting techniques used to transfer DNA and RNA onto a carrier for sorting and identification. The Northern blot is similar to the Southern blot except that RNA instead of DNA is the subject of analysis in this technique.
The Northern Blot technique was originally designed in 1977 by James Alwine, David Kemp, and George Stark at Stanford University to investigate RNA structure and quantity, though today it is used almost exclusively to quantify gene transcription (using messenger RNA [mRNA]) and thus assess gene expression (1, 5).
Northern blot. A northern blot is a laboratory method used to detect specific RNA molecules among a mixture of RNA. Northern blotting can be used to analyze a sample of RNA from a particular tissue or cell type in order to measure the RNA expression of particular genes.
