-- Ask the people you are serving how they like their steaks cooked. Steaks for those who like their meat well-done should go under the broiler a few minutes before the steaks for those who like their meat rare to medium. -- Place the steaks on the unheated rack of the broiler pan.-- For 1-inch steaks cooked to medium doneness, broil the steaks for about 15 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking time. Allow less time for rare steaks and more time for well-done steaks.
Place a 10-to-12-inch cast-iron skillet in the oven and heat the oven to 500 degrees F. Bring the steak to room temperature. When the oven reaches temperature, remove the skillet and place on the range over high heat for 5 minutes. Coat the steak lightly with oil and sprinkle both sides with a generous pinch of salt. Grind on black pepper. Immediately place the steak in the middle of the hot, dry skillet. Cook 30 seconds without moving. Turn with tongs and cook another 30 seconds, then put the pan straight into the oven for 2 minutes. Flip the steak and cook for another 2 minutes. (This time is for medium-rare steak.
Turn the broiler on and heat the pan you will be cooking the steaks on. Just as you donâ€™t want to throw the steak in a cold pan or on a cold grill, you want to make sure your broiler pan is nice and hot as well. Oil it a little with olive oil and turn the broiler on for 10 minutes. When the broiler is preheated, put your steaks on the pan and slide it under the flame.

Broil your steak. Place your steak into the oven on the rack closest to the broiler. Cooking times will vary greatly based on the cut of steak, cooking altitude, type of oven you're using, and how hot the broiler runs; cooking times can range from 3 to 18 minutes. A good rule of thumb to go by is to watch it! 
Line a broiler pan with aluminum foil, add the top, and spray the top with nonstick cooking spray. Broil the steak 4 to 6 minutes per side: Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off any excess, and place it in the middle of the broiler pan. Slide it directly under the broil.
