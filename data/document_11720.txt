Measles, also known as Rubeola or morbilli, is a highly infectious illness caused by a virus-a viral infection caused by the rubeola virus. Measles is an endemic disease; meaning it is continually present in a community and many people develop resistance.
Causes. The cause of measles is a virus that replicates in the nose and throat of an infected child or adult. When someone with measles coughs, sneezes or talks, infected droplets spray into the air, where other people can inhale them.

Measles is caused by infection with the rubeola virus, a paramyxovirus of the genus Morbillivirus. The virus lives in the mucus of the nose and throat of an infected child or adult. The infected person is contagious for four days before the rash appears, and continues so for about four to five days afterwards.
