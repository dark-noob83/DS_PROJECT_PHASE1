the basic difference between the conditions arises due to their underlying cause osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease this means that it takes place because of wear and tear of the cartilage between the joints rheumatoid arthritis on the other hand takes place because of an autoimmune disorder both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are painful conditions affecting the joints of the human body however there are a number of differences between the two conditions
on the other hand in rheumatoid arthritis the pain is generally found occurring on the joints on both sides of the body for example there might be pain in both knees 2 wear and tear of the cartilage cushions is the primary reason for osteoarthritisand rheumatoid arthritis have got some similarities as well as differences their exact causes are not known while osteoarthritis often accompanies aging rheumatoid arthritis can occur in any age group and is also found in children and adultsosteoarthritis can be commonly found in people around the age group of 60
osteoarthritis on the other hand tends to be caused by the wear and tear on joints over time with osteoarthritis the cartilage between the bones wears down causing bone to rub against bone with rheumatoid arthritis the entire lining around the joint becomes inflamed and swollen often causing bone loss 
osteoarthritis is the result of wear and tear on your joints which causes weakening and deterioration of your cartilage mayo clinic rheumatoid arthritis on the other hand is an auto immune disorder whereby your body attacks and destroys joint cartilage niams both conditions however share common symptoms including joint paint stiffness and swelling the risk factors for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are fairly different rheumatoid arthritis also causes other symptoms that are unrelated to joint deterioration such as fatigue fever and a vague feeling of sickness the symptoms of osteoarthritis get progressively worse as you 
an easy way to think of the main difference between ra and oa is this rheumatoid arthritis is about inflammation of the tissue around the joints osteoarthritis is about deterioration of the cartilage between the joints of course there are other differences between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis for instance they have their own unique symptoms and are treated differently but rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis share one big similarity they can both impact your spine rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory form of arthritis that commonly impacts the small joints of the hands and feet in the spine it typically affects the cervical neck region and various facet joints your joints are covered with a membrane called the synovium
so an accurate diagnosis is important osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis rheumatoid arthritis affects about one tenth as many people as osteoarthritis the main difference between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is the cause behind the joint symptoms osteoarthritis is caused by mechanical wear and tear on joints rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body s own immune system attacks the body s joint
the pattern of joints that are affected also vary between the two conditions in rheumatoid arthritis small joints and larger ones are affected on both sides of the body usually in a symmetrical manner this symmetry is absent in osteo arthritis both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are painful conditions affecting the joints of the human body however there are a number of differences between the two conditions
1 rheumatoid arthritis occurs due to an autoimmune response of the body while osteoarthritis is mainly a result of mechanical wear and tear of the cartilage in between the joints 2 osteoarthritis affects older people but rheumatoid arthritis can affect anyone 3 both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are painful conditions affecting the joints of the human body however there are a number of differences between the two conditions
the most common type of arthritis osteoarthritis involves wear and tear damage to the cartilage that caps the bones in your joints rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of your joints causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in joint deformity while both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis can affect the small joints of the hand there are differences rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the middle joints of the fingers and the joints where the fingers attach to the hand
