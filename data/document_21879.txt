This, in addition to the laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy code (58548), is the third set of CPT codes addressing the laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy.
• Abdominal: An incision is made in the lower abdomen, and the uterus is removed through this incision. This open procedure is the most common approach for hysterectomy. • Vaginal: An incision is made in the vagina, and the uterus is removed through the vagina.
Objective. To report the feasibility and safety of robotic modified radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, using the four-arm da Vinci robot system, in a patient with early-stage cervical carcinoma.
INTRODUCTION. Radical hysterectomy refers to the excision of the uterus en bloc with the parametrium (ie, round, broad, cardinal, and uterosacral ligaments) and the upper one-third to one-half of the vagina. The surgeon usually also performs a bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.
The vaginal portion of the procedure is then performed. The vaginal apex is entered and the cervix and uterus are detached from the remaining supporting structures. The uterus is then removed through the vagina. The final code set is for Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH), indicated by CPT codes 58570 to 58573. Although it is not in numerical sequence with TLH, you would also include laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (CPT 58548) in this code set.
