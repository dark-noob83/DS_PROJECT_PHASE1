(June 2013). Azonto is a dance and music genre from Ghana. The dance is known to have originated from a traditional dance called Kpanlogo associated with the coastal towns in the country such as Chorkor, James Town, La, Teshie, Nungua and Tema, in the Greater Accra Region. As a music genre songs identified as those with Azonto beats are usually ones dedicated to the dance.
The latest addition to the Ghanaian dance form is Azonto. It is gradually gaining international popularity. The dance involves knee-bending, throwing of hands in all directions and rigorous hip movements. It is a delight to watch especially women with big hips and buttocks dancing Azonto.
The term Azonto was originally a rude reference to wayward girls, it stems from the word 'Abontoa which means an ugly girl, but it since lost its sting. The dance azonto is a communicative dance believed to originate from Apam which literally means to work.
Azonto is a dance craze originating alongside Korean chocolate bars and Kofi Annan in the gold coast of Ghana. The trend has snowballed, chiefly resulting from a viral video of tightly clad, masked dancers introducing their feverish hand moves to the smiling streets of London.
Azonto is the popular dance for a Ghanaian and West African fast-beat music genre. It sometimes can be used as a rude reference to wayward girls. Azonto music and dance became more popular in mid 2011 when it became Ghanaâ€™s first dance moves to have appealed to a lot of international taste.
To show what job the dancer has, Azonto makes use of movements that are associated with the particular occupation. A photographer could, for instance, mimic taking shots with a camera as he dances. A carpenter could act like he was hammering a nail into a wall.
