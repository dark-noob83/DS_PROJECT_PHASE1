Cupcake Tip #1: Keeping Cupcakes Fresh If you want to keep your cupcakes fresh and soft DO NOT put them in the refrigerator, it will dry them out. You may put the unfrosted cupcakes in a container and wrap container in saran wrap to freeze them.
How to Store Cupcakes. After the cupcakes have cooled, I keep then in large Tupperware-style containers. Food safety experts recommend that cupcakes with whipped cream, buttercream, cream cheese, or ganache frostings should be refrigerated. While I always keep whipped cream and ganache in the fridge, I often keep my buttercream and cream cheese cupcakes on the counter. I haven’t gotten sick yet (nor have any of my tasters), but if you choose to also leave them out, it is at your own risk.
I never put cupcakes in the fridge unless I have decorated them with fresh cream It’s just not necessary. Just store then when they are cool in a cardboard box (not an air tight container) and then after frosting return to the same box.
Room Temperature. Most homemade cupcakes will be safe at room temperature for one to two days. To ensure freshness, store the cupcakes in a covered airtight container. If you do not have an airtight container, cover the cupcakes with several layers of plastic wrap.
My fridge cupcakes are nice and moist :drool: puddin in the mix. I just have them on a plate with a plastic bag around them, I wonder is anyone has better storage ideas in the fridge for them. I didn't know that people didn't keep cakes and cupcakes in the fridge.
