You have a wonderful opportunity to leave an enduring, historical legacy to your kin. The whole world is in your hands – the legacy of your life (or the life of a family member) may be determined by what you do today.
Legacy means an older style or system. An example of legacy is the filing system of a previous secretary at your new job. The definition of legacy is something that is passed on to you from family, including reputation. An example of legacy is family property that has been handed down for generations. Legacy is defined as having had a family member attend a university before you. An example of a legacy is a college student who applies to Harvard because his grandfather and father both went there.
But it’s not just about money, and it doesn’t have to be intimidating. The Enduring Legacy Process is a proven, structured method of identifying the five elements of your legacy and discussing them with your family — all with the impartial assistance of your financial advisor. The Enduring Legacy process turns traditional estate planning into legacy planning.
The definition of enduring is something that is long-lasting and patient. An example of enduring is the love a mother has for her child.
