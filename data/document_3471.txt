Geography. Snow chains and snow cables are used in areas that experience snowy winters, such as states in the Eastern region and the Midwest. In some areas, such as the steep mountain passes, roads and highways, car owners must have snow chains, snow tires or snow cables on their tires when driving.
Q1. What are cable chains and how are they different from traditional link tire chains. A1. Cable chains are a new breed of tire chain that instead of using large, heavy steel links, these cable chains use a high strength steel aircraft cable surrounded by alloy steel traction coils.
Types. Snow chains are available in the recognizable ladder pattern, while snow cables are available in the ladder pattern or a z chain pattern. The latter is supposed to offer the best traction due to the zigzag pattern across the length of the snow cable.
asked by: Steve. Expert Reply: Both of the snow chains and snow cables will work great in snow conditions. The difference is the snow chains will give you better grip in more ice conditions because the chain links will bite into the ice where as the snow cables tend to slide over the ice. The snow chains will make a little more noise on dry pavement as compared to the snow cables.
