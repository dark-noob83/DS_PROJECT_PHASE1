To maintain weight, the chart below shows you your daily calorie limit. It's based on your age, activity level, and the BMI (body-mass index) of 21.5 for women and 22.5 for men. To lose weight -- about 1 pound a week -- reduce total calories in the chart by 500 a day. To gain weight, add 500 calories per day for each pound you want to gain per week.
So, summing up mid-article, the absolute requirement for carbohydrates is zero grams per day. However, depending on protein intake, a practical minimum for carbs lies between 50 grams/day (if someone functions well in ketosis) to 100-120 grams per day (if they don’t function well in ketosis). For a typical male with 160 pounds of lean body mass, daily carbohydrate intake could range from the physiological requirement of zero grams per day to a near maximum of 1120 g/day during a carb-load. Which makes it no wonder that people are confused.
When carbohydrates are restricted completely, the body still has a small requirement for glucose (although this decreases over time) and the body has to find something to make glucose out of. That something is lactate and pyruvate (produced from glucose metabolism), glycerol (from fat metabolism) and some amino acids. For a typical male with 160 pounds of lean body mass, daily carbohydrate intake could range from the physiological requirement of zero grams per day to a near maximum of 1120 g/day during a carb-load. Which makes it no wonder that people are confused.
Minimum Requirements. The Institute of Medicine encourages all women to consume at least 130 grams of carbohydrates each day. A woman’s individualized carbohydrate needs are based on her recommended calorie requirements, weight management goals and physical activity level. This means women following 1,200-calorie weight loss diets need about 135 to 195 grams of carbs each day, women consuming 1,600-calorie diets need 180 to 260 grams, women following 2,000-calorie diets need 225 to 325 grams and women consuming 2,400 calories per day require 270 to 390 grams of carbohydrates each day.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day. You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label. The Nutrition Facts label shows total carbohydrates, which includes starches, fiber, sugar alcohols, and naturally occurring and added sugars.
The amount of carbohydrates a woman should consume each day depends on her total daily calorie intake. Despite carbohydrates’ bad reputation in many commercial weight loss diets, carbohydrates are your body’s main fuel source. This means women following 1,200-calorie weight loss diets need about 135 to 195 grams of carbs each day, women consuming 1,600-calorie diets need 180 to 260 grams, women following 2,000-calorie diets need 225 to 325 grams and women consuming 2,400 calories per day require 270 to 390 grams of carbohydrates each day.
The University of Maryland Medical Center website notes a minimum recommended carbohydrate intake of 100 grams to 150 grams per day. The Institute of Medicine, the organization that sets the recommended dietary allowances for nutrients, recommends consuming at least 130 grams of carbohydrates per day. For most people, this is still below the recommended percentage of calories from carbohydrates. If you consumed 1,200 calories per day, 130 grams of carbohydrates would make up 43 percent of your calories, but it would only be 26 percent of your daily calories if you consumed 2,000 calori
The recommended intake is a minimum of 130 grams/day, or 45 - 65 percent of daily calories for adults, independent of age or activity level. This is the minimum needed for your brain to function. Athletes are recommended to consume 6 - 10 grams for every kilogram of body weight per day. For example, a typical man weighing 70 kilograms needs 420 grams of carbs per day to fuel his activity. If you are on a low-calorie diet (less than 2000 calories per day), it may be difficult to achieve the 6 grams per day. Since there are four calories per one gram of carbohydrate, you would need to be consuming 250-300 grams of carbohydrates per day. The digestibility of the carbohydrates you consume (fiber content) plays a role in the physiological energy available.
The Institute of Medicine recommends a minimum of 130 grams of carbohydrates per day, which is the average minimal usage of glucose that the brain uses on a daily basis. You need 2,361 Calories/day to maintain your weight. You should take 252 (40%) - 472 (75%) grams of carbohydrate for your energy needs. You need 1,361 Calories/day to lose 1 kg per week. You should take 145 (40%) - 272 (75%) grams of carbohydrate for your energy needs. (55% = 200 grams, 65% = 236 grams). You need 2,861 Calories/day to gain 0.5
