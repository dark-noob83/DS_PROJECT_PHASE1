1 In sound waves, energy is transferred through vibration of air particles or particles of a solid through which the sound travels. 2  In water waves, energy is transferred through the vibration of the water particles.
The medium moves back and forth as waves carry energy through it, but it does not actually travel along with the wave. Suppose you fix a slinky spring at one end and push the other end back and forth. Some parts of the spring, called compressions, are squeezed together.
there is several ways that waves can move. waves can move by wind. the energy passes to the water causing waves. The better answer. Waves move because they are a movement o â€¦ f energy through a medium. The wave entails two parts, which are the crest and trough. The wavelength is the distance between two crest. The wave height is the distance between a
Many different kinds of energy travel in waves. Sound waves carry noises through the air to our ears. SEISMIC WAVES travel inside the Earth and cause earthquakes. Light, heat, radio, and similar types of energy are carried by a variety of waves in the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM.
A wave is a way in which energy travels from one place to another. There are many kinds of waves, such as water waves, sound waves, light waves, radio waves, microwaves and earthquake waves. All waves have some things in common. The highest point the wave reaches is called the crest.
When an ocean wave crashes against the shore, it releases a large amount of energy. Ocean waves are transverse waves that carry huge amounts of energy across the surface of the sea as they move up and down. A wave 3 m (10ft) high carries enough energy to power around 1,000 lightbulbs in every 1 m (3 ft) of its length.
