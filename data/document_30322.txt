Step 1. Establish a base price. The average cost to cut a lawn is between $20 and $40. Determine a base price for small, medium and large-sized properties. For example, you may only charge $20 to cut the front and back of a small property that only takes 30 to 60 minutes, but charge $40 for a property that takes twice as long to complete. Step 2.

For example, customers pay the regular price for two lawn cuttings, and you agree to reduce every third lawn service by $5 or $10.
