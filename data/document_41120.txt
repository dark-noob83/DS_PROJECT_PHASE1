1 Bacilli (or bacillus for a single cell) are rod-shaped bacteria. 2  Spirilla (or spirillum for a single cell) are curved bacteria which can range from a gently curved shape to a corkscrew-like spiral. 3  Many spirilla are rigid and capable of movement. For rod-shaped or filamentous bacteria, length is 1-10 µm and diameter is 0.25-1 .0 µm. 1  E. coli, a bacillus of about average size is 1.1 to 1.5 µm wide by 2.0 to 6.0 µm long. 2  Spirochaetes occasionally reach 500 µm in length and the cyanobacterium. 3  Oscillatoria is about 7 µm in diameter.
There are three main shapes of bacteria: bacillus, coccus, and spiral. Bacillus, or rod shaped bacteria, are one of the main forms, and are typically 0.5 micrometers to 1.0 micrometer in width, and from 1.0 micrometer to 4.0 micrometers in length. Examples of bacilli include Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes anthrax, and the well known E. coli. Another common shape of bacteria is the coccus. Cocci are spherically shaped bacteria that organize in several distinct arrangements when in groups: diplococcus, tetrad, sarcina, and staphylococcus arrangements.
The three basic bacterial shapes are coccus (spherical), bacillus (rod-shaped), and spiral (twisted), however pleomorphic bacteria can assume several shapes. Shape of Bacterial Cell. 1  Cocci (or coccus for a single cell) are round cells, sometimes slightly flattened when they are adjacent to one another. For rod-shaped or filamentous bacteria, length is 1-10 µm and diameter is 0.25-1 .0 µm. 1  E. coli, a bacillus of about average size is 1.1 to 1.5 µm wide by 2.0 to 6.0 µm long. 2  Spirochaetes occasionally reach 500 µm in length and the cyanobacterium. 3  Oscillatoria is about 7 µm in diameter.
