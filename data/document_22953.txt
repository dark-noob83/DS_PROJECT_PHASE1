Eat only fully ripe pineapples. Most of the issue with burning mouths is due to the pineapple not being ripe. Always rinse the ripe pineapple before eating it. Cut out the core of the pineapple, which is the part of the fruit that makes it burn your mouth. Use a large knife to first cut the pineapple in half.
Pineappleitis: Pineapple commonly causes minor skin irritation because it's highly acidic. It's common for your tongue to feel gritty, itchy and mildly painful after eating pineapple. If you develop severe pain, itching, burning or swelling in your tongue from eating pineapple, you should talk with your doctor.
Step 4. Eat pineapple in small quantities if it tends to irritate your tongue. Your tongue can withstand a small amount of acid, but when you fairly submerge your tongue in acidic pineapple juice it can burn your tongue tissue. Portion the pineapple into small bags of five pieces to avoid overindulging in the fruit.
