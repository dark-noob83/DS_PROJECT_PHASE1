The wrong kind of oil can ruin your mower's engine. Craftsman offers a line of lawnmowers that includes both push and riding mowers. The engines in these mowers are smaller than car engines, but they work using the same combustion principles. This means they need oil, just as car engines do.
Yes, you may use car oil in your lawnmower but it is not recommended to use multiweight oil. Use 30 weight only. Reason; the chemicals in multiweight won't cool the aircooled engine as well as 30 weight. I like Castrol 30 weight. There is no difference in oil for a lawn mower and oil for an automobile.

In those engines just use the same weight oil as called for in the manual but in a synthetic such as Mobile-one.
