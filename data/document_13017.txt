Variable costs are corporate expenses that vary in direct proportion to the quantity of output. Unlike fixed costs, which remain constant regardless of output, variable costs are a direct function of production volume, rising whenever production expands and falling whenever it contracts. Using the formula above, we can calculate that XYZ Company's total variable cost on the order is: 5,000 x ($0.10 + $0.50) = $3,000. Therefore, the company can reasonably expect to earn a $2,000 gross profit ($5,000 - $3,000) from the order.
BREAKING DOWN 'Variable Cost-Plus Pricing'. For example, assume total variable costs for manufacturing one unit of a product are $10 and a markup of 50% is added. The selling price as determined by this variable cost-plus pricing method would be $15. If contribution to fixed costs per unit is estimated at $4, then profit per unit would be $1. RELATED TERMS. 
The total cost formula is used to derive the combined variable and fixed costs of a batch of goods or services. The formula is the average fixed cost per unit plus the average variable cost per unit, multiplied by the number of units. The calculation is: (Average fixed cost + Average variable cost) x Number of units = Total cost. For example, a company is incurring $10,000 of fixed costs to produce 1,000 units (for an average fixed cost per unit of $10), and its variable cost per unit is $3. At the 1,000-unit production level, the total cost of the production is: ($10 Average fixed cost + $3 Average variable cost) x 1,000 Units = $13,000 Total cost. There are several problems with the total cost formula, which are as follows: 1  Limited range for average fixed cost.
(Total fixed costs + Total variable costs) / Total units produced. The cost per unit should decline as the number of units produced increases, primarily because the total fixed costs will be spread over a larger number of units (subject to the step costing issue noted above). Thus, the cost per unit is not constant. For example, ABC Company has total variable costs of $50,000 and total fixed costs of $30,000 in May, which it incurred while producing 10,000 widgets. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $50,000 variable costs) / 10,000 units = $8 cost per unit. In the following month, ABC produces 5,000 units at a variable cost of $25,000 and the same fixed cost of $30,000. The cost per unit is: 
Formula of Variable Cost. The formula to calculate variable cost is: Total Variable Cost = Total Quantity of Output * Variable Cost Per Unit of Output. To recognize variable costs, it is important to understand how to categorize costs. Variable costs are those which do not remain constant, specifically when production activities fluctuate. This cost per unit is the variable cost of each variable unit produced, or in other words the additional cost incurred for the production of each spark plug. For example, if the business produced 1,000 more units, it would expect to incur additional production costs of $180.
By dividing the total variable costs for a specific period by that same period's production volume will provide us with the variable cost per spark plug. For example, if the spark plug business made 500,000 units last year, its unit variable cost is $90,000 / 500,000, or $0.18. This cost per unit is the variable cost of each variable unit produced, or in other words the additional cost incurred for the production of each spark plug. For example, if the business produced 1,000 more units, it would expect to incur additional production costs of $180.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: variable cost = Total Cost-fixed cost $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00 As output is 1 unit, average variable cost = $5.00 ($5.00 / 1) So, the formula is: variable cost = $5.00 * output. Source(s): Olga Z Â· 8 years ago. Thumbs up.
The total variable costs for last year would be $90,000 (50,000 + 30,000 + 10,000). These expenses are specifically tied to the production activities for last year. After determining the variable cost total for last year, we then divide the total variable costs by the production volume. This cost per unit is the variable cost of each variable unit produced, or in other words the additional cost incurred for the production of each spark plug. For example, if the business produced 1,000 more units, it would expect to incur additional production costs of $180.
