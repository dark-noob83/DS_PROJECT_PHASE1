2015 Roth IRA Rules-Eligibility, Income, Contribution Limits, and More. Note: The article below refers to the 2015 tax year. Assuming your IRA was opened by Dec. 31, 2015, you have until the tax filing deadline–April 15, 2016–to make a 2015 contribution. The income/contribution limits may increase for the 2016 tax year.

If your earned income is less than your eligible contribution amount, your maximum contribution amount equals your income. In other words, if you have $3,000 in earned income, the most you can contribute to the Roth is $3,000 (instead of $5,500).
Follow @Kiplinger. I’ve seen two different numbers for the income limit for married couples to be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA in 2014 -- $181,000 and $191,000. Which one is accurate?
If, for example, your modified AGI is $186,000 (halfway through the phaseout zone), you can each contribute $2,750 to a Roth IRA (half of the contribution amount). For single filers and heads of household, the income levels for the phaseout are $114,000 to $129,000.

Roth IRA Income Limits. You may contribute the full amount to your Roth IRA if your 2015 modified adjusted gross income is below $116,000 for singles ($183,000 for married). You may make partial contributions until your income hits $131,000 ($193,000 for married). If your income is above that, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. If you are interested, there is a workaround called the Backdoor Roth IRA if your income is above the limits. The 401k limits and IRA limits are determined based on inflation, but can only increase in $500 increments. The 2015 social security wage base also increased even though there was a split between Roth 401k limits and Roth IRA limit changes.
The $181,000 represents the maximum modified adjusted gross income a married couple filing jointly in 2014 can have and still contribute the full $5,500 to a Roth IRA (or $6,500 if 50 or older anytime during 2014). The ability to contribute money to a Roth disappears entirely if your joint income is $191,000 or more.

The IRS recently released its 2015 update to income and contribution limits for Roth IRAs. As detailed below, the contribution limits for a Roth IRA are unchanged for 2015–still $5,500. The catch-up contribution for those 50 or older, which is not indexed for inflation, remains $1,000. The income limits to qualify for a Roth IRA, however, have risen. Here are the details. If you are 50 years of age or older before the end of 2014: The maximum contribution that can be made to a traditional or Roth IRA is $6,500 ($5,500 + $1,000 catch-up contribution). This limit can be split between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA but the combined limit is $6,500.
