More On The Spoils System. Giving work to political supporters who help elect a person to office is called the spoils system. This name is taken from the well-known saying, To the victor belongs the spoils (that is, the rewards of victory). President Thomas Jefferson had used the spoils system on a small scale. Several states were using it. 
On a national scale, the spoils system was inaugurated with the development of two political parties, the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans, and was used by the earliest Presidents, particularly Thomas Jefferson. The spoils system has, however, continued for many federal offices and is even more prevalent in state and local governments. See A. A. Hoogenboom, Outlawing the Spoils (1968); W. d.

The Spoils System was criticized for decades, but what led to reforming it was a tragedy in the summer of 1881, the shooting of President James Garfield by a disappointed and deranged office-seeker. Garfield died on September 19, 1881, 11 weeks after being shot by Charles Guiteau at a Washington, D.C. train station.

Lesson Summary. Let's review. Andrew Jackson introduced the spoils system after winning the 1828 presidential election.
