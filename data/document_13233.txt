Part of the Programming glossary: In a computer, a register is one of a small set of data holding places that are part of a computer processor. A register may hold a computer instruction, a storage address, or any kind of data (such as a bit sequence or individual characters). Some instructions specify registers as part of the instruction. For example, an instruction may specify that the contents of two defined registers be added together and then placed in a specified register. A register must be large enough to hold an instruction-for example, in a 32-bit instruction computer, a register must be 32 bits in length.
4. register - (computer science) memory device that is the part of computer memory that has a specific address and that is used to hold information of a specific kind. accumulator register, accumulator - (computer science) a register that has a built-in adder that adds an input number to the contents of the register.
1 Some processors contain registers that may only be used to hold an address or only to hold numeric values (in some cases used as an index register whose value is added as an offset from some address); others allow registers to hold either kind of quantity.
In computer architecture, a processor register is a small amount of storage available on the CPU whose contents can be accessed more quickly than storage available elsewhere.
In computer architecture, a processor register is a small amount of storage available as part of a digital processor, such as a central processing unit (CPU). Such registers are typically addressed by mechanisms other than main memory and can be accessed faster.
