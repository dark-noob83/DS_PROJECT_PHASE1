At this level of exercise you can continue to speak, but not in complete sentences. For experienced runners, your anaerobic threshold is somewhere between your half marathon pace and your ten mile race pace. It should be about 10–30 seconds a mile slower than your 10km
The anaerobic threshold: definition, physiological significance and identification. Wasserman K. During exercise, the oxygen consumption above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms, causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis, is termed the anaerobic threshold (AT). The oxygen consumption at the AT depends on factors that affect oxygen delivery to the tissues.
The anaerobic threshold is affected by factors that modify oxygen delivery to the tissues; it is low in patients with heart disease. Methods of measurement include direct measure of lactate concentration, direct measurement of bicarbonate concentration, and gas exchange measurements.
Lactate Thresholds-Definitions. If you are looking for a simple definition of the lactate threshold that everybody agrees to, you will not find it here because there isn't one. People use different defintions and that is why it is confusing.
The Anaerobic Threshold (AT) is the physiological point during exercise at which lactic acid starts to accumulate in the muscles, which occurs around the point during increasing intensity exercise that anaerobic processes become more dominant.
The level above which pyruvate—an intermediate product of anaerobic metabolism—is produced faster than it can be used aerobically.
As the pace is increased, eventually a point is reached where the production of lactate, by the anaerobic system, is greater than its removal. The AT, also known as the lactate threshold, is the point where lactate (lactic acid) begins to accumulate in the bloodstream.
