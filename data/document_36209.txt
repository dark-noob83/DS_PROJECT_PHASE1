Instead, a piece of space debris moving at more than 20,000 miles per hour nearly wiped out the station and its six-member crew. Tuesday marked the second time that crew members took refuge in Soyuz “lifeboat” capsules. There was a near miss with a satellite motor in 2009. There are more than 20,000 pieces of space junk that measure larger than a softball, and these are tracked by the Department of Defense. Together, both NASA and DoD use ground-based sensors to survey each object’s orbit. However, there are many millions of smaller discards that cannot be tracked.
The International Space Station is in a low Earth orbit between 199 mi and 216 mi. To maintain this orbit, the space station has to travel at a speed of about 17,500 miles per … hour. If a spacecraft was launched sideways off the Earth with a low velocity, gravity would pull it towards the ground. The spacecraft would be in orbit. The speed required for the International Space Station to orbit is 17,500 miles per hour. The higher an object's orbit is, the slower it has to travel to maintain that orbit. + 45 others found this useful.
1 Natural space debris consists of small pieces of cometary and asteroidal material called meteoroids. 2  We see these as meteors when they travel through the Earth's atmosphere. 3  Artificial space debris is any non-functional man-made object in space (usually orbiting the Earth). 1 A 2 mm space debris fragment colliding at 10 km/s is like being hit with a cricket ball at 100 km/hour. 2  A 10 mm fragment at the same speed is like being hit by a large motorbike
The greatest concentrations of debris are found near 500-530 miles (800-850 km). How fast are orbital debris traveling? In low Earth orbit (below 1,250 miles, or 2,000 km), orbital debris circle the Earth at speeds of between 4 and 5 miles per second (7 to 8 km/s). However, the average impact speed of orbital debris with another space object will be approximately 6 miles per second (10 km/s). Consequently, collisions with even a small piece of debris will involve considerable energy.
The earth's rotational speed, depending on how close to the poles varies from 0 to 1040 miles/hour, which at the high end is about .288 miles/sec. This combined with the 66,700 mile/hour mentioned above, is about 18.5 miles/second. It is commonly known that the earth rotates around the sun. The spacecraft would be in orbit.

Debris left in orbits below 370 miles (600 km) normally fall back to Earth within several years. At altitudes of 500 miles (800 km), the time for orbital decay is often measured in decades. Above 620 miles (1,000 km), orbital debris normally will continue circling Earth for a century or more. However, the average impact speed of orbital debris with another space object will be approximately 6 miles per second (10 km/s). Consequently, collisions with even a small piece of debris will involve considerable energy.
Space junk travels as fast as all material that orbits the Earth or at about 17,500 miles per hour. This is fast enough to do damage to anything the junk encounters in orbit. The spacecraft would be in orbit. The speed required for the International Space Station to orbit is 17,500 miles per hour. The higher an object's orbit is, the slower it has to travel to maintain that orbit. + 45 others found this useful.
Image based on objects in low Earth orbit (a region of space within 2,000 kilometers of Earth’s surface) that are currently being tracked by NASA. About 95 percent of these objects are space debris (not functional satellites). The orbital debris dots are not scaled to Earth. 
In the case of natural space objects (meteoroids) that orbit around the Sun, these travel at even greater velocities. To remain in its orbit around the Sun, the Earth has to move at 30 km/sec. Other objects that come near the Earth may have relative velocities ranging anywhere from 11 km/sec to 72 km/sec. 1 A 2 mm space debris fragment colliding at 10 km/s is like being hit with a cricket ball at 100 km/hour. 2  A 10 mm fragment at the same speed is like being hit by a large motorbike
