The periodic table is an arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations and recurring chemical properties. Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number. The standard form of the table consists of a grid of elements, with rows called periods and columns called groups. The history of the periodic table reflects over a century of growth in the understanding of
Answer by Jared Cortes. Confidence votes 136. Dmitri Mendeleev was the inventor of the old periodic table but Henry Moseley changed the concept of atomic weight to atomic number and thus he corrected the defects in the old periodic table and he is called as the father of Modern Periodic Table.
The history of the periodic table is also a history of the discovery of the chemical elements. The first person in history to discover a new element was Hennig Brand, a bankrupt German merchant.
Answer: If you answered Dmitri Mendeleev then you might be incorrect. Dmitri Mendeleev presented his periodic table of the elements based on increasing atomic weight on March 6, 1869, in a presentation to the Russian Chemical Society. While Mendeleev's table was the first to gain some acceptance in the scientific community, it was not the first table of its kind.
The modern periodic table orders the elements according to increasing atomic number rather than increasing atomic weight, but the earlier tables were true periodic tables since they grouped the elements according to periodicity of their chemical and physical properties.
