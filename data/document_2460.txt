1. Local building permit costs & lay of property: Depending on what municipality/region you build in, pricing for building & development costs can range from as low as $10,000 to $30,000. For example, on a 1,800 square foot home, this translates to a difference of $11.00 per square foot. Building a house on a low-grade property most likely requires extra work in regards to raising the grade and bringing in extra loads of fill. This obviously increases the price.
Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price. 
Home prices of $55, $66, $72, $80, $84, $92, $110, $118, and $328 per square foot combine to produce an average of $112 per square foot, which is probably a reasonable figure for many areas of the country. However, the difference between the lowest figure and the highest is very substantial. 
Porches cost a median of $67 per square foot, but vary from $20 to $85. These high end prices include all sorts of special lighting, and other perks. The materials for decking are about $5 per square foot, and average installation plus materials is about $20. The average custom home building costs for custom homes built in the United States is right around $83 per square foot. The median price however was $78
The average cost to build a log home in the U.S. is approximately *$150.00-$200.00+ per square foot turnkey. The square footage you need to be concerned with is the actual living area on the main and second floor if applicable. Example: 2,000 square foot home- (1,500 main floor) & (500 loft floor) with a full basement and two car garage. Lower end. 1  2,000 square feet times $150.00 per sq.ft. = 2  $300,0000. 3  Full basement – 1500 square feet times $35.00 = $52,500.00.
• Basement – $25 to $35 per square foot depending on local prices, soil and climate. • Crawl Space – $15 to $20 per square foot. • Slab – around $10 per square foot (plus you won’t need floor joists or a sub-floor). * Remember that a basement actually gives you more square footage. In other words, you have to have a foundation, so it might as well be a basement if the climate is suitable for one. The cost for the basement is only $10 or $15 more for a basement than a crawl space, so you are essentially getting your basement footage for $10 or $15 per square foot. A Well and Septic could cost between $10,000 and $20,000 depending on location. Cost of structural building materials $20 to $30 per square foot, whether stick built, Concrete Insulated Panels, (CIP) Structural Insulated Panels, (SIP) or lowest of all, log kits and log panels.
1 A great deal depends on location plus the complexity of the project and the quality of the materials chosen. 2  It's possible to custom-build an 800-square-foot dome house for $1 million or a 12,000-square-foot rural ranch house for $400,000. 3  However, the $400,000 custom-built house is the exception rather than the rule. 1 However, building a modest custom home in a low-cost area might drop costs as low as $100 a square foot, or $350,000 for 3,500 square feet.
In the majority of states the average cost is below $85 per square foot. In the northeastern states and California the average price of construction can be between $100 and $120 dollars per square foot. In reality there are many factors that impact the average custom home costs. Let’s walk through a few. The average custom home building costs for custom homes built in the United States is right around $83 per square foot. The median price however was $78
Generally, turnkey costs will start at around $70 a square foot for a starter home in ideal conditions. An average level of finish will be more like $90-100. At $110-120 we are building a custom finish. For example, a $5,000 well will cost $1 per square foot on a 5,000 s.f. house and $2 a s.f. on a 2,500 s.f. house. Since houses with low square footage of finished space still tend to have garages, porches, and all the other site costs, the cost per square foot tends to be higher.
1 A modular home (built in a factory then trucked to the building site in sections) starts at $50,000-$60,000 for 800-900 square feet (1-2 bedrooms, 1 bath) not including the cost of the land, foundation or other site work, but can cost $500,000-$1 million for large, customized homes. 1 Building a garage typically costs about $35-$45 a square foot, or $8,400-$10,800 for a standard single-car garage and $13,300-$17,100 for a two-car garage. 2  A custom outdoor greenhouse with a solid foundation, heating and electricity starts at $10,000-$20,000 for a small structure, but can cost $25,000-$50,000 or more.
