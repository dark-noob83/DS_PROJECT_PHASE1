Goats are ruminant animals and they have a stomach that is composed of 4 compartments and ruminants are less likely to experience digestive problems (acidosis) if they are consuming high forage diets. What do goats eat differs from other ruminants such as cattle or sheep. Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything and they may sample many things, but goats prefer to browse on the tips of woody shrubs, trees, and leafy plants. Stripping leaves off of branches and shrubs is their favorite thing to do. Goats will also eat dry leaves, shoots, weeds, grasses, and apples.
Now that you know the basics of what do goats eat, it is still important to note that changing your goat’s diet rapidly can cause the bacteria inside their body to be thrown off.
In answer to the question, What do goats eat? goats eat both meat and plant-based food items. Commercially raised livestock need to have regular meals comprised of grains (energy,) proteins, vitamins and minerals.
You can read all the literature on what do goats eat but if you skip on other food sources for your goat, then you will miss the boat on the profit that you can potentially make in the process of raising them. There are several food sources that you can add to your goat’s diet such as the following:
Goats are attracted to natural products, so they tend to nibble on things like wood, or wicker, but won’t eat things like a tire. It’s been my experience that if a goat is well-fed and has complete nutrition, they won’t be a goat that eats everything in site.
Goats don’t really get their nutrition from their food, but rather, from the fermentation of their food. You see, their stomachs – there are 4 of them – are designed to ferment and break down their food and then their body digests the nutrition from their fermented food. Goats are not grazers that will mow your lawn.
