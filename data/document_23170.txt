Contribution Limits. To understand how phase-out limits work, it is important to understand contribution limits, as well. Each year, the IRS determines the maximum total amount you may contribute to your Roth and traditional IRAs. As of 2010, that amount is $5,000 if you are under 50, and $6,000 if you are 50 or over.
1 Contribution rates phase out beginning at a MAGI above $116,001, and end at $131,000 (up from $114,000, and $129,000, respectively in 2014). 2  Married Filing Jointly can make maximum Roth IRA contributions for an income of $183,000 or less.
Like the Traditional IRA, the IRS has phase out rules for Roth IRA contributions. Tax filers will be able to contribute the maximum amount to their IRA if they donâ€™t exceed certain income limits. 1  Single, Head of Household, or Married Filing Separately can contribute the maximum if their MAGI is $116,000 or less.
1 If you and your partner file are married filing jointly, the IRA deduction begins to phase out when you reach $98,000 and tops out at $118,000. 2  This represents an increase of $2000 from 2014.
Roth IRA Phase-Out Limits. IRA phase-out limits work very differently depending on whether you are contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRA income limits affect how much you can contribute to the account. If your income exceeds a certain amount, you may make a partial contribution.
Considerations. The IRS determines annual Roth and traditional IRA phase-out limits for filers who are married, filing jointly and single or head of the household. There is also a $10,000 income limit for filers who are married, filing separately. There is no phase-out range in this category.
2015 IRA Contribution Limits. The 2015 IRA contribution limits will look just like it did for 2014. Both the traditional and Roth IRA will have the same contribution limit, which will max out at $5,500. If you are 50 years or older, there is a $1,000 catch up contribution.
