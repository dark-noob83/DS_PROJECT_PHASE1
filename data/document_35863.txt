Best Answer: A 5k is only 3.1 miles, so if you walk at a 15 minute pace it will take around 45 minutes, it shouldn't take longer than an hour and unless you jog or run some it'll most likely take longer than 30 minutes.

Establishing a baseline time for an all-encompassing “average runner” in a 5K run is impossible because there is no single “average runner” to look to. However, you can easily find average 5K performance times for any age/gender group with age-grade data tables for distance running. If you configure the input data for your own age and gender and adjust the time until you arrive at the 50th percentile, you will see the average performance for your class. For example, the average 5K time for a 32-year-old male runner is 25 minutes, 50 seconds.
A 5K is 3.1 miles. If you walk it briskly, you can do it in 50-60 minutes. If you run/jog it, it could take you as little … as 35 minutes.------------------------------------------------------------------ I've done a 5k before, a 5k is 3.1 miles. I've only done it once and it took me 28 minutes and 45 seconds. If you're talking about the actual time it takes to physically run a 5k (and not how long it would take to train for one), it's about 30 minutes.
Best Answer: The world record is around 13 minutes, so I hardly doubt there'll be anyone who can go this fast. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres Hardly anyone will get 13-14 minutes. If they did get that fast, they're probably in the Olympic team. Most people run at around 20 - 30 minutes, if they have a moderate fitness level. Fast would be 18 minutes, and running at around 18 minutes will probably give you a placing of 10 and below. I'm about to run a 5k in march for a coach that recently passed away and I wanted to know how long I should be running for so I don't cheat myself when training.
For example, to achieve a 25:50 5K time, you'll need to run an average pace of 11.61 kilometers per hour, which is a little more than 7 miles per hour. Think of the run time as the end result and your pace as the thing you modify to achieve that time. If you configure the input data for your own age and gender and adjust the time until you arrive at the 50th percentile, you will see the average performance for your class. For example, the average 5K time for a 32-year-old male runner is 25 minutes, 50 seconds.
The 5K is approximately 3.1 miles. Average walking speed is 3 mph so it'll take about an hour. report this answer. Updated on Thursday, February 02 2012 at 06:52AM EST. Source: www.walkingenglishman.com/..
Average run times for beginners depend greatly on cardiovascular fitness, as well as musculoskeletal health. Older, reasonably healthy men in their 50s should look to run the 6.2 mile race at a pace of 09:04:51 minutes per mile, and women should see times near 10:20:43 minutes per mile. Josh Clark from Cool Running says a man who is in shape who typically runs 15 to 30 miles per week can expect to post a 10K time of about 48 minutes, while a woman will run the same distance in 58 minutes.
Average person is not fit enough to run 8 miles. Even a fit person, eg a soldier at training, will only go on a 4-5 mile run in the morning, and that is considered to be s … omething only a very fit person will do. i can run a 5:43 and im in 9th grade girl... but all my friends are fit and they run about a 7 or 8 minute mile... i think the average mile time for a girl my age is about an … 8 minute mile. if anyone disagrees then so be it im not a scientist... just a person.
