Different theories were developed to interpret different human traits. Psychoanalytic, psychoanalysis and psychodynamics are different theories. It is very difficult for a common person to understand the difference between them. Here we are describing brief difference between them. Psychoanalytic. Psychoanalytic theory was originally developed by the Sigmund Freud.
Freud’s psychoanalysis is both a theory and a therapy. Sigmund Freud (writing between the 1890s and the 1930s) developed a collection of theories which have formed the basis of the psychodynamic approach to psychology. His theories are clinically derived-i.e. based on what his patients told him during therapy.
Psychoanalytic vs Psychoanalysis vs Psychodynamic. All these are different theories which explain human behaviors. Sigmund Freud played a key role in the development of every one of them. Psychoanalysis is basically a type of psychodynamics, which focuses on unconscious motivations and conflict.
Psychodynamic therapy is the oldest of the modern therapies. (Freud’s psychoanalysis is a specific form and subset of psychodymanic therapy.) As such, it is based in a highly developed and multifaceted theory of human development and interaction.
They are similar, but not the same thing. Psychoanalysis is a subset of psychodynamic theory. According to the APA, psychoanalysis is a type of psychodynamic theory created by Freud that is focused on unconscious motivations and conflict. It is usually very long and intensive (sometimes 3-5 times per week).
Psychoanalytic therapy. Psychoanalytic therapy is a type of treatment based upon the theories of Sigmund Freud, who is considered one of the forefathers of psychology and the founder of psychoanalysis.
