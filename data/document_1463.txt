OxyHemoglobin Dissociation Curve. This curve describes the relationship between available oxygen and amount of oxygen carried by hemoglobin. 1  The horizontal axis is Pa02, or the amount of oxygen available. 2  The vertical axis is SaO2, or the amount of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen. 1 The horizontal axis is Pa02, or the amount of oxygen available. 2  The vertical axis is SaO2, or the amount of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen. 3  Once the PaO2 reaches 60 mm Hg the curve is almost flat, indicating there is little change in saturation above this point. 4  So, PaO2 of 60 or more is usually considered adequate.
Understand the Oxygen Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve with this clear explanation from Dr. Seheult. This is video 1 of 1 on the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve (also called oxygen dissociation curve and the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve). Speaker: Roger Seheult, MD.

The 'steep' portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is the range that exists at the systemic capillaries (a small drop in systemic capillary p(O 2) can result in the release of large amounts of oxygen for the metabolically active cells). In its most simple form, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relation between the partial pressure of oxygen (x axis) and the oxygen saturation (y axis). Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as successive molecules of oxygen bind.
Some Clinical Uses of the Dissociation Curve. The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, and the role of hemoglobin, are important clinically in understanding the relationship of arterial, oxygen saturation to the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, particularly as it relates to disease. Understanding the Dissociation Curve. In its basic form, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relation between the partial pressure of oxygen (x axis) and the oxygen saturation (y axis).
Factors that affect the standard dissociation curve The strength with which oxygen binds to hemoglobin is affected by several factors. These factors shift or reshape the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. A rightward shift indicates that the hemoglobin under study has a decreased affinity for oxygen. In its most simple form, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relation between the partial pressure of oxygen (x axis) and the oxygen saturation (y axis). Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as successive molecules of oxygen bind.
So, the curve has an s-shape because, at lower PO2s, oxygen binds to hemoglobin at a high rate, and this slows down as hemoglobin become more saturated. At PO2s above 60 the curve is relatively flat, meaning that the oxygen content of the blood will not change much with subsequent increases in PO2. 1 Shift to the left: The curve shifts to the left when hemoglobin has an increased affinity for oxygen, and has an easier time making the bond with oxygen. 2  Higher SpO2 for a given PO2. 3  Hemoglobin is more likely to cling to O2 and not let go (activity is minimal). 4  Think Cold.
Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules from its surrounding tissue. Background. Understanding the Dissociation Curve. In its basic form, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relation between the partial pressure of oxygen (x axis) and the oxygen saturation (y axis).
Hemoglobin (/ˈhiːmɵˌɡloʊbɨn/); also spelled haemoglobin and abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates (with the exception of the fish family Channichthyidae) as well as the tissues of some invertebrates. Carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin and forms carbaminohemoglobin. This decrease in hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen by the binding of carbon dioxide and acid is known as the Bohr effect (shifts the O 2 -saturation curve to the right).
(March 2009). The oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve, also called the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve or oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), is a curve that plots the proportion of hemoglobin in its saturated (oxygen-laden) form on the vertical axis against the prevailing oxygen tension on the horizontal axis. In its most simple form, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relation between the partial pressure of oxygen (x axis) and the oxygen saturation (y axis). Hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases as successive molecules of oxygen bind.
