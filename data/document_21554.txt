There are many different animal classes and every animal in the world belongs to one of them. The five most well known classes of vertebrates (animals with backbones) are mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians.
The number of known species for all animals other than arthropods is about 250,000. The largest group within the phyla of arthropods and the most diverse class in all kingdoms, is insects.
The nine largest phyla contain the majority of species. One phyla, the arthropods, which includes insects and spiders, constitutes about 75 percent of all known animal species. More than 900,000 arthropods have been described, and according to some estimates there may be more than five million more.
With over 30,000 known species, spiders, which are not insects, constitute one of the large families of other kinds of arthropods. Only two other phyla within the animal kingdom, the roundworms and the mollusks, are known to contain more than 100,000 species.
When an animal lives in its natural habitat, their surroundings help it live, eat, grow and survive. To find out what types of animal habitats are out there, it is essential to understand that our planet has innumerable species of animals and therefore, equally innumerable types of habitats for them.
Estuaries are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, so there is a great diversity of animals and plants that live there.

Invertebrates. Invertebrates are the most abundant creatures on the planet — comprising more than 97% of all known animal species. By definition, an invertebrate is an animal without a backbone. That includes jellyfish, sponges, worms, snails, bees, lobsters, and spiders.
