First of all, despite what you read elsewhere, hardline is not Heliax™ and Heliax™ is not hardline. True hardline (sometimes called rigid feedline or rigid line) is most commonly used in broadcast (AM, FM and TV). It does not flex-it's based on concentric pipe with an insulator between the inner and outer conductor. It is much lower loss than coax or even Heliax. Courtesy of David Tubergen, of T&W Electronics Inc. of Grand Rapids, Michigan we have three photos of a 24 inch (61 cm) length of six inch (15.25 cm) diameter hard line made by Dielectric Corporation.
Heliax Cable. Heliax Cable is part of Allied Wire and Cable’s extensive stock of Coaxial Cable. This selection of Coaxial Cables is designed for signal transfers in am/fm radio, UHF/VHS TV, and other communication systems. Our HJ, FSJ, and LDF heliax cables are available with a multitude of jacket materials, depending on your application's fire retardancy requirements.

Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced /ˈkoʊ.aeks/), æks is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating, layer surrounded by a tubular conducting. Shield many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or. jacket Signal leakage is the passage of electromagnetic fields through the shield of a cable and occurs in both directions. Ingress is the passage of an outside signal into the cable and can result in noise and disruption of the desired signal.

1 Twin-lead: This type of cable is a flat two-wire line. 2  It is commonly called a 300 ω line because the line has an impedance of 300 ω. 3  It is often used as a transmission line between an antenna and a receiver (e.g., TV and radio). 4  These cables are stranded to lower skin effects. Electrical cable is an assembly consisting of one or more conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual covering(s), assembly protection and protective covering(s).
For high-power radio-frequency transmission up to about 1 GHz, coaxial cable with a solid copper outer conductor is available in sizes of 0.25 inch upward. The outer conductor is rippled like a bellows to permit flexibility and the inner conductor is held in position by a plastic spiral to approximate an air dielectric. Signal leakage is the passage of electromagnetic fields through the shield of a cable and occurs in both directions. Ingress is the passage of an outside signal into the cable and can result in noise and disruption of the desired signal.
Coaxial cable is used as a transmission line for radio frequency signals. Its applications include feedlines connecting radio transmitters and receivers with their antennas, computer network (Internet) connections, digital audio (S/PDIF), and distributing cable television signals. Signal leakage is the passage of electromagnetic fields through the shield of a cable and occurs in both directions. Ingress is the passage of an outside signal into the cable and can result in noise and disruption of the desired signal.
A lot of people ask what heliax is and what it is used for. Heliax is the type of wire that is used for all cell phone towers and anything telecom related to be run. There are multiple types of heliax wire, the most common type is the hollow copper type. This type of heliax has plastic on the outside, then a layer of copper, followed by foam, and another layer of copper with a hollow center.
