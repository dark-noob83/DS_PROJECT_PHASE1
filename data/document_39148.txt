A biome is a large geographical area of distinctive plant and animal groups which are adapted to that particular environment. Most terrestrial biomes are defined by the dominant plant life. The plant life is determined in part by the climate in a region, and climate is controlled by many factors, including latitude and geography.
A biome is defined as a large geographical region that has particular types of organisms (plants and animals) and climate. .A biome is therefore a distinct ecological community of plants and animals living together in a particular climate.
1 Terrestrial biomes are usually defined by the type of vegetation that is present. 2  The major climatic factors contributing to the vegetation types in these biomes are temperature and precipitation. 3  Aquatic biomes are defined by the type of water they contain.
Biomes are large areas on Earth with similar conditions, such as climates and living organisms. There are two main categories of biomes: 1  Terrestrial biomes are usually defined by the type of vegetation that is present. 2  The major climatic factors contributing to the vegetation types in these biomes are temperature and precipitation. 3  Aquatic biomes are defined by the type of water they contain.
Terrestrial Biomes. Terrestrial biomes are defined by the dominant vegetation. For example, a deciduous forest is made up primarily of non-evergreen trees. A temperate grassland is dominated by grasses. A boreal forest is made up primarily of evergreen trees such as spruce and fir. Read up on each biome to learn more.
Terrestrial biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), and plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna). Climate is also a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes.
