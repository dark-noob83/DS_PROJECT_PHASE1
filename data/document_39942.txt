In the scientific community, pseudoscience is a term used to describe something that is reported to be a product of science but in reality it has no connection to proper scientific methodology and cannot be realistically proven.
Definition. The term 'pseudo' means 'false' or 'pretended'. Pseudo-psychology, therefore, refers to a psychological practice that is fake or unfounded. The science of psychology is built on rigorous principles such as research, evidence and testable ideas. Any discipline that is treated like a science but does not meet these standards can be called pseudoscience.
Lesson Summary. Pseudoscience is a broad category that refers to research or areas of interest that claim or appear to be scientific in nature but lack any of the standards and hallmarks of legitimate scientific study.
Phrenology is regarded today as being a classic example of pseudoscience. Pseudoscience is a term commonly applied to any body of knowledge, methodology, or practice that is portrayed as scientific but diverges substantially from the required standards for scientific work or is unsupported by scientific research. (See Scientific method .).
This lesson examines what is meant by the term 'pseudo-psychology', and gives examples to illustrate how pseudo-psychology differs from scientifically based psychology.
