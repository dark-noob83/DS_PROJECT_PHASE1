Making the world better, one answer at a time. The double helix of the DNA unwinds. Then, the enzyme helicase 'unzips' the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds. Then, the enzyme DNA Polymerase pairs each of the two strands with the correct nitrogenous bases. The top strand is called the 'leading strand' and the bottom strand is called the 'lagging strand.' Then the enzyme ligase glues together the different fragments of the lagging strand of DNA. Now we have two exact replications of DNA, each with 46 chromosomes called daughter cells.
Describe what DNA replication is, and how it relates to the DNA polymerase enzymes. In your own words. The double helix of the DNA unwinds. Then, the enzyme helicase 'unzips' the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds. Then, the enzyme DNA Polymerase pairs each of the two strands with the correct nitrogenous bases. [ The top strand is called the 'leading strand' and the bottom strand is called the 'lagging strand'. Then the enzyme ligase glues together the different fragments of the lagging strand of DNA.

1 The separation of the two single strands of DNA creates a ‘Y’ shape called a replication ‘fork’. 2  The two separated strands will act as templates for making the new strands of DNA. 3  One of the strands is oriented in the 3’ to 5’ direction (towards the replication fork), this is the leading strand. 1 Chunks of DNA, called Okazaki fragments, are then added to the lagging strand also in the 5’ to 3’ direction. 2  This type of replication is called discontinuous as the Okazaki fragments will need to be joined up later.

Describe the structure of DNA, and explain what kind of chemical bond connects the nucleotides of each strand and what type of bond holds the two strands together. Explain, in your own words, the semiconservative replication model and describe the Messelson-Stahl experiment. Describe the process of DNA replication, and explain the role of helicase, single strand binding protein, DNA polymerase, ligase, and primase. Define antiparallel, and explain why continuous synthesis of both DNA strands is not possible. Distinguish between the leading and lagging strands. 
DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division. 1  The first step in DNA replication is to ‘unzip’ the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. 1 Chunks of DNA, called Okazaki fragments, are then added to the lagging strand also in the 5’ to 3’ direction. 2  This type of replication is called discontinuous as the Okazaki fragments will need to be joined up later.
However, DNA does not unzip entirely. It unzips in a small area called a replication fork, which then moves down the entire length of the molecule. Let's look at the details: 1  An enzyme called DNA gyrase makes a nick in the double helix and each side separates. 2  An enzyme called helicase unwinds the double-stranded DNA. 
Each strand becomes a template along which a new complementary strand is built. DNA polymerase brings in the correct bases to complement the template strand, synthesizing a new strand base by base. A DNA polymerase is an enzyme that adds free nucleotides to the end of a chain of DNA, making a new double strand. Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term for this mode of replication is “semiconservative,” because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each new DNA molecule.
