Aerobic Exercise. The CDC suggests that adults get at least two hours and 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, or one hour and 15 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. This breaks down to about 30 minutes of exercise per day for at least five days per week. While two hours and 30 minutes of exercise may seem like a lot of time, it's fine to break up your physical activity into more manageable chunks of time, such as three sets of 10-minute intervals during the day. This makes meeting your aerobic exercise requirements easier.
Include bone strengthening activities, such as jumping rope or running, at least 3 days per week as part of your child's 60 or more minutes. 1  On a scale of 0 to 10, where sitting is a 0 and the highest level of activity is a 10, moderate-intensity activity is a 5 or 6.
1 For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.
Aerobic activity should make up most of your child's 60 or more minutes of physical activity each day. This can include either moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, or vigorous-intensity activity, such as running. Be sure to include vigorous-intensity aerobic activity on at least 3 days per week.
Children and adolescents should do 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of physical activity each day. This may sound like a lot, but don't worry! Your child may already be meeting the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.
Adults gain most of these health benefits when they do the equivalent of at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity (2 hours and 30 minutes) each week. Adults gain additional and more extensive health and fitness benefits with even more physical activity.
