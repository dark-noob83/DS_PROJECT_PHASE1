In short, it seems like very few full-time Uber drivers are earning above $30 per hour. And while many drivers earn more than $50,000 per year, and some smart drivers earn more than $100,000 per year, they're all working overtime to get it. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the defintion of median.. If the best a smart driver can take home is $29 per hour, he'd have to work about a 60-hour week to bring home Uber's $90,000. For a smart driver to earn $150,000 would take a 96-hour working week, a pace few people could reasonably maintain for a month let alone an entire year.
One driver I spoke with suggested that Uber should allow drivers who make rush hour trips --morning or evening -- into the five boroughs to keep 90 percent of the fare. I would go a step further and say, considering they're taking in $20 million a week, they should cover all N.J. driver's river-crossing tolls. 
The way drivers see it, ride volume can only increase so much in response to lower prices. Garay says that on average, a ride takes him 20 minutes from start to finish: five minutes to reach the pickup location, five to wait for the customer, and 10 to drive to the destination. For a trip of that length, Garay says he’ll make $10 or $11. In several months of reporting on Uber, I have yet to come across a single driver earning the equivalent of $90,766 a year. Those I’ve spoken with report that they gross around $1,000 a week after commission and sales tax—but before gas and other expenses—for annual income closer to $50,000.
So that's $15 an hour. But accounting for tolls, Uber's 20% cut, gas, car insurance, vehicle financing, and self employment taxes, the driver really only made $54.50 for 12 hours of driving. I would have to work 80-120 hours a week to make ends meet, an uberX driver wrote on Quora. But at least Uber gives me the opportunity to work that much. Most companies will only hire you for low pay at only 35-40 hours a week..
Uber drivers make the most money (pretax) per ride, on average – $15.97, compared with $13.35 for Sidecar and $11.48 for Lyft. Where you live also pays a role. Lyft drivers in Dallas make the least money per trip, which means they would have to provide 97.65 rides before paying for the city's average annual car insurance premium.
Uber declined to say how much its average Washington area uberX driver makes, but the company has said its drivers make as much as $90,000 a year in the New York market and $74,000 in San Francisco. UberX is the cheapest of the services it provides; the other is its premium luxury sedan service, uberBlack. As the company based in San Francisco has grown exponentially, Uber has brought tens of thousands of drivers on board, touting the ride-share industry as a ­hard-to-pass-up opportunity where drivers can make up to $90,000 a year driving for the popular service.
Uber driver pay varies depending on where you live and how many hours you drive. I make between $20 and $25 an hour in Los Angeles. Studies across the nation show that Uber drivers make over $19 an hour on average. In New York City, the average Uber driver makes over $30 an hour. As described above, drivers are paid a portion of the fare for every ride that is given. As promised, here is an example of my pay for one 10 ½ hour day: $256.30 / 10.5 hours = $24.41 an hour. Which — if I save 10% for taxes and spend 10% on gas and vehicle costs– is about $19.53 an hour.
That works out to about $7.20 per hour (assuming a 40-hour work week), which would still leave New York Uber drivers ahead, but would seriously cut into Uber’s advantage across the board if costs in other cities are similar. It should also be noted that cab drivers likely share in many of those expenses. But the numbers demonstrate how Uber isn’t providing a career as much as an income supplement or temporary gig: Just 24% of Uber drivers say the company is their only source of personal income, and another 16% say Uber is their largest source of income but not the only one.
There is also no such thing as an Uber driver salary. As described above, drivers are paid a portion of the fare for every ride that is given. As promised, here is an example of my pay for one 10 ½ hour day: $256.30 / 10.5 hours = $24.41 an hour. Which — if I save 10% for taxes and spend 10% on gas and vehicle costs– is about $19.53 an hour.
As I already explained, how much money an Uber driver makes depends on numerous factors. As a practical example, let’s assume you make $20 an hour after taxes and expenses, and you work 40 hours a week, like a regular full-time job: $19 x 40 hours/week= $760 a week. As described above, drivers are paid a portion of the fare for every ride that is given. As promised, here is an example of my pay for one 10 ½ hour day: $256.30 / 10.5 hours = $24.41 an hour. Which — if I save 10% for taxes and spend 10% on gas and vehicle costs– is about $19.53 an hour.
