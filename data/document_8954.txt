Chromosomes contain smaller units of genetic material called DNA. DNA is a sequence of letters that spell out the genetic code. The DNA is organized into words and sentences called genes. Humans have approximately 20,000 genes and each one influences a part of development. These genes usually come in pairs.
Genes are made from a long molecule called DNA, which is copied and inherited across generations. DNA is made of simple units that line up in a particular order within this large molecule. The order of these units carries genetic information, similar to how the order of letters on a page carry information. The language used by DNA is called the genetic code, which lets organisms read the information in the genes.
DNA, along with RNA and proteins, is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for life. Most of the DNA is located in the nucleus, although a small amount can be found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA). Within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes.
Transcription is the process by which the genetic information stored in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. In more detail, the DNA base sequence is first copied into an RNA molecule, called premessenger RNA, by messenger RNA (mRNA) polymerase.
An organized unit of DNA sequences that enables a segment of DNA to be transcribed into RNA and ultimately results in the formation of a biologically functional product is most accurately referred to as a(n). gene. chromosome.
