A cat’s body hums along at a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit — a little higher than the normal human body temperature and about the same as dogs. A normal range is 100 to 102.5, so call your veterinarian if your cat's temperature is higher or lower than that.
A cat’s normal body temperature can range from 100.5 to 102.5 degrees. Because 101.5 degrees is right in the middle, it’s often referred to as a “normal” body temperature. Being that their body temperature is higher than ours, they can also tolerate higher temperatures (provided they have access to water).
But you can’t tell if your cat has a fever by feeling for a warm, dry nose, as many people believe. The only way to know for sure -- with either a human or a cat -- is to take its temperature. A normal temperature in cats ranges from 100.4º to 102.5º Fahrenheit. A fever in cats occurs when temperatures rise above 102.5º F. Although fevers may be helpful in fighting disease, a fever higher than 106º F can damage organs.
Cat Temperature-Normal Range, Fever & More. Normal body temperatures in cats range between 100 - 102.5°F (37.7 - 39.1°C). The body regulates its temperature (known as thermoregulation) by a number of measures and for a number of reasons.
Pyrexia in Cats. The normal body temperature for cats falls in the range of 99.5-102.5 Fahrenheit. Fever, referred to medically as pyrexia, can be defined as a higher than normal body temperature in cats – a body temperature of at least 103.5 ° F (39.7° C).
