Cat lifespan varies from breed to breed; however, the average lifespan of a free-roaming cat is less than 3 years, whereas the lifespan of an indoor cat averages 15 to 18 years. Spayed and neutered cats live longer because they do not develop ovarian or testicular cancers.
Cats that spend time indoors only, will have a longer life. Indoor cats are less exposed to bacteria, diseases, traffic accidents or the danger of chewing on toxic plants. Indoor cats may live between 12 and 15 years of average. However, the record age of an indoors cat is 25.
Cats and humans age differently but the typical 1-year old cat is equivalent to a 16 to 17-year old teenager. Between the ages of 1 and 9, each year equates to 5 to 6 years in humans. A 25-year age cat is 108 years old in human terms.
Today cats live longer than ever. Just 20 years ago the life expectancy of a cat was four to six years; today they live 15 years or more. Life expectancy in cats depends on many things, but the most important factor is whether he is an indoor-only cat or an outdoor cat. Life expectancy varies significantly between the two.
What is the average life span of a cat? The average lifespan of cats is much lower than the possible life expectancy, which is in a range from 10 to 17 years. The mortality rate for wild cats can be high, and most â€¦ adult cats do not live 10 years, as they die of diseases, lack of nutrition, or accidents.
Pet Life Expectancy. We hope our pets will be a part of our lives for many, many years but the fact is that the average life expectancy is 10-12 years for dogs and 10-14 years for cats. Older pets have very specific needs and are particularly susceptible in later years to cancer, arthritis, and dental disease.
Cat life expectancy is getting better and better. Many cats live for 10 - 15 years, and some live 20 years or more. However, a cat's life expectancy does depend on a number of factors, many of which we can have a lot of control over.
