Pulse-position modulation (PPM) is a form of signal modulation in which M message bits are encoded by transmitting a single pulse in one of possible required time-shifts. This is repeated every T seconds, such that the transmitted bit rate is bits per second.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Pulse-position modulation (PPM) is a form of signal modulation in which M message bits are encoded by transmitting a single pulse in one of possible required time-shifts. This is repeated every T seconds, such that the transmitted bit rate is bits per second.
In AM modulation technique, the amplitude of a carrier is varied according to the amplitude of the modulating signal. The advantage is the simplicity in the transmitter and receiver design but the noise performance is very poor.
The Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) is a modulation technique designed to achieve the goals like simple transmitter and receiver circuitry, noise performance, constant bandwidth and the power efficiency and constant transmitter power.
PPM-Pulse Position Modulation. The electronic system in the transmitter scans the positions of the sticks, pots and switches and creates eight pulses. Pulse length is related to stick position, e.g: all the way to the left 1 ms, middle 1.5 ms and all the way to the right 2 ms.
Pulse position modulation is a signal modulation technique that allows computers to share data by measuring the time each data packet takes to reach the computer. It is often used in optical communication, such as fiber optics, in which there is little multi-pathway interference.
Guide to PWM and PPM PWM and PPM are two common words used in the R/C industry. PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation and PPM stands for Pulse Position Modulation. Some devices that use PWM for control are ESC's (electronic speed controls) and servos.
