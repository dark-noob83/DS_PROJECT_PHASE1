Pitching your product correctly can mean the difference in your product being purchased by a retail buyer, distributor or collecting dust in your garage.
How to Pitch a Product Idea. Provide product samples. Bring the best examples of the product you are pitching to your meeting. If you are pitching shoes, bring the latest and trendiest styles available. Ensure they are in excellent condition. Explain the value and benefits of the product. Highlight what is different about your product, compared to others on the market.
Pitching a new product is about selling the concept, need for the product and ability to sell it to consumers. To pitch a product, you must do your research to ensure you know who may be interested in the product. Provide samples of the product and have a presentation prepared that catches the buyer's eye.
You may have the best idea for a product that will save people time and energy, but if you cannot convey that idea quickly and in an way that's understandable, a potential investor is unlikely to help you financially. Your pitch should also be lively and engaging and make the person you're pitching want the product.
Step 1. Develop your elevator pitch for the product or invention. Your initial pitch should last less than a minute when you explain it to someone. Explain what your product is and why it is better than similar products currently available.
In order to deliver the perfect pitch to a retail buyer or a distributor, you have to be able to clearly explain the benefits and features of your product in an exciting way that will motivate them to purchase your product.
The key to successfully pitching a new product idea or invention to a potential investor or company is being concise and clear.
