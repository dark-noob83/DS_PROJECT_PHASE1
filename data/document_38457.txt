During the Great Depression, for example, the league was under financial pressure to lower its salary cap to $62,500 per team, and $7,000 per player, forcing some teams to trade away well paid star players in order to fit the cap. As a result of these factors, the cap has been raised each year to its current figure of $59.4 million for the 2010–11 season, with a cap of $11.88 million for a player. The CBA also contains a Lower Limit of the Payroll Range, which is the minimum that each team must pay in player salaries.
The average salary among the top 100 players in MLB is $4.5 million more than the average for the NBA ($11.9 million) and nearly twice as much as the NFL ($8.9 million). However, things are a little trickier in the NFL as this does not include signing bonuses which are a large component of what the top players are paid. Follow Business Insider: The top 100 Major League Baseball players will make an average salary of $16.4 million during the 2015 season led by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw who will make $30.0 million in the second year of his 7-year, $215 million contract.
The NHL has a hard salary cap with substantial penalties for both players and agents who break the rules, as well as for teams. The league calculates the cap annually based on total hockey-related revenues, and any one player can only earn up to 20 percent of his team's cap. The agreement allows for signing bonuses that count toward the cap but are subject to a limit of 10 percent of the player's salary. There are additional rules for exceeding the cap with signing bonuses, but the effect on the cap is low because of the signing bonus limit. To induce players to sign despite this, the teams pay large signing bonuses that the players can keep even if the team releases them. These bonuses affect the salary cap because they are included, but they can be prorated for up to five years.
Advantages of Signing Bonuses. Because caps limit the salaries teams can pay each year, teams use signing bonuses instead to acquire top players. Only a portion of a player's signing bonus counts against that year's cap. For example, a team might pay a player a $6 million salary in a given year. Under cap rules, this leaves the team with $6 million less to pay other players that year. A star player might be unwilling to sign for that amount. 
The 2015 cap is more than $10 million richer than the $133 million salary cap in 2014, which jumped up another $10 million from the $123 million salary cap in 2013. That means the NFL has more and more money to spend on players themselves, making some, like Chicago's Jay Cutler, very happy. But first things first: 
The negotiations for 2005–12 NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement revolved primarily around players' salaries. The league contended that its clubs spent about 75% of revenues on salaries; a percentage far higher than existed in other North American sports. As a result of these factors, the cap has been raised each year to its current figure of $59.4 million for the 2010–11 season, with a cap of $11.88 million for a player. The CBA also contains a Lower Limit of the Payroll Range, which is the minimum that each team must pay in player salaries.

For the 2005–06 NHL season, the salary cap was set at US$ 39 million per team, with a maximum of $7.8 million (20% of the team's cap) for a player. As a result of these factors, the cap has been raised each year to its current figure of $59.4 million for the 2010–11 season, with a cap of $11.88 million for a player. The CBA also contains a Lower Limit of the Payroll Range, which is the minimum that each team must pay in player salaries.
