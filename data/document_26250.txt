When cooking fish, care must be taken not to overcook the fillet, steak, or whole fish, which results in dry and somewhat tasteless meat. A general rule is to cook a fish 10 minutes for each inch of thickness. The 10 minute rule should not be used for deep-frying or microwaving fish. To cook fish steaks that are slightly translucent in the center, remove the steaks from the heat when they reach an internal temperature of 135ºF to 140ºF. The fish steaks will continue cooking with the retained heat if they are covered and left to stand a few minutes prior to serving.
Poaching fish can be done on the stove top or in the oven. The poaching method is cooking just below the boiling point of 212 degrees at sea level. Place the fish in the poaching liquid, water, juice, wine or milk, cover and cook for approximately eight to 10 minutes for fillets or 15 to 20 minutes for whole fish. Test for doneness using a meat thermometer.
When you can take a fork and the fish meat is flaky, its done. All meats should be cooked with at least 350 degrees in order to kill all bacteria. Answer, 03.21.10: To prevent bacterial growth, fish should be cooked TO an internal temperature of 145 degrees F and held for at least 15 seconds. It can be cooked AT whatever temperature you like. Always check the temperature in the thickest part of the fish. A frozen meat pie of average size should be cooked at 350 degrees and covered with foil for 35-40 minutes. Check center temperature. If temperature has reached 165 degrees, un … cover and cook for another 5-8 minutes until the crust has reached desired color.

Sear, bake, or broil each side for approximately 4 minutes or until an instant-read cooking or meat thermometer inserted into their centers reach 115 degrees F. Remove from heat. The carryover cooking will add another 10 to 15 degrees, for an ideal final temperature of 125 to 130
Cooking thermometers take the guesswork out of cooking, as they measure the internal temperatures of your cooked meat, poultry, seafood, baked goods, and/or casseroles, to assure that a safe temperature has been reached, harmful bacteria have been destroyed, and your food is cooked perfectly.

You can cook fish any number of ways, but baking it is an excellent way to retain the subtle distinctions in the flavor and texture of the fish. Fresh fish still tastes fresh baked, and that can't be said for all other cooking methods. Certain cuts of fish are better for baking than others. It's easy to overcook fish, however you cook it, which is why it's important to keep a close eye on the cooking time. Overcooked fish becomes dry and tough. Stuffed fish and fish with a firmer flesh will take a bit longer to cook thoroughly. Standard baking temperature is 350 degrees, which works just fine for fish. But you can get away with setting the temperature even lower. This extends the cooking time, which may help if other ingredients in the dish need more time to cook
