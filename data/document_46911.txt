This act was signed into law on August 6, 1965, by President Lyndon Johnson. It outlawed the discriminatory voting practices adopted in many southern states after the Civil War, including literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting.
Lyndon Johnson, who became president following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, sailed to a landslide victory in the 1964 presidential election. After the election, Johnson moved to do something about voting rights.
The Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 was designed to address these issues. It prohibits discrimination based on race, and requires certain jurisdictions to provide bilingual assistance to language minority voters.
But the Supreme Court in 1966 in South Carolina v. Katzenbach rejected this challenge. It ruled that the act fell under Congressâ€™s power to enforce the requirements of the 15th Amendment, which had been ratified in 1870. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 had immediate and dramatic results.
Considered one of President Lyndon B. Johnson's most eloquent speeches, his Voting Rights Act address was given one week after deadly racial violence erupted in Selma, Alabama. In it he uses the phrase we shall overcome, borrowed from the civil rights movement. It was delivered March 15, 1965 before a joint session of Congress, and was part of the Johnson's efforts to persuade Congress to pass his Voting Rights Act.
The Voting Rights Act passed the following year with large majorities in both the United States House of Representatives (333 to 48) and the Senate (77 to 19). Johnson, also known as LBJ, signed it into law August 6, 1965.
In March 1965, on a bridge outside Selma, Alabama, a second phase of the revolution was born. Civil and human rights activists, led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others, took to the streets in a peaceful protest for voting rights for African Americans.
