Human blastocysts should hatch from the shell and begin to implant 1-2 days after day 5 IVF blastocyst transfer. In a natural situation (not IVF), the blastocyst should hatch and implant at the same time-about 6 to 10 days after ovulation.
1 Implantation occurs on day 6-10 after the egg retrieval. 2  Which is 1 to 5 days after a blastocyst transfer. 3  Which is equivalent to day 20-24 of a natural menstrual cycle (idealized 28 day cycle).
We mean it. Implantation takes place between 1 and 5 days after a blastocyst transfer. If you didn’t have a day-5 transfer, your implantation window is 6 to 10 days after egg retrieval. Take that week off. There’s no hard evidence to suggest being home alone helps – but research isn’t everything.
If it's a blastocyst transfer, implantation could begin within 24 hours. If it's a day 3 transfer, it takes 2-3 days longer (but the same total number of days from fertilization). An embryo cannot start to implant until it has hatched. This occurs about 1 day after it forms a blastocyst.

Implantation can start to occur as soon as 6-10 days after retrieval (I use after retrieval because embryos can be transferred on different days of development. Count the retrieval day as day 0). Five days after the retrieval a healthy embryo will have reached the blastocyst stage.
Many think of it as 'sticking.' implantation in humans always occurs when the embryo is between 6-7 days old. A very popular concept on the internet now in 2012, 'implantation bleeding, ' is speculative and mostly not useful.
Usually, the egg will be implanted between 6 to 12 days of egg retrieval. After five days of embryo transfer, the egg reaches blastocyst stage. For accuracy, you need to county the day of retrieval as day 0.
