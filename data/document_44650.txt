Usually planted in the early fall, cool-season grass seeds prefer daytime temperatures ranging from 60 to 75 F. With this temperature range, the soil itself is usually between 50 and 65 F -- the right environment for germination.
Cool season grasses grow best when the soil temperatures are between 50 and 65 degrees F. These temperatures usually occur when the daytime air temperatures are between 60 and 75 degrees. High temperatures of summer can cause these plants to go dormant and thus planting during summer is asking for problems.
Grass seed that fails to germinate cannot grow into part of a lush green lawn, so it's important to sow seed when conditions are right for germination. Soil temperature, depth of planting and soil moisture are all key factors. Ensure the correct conditions when you seed your lawn for the best results.
Temperature. Grass seed germinates when the soil temperature is 65 degrees and above. It's important to understand that it is the soil temperature, and not the surrounding air temperature, that is the trigger for seed germination.
Cool season grass such as Fescue, germinate best when the soil temperatures are between 50&deg and 65&deg degrees F. These soil temperatures usually occur when the daytime air temperatures are between 60&deg and 75&deg degrees.
Temperature. Grass seed germinates when the soil temperature is 18.3 degrees C and above. It's important to understand that it is the soil temperature, and not the surrounding air temperature, that is the trigger for seed germination.
Grass seed not in good contact with the soil cannot warm up correctly for successful germination. Seeds rely on warmth and soil moisture to swell and sprout. If your seeds remain at their ideal temperature range and are planted no more than 1/4 inch deep, you should see germination after three weeks. It is critical to keep the top 1/2 inch of soil moist with a misty spray so the seeds continue to absorb moisture as the seedling grows larger.
