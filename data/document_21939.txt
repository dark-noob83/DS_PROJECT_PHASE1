Role of Hormones Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): Controls reabsorption of water in the blood. (more ADH, more water reabsorption) Made in the hypothalamus but stored in and released from the pituitary gland in the brain. Increases the permeability of the walls of the distil tubules and collecting ducts to water. It is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted from the posterior pituitary gland. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium ions into the blood in the loop of Henle and distal tubes.
Re: Difference between ADH and Aldosterone. ADH (vasopressin) increases the permeability of the collecting duct. This makes water reabsorption easier and changes the concentration of urine. It is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted from the posterior pituitary gland. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium ions into the blood in the loop of Henle and distal tubes.
1. ADH is synthesized in the hypothalamus while aldosterone is made in the adrenal cortex. 2. ADH conserves water directly through its reabsorption while aldosterone conserves water indirectly through the reabsorption of sodium. These processes can be carried out by these two hormones. ADH is completely known as the antidiuretic hormone. It is also identified as AVP or arginine vasopressin or simply vasopressin. Basically, the difference between the two is regarding the mechanism of action.
Reabsorption of Na leads to reabsorption of water due to osmosis. ADH is synthesized in the hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary. While aldosterone is a steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland and is a part of the renin-angiotension converting system. ADH is mainly responsible for maintaining the concentration of Na. I thought they both acted on the kidneys to increase reabsorption of water and sodium ions into the blood and that the water reabsoprtion caused sodium reabsorption due to a concentration gradient.

ADH Vs Aldosterone. Basic learners of Biology and the concept of the urinary system may somehow have difficulty in separating the roles of ADH and aldosterone. Fortunately for those who have taken advanced courses involving these concepts, the two terms are just like their everyday word. These processes can be carried out by these two hormones. ADH is completely known as the antidiuretic hormone. It is also identified as AVP or arginine vasopressin or simply vasopressin. Basically, the difference between the two is regarding the mechanism of action.
• Aldosterone is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland, whereas ADH is secreted by the hypothalamus. • Aldosterone is the main regulator of water and electrolytes such as Sodium and Potassium in the body, but ADH is released when water level of the blood stream is lower. It reabsorbs water and Sodium back to the blood stream, to increase blood volume and thereby regulating the blood pressure. Although aldosterone retains Sodium and water, it induces excretion of Potassium. Potassium can be induced by angiotensin II. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH). ADH is a polypeptide, which is secreted by the hypothalamus, and it is stored in the posterior pituitary gland. ADH is released when water level is low in the blood stream. ADH regulates the body water level by concentrating urine and thereby reducing urine volume
As a result, posterior pituitary regulates the release of Aldosterone and reduce the reabsorbing of water. Aldosterone. Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland, and it is stored in the posterior pituitary gland. It reabsorbs water and Sodium back to the blood stream, to increase blood volume and thereby regulating the blood pressure. Although aldosterone retains Sodium and water, it induces excretion of Potassium. Potassium can be induced by angiotensin II. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH). ADH is a polypeptide, which is secreted by the hypothalamus, and it is stored in the posterior pituitary gland. ADH is released when water level is low in the blood stream. ADH regulates the body water level by concentrating urine and thereby reducing urine volume
