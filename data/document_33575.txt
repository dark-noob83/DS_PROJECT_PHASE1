Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. 2025 delegates are needed to win the democratic nomination. However, mre than 40% of the needed delegate are so-called super delegates. This means they are free to pledge their votes to whomever they please, and don't have to vote for the winner of the given caucus or primary. This safety valve was implemented to prevent candidates from fundamentally changing the system.
The number of delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination is 2,025. The Democratic Party system was designed to be proportional, which could lead to Sen Sens. Barack Obama (D-IL) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) ending up with roughly similar numbers, says Peter Beinart, CFR's senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy.
Hillary has about one-fifth of the delegates she'll need for the Democratic nomination locked in – five months before the first primary vote is cast.
Hillary Clinton has already secured the support of one-fifth of the number of Democratic National Convention delegates that she will need in order to win her party's presidential nomination, it emerged on Friday.
But Bloomberg reported, based on private conversations in Minneapolis, that Hillary's delegate haul may be more than 440. The DNC's rules for next year's convention initially called for a total of 4,483 delegates, with a majority – 2,242 – needed to win the presidential nomination. If Clinton has more than 440 pledges, she is about 20 per cent of the way to victory.
