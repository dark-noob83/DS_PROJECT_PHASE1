Home » Cardiology » Cholesterol Levels ». Normal cholesterol levels in men over 50 should be less than 200. Because high cholesterol is a leading contributor to heart disease and other chronic illnesses, many doctors recommend that men over the age of 50 receive annual physicals that include cholesterol readings. Both your HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels will be checked. These two are also known as good and bad cholesterol, for a very good reason. HDL cholesterol is productive. It helps to rid your body of bad cholesterol and protects the heart. This number should be over 60.
1) Total Cholesterol: less than 200 mg/dL. 2) LDL: 100 mg/dL to 129 mg/dL. 3) HDL: more than 40 mg/dL. 4) Triglycerides: 100 mg/dL to 150 mg/dL. It should be taken into account that the mentioned normal ranges are rather unstable, because they are changing with age. If the normal level of LDL of a 25-year-old is 160 mg/dL, for a 75-year-old it would be too small. The desirable total level of cholesterol in the blood is less than 200 mg/dL. If the concentration of cholesterol in the blood is greater than 240 mg/dL, it is considered to be high.
Normal Ranges. Recommended ranges for LDL cholesterol fall below 100 mg/dL and anything above 159 mg/dL is considered high. HDL cholesterol should be above 60 mg/dL and anything below 40 mg/dL is considered too low. Total cholesterol should be below 200 mg/dL and anything above 240 mg/dL is considered high. Men who have had heart attacks, strokes or coronary artery disease should have LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. 
LDL (bad) cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to new guidelines from the American Heart Association. Your total cholesterol and HDL (good) cholesterol are among numerous factors your doctor can use to predict your lifetime or 10-year risk for a heart attack or stroke.

In the United States, cholesterol levels are calculated in milligrams of cholesterol for each deciliter of blood. A result of under 200 mg per dL (5.2 mmol/L) is ideal. A level somewhere between 200 to 239 mg per dL (5.2 and 6.2 mmol/L) is within the edge line of high-risk class. A normal HDL cholesterol is in between 40 and 49 mg per dL (1 and 1.3 mmol/L) for men. As for women, it is between 50 and 59 mg per dL (1.3 and 1.5 mmol/L).
Your total cholesterol level is in the Desirable range, but your level of bad LDL cholesterol is High. This may mean that your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, is too low. It is best to have a high level of good HDL and a low level of bad LDL. Cholesterol levels should be measured at least once every five years in everyone over age 20. The screening test that is usually performed is a blood test called a lipid profile. Experts recommend that men ages 35 and older and women ages 45 and older be more frequently screened for lipid disorders.
High: At or above 240 mg/dL. If your total cholesterol is high, you have twice the risk for heart disease as a person with normal total cholesterol. Here is the adult range for HDL cholesterol: Normal: 35 to 65 mg/dL for men, 35 to 80 mg/dL for women. If your number is less than 25 mg/dL, your risk for coronary heart disease is doubled. If your number is between 60 and 74 mg/dL, your risk for coronary heart disease is below average
1 If HDL-C is less than 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) for men and less than 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) for women, there is an increased risk of heart disease that is independent of other risk factors, including the LDL-C level. For example, if a person has a total cholesterol result of 200 mg/dL and an HDL cholesterol level of 50 mg/dL, the ratio would be stated as 4 (or 4:1). A desirable ratio is below 5 (5:1); the optimum ratio is 3.5 (3.5:1).
At the same time HDL Cholesterol Levels fall into 1) low (for men – less than 40 mg/dL; for women – less than 50 mg/dL) and 2) high (more than 60 mg/dL for both men and women). The desirable total level of cholesterol in the blood is less than 200 mg/dL. If the concentration of cholesterol in the blood is greater than 240 mg/dL, it is considered to be high.
A score below 40 mg per dL (1 mmol/L) for men, and 50 mg per dL (1.3 mmol/L) for women is known to be low. This places you at threat of cardiovascular problems. A normal HDL cholesterol is in between 40 and 49 mg per dL (1 and 1.3 mmol/L) for men. As for women, it is between 50 and 59 mg per dL (1.3 and 1.5 mmol/L).
