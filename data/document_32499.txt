Although he fights Aizen numerous times (minor battles), this time all of the characters in Bleach are losing terribly, but the last time he fights (battles) Aizen is episodes 309 and 310. The whole battle ranges from episodes 308 - 309. 310 is where the arc finishes off and the Aizen vs Ichigo ends nicely.
