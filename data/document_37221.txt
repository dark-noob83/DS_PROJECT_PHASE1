Costs for 1 acre of hops, based on a system of several hundred acres, using a high trellis system, were estimated at $5,300 per acre for 2012. These costs are much less than small-scale hop production because of the cost savings from large-scale production. Production costs for irrigated. The total initial investment for ¼-acre was estimated at $6,500, with annual production costs at $3,350. The North Carolina budget estimated a breakeven price of about $35 per pound for 400 pounds of wet hops produced from ¼-acre.

Market value. Researchers estimate that within the first year, growers can expect a yield of 200 to 1,800 pounds per acre, depending on the cultivar, with an estimated value of $2,000 to $25,200. In the second year and subsequent years, yield increases to 500 to 2,200 pounds per acre valued at $7,000 to $30,800. With these kinds of numbers, its important to get production right. That’s why the OARDC is trying to figure out the best practices.
Fixed costs are the costs that incurred whether you produce any hops that year. Fixed costs include amortized establishment cost, taxes, insurance, and land. Land charge is estimated at a rental rate of $75 per 0.25 acre. An overhead cost is estimated at 8% for the total variable costs to produce hops. Total fixed costs are estimated to be $868 for the site (Table 7). The cost of materials for the irrigation setup totaled $1,983 for the quarter acre yard, approximately $1300 (~70%) went toward the on-site water storage cistern.
