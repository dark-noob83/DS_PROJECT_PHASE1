In rare cases, a child may get a very mild form of the disease. About 4 percent of children develop a mild rash (around ten chicken-pox-like blisters). Fewer than 1 child in 2,500 has a seizure caused by high fever (and slightly more with the MMRV vaccine).
A second dose of the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine is now available for children born on or after January 1, 2000, who are at least 12 months to 11 years of age. This safe, effective booster will provide added protection against this highly contagious illness.
The second dose may be given at an earlier age if it is given at least 3 months after the first dose. People 13 years of age and older who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get two doses, at least 28 days apart.
It is really NEVER a good age to get chicken pox (especially intentionally!). The risk of complications is so great--putting your child and your family in danger. Far better, and much less riskier, is to obtain the vaccine as early as 12-18 months. I think there is a booster requirement between 4-6 years.
Most cases occur in people who are younger than 15 years of age. Chickenpox is usually a mild illness, but it can cause problems such as brain swelling, pneumonia and skin infections. Some children get sicker than others.
At a Glance. CDC recommends two doses of chickenpox vaccine for children, adolescents, and adults. Children should receive two doses of the vaccineâ€”the first dose at 12 through 15 months old and a second dose at 4 through 6 years old. 1  Who needs the chickenpox vaccine.
A common viral infection, chicken pox can affect any young child or baby. You may think your child has symptoms of a cold when it is acutally the beginning of chicken pox. Most children get it under the age of 15, but anyone can contract it.
