RTI International (formerly Research Triangle Institute) is a nonprofit organization headquartered in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina that provides research and technical services. RTI competes with the three universities that form the research triangle and other research institutes for contracts. It bids on $2 billion in research contracts a year and wins approximately 40 percent of the budget it bids on.
Response to intervention (RTI) may sound complicated, but it’s based on a fairly simple idea. Early in the year, your child’s school can start looking at everyone’s skills in reading, writing and math. They can provide targeted teaching—called interventions—to help struggling students catch up. RTI is not a replacement for special education. But it can help many struggling students make progress. The more details you have about your school’s RTI process, the more you can help your child get the kind of support he needs to succeed.
Response to Intervention (RTI) is a school-based, multi-level prevention system to maximize student achievement and reduce behavior problems. The four essential components of RTI, as outlined by the National Center on Response to Intervention, are: Multi-level prevention system Universal Screening Progress Monitoring Data-Based Decision-Making The RTI Implementer Series includes three training modules on the Essential Components of response to intervention.
For RTI implementation to work well, the following essential components must be implemented with fidelity and in a rigorous manner: High-quality, scientifically based classroom instruction. All students receive high-quality, research-based instruction in the general education classroom. RTI is designed for use when making decisions in both general education and special education, creating a well-integrated system of instruction and intervention guided by child outcome data.
Response to Intervention (RTI) is a multi-tier approach to the early identification and support of students with learning and behavior needs. The RTI process begins with high-quality instruction and universal screening of all children in the general education classroom. Though there is no single, thoroughly researched and widely practiced “model” of the RTI process, it is generally defined as a three-tier (or three-step) model of school supports that uses research-based academic and/or behavioral interventions. The Three-Tier Model is described below.
