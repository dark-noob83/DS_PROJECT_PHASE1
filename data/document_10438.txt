How long does it take to get to Jupiter from Earth? The distance between Earth and Jupiter varies depending on where the two planets are in their orbits around the sun. So the time it takes to travel to Jupiter from Earth depends on the distance between the two planets at the time of launch. It also depends on the speed of the spacecraft and the path chosen. Below is a list of launch and arrival times between Earth and Jupiter for some past missions. MISSION LAUNCHED JUPITERARRIVAL Cassini Oct 15, 1997 July 1, 2004 Voyager 1 Sept 5, 1977 March 5, 1979 Voyager 2 Aug 20, 1977 July 9, 1979 Ulysses Oct 6, 1990 Dec 8, 1992 Pioneer 11 April 5, 1973 Dec 2, 1974.
Since the Earth and Jupiter are both revolving around the sun, the distance between them is always changing. The average distance between the Earth and Jupiter is 483 million miles. If you could travel at the speed of light, it would only take you 43 minutes to get to Jupiter. 
The elliptical paths mean that the planets do not remain at a constant distance from the sun. At its closest, or perihelion, Jupiter lies 460 million miles (741 million km) from the star; at its farthest, or aphelion, it is 508 million miles (817 million km) away. On average, the distance to Jupiter is 484 million miles (778 million km). From its closest point, Jupiter shines so brightly that even Venus dims in comparison. At its farthest, the gas giant lies 601 million miles (968 million km) away. Jupiter takes 11.86 Earth-years to complete one orbit of the sun.
When the two planets are at their closest point, the distance to Jupiter is only 365 million miles (588 million kilometers). From its closest point, Jupiter shines so brightly that even Venus dims in comparison. At its farthest, the gas giant lies 601 million miles (968 million km) away. Jupiter takes 11.86 Earth-years to complete one orbit of the sun.
Even on a straight line, Jupiter is at least 590 million kilometers from Earth and could be as far as 966 million ki … lometers. For example, it would take at least 2 and a half years to reach Jupiter with a space shuttle at its orbital speed of 17,500 mph. Jet Flight to Jupiter A commercial jet travels more or less 1000 km/hr. Jupiter is, round numbers, 5 A.U. away, or 5*150e6 km. Time = distance/rate, so time = 750e6 km /1e3 km/hr = 750,000 hours.
How long it would take to get to Neptune from Earth would depend on the path chosen and on where Neptune and Earth were in their orbits when the mission was launched. For example, the Voyager 2 spacecraft was launched on Aug 20, 1977 and it reached Neptune on Aug 24, 1989. 
Confidence votes 30.1K. If the Earth and Jupiter are lined up properly and you assume Jupiter is 480,000,000 miles from the sun and earth is 93,000,000 miles from the sun and the shuttle travels 17,500 mph: 480,000,000-93,000,000=387,000,000 (distance from Earth to Jupiter). 387,000,000/17,500=22,114 hours or 921 days or 2.522 years. Note however, that space shuttles aren't designed to totally escape Earth's gravitational pull and wouldn't be able fly that far away.
So let me give you some context. Light itself takes 4.6 hours to travel from the Earth to Pluto. If you wanted to send a signal to Pluto, it would take 4.6 hours for your transmission to reach Pluto, and then an additional 4.6 hours for their message to return to us. Let’s talk spacecraft. 
Traveling at the speed of light (approx. 186,000 miles per second) the sun is about 93 million miles away and so it takes about 8 minutes to get there. Jupiter at its closest … is about 360 million miles away. So, it should take approx. 32 minutes to get to Jupiter traveling at the speed of light. Jet Flight to Jupiter A commercial jet travels more or less 1000 km/hr. Jupiter is, round numbers, 5 A.U. away, or 5*150e6 km. Time = distance/rate, so time = 750e6 km /1e3 km/hr = 750,000 hours.
