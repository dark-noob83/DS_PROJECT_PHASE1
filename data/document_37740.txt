1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. 2  For a whole 10- to 15-pound ham, allow 18 to 20 minutes per pound; for a half--5 to 7 pounds--about 20 minutes per pound; or for a shank or butt portion weighing 3 to 4 pounds, about 35 minutes to the pound.
The best way to do this is to place the ham on a rack in a roasting pan. Add water to the bottom of the pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil (cover the pan with the ham). Cook approximately 12 to 15 minutes per pound for a whole or boneless ham and approximately 18 to 20 minutes per pound for a half ham.

1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. 2  To heat the ham, place it on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and bake uncovered. 3  For a whole ham, allow 15 to 18 minutes to the pound; for a half, 18 to 24 minutes per pound. 4  The ham will be ready when the internal temperature reaches 140°F.
Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert an oven-safe thermometer into the center of the ham (it should not touch the bone of a bone-in ham). Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until ham registers desired temperature (140°F for cooked ham).
Step 3: Baking the ham. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert an oven-safe thermometer into the center of the ham (it should not touch bone). Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until the ham registers the desired temperature (140 to 150 degrees F).
Try to work the glaze into the scored lines. 5 Place ham in oven. Cook for about 1 1/2 hours (check after 1 hour, will take longer if the ham is not at room temp to begin with), or about 10 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature of the ham is 110°-120° (use a meat thermometer).
