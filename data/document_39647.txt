Yes horses can get 'Pink Eye' which is actually called Conjunctivitis. It can be caused by many things including but not limited to; dust, illness, viruses, and bacteria. Conjunctivitis can be highly contagious and any horse showing signs of it should be kept away from other horses.
Conjunctivitis in Horses. Much like humans, horses can contract conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva which is a part of the eye), also known as pink eye. It may be due to several factors such as a dusty environment, an illness, or a viral or bacterial organism infecting the eye. Depending on the cause, it can be also highly infectious. Conjunctivitis is normally associated with a clear or yellow/white discharge in the eye. It may or may not contain mucus. At the same time, itching and irritation are also clear signs of the beginnings of conjunctivitis and these symptoms may appear before others symptoms arrive.
Conjunctivitis, colloquially known as pinkeye, results from a variety of causes in horses. It occurs when the lining of the eyelids becomes inflamed. One or both eyes may be affected. If it appears in both eyes, suspect a viral or bacterial infection.
Description. Conjunctivitis in horses is similar to conjunctivitis in humans. The tissues of the horse's eyes become irritated by allergens, excessive dust, flies, injury, or a combination of irritants. When bacterial infection sets in, the eyes appear red and watery.
