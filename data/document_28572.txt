How it works. For each child or beneficiary, there is a lifetime limit of $50,000 in total contributions: 1  This limit does not include any government grant money. 2  If you contribute more than the limit, you may have to pay tax on the excess amount. 3  After 31 years, you can no longer make contributions. 
1 Refers to the TD Securities Inc Self-Directed Education Savings Plan. There is no maximum yearly contribution limit for an RESP. However, there is a maximum lifetime contribution limit of $50,000 per beneficiary, for a term of 31 years. One beneficiary can be designated in more than one plan and the maximum contribution limit for that beneficiary applies to all such plans as a group. RESP proceeds must be used within 35 years of the start of the plan.
She opened the account in 2010 and has $2,500 of contribution room available. She contributes $1,500 to the account in 2010, so the RESP grant is $300 (20% of $1,500). In 2011, she contributes $1,200, thereby qualifying for a $240 grant. 20% of the $1,000 contribution is $200, so you will now have an extra $200 in the account courtesy of the Canadian government. This basically gives you an extra 20% one-time return on your contribution.
Each child is entitled to a cumulative limit of $7,200. A family that did not contribute to its child’s RESP for a year or more can receive a grant of not more than $1,000 as a CESG in a year (i.e., on a maximum contribution of $5,000). 26. The maximum annual grant on the first $500 contributed per child is increased slightly for low-and mid-income families. For transfers after 2013, investment income earned in an RESP can also be transferred on a tax-free basis to an RDSP provided the plans share a common beneficiary. The total RESP income that you can transfer to an RRSP is subject to a lifetime limit of $50,000.
CESG carry forward. If you have not contributed to an RESP, or have contributed less than $2500 to earn the maximum CESG allotment each year, then you can carry CESG contribution room forward to future years. A maximum of $1,000 in CESG can be received in any one given year. For example, if you did not contribute to your child’s RESP in 2012, the $500 CESG not collected is carried forward to the current year. A contribution of $5,000 will attract $500 in grant for the current year and $500 in CESG carry forward grant from the previous year. 
A family that did not contribute to its child’s RESP for a year or more and therefore has unused contribution room for future years can receive a grant of not more than $1,000 as a CESG in a year (i.e. the CESG on a maximum contribution of $5,000). 9. An RESP, which has a maximum life of 35 years, may be an individual (family or otherwise) or group plan. With the exception of a family plan, there is no restriction as to the age of or relationship of the contributor with the beneficiary. The maximum contribution period is 31 years.

About RESPs. A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) is a tax-deferred investment plan that helps you save for a child's post secondary education, so that you'll have the funds you need, when you need them. You can make contributions up to a maximum of $50,000 per child until the child turns 31.
