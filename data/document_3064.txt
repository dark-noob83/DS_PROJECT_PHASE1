Randall Dale Adams (December 17, 1948 â€“ October 30, 2010) was a man who was wrongly convicted of murdering police officer Robert W. Wood and was subsequently sentenced to death. He served more than 12 years in prison and some of that time on death row. His death sentence was reduced through appeal to the United States Supreme Court, and eight years later he was released when evidence was uncovered to prove his innocence. In 1981, Mulder returned to practice private law in Dallas, and the new prosecution then dropped charges in 1989. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said (and Adams agreed) that conviction was unfair mainly because of prosecutor Doug Mulder.. Adams later worked as an anti-death penalty activist.
After his release from prison in California, and five months after Morris arrived in Dallas, Harris tried to kidnap a young woman named Roxanne Lockard in Beaumont, Texas. In an effort to prevent the abduction, Lockard's boyfriend, Mark Mays, exchanged gunfire with Harris. Mays was shot to death and Harris was wounded. Thus, he said, he was asking Governor Bill Clements to commute Adams's sentence to life in prison. When the governor promptly complied, Wade proclaimed that there now would be no need for a new trial. Adams, of course, thought otherwise, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with Wade.
