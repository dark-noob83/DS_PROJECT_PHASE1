And along with good job prospects, that master’s degree in occupational therapy should pay off financially as well. These workers earned an annual mean wage of $77,890 nationally in 2013, with the top 10% of earners making $109,380.
While those earning master's, doctoral, or professional degrees still earn more during their careers than those with less education, the gap is closing, according to The College Payoff, a report published today by the Georgetown University Center for Education and the Workforce.
In 1996 students with a master's earned an average of $46,332 a year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau -- 24 percent more than a college grad with a bachelor's degree. For Harvard University sophomore Josh Weaver, a professional degree is inevitable, but money doesn't play a huge role.
Over a lifetime, a master’s degree can translate to a lifetime salary of $3.3 million. Obviously, $3.3 million – $100,000 is a pretty nice equation—and one worth calculating. Don’t mistakenly think, however, that a master’s degree is an instant ticket to easy money.
However, appearances are deceiving. First of all, most graduate programs average around $60,000 dollars. So, if a student takes out a student loan for $60,000, the higher salary would end up paying for the education in about four years. After that, what you make is what you keep. According to the U.S. census bureau, the average person with a master’s degree earns around $240,000 more than someone with a bachelor’s degree.
Earning a college degree is usually the best way to guarantee better job prospects and higher pay. You put the work in up front, do your best, and emerge from the experience with the skills employers expect and demand. And most of the time, that investment pays off.
According to the data, the average weekly income for adults with a bachelor’s degree was $1,108, while those with a master’s degree pulled in $1,329. Meanwhile, adults with professional degrees and doctorate degrees pulled in a weekly salary of $1,714 and $1,623, respectively, that same year.
