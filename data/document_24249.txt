The 'most valuable car in the world': George Barris (pictured) auctioned off the original Batmobile 47 years after he built it from an old Lincoln Futura.
In the mid 1960's, George Barris of Barris Kustom City acquired the car for $1 directly from Ford. Fast forward to August 1965, the Batman TV show producers approached George to have him build a new Batmobile for their upcoming show. Barris and his crew pulled a mold from the #1 Batmobile and created 3 fiberglass copies. These replicas were displayed at car shows and dragstrips and also made appearances where countless fans could see them. Over 45 years later the 1966 TV Batmobile is still one of the most iconic and popular cars in the world. In 1955, the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company designed and built a futuristic concept car called the Lincoln Futura. It was built entirely by hand in Turin, Italy at a cost of $250,000, and like many concept cars, was never put in to production

History. The first Batmobile. Before the familiar bat-finned cars, the title Batmobile was first used on a red convertible in Detective Comics #48 in February 1941. Most of the design was based on the 1936 Cord, though the nose of the car looked more like that of a Lincoln or similar car.
In November 2012 Barris Kustom and George Barris announced the sale of the Batmobile at the Barrett-Jackson car show and auction held in Scottsdale, Arizona. The vehicle fetched $4.2 million on January 19, 2013. The first car ever publicly toured as a Batmobile was several years before the Barris Batmobile of the TV series. It was inspired by DC comics and was created in 1960 by Forrest Robinson of Westmoreland, N.H. using a 1956 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 chassis and building a handmade custom body.
Barris built two fiberglass copies of the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing. Eventually, the three copies (and the screen-used metal Futura Batmobile) were covered with a black velvet fuzz paint, presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies.
