A series of variants based on the United States Army 's Boeing CH-47 Chinook, the RAF Chinook fleet is the largest outside the United States. In March 1967 an order was placed for fifteen Chinook HC Mk1s, standing for Helicopter, Cargo Mark 1, for the Royal Air Force to replace the Bristol Belvedere. This original MK1 variant was to be based on the CH-47B but the order was cancelled in a review of defence spending in November 1967.

Here are a few of the things that make it amazing: Twin 60 foot rotors give the helicopter amazing lift -- it can haul up to 28,000 pounds of cargo either inside or attached to exterior hooks. 
The CH-47/MH-47 U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) modernization program is in full rate production and will ensure that aircraft are sustained at least through 2030. According to Boeing, it is not unlikely that Chinook helicopters will be Army aviation assets for a century or more. The CH-47F is expected to remain the Army's heavy lift helicopter until at least the 2038 timeframe. The CH-47 is built and assembled at Boeing's production facility in Ridley Park, PA. The Chinook is the most reliable and efficient transport helicopter in the world, capable of handling loads of up to 25,000 pounds.
