Talcum Powder. Talcum powder is a product made from a mineral called talc; it's mostly magnesium, silicon and oxygen. In its natural form, talc may contain asbestos, although home-use talcum powders have been asbestos-free since the 1970s. Talcum powder, made from the mineral talc, is the primary ingredient in baby powder, many adult topical powders and some pet grooming products. If inhaled or swallowed, talcum powder can poison a cat. Meanwhile, some studies link talcum powder and cancer, although the tests were inconclusive at the time of publication
Talcum powder is made from talc, a mineral made up mainly of the elements magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. As a powder, it absorbs moisture well and helps cut down on friction, making it useful for keeping skin dry and helping to prevent rashes. In its natural form, some talc contains asbestos, a substance known to cause cancers in and around the lungs when inhaled (see our document Asbestos). All talcum products used in homes in the United States have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.
When talking about whether or not talcum powder is linked to cancer, it is important to distinguish between talc that contains asbestos and talc that is asbestos-free. Talc that has asbestos is generally accepted as being able to cause cancer if it is inhaled. This type of talc is not used in modern consumer products. In its natural form, some talc contains asbestos, a substance known to cause cancers in and around the lungs when inhaled (see our document Asbestos). All talcum products used in homes in the United States have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.
