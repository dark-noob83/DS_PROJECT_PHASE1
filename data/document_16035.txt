Mainly it means that he either thinks you're short/young, or he thinks you're sexy. Those are the two meanings most commonly used. But more often than not, he likely thinks you're short or young. If he really doesn't call anyone else this then maybe he's into you. 1
Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. If a guy calls a girl shawty , it's a term of endearment. It can either mean he thinks you're cute, or just plain likes you, is interested in you, has a crush on you, etc. Sometimes a girl can call a girl shawty , or a guy to a guy shawty , too, meaning the equivalent of homie or something. But as far as I understand, that's only 4 same gender, (when you're not a homosexual of course). If a guy calls a girl shawty , it's a term of endearment
Well in most cases its not in that way. Its like a sign of endearment, meaning she only says it as a way of being nice in a sense. I dont know how old you are but sometimes I hear girls call each other hun or even babe depending on how friendly the relationship is it does not mean they like you in that way. 
Report Abuse. Shawty is another way of saying shorty and its really just a slang term, it really doesn't mean anything negative (like whore-as someone already said) but it's probably his way of flirting. Just tell him to call you by your NAME... you have one for a reason ;-). he came up too me and said shawty or he said shorty. but then he actually said shawty. and he kept saying it like, ' bye shawty.' and blh blh. like sometimes i hang out with my friends, he just comes up and say hi shawty., kinda funny though.
