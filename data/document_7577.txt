Best Answer: The eggs take roughly 19-21 days to hatch after being laid, and a female will lay an egg every 24-48 hours. Please be aware that same sex birds will perform copulatory behaviour and that not all mating leads to the laying of fertile eggs. Females will lay unfertilised eggs, even with the absence of males.

Hatching: Cockatiel eggs hatch 18-21 days after nesting begins. A few days before hatching, the air cell (located at the wider side of the egg) will become larger and start to tilt. The baby will then reposition itself and move into the air cell. This is called drawdown.
Generally though, the hen will start incubating the eggs by the time she lays the 2nd egg. The normal incubation period for cockatiel eggs is between 18 and 21 days (from the day the hen or pair start sitting the eggs). The male and female generally take turns sitting on the eggs and do this in shifts. Some pairs will divide the eggs and each sit on half of them.
