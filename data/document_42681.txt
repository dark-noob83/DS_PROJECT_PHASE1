Three basic factors must be considered: (1) how many cubic yards of earth have to be moved to recover one ton of marketable coal (this relationship is commonly known as the mining ratio), (2) what is the total cost of moving that material, and (3) what is the sales price of the coal. The mining ratio is outside the operator’s control for a mountaintop removal project; that is, a fixed volume of earth overlies a fixed volume of coal. There is nothing a mine designer can do to improve the ratio if the full seam is to be taken.
The majority of surface mining equipment in the world comes from one company: Caterpillar. And for good reason. Cat ® equipment is designed to lower cost per ton by providing productive and reliable performance. 13. Highwall Miners deliver an efficient, proven and durable method for mining coal from outcropping horizontal seams — recovering up to 70 percent of in-place coal. The entire mining cycle is completed by a three-to four-man crew, with no personnel going underground at any time.
Summary. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, also known as the Abandoned Mine. Land (AML) Fund, is financed by fees levied per ton of domestically produced coal. The fee is 35 cents per ton for surface-mined coal, 15 cents per ton for underground-. mined coal, and 10 cents per ton for lignite. The fund and the fees were established. by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) to finance. mined coal, 3.8 cents per ton for underground-mined coal, and 2.5 cents per ton for. lignite coal. 31 These fees were based on estimates of coal production by type of. mining and were set with the intention of raising $69 million, the estimated interest. earnings of the AML Fund in FY2005.
Layback one is expected to provide a significant portion of the ore in 2000. Additional mining equipment, scheduled for delivery in mid-1999, will be used on layback one. Mining-Unit Costs The cost per ton for the month of December was $0.81 per ton reflecting the short haul distance to the crusher. For 1999 and beyond, mining cost per ton is expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90. The depth of the pit and the height of the heap leach pad impact the truck-haul cycle time and unit cost, which is the most significant component of mining costs. Processing-Rates The crushing/processing rate is 21,500 tpd. 
Let’s imagine that a 10 million ton block of coal could actually be mined using either deep or surface mining methods. Surface mining would recover about 80% of the reserve, so 120 miners could work for eight years (960 employee-years) to produce eight million tons. Mining Cost: The total cost of mining will include everything, starting from the beginning of the project to active mining and through land restoration to the final release of the mine permit and surety bond, which will be years after the last ton of coal is sold.
More Cost Models. This mine is an open pit mine producing 5,000 tonnes ore and 5,000 tonnes waste per day. Rock characteristics for both ore and waste are typical of those of granite or porphyritic material. Operating conditions, wage scales, and unit prices are typical for western U.S. mining operations. All costs listed are in 2012 US$.
1 Average sales price of coal from U.S. mines decreased from $39.95 per short ton in 2012 to $37.24 per short ton in 2013 (6.8% lower than 2012). 2  Total U.S. coal stocks decreased 16.1% to 200.4 million short tons, a decrease of 38.4 million short tons. 
The equipment listed here represents a typical suite of equipment for a 10,000 tonne per day (5,000 tpd ore + 5,000 tpd waste) surface mine with a 3,500 ft. ore haul and a 1,800 ft. waste haul. Mining Equipment Fleet - 10,000 tonne per day (ore + waste) open pit mine. The following listings of equipment capital and operating costs are taken directly from the current Mining Cost Service Manual and Mine and Mill Equipment Cost Estimator's Guide.
Let’s say we’re mining a 24 inch thick coal seam and recovering 100% of the in-place coal (which is actually not possible.) We would get 200 cubic feet of coal, which is equal to 8.5 tons (at a perfectly clean 85 pounds per cubic foot.) So, our mining ratio would be 106 divided by 8.5, or 12.5:1. The mining ratio is outside the operator’s control for a mountaintop removal project; that is, a fixed volume of earth overlies a fixed volume of coal. There is nothing a mine designer can do to improve the ratio if the full seam is to be taken.
