The length of area covered with riprap will be the eroded area (75 feet) + 10 feet upstreamand downstream = 95 feet.4. A geotextile fabric will be installed beneath the riprap.Construction:1. Where grading is required, grade the site according to the grading plan. Grade only whenstone is ready to be placed.2. This riprap will be placed to a height of 6 feet (3 feet above the ordinary high water mark).The depth will be 24 inches: [1.5 x (stone size of 12 inches) = 18 inches + 0.5 foot granularstone = total of 24 inches].3.

B.3 Mussetter Engineering, Inc. Appendix B5. Estimated construction cost (Item 8) Scenario 3 assuming mitigation can be offset by removing rock from Golden State Island and using this rock at the M&T site. Appendix B2. Estimated construction cost (Item 8) Scenario 3 assuming all new rock and mitigation costs of $800 per foot of bankline.
The estimate was prepared in accordance with a Class 4 engineer’s construction cost estimate as defined by Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International (AACE, 1997). The typical expected accuracy range for this class estimate is –15% to –30% on the low side and +20% to +50% on the high side.

Erosion Control Costs. The cost of riprap varies depending on location and the type of material selected. A cost of $35 to $50 per square yard of nongrouted riprap can be used as a basic quote, while grouted riprap ranges from $45 to $60 per square yard. These costs will depend on the availability of resources, accessibility and total area to be cover
Riprap may also used as revetment. Installation: Stone weight is approximately 165 lbs/cu ft. Riprap should be well-bedded in a stable channel bottom for a depth of 1.5 to 3.0 ft, depending on the size of the stone. The channel side slopes shall be prepared to the required lines and grades. Riprap should be placed over filter fabric.
Riprap Installation. Riprap offers a soft edge in the transition from water to land. Many permitting officials in the area around Apollo Beach recommend, if not require, that rip rap is placed instead of further proliferation of hard seawalls. We can use clean broker rock or concrete for a rip rap installation.
