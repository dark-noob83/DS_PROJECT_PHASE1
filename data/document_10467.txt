City leaders say the new central library located on Cesar Chavez Street at the old Seaholm site will cost $120 million.
Project interior design consultants along with Public Works and Library staff members are meeting this month with the City of Austin Purchasing Department to complete the final set of procurement documents for furniture solicitation for the New Central Library.

They were libraries city officials also looked at as examples before starting construction here. The main public library in Jacksonville built in 2005 cost less than Austin’s at $100 million. But San Diego’s new library had a price tag of $185 million and Seattle’s public library cost $165 million.
Construction activities continue to progress rapidly at the site of New Central Library, with efforts concentrated on making the building impermeable to water through completion of roof work-including the roof garden – and making the exterior walls weathertight.
