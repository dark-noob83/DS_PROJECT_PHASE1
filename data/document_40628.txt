LDMOS (laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor) transistors are used in microwave/ RF power amplifiers. These transistors are often fabricated on p/p + silicon epitaxial layers. The fabrication of LDMOS devices mostly involves various ion-implantation and subsequent annealing cycles. RF power amplifiers based on single LDMOS devices suffer from relatively poor efficiency when used in 3G and 4G (LTE) networks, due to the higher peak-to-average power of the modulation schemes and CDMA and OFDMA access techniques used in these communication systems.
1.LDD is Lightly Doped drain. If a MOSFET has a LDD structure, the built in potential, Vbi in a LDD-MOSFET will be smaller as compared to conventional MOSFET s; therefore thethreshold voltage reduction due to the short channel effect will be smaller 2.I do not know what DDD is. 3.LDMOS is laterally diffused MOSFET. It is used in HF,RF applications. ddd ldmos. LDD = Lightly Doped Drain, Special implant placed in the drain near the gate to reduce the electric field at the drain. It is used to control hot carrier degradation by decreasing the impact ionization in
Silicon-based LDMOS FETs are widely used in RF power amplifiers for base-stations as the requirement is for high output power with a corresponding drain to source breakdown voltage usually above 60 volts. Compared to other devices such as GaAs FETs they show a lower maximum power gain frequency. RF power amplifiers based on single LDMOS devices suffer from relatively poor efficiency when used in 3G and 4G (LTE) networks, due to the higher peak-to-average power of the modulation schemes and CDMA and OFDMA access techniques used in these communication systems.
Comments 0. Power lateral diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor (LDMOS) transistors, popularly used in linear high-power amplifiers (HPAs) for cellular base stations, are not without their linearity and stability problems. There is still much room for improvement in linearity and low-frequency stability when developing high-power silicon LDMOS devices, as modifications to a standard device can show.

7.8.1. The Laterally Diffused MOSFET (LDMOS) is an asymmetric power MOSFET designed for low on-resistance and high blocking voltage. These features are obtained by creating a diffused p-type channel region in a low-doped n-type drain region. A typical structure is presented in Figure 7.8.1. The device can be fabricated by diffusion as well as ion implantation. The p-type region is formed first, followed by shallow p + and n + regions. The n + regions provide both source and drain contact regions.

As the name implies, a lateral current is created between drain and source. A cross-section of a LDMOS device used in RF applications can be seen in Figure 1. To understand how the device functions, we should first consider differences between a regular MOS and a LDMOS. One of the things we first notice is P+ Threshold adjust (beside P+ Sinker).
There is excitement for GaN as a disruptive technology for GaAs/LDMOS and enabling technology for high-power and high-frequency RF applications. But complex engineering solutions decisions with device technology are based on more than just raw performance. To get a feel for this growth and development, one can simply look to the power-amplifier (PA) market (Fig. 1) . After all, RF PAs are used in most RF applications. Some mainstream device technologies, such as LDMOS and GaAs, have enjoyed consistent incremental growth and longevity in the RF markets.
