Stenosis. Narrowing of a valve or an artery is called stenosis. A stenotic valve does not open completely and therefore it obstructs or blocks blood from moving through it normally. An artery can become stenotic as well, such that there is obstruction of blood flow through it to the organs of the body.
About Valve Stenosis Stenosis is the term for a valve that doesnâ€™t open properly. The flaps of a valve thicken, stiffen, or fuse together. As a result, the valve cannot fully open. Thus, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve, and the body may suffer from a reduced supply of oxygen.
Narrowing of the pulmonary valve is most often present at birth (congenital). It is caused by a problem that occurs as the baby develops in the womb before birth. The cause is unknown, but genes may play a role. Narrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called pulmonary valve stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or after the valve. The defect may occur alone or with other heart defects that are present at birth. The condition can be mild or severe.
Aortic valve stenosis is narrowing of the aortic valve. Many things can narrow this passageway between your heart and aorta. Causes of aortic valve stenosis include: Congenital heart defect. The aortic valve consists of three tightly fitting, triangular-shaped flaps of tissue called leaflets.
Aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people. Calcification of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves.
Causes of Valve Stenosis Stenosis can be caused by age or by a malformed valve called a bicuspid valve. Up to two percent of the population is born with a bicuspid valve abnormality which means that instead of having three flaps that open for blood flow, two are fused together.
