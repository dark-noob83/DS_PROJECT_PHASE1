If you’re changing the amount of feed, increase or decrease each meal a little at a time, over several weeks if possible. One method for changing the type of feed is to replace 25 percent of the current food with the new food every two days, so that in six days the horse is eating l00 percent of the new food. 3.

1 Accustom horses to feed gradually. 2  In general, they maybe given as much hay as they will eat. 3  It is safe to start horses on 1/2 pound of grain daily for each hundred pound's of the animal's weight. 4  Thereafter, 1/2 pound of grain added to the total ration every third day is advisable. The basic ration for a horse is hay plus grain. The amount of grain a horse needs depends on the growth or performance expected. The amount of total ration is based on a consumption of 2-1/4 pounds of airdry fed per cwt. Thus a 1,000-pound horse would receive a total daily ration of 22-1/2 pounds.
At least 65% of this amount should be forage. In other words, a 1000 lb horse should be fed 18 lb of dry matter each day. Dry matter (DM) is the amount of feed that does not contain moisture; the DM content of hay is considerably higher than fresh grass. Your hay analysis should show the DM content of your forage. If you are feeding 100% hay and your hay contains 90% DM (or 10% moisture), your 1000 lb horse should be fed 20 lb of hay (18 lb DM/0.9) straight from the bale each day. Clearly, weighing hay is the most effective way to measure the correct amount
Structural carbohydrates, like hay and grass, are essential to a horse’s diet. Horses eat large quantities of hay and grass as their main source of food. In fact, horses should eat about 15-20 pounds or 1-2% of their body weight in hay every day, so make sure that your horse always has plenty of hay to chew on. In two days, replace 50% of the old feed with the new feed. Two days after that, replace 75% of the old feed with the new feed. Then two days after that you will be able to give your horse 100% new feed.
