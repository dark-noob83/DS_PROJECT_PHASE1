The carpal tunnel is a narrow, tunnel-like structure in the wrist. The bottom and sides of this tunnel are formed by wrist (carpal) bones. The top of the tunnel is covered by a strong band of connective tissue called the transverse carpal ligament.
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome-Surgery. Most people with carpal tunnel syndrome are treated without surgery. Surgery is considered only when: 1  Symptoms haven't improved after several weeks to months of nonsurgical treatment. 2  This assumes that you are having ongoing symptoms but no sign of nerve damage. 3  Nerve damage would make surgery more urgent.
Carpal tunnel release is a surgery thatâ€™s used to treat and potentially heal the painful condition known as carpal tunnel syndrome. Doctors used to think that carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by an overuse injury or a repetitive motion performed by the wrist or hand, often at work.
Surgery is usually recommended for cases of CTS, when other treatments have failed to relieve symptoms. Surgery for CTS is known as carpal tunnel decompression or carpal tunnel release surgery and is performed on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight.
Introduction. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a disorder that causes pain and weakness in the hand and wrist. CTS develops from problems in a nerve in the wrist -- not the muscles, as some people believe. The symptoms of CTS can range from mild to incapacitating.
During open carpal tunnel release surgery, the transverse carpal ligament is cut, which releases pressure on the median nerve and relieves the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. An incision is made at the base of the palm of the hand. This allows the doctor to see the transverse carpal ligament.
