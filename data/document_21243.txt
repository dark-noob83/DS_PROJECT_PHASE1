Interstate business is business conducted between states. For example, if your company in state A provides a product or service for someone in another state (state B), you are conducting interstate business. Intrastate business is business conducted within a particular state. So if a company and customer are in the same state, then you are conducting intrastate business. This is important because states only have the power to regulate
Intrastate commerce is trade, traffic, or transportation within a single State. If your operations include interstate commerce, you must comply with the applicable Federal safety regulations and operating authority rules, in addition to State and local requirements.
