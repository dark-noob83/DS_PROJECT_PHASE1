Rogers are crooks. They have removed this alert service. They charge min. $50 overage before they stop the overages bleeding. I’m buying out my flex tab and moving to Wind.. it’ll be poor quality data but atleast it will be set to $35/mth vs. $300.
From my rogers for my 6 GB plan, it gives 50 cents a MB for first 60 MB and 3 cents a MB after that. But yours might be different. Log into my rogers, go to products and services, and click on the show full details plus sign at the bottom and look for the footnote related to your data plan.
Hi John – For all code eligible customers the $50 cap on data overage charges also applies to Rogers Rocket Hubs. You will receive a notification when you have reached $50 in data overage charges.
This program is currently only for Share Everything customers. Share Everything Plan customers will receive a notification via SMS (text message) when they reach 75% of their data bucket, 100% of their data bucket, at $30 data overage, and $90 overage.
I was shocked when I see my this month Rogers wireless bill because I was charged $48.82 + tax for overage data use. They charged me for 950 MB with the rate of $0.51 per 1MB. I just thought I should share my experience with you, so you won’t get surprised bills with overage charges. I have been with Rogers for almost 9 years, and they usually send text-message notification when I hit 80% of the monthly data limit.
The fees are 70 dollars for 10 gig of data and 10 dollars per gig for overage but with a maximum overage of 50 dollars per month. I use between 50 and 150 gig per month but have always paid 120 dollars per month max so even when the overage amount seemed much higher than possible I never worried about it.
I've Been Around. Posts: 1. I was reviewing my bill and noticed an overage for data the last two months I did not go back any further because for fear of ruining my day. I called Rogers Support in hopes of eliminating these charges in the future.
