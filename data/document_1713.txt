Lupus Overview. Lupus, an autoimmune disease, happens when the immune system attacks its tissues, causing inflammation, swelling, pain, and damage. Lupus symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, fever, and a lupus rash.
The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. The most common signs and symptoms include: 1  Fatigue and fever. 2  Joint pain, stiffness and swelling. 3  Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose.
Lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that can damage any part of the body (skin, joints, and/or organs inside the body). Chronic means that the signs and symptoms tend to last longer than six weeks and often for many years.
Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems â€” including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs.
Lupus is an autoimmune disease that causes swelling (inflammation) and a wide variety of symptoms. Lupus affects each individual uniquely. Some people have only a few mild symptoms and others have many, more severe symptoms. Symptoms usually start in early adulthood, anywhere from the teen years to the 30s.
About Lupus. Lupus is an autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, heart, lungs, blood, kidneys, and brain. Normally, the body's immune system makes proteins called antibodies to protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign materials.
Many of these symptoms occur in other illnesses. In fact, lupus is sometimes called the great imitator because its symptoms are often like the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, blood disorders, fibromyalgia, diabetes, thyroid problems, Lyme disease, and a number of heart, lung, muscle, and bone diseases.
