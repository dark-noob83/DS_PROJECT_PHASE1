Primase is an enzyme that creates a primer on a DNA strand by adding RNA nucleotides to the strand according to the DNA template sequence. This process occurs during DNA Replication. If all this sounds complicated, don't worry. We'll break it down below, starting with how DNA replication works. After the DNA is unzipped, by an enzyme called helicase, it is time for primase to come in. Primase starts off the creation of the new strand of DNA by adding the first nucleotide building blocks at a site called the origin of replication. This will be the starting point for creating the new side of the DNA zipper.
Primase. DNA primase is an enzyme involved in the replication of DNA. DNA primase is, in fact, a type of RNA polymerase which creates an RNA primer; next, DNA polymerase uses the RNA primer to replicate ssDNA. Primase catalyzes the synthesis of a short RNA segment called a primer complementary to a ssDNA template
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. DNA primase, also called as DNA primerase, is an enzyme involved in the replication of DNA. DNA primase is a type of RNA polymerase which creates an RNA primer (later this RNA piece is removed by a 5' to 3' exonuclease); next, DNA polymerase uses the RNA primer to replicate ssDNA. Primase is activated by DNA helicase where it then synthesizes a short RNA primer approximately 11 ±1 nucleotides long, to which new nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase. The RNA segments are first synthesized by primase and then elongat
Primase is of key importance in DNA replication because no known DNA polymerases can initiate the synthesis of a DNA strand without an initial RNA or DNA primer (for temporary DNA elongation). Primase is activated by DNA helicase where it then synthesizes a short RNA primer approximately 11 ±1 nucleotides long, to which new nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase. The RNA segments are first synthesized by primase and then elongat
Primase catalyzes the synthesis of a short RNA (or DNA in some organisms) segment called a primer complementary to a ssDNA template. Primase is activated by DNA helicase where it then synthesizes a short RNA primer approximately 11 ±1 nucleotides long, to which new nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase. The RNA segments are first synthesized by primase and then elongat
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Primase is an enzyme that creates a short RNA sequence, called a primer, on a DNA template strand so that DNA polymerase can make a copy of that DNA strand. DNA polymerases cannot synthesize a DNA strand de novo: they can only extend an already existing strand. Report Abuse. Primase is an enzyme that catalyse the synthesis of a short sequence of single strand RNA (RNA primer) on which the polymerase enzyme started forming Okazaki fragements to make a new copy of the DNA gene.

Primase is an enzyme that synthesizes short RNA sequences called primers. These primers serve as a starting point for DNA synthesis. Since primase produces RNA molecules, the enzyme is a type of RNA polymerase. Primase functions by synthesizing short RNA sequences that are complementary to a single-stranded piece of DNA, which serves as its template
primase An enzyme that creates the short primer sequences needed for the discontinuous replication of DNA. It is an RNA polymerase that synthesizes a short segment of RNA, consisting of 10 to 12 nucleotides, attached to the lagging strand of the unwound DNA molecule.
