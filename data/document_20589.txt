Depending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly in 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more.
If you need easy-to-peel eggs and you have fresh eggs, you might want to try steaming the eggs for 15 minutes. Pour an inch of water into a pot and insert a steamer basket.Bring to a boil. Place the eggs in the steamer basket, cover and steam for 15 minutes (more or less, check!).
Hard-cooked eggs in the shell can be refrigerated up to one week. Peeled hard boiled eggs can be stored in the refrigerator in a bowl of cold water to cover for about 1 week (change the water daily) - or in a sealed container without water (cover the eggs with damp paper towels) for the same length of time.
When you boil an egg, a physical change occurs that causes it to harden. The time it takes to hard boil an egg depends on the size of the egg. Give the egg time to reach room temperature, about 12 to 15 minutes. Place the eggs in a pan of water and give the water time to boil. It should take eight to 10 minutes for the water to begin to boil, less time if you cover the pan with a lid. You can also add salt to the water to encourage the water to boil faster.
