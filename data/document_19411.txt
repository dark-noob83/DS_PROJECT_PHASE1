Respected dermatologists who specialize in rare skin disorders and receive dozens of referrals per month may charge more than normal acne specialists. The going rate for a cheaper dermatologist is typically between $100 and $170 per visit. An expensive dermatologist might charge upwards of $200. If you're unsatisfied with the cost of your visit, talk to your dermatologist's bookkeeper and ask how to secure a reduced rate on your next appointment.
An Annual Skin Exam is 25 minutes. This visit with Dr. Scheel will cost $149 + tax or you may choose to see one of our Board Certified Physician Assistants for $127 + tax. The visit code for your insurance provider is 99214.
i am seeing a dermatologist in two weeks. the appointment costs $250, it is at the Miami children hospital they also said any procedure is extra. i think the cost depends on the quality of the dermatologist.
