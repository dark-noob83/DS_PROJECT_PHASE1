AWP, like most conferences, is made up of panels all day followed by readings and social events at night. The purpose of AWP — mostly sponsored by a variety of graduate-level writing programs — is manifold. Even the scene at the bar that pops up during the afternoon on site is notable and has drawn scrutiny for the hookup scene that’s fostered there. Oh yes: rumors of bad behavior follow AWP just as they dog MFA programs themselves and of course, artist’s residencies. Minneapolis-bound for a literary Burning Man of sorts.
AWP provides community, opportunities, ideas, news, and advocacy for writers and teachers of writing. Book View Now, a PBS show dedicated to books and publishing since its inception in November 2014, plans to expand its book programming to include “livestreaming, social media, and other programming.”.

Whether you’re brand new to AWP or a seasoned veteran, the following nuggets of wisdom from writers and editors should help you come out of the conference with your sanity (and suitcase full of literary magazines) intact. Michael Nye, editor of Missouri Review: Skip the panels. Controversal advice, I’m sure. A regular criticism of AWP panels is that they are not particularly good and poorly organized, and that panels are selected for name recognition rather than the quality of the presentation. I wish I could disagree. Remember that you are with other writers, and we’re all really eager to say Hello to a wide-range of people: politeness and dignity can go a long way in making good impressions. Don’t be that person (though, at AWP, we are all that person). Keep your eyes above the neck.
