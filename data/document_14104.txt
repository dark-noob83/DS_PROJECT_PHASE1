A prototype is a model used to test and evaluate a design. When you design a product, you need to build samples of the product to test and verify the functionality of the design. First few units which are build for this purpose are called prototypes.
Prototyping is the process of building a model of a system. In terms of an information system, prototypes are employed to help system designers build an information system that intuitive and easy to manipulate for end users.
2) In prototype-based programming, a prototype is an original object; new objects are created by copying the prototype. 3) In hardware design, a prototype is a hand-built model that represents a manufactured (easily replicable) product sufficiently for designers to visualize and test the design. The word prototype comes from the Latin words proto, meaning original, and typus, meaning form or model. In a non-technical context, a prototype is an especially representative example of a given category.
The Prototyping Model is a systems development method (SDM) in which a prototype (an early approximation of a final system or product) is built, tested, and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable prototype is finally achieved from which the complete system or product can now be developed.
A prototype design is a product that is designed and built to test a new design. The item is usually made in a special lab or shop. The prototype is used to corr â€¦ ect mistakes and make it more user friendly. It is also used to make the tooling and equipment needed to produce it in large quantities.
An array of prototypes leading to the final design. A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from. It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming.
