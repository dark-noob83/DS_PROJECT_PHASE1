Honey Comb is as close to the hive as you can get. This is pure, raw, unprocessed honey. The comb is cut directly from the hive and packaged, no processing is done. Each honey comb contains raw gallberry honey, a very sweet and flavorful honey. Honey comb can be paired with a variety of cheeses and fruits.
Today, very little honey is produced as comb honey. Comb honey is raw pure honey sections taken straight from the hive – honey bees' wax comb with no further handling at all. It is the most unprocessed form in which honey comes -- the bees fill the hexagon shaped wax cells of the comb with honey and cap it with beeswax. You can eat comb honey just like a chewy candy.
