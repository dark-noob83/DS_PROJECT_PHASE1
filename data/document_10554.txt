The Sparidae are a family of fish in the order Perciformes, commonly called sea breams and porgies (North America). The sheepshead, scup, and red seabream are species in this family. Most sparids are deep-bodied compressed fish with a small mouth separated by a broad space from the eye, a single dorsal fin with strong spines and soft rays, a short anal fin, long pointed pectoral fins and rather large firmly attached scales.
The common pandora, is found in the Atlantic Ocean from Scandinavia to Cape Verde, and in the Mediterranean and the North Sea. A typical specimen measures 10–30 cm, but it can reach as much as 50 cm in length. It is omnivorous, but mainly feeds on smaller fish and benthic invertebrates. The black seabream live in northern Europe and in the Mediterranean, usually found on the inshore shelf at depths varying from 5 to 300 m. They are usually found in schools feeding on seaweeds and invertebrates. They can reach a maximum size of 6
Treating an annular tear. An L5/S1 annular tear is a very common condition, and the symptoms can often be treated successfully through a regimen of conservative, non-surgical techniques. In fact, an annular tear can sometimes heal completely after a few weeks of non-invasive treatment. Some examples of effective symptom remedies include:
An annular tear can be asymptomatic. In most cases, this condition will result in inflammation that is resolved without treatment. However, if an annular tear progresses, it could allow the inner disc material to leak through the tear and into the vertebral canal.

Annular lesions are extremely common and striking in appearance but can also be misleading. The term “annular” stems from the Latin word “annulus,” meaning ringed. 1 The lesions appear as circular or ovoid macules or patches with an erythematous periphery and central clearing. The condition is considered benign and is characterized by smooth, skin-colored annular plaques and papules. 1 The lesions are usually found on the hands, feet, wrists and ankles but can potentially occur anywhere on the body.
Although most annular lesions will be typical of a dermatophytosis, physicians must consider other possible diagnoses. Tinea corporis can often be diagnosed on the basis of a positive potassium hydroxide examination. Topical and systemic antifungals are usually curative. The condition is considered benign and is characterized by smooth, skin-colored annular plaques and papules. 1 The lesions are usually found on the hands, feet, wrists and ankles but can potentially occur anywhere on the body.
Abstract. The short-term movements of a small temperate fish, the annular seabream Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus 1758), were examined using standard tag-recapture and passive acoustic telemetry in Palma Bay (NW Mediterranean), a marine protected area (MPA).
If, for instance, you are positioned just outside of the path of the total eclipse, you will see the sun wane to a narrow crescent, then thicken up again as the shadow passes by. Annular solar eclipses. An annular eclipse, though a rare and amazing sight, is far different from a total one. The sky will darken ... A solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets between Earth and the sun, and the moon casts a shadow over Earth. A solar eclipse can only take place at the phase of new moon, when the moon passes directly between the sun and Earth and its shadows fall upon Earth’s surface.
Yellowfin seabream (Acanthopagrus latus) are found along in shallow coastal waters from the Persian Gulf to the coast of India to the Philippines, and north to Japan, south to Australia. Eats mollusks, crustaceans, echinoderms and worms. Is a popular angling fish. The black seabream live in northern Europe and in the Mediterranean, usually found on the inshore shelf at depths varying from 5 to 300 m. They are usually found in schools feeding on seaweeds and invertebrates. They can reach a maximum size of 60 cm in length.
