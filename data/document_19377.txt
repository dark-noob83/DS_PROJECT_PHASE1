But not all DNA changes are harmful. Some mutations have no effect, and others produce new versions of proteins that may give a survival advantage to the organisms that have them. Over time, mutations supply the raw material from which new life forms evolve (see Chapter 3, Life's Genetic Tree). 
That is, an organism may only use a small fraction of its entire genetic sequence, otherwise known as its genome. The genome is the set of all genes, regulatory sequences, and noncoding information within an organism's DNA. Thus, the study of genomics considers all of the genetic material contained within and shared between organisms. As genomic techniques advance, researchers continue to accumulate vast amounts of information about DNA sequences from scores of organisms.
DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA. The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences. DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs.
DNA is the primary genetic material of all cellular organisms? DNA is the primary genetic material of all cellular organisms and  is housed in the nucleus or cytoplasm. DNA controls the cells  functions. Edit. Share to: JD Heyl.
In modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA. 
The sequence of nucleotides allows RNA to encode genetic information. All cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to carry the genetic information that directs protein synthesis. In addition, many viruses use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material. The exact sequence of nucleotides on a DNA strand is the genetic code. The total genetic code for all of the DNA on all the chromosomes is the genome. Each cell in the body has exactly the same chromosomes and exactly the same genome.
DNA. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. DNA is comprised of two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix. Each of the two strands of the DNA molecule is a chain of smaller molecules. The exact sequence of nucleotides on a DNA strand is the genetic code. The total genetic code for all of the DNA on all the chromosomes is the genome. Each cell in the body has exactly the same chromosomes and exactly the same genome.
1. DNA is the genetic material of all cellular organisms. Cytosine, a nucleotide. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the material substance of inheritance. All cellular organisms use DNA to encode and store their genetic information. DNA is a chemical compound that resembles a long chain, with the links in the chain made up of individual chemical units called nucleotides. Fact Sheet: DNA-RNA-Protein.
