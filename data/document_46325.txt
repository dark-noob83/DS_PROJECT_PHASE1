If the value of the parameter specified by the null hypothesis is contained in the 95% interval then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 0.05 level. If the value specified by the null hypothesis is not in the interval then the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 0.05 level. If a 99% confidence interval is constructed, then values outside the interval are rejected at the 0.01 level.
in which the hypothesized value is zero are most common. When the hypothesized value is zero then there is a simple relationship between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals: If the interval contains zero then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the stated level of confidence. If the interval does not contain zero then the null hypothesis can be rejected.
Specifies the level for the test and confidence intervals. For given value, alpha, the confidence level is (1-alpha)*100%. The ALPHA= value should be between 0 and 1. If this parameter is omitted, then ALPHA=0.05 resulting in a 95% level
However, since the null hypothesis would be only one of an infinite number of values in the confidence interval, accepting the null hypothesis is not justified.
Looking at non-significant effects in terms of confidence intervals makes clear why the null hypothesis should not be accepted when it is not rejected: Every value in the confidence interval is a plausible value of the parameter. Since zero is in the interval, it cannot be rejected.
1 Since zero is lower than 2.00, it is rejected as a plausible value and a test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between means is significant. 2  It turns out that the p value is 0.0057. 3  There is a similar relationship between the 99% confidence interval and Significance at the 0.01 level.
There is a close relationship between confidence intervals and significance tests. Specifically, if a statistic is significantly different from 0 at the 0.05 level, then the 95% confidence interval will not contain 0.
