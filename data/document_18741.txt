The Saqqara necropolises, near the ancient capital of Memphis on the Nile's west bank just south of Cairo, boast Egypt's oldest pyramids.
The disparate necropolises of the Fayoum oasis are stretched along the banks of the Nile, near Lisht and Maidum, and more inland closer to Lahun and Hawara. Along the Nile, the pyramids of Amenemhet I and Senusret I are located outside of Lisht, while Snefru's tomb is situated at Maidum. Fayoum is also known for having what is believed to be the only obelisk in Egypt with a rounded top. The spire was once topped with a golden statue of the sun god, Ra.

The pyramid complex at Giza, which is just across the Nile from the capital city of Cairo, is the most iconic of Egypt. The Great Pyramid of Cheops, or Khufu, is the only surviving wonder of the ancient world; the other six have all succumbed to time and human development.

Ancient Egyptians built pyramids to honor, or sometimes entomb, pharaohs and other royalty. Because Egypt is largely desert, much of ancient Egyptian civilization arose in the Nile River valley.
