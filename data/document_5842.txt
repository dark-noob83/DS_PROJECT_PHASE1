The hypothalamus receives messages from peripheral nerves, the cortex, and the limbic system, and sends messages out that induce the body's three characteristic types of response to stress: behavior, autonomic nervous system, and endocrine system.
Millions of messengers. Your nervous system contains millions of nerve cells, called neurons. Neurons are highly specialised to transmit messages from one part of your body to another. All neurons have a cell body and one or more fibres. These fibres vary in length from microscopic to over 1 metre.
The endocrine system influences every cellular function within your body. The foundations of the endocrine system are hormones and glands. A gland is a group of cells that produces and secretes hormones. Hormones are the body's chemical messengers. They send and relay messages between different systems. Many different hormones move through the bloodstream. Most hormones are intuitively designed to affect only certain cells.
The nervous system regulates the homeostasis of the body either directly by sending messages to various parts of the body, or indirectly by relaying them via the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and other endocrine organs. Reaction to stress is particularly complex and affects many physiological mechanisms.
Your nervous system sends messages from the body to the brain. Different kinds of Neurons are used to send each message, to allow your brain to know what is going on in your e â€¦ nvironment. The things that cause a reaction are called Stimuli. Messages are sent along nerve cells, or Neurons.
