Share. Careers in Cereal Chemistry. Cereal Chemistry is the study of the composition, structure, and properties of cereals and the reactions or transformations they undergo. Cereals are plants such as wheat, rice, corn, barley, rye, oats, and millet, which produce grains that are the base of the world's food supply. Because of the importance of cereals as food for humans and animals, the field of cereal chemistry continues to grow as an important scientific career.

Compositionally, cereals consist of 12-14 percent water, 65-75 percent carbohydrates, 2-6 percent lipids and 7-12 percent protein. Cereals are quite similar in gross composition being low in protein and high in carbohydrates (Table 2). The lipid content of maize ranges between 0.4 percent and 17 percent, most of which are triacylglycerides (Eliasson and Larsson 1993). Different cultivars of a given type of cereal exhibit compositional variability. The chemical components of cereals are not uniformly distributed in the grain (Table 3). Hulls and bran are high in cellulose, pentosans and ash. The aleurone layer of wheat contains 25 times more minerals than the endosperm; whereas the lipids are generally concentrated in the aleurone and germ
The principal carbohydrate of all cereals is starch, representing 56 percent (oats) to 80 percent (maize) of the grain dry matter (Eliasson and Larsson 1993). Cereal starches are similar in composition, having 74-79 percent amylopectin, 25-30 percent amylose, and 1 percent lipids. The lipid content of maize ranges between 0.4 percent and 17 percent, most of which are triacylglycerides (Eliasson and Larsson 1993). Different cultivars of a given type of cereal exhibit compositional variability. The chemical components of cereals are not uniformly distributed in the grain (Table 3). Hulls and bran are high in cellulose, pentosans and ash. The aleurone layer of wheat contains 25 times more minerals than the endosperm; whereas the lipids are generally concentrated in the aleurone and germ
Cereal grains and the food products derived from them are an important part of human diets, providing energy and nutrients for the growth and health of humans. Grains from different cereal crops vary in the shape, size, structure, and chemical composition. Protein is the second largest component of cereal grains (7.50–16.89 %) (Table 1). Protein is a vital constituent with respect to the functional property and nutritional value of cereal grains. Proteins present in cereal grains vary in the amino acid composition and molecular weight.
Carbohydrates are the major chemical composition of the corn. However, the maize corn kernel is more than a rich source of carbohydrate, it is a source of enzymes for the study of biosynthesis and genetic markers for genetic, biochemical, and genetic engineering studies. Protein is the second most important rice component after carbohydrates. The ouster tissue of the rice grain are rich in water soluble proteins (albumin) and also salt soluble proteins (globulin), but the endosperm is rich in glutelin.
Chemical Composition of Cereals. Chemical Composition of Cereals. The chemical composition of the cereals varies widely and depends on the environmental conditions, soil, variety and fertilizer. Wheat has a higher protein content than other cereals: The protein content varies from 7 to 22% depending on the variety. Protein is the second most important rice component after carbohydrates. The ouster tissue of the rice grain are rich in water soluble proteins (albumin) and also salt soluble proteins (globulin), but the endosperm is rich in glutelin.
