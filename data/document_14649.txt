And Sine, Cosine and Tangent are the three main functions in trigonometry. They are often shortened to sin, cos and tan. The calculation is simply one side of a right angled triangle divided by another side ... we just have to know which sides, and that is where sohcahtoa helps. For a triangle with an angle θ, the functions are calculated this way: Sine Function: soh... s in(θ) = o pposite / h ypotenuse. Cosine Function: ...cah..
Since we know the 53 angle, the hypotenuse ,and we want to find length of the opposite side, we should use sine. Step 2. Set up an equation based on the ratio you chose in the step 1. $ sin(53) = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} \\ sin(53) = \frac{x}{15} $. Step 3. Cross multiply and solve the equation for the side length. Directions: Use sohcahtoa to find the given side length. Based on your givens and unknowns, determine which sohcahtoa ratio to use. Since we know the 67 angle, its adjacent side length and we want to know length of the opposite side, we should use tangent
The inverse trigonometric functions (sin -1, cos -1, and tan -1) allow you to find the measure of an angle in a right triangle. All that you need to know are any two sides as well as how to use SOHCAHTOA. Alternately, you could use the inverse of one of the SOHCAHTOA functions, in this case the inverse of sine (sin -1)! To find, an angle of a right triangle all that we need to know is the length of two sides! Then use the same SOHCAHTOA ratios --just in a different fashion See the example below. sin-1(73.24/76.19) =74 °.
Use sine,cosine or tangent to find the length of side k in the triangle below. Step 1. Based on your givens and unknowns, determine which sohcahtoa ratio to use. Since we know the 53 angle, the adjacent side ,and we want to find length of the hypotenuse, we should use cosine. Step 2. Set up an equation based on the ratio you chose in the step 1. $ cos(53) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} \\ cos(53) = \frac{45}{x} $. Step 3. Cross multiply and solve the equation for the side length. Directions: Use sohcahtoa to find the given side length. Based on your givens and unknowns, determine which sohcahtoa ratio to use. Since we know the 67 angle, its adjacent side length and we want to know length of the opposite side, we should use tangent
Visit http://www.mathswrap.co.uk for real maths, tips and tricks. You can use the trigonometric SohCahToa ratios to find the length of a missing side in a right angle triangle. You need to know the length of another side and the size of one of the acute angles. 
SOHCAHTOA can help us, and we use it like this: Step 1: find the names of the two sides we are working on: the side we already know, and the side we are trying to find 1  : Adjacent is adjacent to the angle, 2  Opposite is opposite the angle, 3  and the longest side is the Hypotenuse. Careful! The 60° angle is at the top, so the h side is Adjacent to the angle! 1  Step 1 The two sides we are using are A djacent (h) and H ypotenuse (1000). 2  Step 2 SOH CAH TOA tells us to use C osine. 3  Step 3 Put our values into the Cosine equation: 4  cos 60° = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = h / 1000
Example of finding Side Length. How to use sine,cosine,tangent to determine side X in the triangle below. Step 1. Step 2. Step 3. Directions: Use sohcahtoa to find the given side length. Based on your givens and unknowns, determine which sohcahtoa ratio to use. Since we know the 67 angle, its adjacent side length and we want to know length of the opposite side, we should use tangent. Set up an equation based on the ratio you chose in the step 1.
and the tangent of an angle of a right triangle is equal to the length of the side opposite the angle over the length of the side adjacent to the angle (TOA). Students are then asked to find the values of the sine, cosine, and tangent of given angles in given right triangles.
