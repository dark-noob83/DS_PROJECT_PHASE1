The more ions, the more acidic the solution. The fewer ions the more alkaline (base) the solution. The pH level is a measure of acidity or alkalinity, on a scale of zero to fourteen, with zero being most acid, fourteen being most alkaline and seven being mid-range. The most critical pH balance is in the blood. Acidic Alkaline.
The pH scale measures how acidic or alkalizing a substance is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of higher than 7 is alkalizing (also called basic). A pH less than 7 is acidic and a pH of 7 is considered neutral. pH stands for “potential hydrogen”. pH is defined as “the measurement of electrical resistance between negative and positive ions in the body”.
Alkalinity does not refer to alkalis as alkaline does ⁶. While alkalinity and pH are closely related, there are distinct differences. The alkalinity of water or a solution is the quantitative capacity of that solution to buffer or neutralize an acid. At a neutral pH of 7 (pure water), the concentration of both H+ ions and OH-ions is 10⁻⁷ M. Thus the ions H+ and OH-are always paired – as the concentration of one increases, the other will decrease; regardless of pH, the sum of the ions will always equal 10⁻¹⁴ M ².
Bases, also called alkaline substances, are compounds that release hydroxyl ions (OH-) in solution. Weak bases have a bitter taste (opposed to sour taste of acids and sweetness of aldehydes and ketones) and are slimy to the touch. The more hydroxyl ions in a solution, the more alkaline it is.

Shares & Saves. Save. The word alkaline has an unique etymology, for it is derived from the Arabic word, al qaliy, which refers to the calcined ashes that were combined with animal fat to make soap. Today, alkaline is often defined as being the opposite of acidic, also called basic. 
In chemistry, an alkali (/ˈaelkəlaɪ/ ; ˈælkəlaɪ From: arabic-al qaly, القلي, “القالي ashes of the”) saltwort is a, basic ionic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chemical. Element an alkali also can be defined as a base that dissolves in.

Alkaline substances have a pH greater than 7. Cleaning products are alkaline, soap, detergent... Acidic substances have a pH less than 7. Oranges, lemons, fruit, yoghurt, vinegar, anything with the word acid attached to it are acidic. Actually, Hempmilk is made from shelled hemp seeds (technically not milk), which are slightly acidic. Not all kinds … of milk are alkaline. Actually Unsweetened almond milk is considered low alkaline, while unsweetened soy and unsweetened rice milks are both considered low acid.
