3. Multiply 43.56 by the pounds of grass seed for each 1,000 square feet (92.9 square m) to get the amount of grass seed needed per acre (hectare). 1  For example, if you have a grass seed mixture that recommends 4 lbs. ( 2 1.8 kg) per 1,000 square feet (92.9 square m), then you would need 43.56 x 4 = 174.24 lbs. 1 For example, for the above grass seed calculation, you would multiply 174.24 (79 kg) by the number of acres (hectares): 2 acres (.8 hectares) would be 348.48 lbs.(158 kg); 50 acres (20 hectares) would be 8,712 lbs. ( 2 3951 kg). 3  Round up to the next pound, i.e. 348.48 lbs. would be 349 lbs.

Seed including clover costs about €55 per acre; fertiliser (two bags of 10-10-20 per acre) €50; lime (two tones per acre, spread) €22 per ton; ploughing and one pass sowing €50 per acre.
