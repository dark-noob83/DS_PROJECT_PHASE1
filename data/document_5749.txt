Some of the fluid continues down the 4.____ of the spinal cord, but most of it circulated into the 5.____ by passing through three tiny openings in the walls of the 6.____. As a rule, cerebrospinal fluid is formed and drained back into the venous blood at the same rate. If its drainage is blocked, a condition called 7.____ occurs, which results in increased pressure on the brain. Ordinarily, cerebrospinal fluid flows from the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle and then through the 3.____ to the fourth ventricle.
