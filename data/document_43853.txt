1 The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
You can take a temperature using the mouth (oral), anus (rectal), armpit (axillary), or ear (tympanic). But the temperature readings vary depending on which one you use, and you need an accurate body temperature to determine if a fever is present. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
Report Abuse. when taking a temp under the arm its called auxillary.. you are suppose to add a degree.. if you are calling a doctor or taking your child in you need to tell them what the temp was and that it was an auxillary or under arm temp.. if you have a typanic thermometer thats the most accurate..
Generally, the correlation of temperature results are as follows: 1  The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
The normal temp rectally should be 99.6 and under the arm is 97.6. So if you are going by the normal 98.6 than you should subtract or add. For example, if you get a fever of 100.8 rectally, then it is actually only one degree above the normal. Yes | No Thank you! Under the arm (axillary) Although it's not the most accurate way to take a temperature, you can also use an oral thermometer for an armpit reading Place the thermometer under your arm with your arm down. Hold your arms across your chest. Wait about one minute or until you hear a beep
1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
A. The average (normal) temperature under the arm (98.7 axillary) is about one degree less than the mouth (98.6) , and about two degrees less than the rectal temperature 99.6). If you are transmitting information to a medical provider, you do not have to add or substract a degree. All you need to do is say, The temperature was 99.8 under the arm..
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period.
