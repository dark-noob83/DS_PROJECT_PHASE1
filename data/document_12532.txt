The average cost across the country for a professionally installed system is about $8 to $9 per watt, with batteries adding an additional 20 to 30 percent to the cost. If you are a handy do-it-yourselfer, you can save around $2 per watt, but your system may be more difficult to certify for incentives. 
Solar Panels. The solar panels themselves usually account for about 30% of total costs. Residential solar panels with a combined capacity of 3-8kW typically cost between $4,000-$16,000. The best solar panels are not necessarily the most expensive. 
The federal tax credit covers 30% of the solar system cost, and in some states there are additional local and utility rebates to offset retail price. You own the solar panel system and its expected useful life is 30+ years. On average, top tier electricity prices have increased about 5% per year for the last 30 years. 
The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.72/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. “Common residential system prices ranged from less than $3.00/W to just above $7.00/W,” the Solar Energy Industries Association writes. 
1 Overall (Average) Solar panels cost (from recently updated figures in 2013) ranges between $1750 – $2500 per Kw of installed capacity (average Solar panel cost per kw). 2  This figure includes purchasing the equipment and cost for solar panel installation. 1 Simplistic estimation of FITs income – For a solar panel installation under a FITs scheme of $0.35c per kWh you will receive on average 1650 kwh x 0.35$/kwh = approx. 2  $580 per year per kW installed. i.e. a 5kw home solar panels system will generate 5x$580 = $2900 per year.
1 Solar-powered home water heaters cost $1,000-$3,500 (including installation) but have extremely low monthly operating costs and can be used in any climate, according to the US Department of Energy. 2  The cost for a solar heating system can vary widely. 
Solar Energy Savings. The average household today pays nearly $170 each month in home energy costs. Some estimates have energy costs pegged. at almost $200 per month, a cost of $2,400 for the entire year. It’s important to look at the long term picture when evaluating the amount of savings the addition of a solar panel. system to one’s home will bring.
Credit: Cost of Solar. Studies have found that the average solar homeowner will save about $20,000 over 20 years from going solar. In three of the four most populous states in the country, that 20-year total is actually $30,000. In Hawaii, it’s up above $60,000! And that’s just the average. The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.93/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region.
For example, the total average cost of an installed residential PV system under the California Solar Initiative is $8.70 per Watt (including installation, as of January 2011). That translates to about $34,800 for a four-kilowatt system, the average size of a residential installation.
