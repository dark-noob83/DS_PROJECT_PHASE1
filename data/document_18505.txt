Invented by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg in 1921 and first described privately to his associates in 1923, the method was used during the next twenty years almost exclusively by the composers of the Second Viennese School — Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Hanns Eisler and Schoenberg himself. The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes.
Twelve-tone technique —also known as dodecaphony, twelve-tone serialism, and (in British usage) twelve-note composition —is a method of musical composition devised by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951). The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note through the use of tone rows, orderings of the 12 pitch classes.
Arnold Schoenberg was responsible for the development of the twelve-tone system and atonality. Schoenberg was one of the members of the Second Viennese School, along with Webe … rn and Berg. He developed Klangfarbenmelodie and the Sprechstimme technique, which was demonstrated in his song cycle Pierrot lunaire. Schoenberg was almost entirely self-taught, learning music by  imitating the old masters. He held immense respect for Bach,  Beethoven, Mozart and Brahms. When Schoenberg wa … s met with  exceptionally difficult compositional problems, he often consulted  the works of these composers for guidance and instruction.
Schoenberg's approach, both in terms of harmony and development, has been one of the most influential of 20th-century musical thought. Many European and American composers from at least three generations have consciously extended his thinking, whereas others have passionately reacted against it.

Berg embraced the twelve-tone system developed by Schoenberg, composing the Lyric Suite for string quartet, the Chamber concerto, and a Violin concerto employing those principles. Berg's last work, the opera Lulu, was left in a somewhat incomplete state at the time of his death in 1935. The opera's third act was completed based on the composer's score by Friedrich Cerha in 1963, and received its world premiere in Paris in 1979.
