A pyramid is a polyhedron for which the base is a polygon and all lateral faces are triangles. In this lesson, we'll only concern ourselves with pyramids whose lateral faces are congruent — that is, they're the same size and shape.
Technically, when the lateral faces are congruent triangles, the shape is known as a right pyramid, indicating that the apex — the vertex at which the lateral faces meet — is directly above the center of the base. In this lesson, when we use the term pyramid, we mean a right pyramid. But there are other types of pyramids, too. A pyramid is typically described by the shape of its base. For instance, a triangular pyramid has a base that is a triangle, and a hexagonal pyramid has a base that is a hexagon.
The pyramids have square bases, are called square pyramids, a hexagonal pyramid has a base that is a hexagon and the pyramids have triangular bases called as triangular pyramids, and so on. A pyramid is a polyhedron with a polygonal base and triangular sides. A pyramid is named for the shape of its base. Some of the polygonal pyramids are as follow: 1.Triangular Pyramid. The pyramids have triangular bases are called triangular pyramids, also known as a tetrahedron.
For the structure, see Pyramid. A pyramid is a three-dimensional shape. It has triangular sides that come together in a point at the top, call the  apex . A pyramid with a square base (bottom) and four sides is called a square pyramid. A pyramid with a triangular base and three sides is called a tetrahedron.
A triangular pyramid is a three-dimension figure with three faces that are triangles and base that is again a triangle. A pyramid is described by the shape of its base. A pyramid having triangular base is called as a triangular pyramid. A triangular pyramid is a pyramid having a triangular base. The tetrahedron is a triangular pyramid having congruent equilateral triangles for each of its faces.
