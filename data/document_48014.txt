Within the nephron (the functional unit of the kidneys), filtration occurs in the glomerolus. The filtered fluid is called filtrate. Reabsorption of filtrate occurs in a few places within the nephron, however, the majority of reabsorption takes place in the proximal convoluted tube.
Reabsorbtion. Occuring more commonly within the nephron system than filtration, this is a form of active transport which takes the the useful substances for the body from the tubules and places them back into the blood filled capillaries.
Processes of the Kidneys. Filtration. Filtration is the mass movement of water and solutes from plasma to the renal tubule that occurs in the renal corpuscle. About 20% of the plasma volume passing through the glomerulus at any given time is filtered. This means that about 180 liters of fluid are filtered by the kidneys every day.

Filtration is driven by the hydrostatic pressure of the blood, and causeswater and small molecules to be filtered, while blood cells and large molecules like proteins do not pass through the filter. Source [10]. In reabsorption & secretion, as the filtrate passes down the nephron most of it is reabsorbed into the blood.
