2. Heat up 1/2 tablespoon of oil in a pan on medium-high heat. You want the oil to be hot so that the squid cooks quickly. Leaving the meat in the oil for too long will make it tough and rubbery.
Heat over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Mix the flour, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Working in small batches, toss the squid into the flour mixture to coat. Carefully add the squid to the oil and fry until crisp and very pale golden, about 1 minute per batch.
3. Combine 2 oz (56.7 g) olive oil with 1/2 oz (14.17 g) lemon juice, 2 smashed garlic cloves, 2 tsp. (10 ml) Italian seasoning and a pinch of salt in a shallow dish. 4. Add the calamari body and tentacles to the shallow dish and let it sit for up to 1 hour.
Cook squid in hot vinegar, in a 10-inch fry pan, at a moderate heat, 350F., for approximately 30 minutes or until vinegar is completely evaporated. Add oil and continue cooking for 5 to 7 minutes longer or until squid are tender. Makes 2 to 3 servings.
Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cut the calamari bodies into rings 3/4 inch thick. Add the calamari rings and tentacles to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook until all the seafood is opaque throughout but still tender, about 4 minutes longer. Drain well and transfer to a bowl.
