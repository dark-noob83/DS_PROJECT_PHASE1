method of control globe valves have a disk which can completely open or completely close the flow path this is done with the perpendicular movement of the disk away from the seat the annular space between the disk and seat ring gradually changes to allow fluid flow through the valve in globe valves flow rate is determined by the lift of the valve plug from the seat manual globe valves can have equal percentage linear or quick opening flow since flow characteristics determine the flow rate the operator can roughly determine the flow rate by the linear position of the manual handwheel
a globe valves is a linear motion valve and are primarily designed to stop start and regulate flow the disk of a globe valve can be totally removed from the flowpath or it can completely close the flowpath conventional globe valves may be used for isolation and throttling services although these valves exhibit slightly higher pressure drops than straight through valves e g gate plug ball etc they may be used where the pressure drop through the valve is not a controlling factor
globe valve a globe valve is a type of valve used for regulating flow in a pipeline consisting of a movable disk type element and a stationary ring seat in a generally spherical body globe valves are named for their spherical body shape with the two halves of the body being separated by an internal baffl
globe valves are commonly used as an on off valve but they may be used for throttling systems the gradual change in spacing between the disk and seat ring gives the globe valve good throttling ability in globe valves flow rate is determined by the lift of the valve plug from the seat manual globe valves can have equal percentage linear or quick opening flow since flow characteristics determine the flow rate the operator can roughly determine the flow rate by the linear position of the manual handwheel
the basic design of a globe valve which is called globe due to the originally round body shape hasn t changed much over the last 200 years a globe valve is a valve primarily designed to stop or regulate a flow by lifting a disc in a perpendicular motion away from the seat out of the path of the fluid 
globe valves the globe valve is used for throttling flow control shut off is accomplished by moving the disc against the flow stream rather than across it as in the case with a gate valve the globe valve must be installed in the proper relation to the media flow as indicated by the flow direction arrow marked on the valve body this valve is considered uni directional and must be installed with the pressure side or inlet under the seat
back seats are often applied in globe valves stem globe valves uses two methods for connecting the disk and the stem the t slot and the disk nut construction in the t slot design the disk slides over the stem while in the disk nut design the disk is screwed into the stem conventional globe valves may be used for isolation and throttling services although these valves exhibit slightly higher pressure drops than straight through valves e g gate plug ball etc they may be used where the pressure drop through the valve is not a controlling factor
gate valve the gate valve has much the same function as the ball valve in that it is used to restrict the flow of water only the gate valve is generally used for larger applications again the name explains the function the gate is placed between two parallel plates to hold it in plac
inside the valve is a ball with a hole cut right through the center this ball is connected to the handle when the part with the hole is parallel with the pipe itself the water flow is unrestricted and flows freely the gate valve has much the same function as the ball valve in that it is used to restrict the flow of water only the gate valve is generally used for larger applications again the name explains the function
