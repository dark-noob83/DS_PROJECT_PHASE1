Whales' front limbs are called fins. Only some whales have back limbs, which are very small. The tail is divided into two extensions called flukes. Most whales also have a dor … sal fin.
Whales of the Silver Bank-Flukes & Fluking. The fluke, or tail fin, of a humpback whale is very broad and flat, ranging in width from 10 to 15 feet. Attached to a muscular base known as the caudal peduncle, the fluke is capable of propelling the whale at over 12 knots for short periods of time.
It is called the fin whale or finback because of its prominent dorsal fin. It was first referred to as finfisch by Friderich Martens in 1675 to distinguish it from speci … es hunted by whalers that lacked dorsal fins (e.g. bowhead and right whales).

The coloring of a fin whale is very unique. Their bodies are light gray to brownish-black on the back and sides, while the underside is white. The coloring of the lower jaw is what makes the fin whale unique. The coloring is asymmetrical, meaning that each side is different.
The fin whale is second in size only to the blue whale, the largest whale at 100 feet. For an animal that weighs up to 80 tons and may reach a length of 80 feet, the streamlined fin whale is an amazingly swift swimmer. It swims at 5-15 miles an hour with faster bursts of speed.
Side fins of whales are called pectoral fins or sometimes flippers.
The fin whale is one of the rorquals, a family that includes the humpback whale, blue whale, Bryde's whale, sei whale, and minke whale. Rorquals all have a dorsal fin and throat grooves that expand when the animal is feeding. The fin, or finback whale is second only to the blue whale in size and weight.
