Best Answer: If you show up for your MRI in sweat clothing (or something similar) with no metal parts, such as buttons, zippers or snaps, you should be able to leave your clothing on during your study. You could even wear regular clothes to your appointment, then change into your sweats just prior to your exam.
Best Answer: You can usually wear your own clothes as long as you're not wearing anything metal (including the metal on bra hooks.) You may have to remove any body jewelry, or they may let you wear it.
Here are some examples: If you are going to have a scan of the lower spine (lumbar spine) or the abdomen area, don't wear clothing or under-clothing that has metal on it in that area. For example, a body suit that has snaps in the crotch, or pants with fasteners or a zipper will cause a problem.
We will ask you to change into a gown if you are wearing clothes that contain metal. You may prefer to arrive for your scan in clothes which do not contain metal, for example you could wear a zipless tracksuit or an elasticated skirt. If you do this you will not have to change for your scan.
Please wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing without zippers, snaps or anything else metallic, as metal interferes with the imaging. If your clothing contains metal, we will provide scrubs for you to wear during the exam. You cannot wear watches, jewelry, or anything else containing metal into the scanner room.
A Brigham and Women's Hospital answered. We encourage our patients to wear loose, comfortable clothing that does not have any metal buttons, snaps, or zippers for a computerized tomography (CT) scan. Otherwise you may be asked to change your clothes and wear a hospital gown. It is best to leave all valuables at home. You may be asked to remove any jewelry, dentures, glasses, or any metal objects that may interfere with the CT scan.
