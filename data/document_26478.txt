Women should limit sugar intake to no more than 6 teaspoons per day, which provides about 100 calories. Men should limit sugar intake to no more than 9 teaspoons, or about 150 calories. In contrast, the average adult consumes 22 teaspoons per day.
The average American consumes 3 pounds of sugar a week and 130 pounds a year, reports Forbes.com. This is equal to about 3,550 pounds of sugar in a lifetime. The consumption of added sugar accounts for an intake of 500 calories per day, which can cause a weight gain of 1 pound per week.
The American Heart Association recommends no more than six teaspoons (about 30 grams) of sugar per day for women, or nine teaspoons (45 grams) per day for men. And for men and women ages 19 to 30, the USDA recommends two cups of fruit per day.
The new guidelines state most women should consume no more than 100 calories, and men no more than 150 calories, of added sugar. These numbers average out to about 6 to 9 teaspoons, or 25 to 37.5 grams, of sugar a day.
This means women following 1,200-calorie weight loss diets need about 135 to 195 grams of carbs each day, women consuming 1,600-calorie diets need 180 to 260 grams, women following 2,000-calorie diets need 225 to 325 grams and women consuming 2,400 calories per day require 270 to 390 grams of carbohydrates each day.
For example, the World Health Organization recommends keeping added sugar intake to 10% of total calories. For the average 2000 calorie-diet that's a maximum of 50 grams. The American Heart Association recommends 6 teaspoons of sugar for women and 9 for men (1 teaspoon of sugar has about 4g of sugar).
1 Five per cent of sugar intake daily is about 25 grams of sugar/day for an adult. 2  That is about six to seven teaspoons. 3  A can of Coke has more than 10 teaspoons of sugar.
To find the amount of calories from sugar in a product, multiply the grams by 4. For example, a product containing 15 grams of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving, according to the American Heart Association. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, that's 3%.
