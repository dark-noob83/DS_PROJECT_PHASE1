Size. The live oak can live for up to 300 years, reach 80 feet in height and grow canopies up to 100 feet wide. Most specimens will average only about 40 to 60 feet in height and about 60 to 80 feet wide, but these dimensions can still make planting difficult. Live oak trees grow at a rate of 24 to 36 inches per year, so even relatively small saplings could soon interfere with utility wires, buildings or nearby plants. Live oaks have a broad root system that reaches as far as the edge of the canopy, or dripline.
Arborist1627: Columnar english oaks (Quercus robur 'Fastigiata') grow fairly large. I've never seen any reach 50 feet though--this is immaterial though, as anything over 20 feet tall is big in my category.
This oak grows to 70 feet tall and is a fast growing oak that will grow up to 2 feet per year in good soil. These oaks are best adapted to the north but will grow as far south as Atlanta. I also have listed a southern Red oak here on Ebay. These trees are hardy from zone 4-8a and these are 6-16 inch tall seedlings.
My Town wants to plant Columnar English Oak trees about every 7 meters apart (approx. 22 feet). My major concern is that the homes located along this strip where the trees will be planted would be approx. 15-20 feet away from the trunk of these trees.
They should be 40 to 50 feet away from all other trees. Allow an additional 15 to 20 feet between the live oak and your home, driveway or any other structure. This allows for roots that may extend beyond the adult tree's canopy. When you first plant your live oaks, they may seem too small for this kind of spacing, but it will be necessary later.
