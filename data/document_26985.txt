• One of the main differences between an award and a reward is that an award is given in the form of a shield, a trophy, title, badge, medals or sometimes cash. On the other hand a reward is not given in the form of a memento but is given as money.
One great example of such words is “Honor, Incentive, Prize, Reward and Award”. Yes, all we know that these are words that we do not take care to use either one, when we want to appreciate someone for its any special work. However, being having difference in spellings, obviously, they all are somewhat different words.
In the verb form (to reward) the term is synonymous with 'to reinforce'. As a verb it is used with respect to instrumental but not Pavlovian conditioniNG. PRIZE: A prize is an award given to a person or a group of people to recognise and reward actions or achievements. Official prizes often involve monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. Some prizes are also associated with extravagant awarding ceremonies, such as the Oscars.
Perhaps one answer is an award is given to a WORK, such as a National Book Award is given for a particular book, whereas a prize, such as a Nobel Prize in literature, is given to a PERSON for his body of work. But then again, there are Pulitzer Prizes, which in this definition is more like an award, so I could be wrong.
An award or a prize is generally provided for the personal achievements, whereas the rewards focus on the factor of contribution made by the individual. A reward is usually in form of money. Awards are always associated with the positive things whereas a reward can also be used in reference to bad or evil things.
Key Difference: An award or prize is a mark of recognition for excellence in certain field, whereas a reward is a compensation or incentive in return of an act.
