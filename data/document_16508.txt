3 January 2004 | by michaelzstuff (California) – See all my reviews. Angels in the Endzone is a very good family movie, Christopher Lloyd, Paul Dooley, and Matthew Lawrence .... give reasonably good performances. Angels is probably not the best made football movie ever made, but it has some funny sequences and serious moment

The common name for the plant is angel’s trumpet and the botanical name is Brugmansia spp. I was surprised to see the plant growing in the gardens, which feature local plants that can be grown here in NC. Brugmansia is supposed to be a zone 9-12 tropical plant, happiest in zones 9-10. I guess there is hope for me that it might grow in my garden with some luck! It is easy to see why the plant has the common name of Angel’s Trumpet.
