These high performance precision, conductive, ESD safe, SV Carbon Fiber Reinforced Tweezers are ideal for forensic, electronic and sample preparation applications where handling of scratch sensitive material or samples is required. 
It is also available as a crosslinked closed cell foam, used increasingly in aviation and aerospace applications. A fine powder grade, KYNAR 500 PVDF or HYLAR 5000 PVDF, is also used as the principal ingredient of high-end paints for metals. PVDF exists in several forms: alpha (TGTG'), beta (TTTT), and gamma (TTTGTTTG') phases, depending on the chain conformations as trans (T) or gauche (G) linkages. When poled, PVDF is a ferroelectric polymer, exhibiting efficient piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties.

Soft tips specially designed for the electronics industry, easy to mar samples and brittle materials such as Si pieces, these ESD-safe tweezers are made of anti-magnetic, anti-acid stainless steel with replaceable carbon fiber reinforced PTFE tips. Made in Switzerland. 
By adding special conductive materials to the resin, the conductivity of PVDF is increased to control static electricity formation or conduction. These additives may be in the form of either carbon fibers (PVDF CN-F) or carbon powder (PVDF CN-P). Some properties of the original PVDF material are modified by the addition of fillers, but chemical resistance, strength, and manufacturability remain generally the same. Kynar® PVDF has excellent corrosion and chemical resistance and performs in many applications up to 300°F (149°C). It is used extensively in chemical processing applications because of its unique combination of properties.
Copolymers of PVDF are also used in piezoelectric and electrostrictive applications. One of the most commonly used copolymers is P(VDF-trifluoroethylene), usually available in ratios of about 50:50 wt% and 65:35 wt% (equivalent to about 56:44 mol% and 70:30 mol%). Another one is P(VDF-tetrafluoroethylene). PVDF exists in several forms: alpha (TGTG'), beta (TTTT), and gamma (TTTGTTTG') phases, depending on the chain conformations as trans (T) or gauche (G) linkages. When poled, PVDF is a ferroelectric polymer, exhibiting efficient piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties.
