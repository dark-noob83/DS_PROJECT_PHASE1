10 years ago Propane was cheap-so we installed central heating using propane. Now Propane cost 3 or 4 times that and our winter propane bill is about $600 per month (i.e. about for 5 months-rest of the year it is about $50 per month) - Our cooling is electric. I should have installed electric heating as well.

Propane is measured by the gallon so propane is priced per gallon. During the 2011-2012 heating season propane prices ranged from $2.74 to $2.88 per gallon, meaning that a 500-gallon tank cost between $1,100 and $1,150 to fill.
For a heater with an Energy Factor of .6 and a propane cost of $3.89 per gallon, or $.00004251 per Btu, that works out to $1,061 per year.
To calculate the annual operating cost of a propane water heater, you need to divide 41,045 by the heater's Energy Factor and multiply the result by 365, and the fuel cost per British thermal unit.
