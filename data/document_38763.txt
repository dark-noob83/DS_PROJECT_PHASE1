Sustainability. We're going to define sustainability quite differently from normal definitions because the most popular definition in the world, the Brundtland definition of so called sustainable development, is flawed. It's so flawed it should be tossed on the rubbish heap of history's biggest catastrophic mistakes.
The list can be shortened into a tight definition. Environmental sustainability is the rates of renewable resource harvest, pollution creation, and non-renewable resource depletion that can be continued indefinitely. If they cannot be continued indefinitely then they are not sustainable.
Environmental Sustainability. To define environmental sustainability we must first define sustainability. Sustainability is the ability to continue a defined behavior indefinitely. To define what environmental sustainability is we turn to the experts.
Basically the world's standard definition of environmental sustainability is sustainable development, which means sustainable economic growth, which is an oxymoron. No form of economic growth can be continued indefinitely. Furthermore, all economic growth today is terribly environmentally degrading.
There may be as many definitions of sustainability and sustainable development as there are groups trying to define it. All the definitions have to do with:
Definition, Take 1: Sustainability is to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This is the definition of sustainability as created by the World Commission on Environment and Development.
The above definition of sustainability goes against the norm. The most popular definition of sustainability is that from the Brundtland Report of 1987, which said: Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
