The Throttle Body is a device located in the engine compartment, between the intake manifold and air intake pipe. It is similar to the carburetor but does not regulate fuel flow. The throttle body monitors the amount of air that can flow into an engine's combustion chamber. The most important and largest part inside the throttle body is its throttle plate. This plate has a butterfly valve, which rotates on the throttle shaft.
1 The throttle body is located between the air cleaner and the intake manifold of the engine. 2  Most throttle bodies are made of aluminum. 3  The throttle body is connected to the gas pedal of your vehicle with a linkage or flexible cable, which moves the throttle shaft when the gas pedal is depressed.
Throttle body service is the throttle body cleaning and wiping of the bore and throttle blade. The service is important in order to keep the automobile running smoothly, efficiently, and safely.
Post. Share. Definition: In a traditional spark ignition gasoline engine, the throttle body is the part of the air intake system that controls the amount of air that flows into an engine's combustion chamber. It consists of a bored housing that contains a throttle plate (butterfly) that rotates on a shaft.
Internal combustion gasoline engines require three things to operate: oxygen, fuel and a spark. On modern engines, fuel delivery and spark timing are handled by a computer controlled system of pumps and actuators. Air delivery is a bit more analog, which is where the throttle body comes in.
The amount of air in the engine is controlled by the air intake system. A throttle body is part of the air intake system that helps control the amount of air that gets into the engine. If the throttle body fails, the engine will not get the proper mixture of air and fuel and the engine may lose power.
