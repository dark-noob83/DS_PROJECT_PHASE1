Solar heating of the atmosphere, differential heating of water and land masses, rotation of the Earth and the Coriolis effect it causes are the sources of global wind patterns.
To understand the global wind patterns it is best to first view the Earth as a fixed (non rotating) planet. (www.bom.gov.au/info/ftweather/ images/hadley3.gif) As you can see in the absence of the Coriolis effect the cold air from the poles and the warm air from the equator create 4 distinct convection cells.
Unequal heating of the Earthâ€™s surface also forms large global wind patterns. In area near the equator, the sun is almost directly overhead for most of the year. Warm air rises at the equator and moves toward the poles.
Global Wind Patterns wind belts of the general circulation. The global wind pattern is also known as the general circulation and the surface winds of each hemisphere are divided into three wind belts: 1  Polar Easterlies: From 60-90 degrees latitude. 2  Prevailing Westerlies: From 30-60 degrees latitude (aka Westerlies).
The sun is the ultimate source of energy for Earth. As you have previously learned, incoming solar energy (100%) balances the energy reflected in Earth's atmosphere (30%) and the energy which is absorbed at Earth's surface and reradiated as heat or reradiated from clouds and greenhouse gases (70%).
Objectives: 1. Identify factors that affect global wind patterns. 2. Describe the strengths and weaknesses of the three-celled circulation model, and use the model to describe prevailing winds and pressure regions. Key Terms: polar front mid-latitude ITCZ trade winds prevailing winds Notes: (19-3) Wind is a vital resource.
