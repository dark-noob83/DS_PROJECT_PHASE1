1 64.6% of individuals with TB in 2013 were foreign born. 2  The authors note that most cases of TB among foreign-born individuals in the United States are the result of reactivation of latent disease. 3  Just 4 states (California, Texas, Florida, and New York) accounted for approximately half of the TB cases in 2013.
Overall, the percentage of MDR TB cases decreased slightly from 1.4% (96 cases) in 2013 to 1.3% (91 cases) in 2014.**. Of the total number of reported MDR TB cases, the proportion occurring among foreign-born persons increased from 31% (149 of 484) in 1993 to 88% (80 of 91) in 2014. * MDR TB is defined as TB disease that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin.
According to preliminary data from the CDC's National TB Surveillance, fewer than 9,600 cases were reported in the United States in 2013. That represents a decline of 4.2 percent from 2012 -- from 3.2 cases per 100,000 people to 3.0 per 100,000.
In 2010, 60% of TB cases occurred in foreign-born persons. Foreign-born persons have accounted for the majority of TB cases in the United States every year since 2001. Moreover, the case rate among foreign-born persons in 2010 was approximately 11 times higher than among U.S.-born persons, according to the CDC.
In 2011 TB cases and rates decreased among both foreign born and U.S. born people, although foreign born people continued to be disproportionately affected. In 2011 of the 10,528 cases of TB, 3,981 (37.8%) were among U.S. born people, with 6,510 (61.8%) among foreign born people.
In 2014, a total of 66% of reported TB cases in the United States occurred among foreign-born persons. The case rate among foreign-born persons (15.4 cases per 100,000 persons) in 2014 was approximately 13 times higher than among U.S.-born persons (1.2 cases per 100,000 persons).

TB in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 11,182 TB cases (a rate of 3.6 cases per 100,000 persons) were reported in the United States in 2010. Both the number of TB cases reported and the case rate decreased, representing a 3.1% and 3.8% decline compared to 2009.
A total of 9,421 TB cases (a rate of 2.96 cases per 100,000 persons) were reported in the United States in 2014. Both the number of TB cases reported and the case rate decreased; this represents a 1.5% and 2.2% decline, respectively, compared to 2013*. This is the smallest decline in more than a decade.
