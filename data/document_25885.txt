1 The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the median earnings of women and men. 2  This can be either the earnings ratio or the actual pay gap. 3  Women earned on average $0.78 to every $1 earned by men in 2013 (78%) for annual earnings. 1 Women were paid about 90% of what men earned until age 35, at which point median earnings for women start to slow down compared to men's earnings, further widening the pay gap. 2  The average full-time working woman will lose more than $460,000 over a 40 year period in wages due only to the wage gap.

The essential difference between a salary and wages is that a salaried person is paid a fixed amount per pay period and a wage earner is paid by the hour. Someone who is paid a salary is paid a fixed amount in each pay period, with the total of these fixed payments over a full year summing to the amount of the salary. This person is considered to be an exempt employee. There is no linkage between the amount paid and the number of hours worked. This person is considered to be a non-exempt employee. For example, a person who is paid a wage of $20 per hour will receive gross pay of $800 ($20/hr x 40 hours) if he works a standard 40 hour week, but will only receive gross pay of $400 ($20/hr x 20 hours) if he works 20 hours in a week.

A person who receives wages is also entitled to overtime pay of 1.5x his normal rate of pay if he works more than 40 hours per week. There is also a difference between salary and wages in regard to the speed of payment. This person is considered to be a non-exempt employee. For example, a person who is paid a wage of $20 per hour will receive gross pay of $800 ($20/hr x 40 hours) if he works a standard 40 hour week, but will only receive gross pay of $400 ($20/hr x 20 hours) if he works 20 hours in a week.
Following are the major differences between salary and wages: 1  Salary is the fixed amount of compensation which is paid for the performance of an employee. 2  Wage is the variable amount of compensation which is paid on the basis of hours spent in finishing the certain amount of work.

Salary is a fixed amount paid to the employees at regular intervals for their performance and productivity whereas wages are the hourly-based payment given to the labor for the amount of work finished in a day.
