A prime number is a whole number greater than 1, whose only two whole-number factors are 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. As we proceed in the set of natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, ...}, the primes become less and less frequent in general.
more ... A Prime Number can be divided evenly only by 1, or itself. And it must be a whole number greater than 1. Example: 5 can only be divided evenly by 1 or 5, so it is a prime number. But 6 can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3 and 6 so it is NOT a prime number (it is a composite number). See: Composite Number.
A Prime (or a Prime Number) is any whole number that cannot be divided by any other number except itself and 1, without a remainder.   For example, 12 is not a prime number â€¦ because it can be divided by, 1, (to give the answer 12), 2 (to give 6), 3 (to give 4), 6 (to give 2) and 12 (to give 1).
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.
Composite Number. more ... A whole number that can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 or itself. Example: 9 can be divided evenly by 3 (as well as 1 and 9), so 9 is a composite number. But 7 cannot be divided evenly (except by 1 and 7), so is NOT a composite number (it is a prime number).
