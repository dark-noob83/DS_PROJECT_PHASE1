Synonym(s): fossa cranii anterior [TA], anterior cranial base. The anteriormost of the three divisions of the internal cranial base, which houses the inferior face of the frontal lobes of the brain. The floor of the fossa is covered by dura mater and is formed by contributions from the frontal, ethmoid and sphenoid bones. The anterior cranial fossa is limited anteriorly and laterally by the frontal bone.
