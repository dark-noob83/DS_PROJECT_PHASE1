Not all of the banks who received TARP money have repaid the loans. In fact, 400-plus banks are still on the governmentâ€™s red list -- more than have completed the payments -- and, according to the GAO, some may never pay the money back.
The State of the Bailout. OUTFLOWS: $617 billion This includes money that has actually been spent, invested, or loaned. INFLOWS: $673 billion Money returned and paid to Treasury as interest, dividends, fees or to repurchase their stock warrants.
It's been four years since the U.S. launched a massive bailout of the financial system and the auto industry. While much of the bailout money has been paid back, the government still owns large shares in companies such as AIG and GM, and has yet to recoup some $200 billion in bailouts. Here's a breakdown by industry. The largest banks have repaid their bailouts, with interest. But the government has not recouped its bailouts of many mid-sized and small banks. This complete list of bailed out banks shows which ones have paid the money back and which have not.
The Treasury Department has invested about $200 billion in hundreds of banks through its Capital Purchase Program in an effort to prop up capital and support new lending. (Editor's note: This information has not been updated.). DENOTES THE BANK HAS PAID TREASURY BACK. Related bailout Links.

The banks will never pay back the bailouts, since most of the money went overseas to foreign banks. The bailouts wont cost $700 billion, but according to bloomberg, about $24,000 billion once you follow the spiderweb of costs. http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=n...
