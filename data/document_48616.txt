DNA was first discovered back in 1869 by Johann Friedrich Miescher. The fundamental structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick, although many people believe that Rosalind Franklin also played a large role in their research.
Taken in 1952, this image is the first X-ray picture of DNA, which led to the discovery of its molecular structure by Watson and Crick. Created by Rosalind Franklin using a technique called X-ray crystallography, it revealed the helical shape of the DNA molecule.
Many people believe that American biologist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick discovered DNA in the 1950s. In reality, this is not the case. Rather, DNA was first identified in the late 1860s by Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher.
DNA or Deoxyribonucleic acid is known as a polymer. The structure of DNA was co-discovered in 1953 by English molecular biologist, Francis Harry Compton Crick. He discovered the structure with the help of James D. Watson. He won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1962.
Simple Answer: James Watson and Francis Crick are credited with the first correct double-helix model of DNA structure published in 1953 in the journal Nature. More Complicat … ed: Credit for the research leading to the discovery of the structure of DNA is controversial.
Chargaff's realization that A = T and C = G, combined with some crucially important X-ray crystallography work by English researchers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, contributed to Watson and Crick's derivation of the three-dimensional, double-helical model for the structure of DNA.
James Watson and Francis Crick, 1959 © Crick and Watson, together with Maurice Wilkins, won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of the structure of DNA. This was one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the 20th century. Francis Harry Compton Crick was born on 8 June 1916 near Northampton.
