Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore’s latest romantic comedy was filmed during June and July of 2013 at South Africa’s Lost City at Sun City. Scenes were shot at the resort’s animal park, within the Palace of the Lost City hotel, on the hotel’s pool terrace and in the Crystal Court restaurant.
Nonetheless, the film takes us to South Africa and offers quite some beautiful jungle sceneries. The main filming location of Blended is Sun City, a luxury resort near Rustenburg in the North West Province of South Africa.
As we’ve reported, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore will spend six weeks this summer filming in Sun City, South Africa for a new romantic comedy, Blended, about a couple who, after surviving a dreadful first date, find themselves at a family resort with the kids from their respective previous marriages.
Here's the first trailer: Blended costars Joel McHale, Kevin Nealon and Terry Crews and was filmed mainly in South Africa. Sandler and Barrymore previously costarred in The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates. Both of those movies ended up being hits with audiences and, for the most part, critics as well.
Principal photography for Blended took place in Sun City, South Africa; some scenes were filmed near Lake Lanier, Buford, and Gainesville in Georgia, USA. Warner Bros. co-produced the film with Happy Madison Productions.
Blended marked the third romantic comedy collaboration between Sandler and Barrymore, following The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates. Coraci also previously directed Sandler and Barrymore in The Wedding Singer. It also marked Sandler's first role in a Warner Bros. film.
