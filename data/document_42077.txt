medical definition of radio frequency any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in a range extending from below 3 kilohertz to about 300 gigahertz and that include the frequencies used in radio and television transmission 
radiofrequency rf energy is another name for radio waves it is one form of electromagnetic energy which consists of waves of electric and magnetic energy moving together radiating through space the area where these waves are found is called an electromagnetic field 
radio frequency or rf is the mode of communication that is used by most radio devices from deep space communication networks to cell phones cb radios use rf transceivers some tv remote controls use rf cordless phones use rf a standard radio is the most obvious receiver of radio signals rf is used to send signals to remote control toys wireless routers use rf technology 
gps solutions a radio frequency rf signal refers to a wireless electromagnetic signal used as a form of communication if one is discussing wireless electronics radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with identified radio frequencies that range from 3hz to 300 ghz
as described in the main chapter of this section in paper chromatography there is what is known as the stationary phase which is the absorbent chromatography paper and the mobile phase which is a liquid solvent or mixture of solvents used to carry the sample solutes under analysis along the paper due the fact that the solvent front is always larger from the distance travelled by the solute rf values are always between 0 one extreme where solute remains fixed at its origin and 1 the other extreme where the solute is so soluble that it moves as far as
rf values do not have units since it is a ration of distances rf 0 66 60 % ethanol if is given it is assumed that the mixture is in water hence 60 % ethanol 40 % water rf 0 78 ethanol methanol mixture 1 2 a mixture of 1 part ethanol and 2 parts methanol due the fact that the solvent front is always larger from the distance travelled by the solute rf values are always between 0 one extreme where solute remains fixed at its origin and 1 the other extreme where the solute is so soluble that it moves as far as
a rheumatoid factor rf blood test measures the amount of the rf antibody present in the blood normally antibodies are produced by the immune system to help destroy and eliminate invading bacteria and viruses that can cause disease but the rf antibody can attach to normal body tissue resulting in damage if rf is present the red blood cells clump together this method is often used to confirm the presence of rf nephelometry test this test mixes the blood being tested with antibodies that cause the blood to clump
when an rf current is supplied to an antenna an electromagnetic field is created that then is able to propagate through space many wireless technologies are based on rf field propagation these frequencies make up part of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum ultra low frequency ulf 0 3 hz 
occasionally an elevated level of rf is present in healthy people the amount of rheumatoid factor in blood can be measured in two ways agglutination tests one test method mixes blood with tiny rubber latex beads that are covered with human antibodies if rf is present the latex beads clump together agglutinate if rf is present the red blood cells clump together this method is often used to confirm the presence of rf nephelometry test this test mixes the blood being tested with antibodies that cause the blood to clump
when an rf current is supplied to an antenna itgives rise to an electromagneticfield that propagates through space this field is sometimescalled an rf field in less technical jargon it is a radiowave any rf field has a wavelength that is inverselyproportional to the frequency in the atmosphere or in outerspace if f is the frequency in megahertz and s is the wavelength in meters then s 300 f the frequency of an rf signal is inversely proportional to the wavelengthof the em field to which it corresponds at 9 khz the free spacewavelength is approximately 33 kilometers km or 21 miles mi at the highestradio frequencies the em wavelengths measure approximately one millimeter 1 mm
