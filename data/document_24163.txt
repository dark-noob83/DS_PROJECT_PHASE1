Report Abuse. Grips run from $5-$9 depending on the brand. Usually, the golf shop will not charge a labor cost when you purchase the grips from them. On average per club, it should cost you anywhere from $5-$9 per club...so say $7. So, for your irons (7irons:3-9) should be around $49 Three wedges @ $7 = $21 Driver, 3-wood, and hybrid = $21 Putter....naah...don't do the putter = $0 Total guesstimate: $91.....so maybe up to $100. But if you don't want to do it yourself it will cost $60-$90 for all 13 clubs in your bag (besides your putter). http://vodpod.com/watch/164134-how-to-re...
