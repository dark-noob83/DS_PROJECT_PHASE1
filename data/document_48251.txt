In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communications model, a switch performs the Layer 2 or Data-link layer function. That is, it simply looks at each packet or data unit and determines from a physical address (the MAC address) which device a data unit is intended for and switches it out toward that device. In a wide area packet-switched network such as the Internet, a switch determines from the IP address in each packet which output port to use for the next part of its trip to the intended destination.
Telephone switches are a small component of a large network. The majority of work and expense of the phone system is the wiring outside the central office, or the outside plant. In the middle 20th century, each subscriber telephone number required an individual pair of wires from the switch to the subscriber's phone. Traditional telephone switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use a combination of space-and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B).
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This list of telephone switches is a compilation of telephone company-operated telephone switches used in telephone exchanges or central offices and large enterprise office telephone switching systems.

A telephone exchange is a telecommunications system used in the public switched telephone network or in large enterprises. Traditional telephone switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use a combination of space-and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B).
In a telecommunications network, a switch is a device that channels incoming data from any of multiple input ports to the specific output port that will take the data toward its intended destination. In a wide area packet-switched network such as the Internet, a switch determines from the IP address in each packet which output port to use for the next part of its trip to the
Switching Network in Telecommunications. SWITCHING NETWORK IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS The direction of this paper is to describe a telecommunications switch and show its purpose and multitasking abilities. This paper will use the AT&T 5ESS Switch to give a real world example of a top rated telecommunications switch. The end result will be an understanding of how a switch works and what it can do. Also, it will show why the AT&T 5ESS Switch is #1 in today's telecommunication world.
Switching Hierarchy The telephone system was originally designed as a hierarchy of switches that set up calls across COs, across LATAs, or across long-distance connections. This hierarchy is pictured in Figure T-6. Figure T-6 (see book, page 1227) The hierarchy can be traced back to the first phone systems. Structure of the Telephone Network The public-switched telephone network (PSTN) consists of transmission components, switching components, and facilities for maintenance equipment, billing systems, and other internal components.
For corporate or enterprise use, a private telephone exchange is often referred to as a private branch exchange (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched telephone network. Traditional telephone switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use a combination of space-and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B).
Some telephone exchange buildings in small towns now house only remote or satellite switches, and are homed upon a parent switch, usually several kilometres away. The remote switch is dependent on the parent switch for routing and number plan information. Traditional telephone switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use a combination of space-and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B).
