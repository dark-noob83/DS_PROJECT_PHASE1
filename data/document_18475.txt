Fiber in Beans, Peas and Oats. Peas, oats and dry beans such as kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, navy beans and lima beans contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. All of these foods are high in soluble fiber, which is why they are often encouraged in heart-healthy diets.
Lentils and pinto beans are also rich sources of insoluble fiber, with lentils providing 4.6 grams in each 1/2-cup and pintos supplying 4.7 grams. Insoluble fiber is made up of the lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose from plant cell walls. It adds bulk to stool and can help regulate bowel movements.
A cup of black beans contains 15 grams of fiber, which is 60 percent of the 25 grams you need each day. A cup of lima beans contains 13.2 grams of fiber, and a cup of baked beans has 10.4 grams. In comparison, a cup of raw carrots or a cup of corn each contain 3.6 grams of fiber.
Sometimes called butter beans because of their starchy yet buttery texture, lima beans have a delicate flavor that complements a wide variety of dishes. Although fresh lima beans are often difficult to find, they are worth looking for in the summer and fall when they are in season.
A cup of boiled navy beans has 19.1 grams of fiber, and the same amount of small white beans has 18.6 grams. Choose canned great northern beans instead and you'll still get 12.8 grams of fiber per cup.
In addition to its beneficial effects on the digestive system and the heart, lima beans' soluble fiber helps stabilize blood sugar levels. If you have insulin resistance, hypoglycemia or diabetes, lima beans can really help you balance blood sugar levels while providing steady, slow-burning energy.
Lima beans, like other beans, are rich in dietary fiber. For this reason, lima beans and other beans are useful foods for people with irregular glucose metabolism, such as diabetics and those with hypoglycemia, because beans have a low glycemic index rating.
