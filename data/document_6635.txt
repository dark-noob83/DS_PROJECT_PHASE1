Glomerular Filtration. The first step in renal processing involves the filtration of plasma in the glomerulus. Glomerular filtration is a process of bulk flow: water and low molecular weight substances move from the lumen of the capillary, across the filtration membrane, and into Bowman s space. When the filtration membrane is not functioning properly, it ceases to be an effective barrier. What then occurs is proteinuria, an abnormal accumulation of protein in the urine.
The glomerular filtration barrier function: new concepts. Hausmann R(1), Grepl M, Knecht V, Moeller MJ. Author information: (1)University Hospital of RWTH Aachen University, Institute for Numerical Mathematics, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Each day, the human kidneys filter about 140 l of primary urine from plasma. Although this ultrafiltrate is virtually free of plasma protein, the glomerular filter never clogs under physiological conditions.
As all plasma proteins are negatively charged, the electrical field across the glomerular filtration barrier is predicted to drive plasma proteins from the filter toward the capillary lumen by electrophoresis. SUMMARY: In this review, we examine our novel model for glomerular filtration in more detail. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Each day, the human kidneys filter about 140 l of primary urine from plasma. Although this ultrafiltrate is virtually free of plasma protein, the glomerular filter never clogs under physiological conditions.

The glomerular filtration barrier is composed of glomerular endothelial cells, the glomerulus basement membrane and the podocyte cell layer. The filtration barrier is a target of injury in several systemic and renal diseases, and this often leads to progressive renal disease and kidney failure. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular biology of the glomerulus.

The barrier consists of three layers: the vascular endothelium, the glomerular basement membrane and the slit diaphragm located between podocyte foot processes. The main components of the slit diaphragm are nephrin, the product of NPHS1 gene and podocin, the product of NPHS2 gene. 
The ultrafiltration of plasma in the kidney occurs through the capillary wall of the glomerulus. The filtration barrier is composed of glomerular endothelial cells (GECs), the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and podocyte cells (Fig. 1). The plasma molecules are sieved through the glomerular filter based on their size and (probably) charge [1] . The filtration barrier is a target of injury in several systemic and renal diseases, and this often leads to progressive renal disease and kidney failure. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular biology
1 Filtration barrier —The filtration barrier is composed of the fenestrated endothelium of the glomerular capillaries, the fused basal lamina of the endothelial cells and podocytes, and the filtration slits of the podocytes. As a result, the filtrate leaving the Bowman's capsule is very similar to blood plasma (filtrate or glomerular filtrate is composed of blood plasma minus plasma protein i.e. it contains all the components of blood plasma except the proteins) in composition as it passes into the proximal convoluted tubule.
