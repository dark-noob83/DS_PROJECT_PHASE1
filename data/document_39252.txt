Facility. In any job, the employer affects salaries, and swimming instructors are no exception. For example, swimming instructors working at the YMCA earned an average of $10.50 to $12.60 an hour as of 2011. A swim coach, on the other hand, earns more, making anywhere from $12.55 to $15.05 an hour. At LIFETIME Fitness, the average wage is closer to $13.94 an hour for a swim instructor. Unfortunately, swim instruction isn’t a field known for high wages.

Our baby swimming lessons sizes are limited depending on the venue. It is not possible for you to turn up at a class and pay the baby swimming instructor. Bookings and payments for all swimming lessons for children are dealt with by our Head Office and not via the pool where you will attend the baby swimming classes. We have found that for a parent to commit to a longer period the child will invariably miss some lessons due to illness or other commitments. As the classes are paid for in advance and are non-refundable, courses longer than 5 weeks could lead to the parent paying for unattended baby swimming lessons.
