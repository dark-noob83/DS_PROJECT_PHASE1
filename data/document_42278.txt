Remember to take your resting heart rate over at least 3 days so that you can get an average reading. For example if on day one you record 72 bpm (beats per minute) day two you record 78 bpm and on day three you record 72 bpm, then your average is 74 bpm. Look at recording your resting heart rate for a full minute to make the test as accurate as possible. As you become older, your heart rate decreases, with infants having the highest resting heart rates from 100 to over 160 beats per minute. Young children, under 10, have a resting heart rate range from 70 to 120 beats per minute. Adults generally have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Resting heart rate is an approximate measurement and one of many tools used for testing your health
A normal resting heart rate can range anywhere from 40 to 100 beats per minute. Below is a chart relating resting heart rate and fitness level. As can be seen on this chart, your resting heart rate can vary with your fitness level and with age â€” the fitter you are, generally the lower the resting heart rate. 1 I'm 18 my rate is 79 bpm should i be worried its below average and for a younge person it shouldnt be, mind u i am recovering from a fever and have majour anxiety if that could effect it for my resting heart anyway but i am 11.5 stone. ( 2 from Ren, Oct 2012). 3  I am a fit 27 year old guy.
1 I have a resting heart rate of 42-50 bpm. 2  Because I am large, my doctor ordered me to go to a cardiologist. 3  The cardiologist did an echo and stress test. 4  He also put me on a 21 day holter and event monitor (24 hour EKG pretty much). 1 I'm 18 my rate is 79 bpm should i be worried its below average and for a younge person it shouldnt be, mind u i am recovering from a fever and have majour anxiety if that could effect it for my resting heart anyway but i am 11.5 stone. ( 2 from Ren, Oct 2012). 3  I am a fit 27 year old guy.
1 According to your fitness/pulse rate chart i must be a super fit 20 year old or better because my resting pulse is typically 30-32.In fact I took it twice this morning and it was 25.I'm 63 years old and I do a lot of fitness work but not enough to justify my low heart rate. 1 I'm 18 my rate is 79 bpm should i be worried its below average and for a younge person it shouldnt be, mind u i am recovering from a fever and have majour anxiety if that could effect it for my resting heart anyway but i am 11.5 stone. ( 2 from Ren, Oct 2012). 3  I am a fit 27 year old guy.
(Note: mm Hg means millimeters of mercury). The resting heart rate for the average person is between 70 and 90 beats per minute (bpm). The term tachycardia is applied to a rapid heart rate (over 100 bpm) and the term bradycardia indicates a slow heart rate (less than 50 bpm). Endurance athletes may have a resting heart rate of less than 50 bpm due to having an enlarged heart as a result of their training regime. An endurance athlete will have a lower resting heart rate and a larger stroke volume than a non-athlete. The cardiac output for an endurance athlete is approx. 35 litres while that for the non-athlete is 22 litres.
As an example, a man with a resting heart rate of 72 at an age of 40, will be classed as having an average resting heart rate. A young women at 22 years of age with a resting heart rate of 55, would be classed as (athlete), but not all low resting heart rates are a good indication of an individuals fitness. As you become older, your heart rate decreases, with infants having the highest resting heart rates from 100 to over 160 beats per minute. Young children, under 10, have a resting heart rate range from 70 to 120 beats per minute. Adults generally have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute.

1 My resting heart rate is 66 BPM that's after lying on a bed for 10 mins. 2  I go gym and also do Krav Maga contact combat during which time my heart rate on max goes up to 359 BPM, when my heart rate is at this pace I see things in slow motion, with clarity. 1 I'm 18 my rate is 79 bpm should i be worried its below average and for a younge person it shouldnt be, mind u i am recovering from a fever and have majour anxiety if that could effect it for my resting heart anyway but i am 11.5 stone.

Most adults have a resting heart rate of 60-100 beats per minute (bpm). The fitter you are, the lower your resting heart rate is likely to be. For example, athletes may have a resting heart rate of 40-60 bpm or lower. You should contact your GP if you think your heart rate is continuously above 120 bpm or below 40 bpm, although this could just be normal for you.
