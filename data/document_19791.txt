A blood calcium test is ordered to screen for, diagnose, and monitor a range of conditions relating to the bones, heart, nerves, kidneys, and teeth. The test may also be ordered if a person has symptoms of a parathyroid disorder, malabsorption, or an overactive thyroid.
A calcium blood test measures how much calcium is in your blood. Your health care provider can use this test to help diagnose and watch many conditions. There are two types of calcium blood tests. One is total calcium and the other is ionized calcium. Ionized calcium measures the free calcium in your blood. This is the calcium not bound to other parts of the blood.
Low total calcium (hypocalcemia). The most common cause of low total calcium is: 1  Low blood protein levels, especially a low level of albumin, which can result from liver disease or malnutrition, both of which may result from alcoholism or other illnesses. 2  Low albumin is also very common in people who are acutely ill.
A calcium blood test measures the total amount of calcium in your blood. Results of the blood test can show if you have too much or too little calcium in your blood. Irregular calcium blood levels rarely present any unusual signs or symptoms, so a calcium blood test may be the only way to detect a potential problem.
