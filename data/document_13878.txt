Medical School. Medical school is the next four years of higher education for an OB/GYN. Generally, the first two years of medical school take place in the classroom, and the last two are spent in a clinic or hospital. Courses in medical school include biochemistry, anatomy and pathology. Becoming a certified OB/GYN requires over eight years of higher education, plus a residency at a clinic or hospital. Once you complete all of the education, you must pass two board exams and obtain a state license.
To become an OB/GYN, individuals must earn a bachelor's degree, complete medical school and fulfill a 4-year residency requirement. During residency, students spend at least 50 hours per week attending to patients and learning from doctors.

The specialized residency program allows candidates to learn about preconception, pregnancy, labor and delivery, postpartum and genetics.
