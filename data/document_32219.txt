Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) are lancet-shaped, gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacteria with over 90 known serotypes. Most S. pneumoniae serotypes have been shown to cause disease, but only a minority of serotypes produce the majority of pneumococcal infections.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive diplococcus with a well-formed capsule. This organism is one of the commonest seen in community-acquired pneumonias, accounting for up to 25% of these infections.
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, or pneumococcus, can cause many types of illnesses. Some of these illnesses can be life-threatening. Pneumococcus is the most common cause of bloodstream infections, pneumonia, meningitis, and middle ear infections in young children.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a Gram-positive, alpha-hemolytic, facultative anaerobic member of the genus Streptococcus. A significant human pathogenic bacterium, S. pneumoniae was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century, and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies.
Pneumococcal infections are caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, and range from mild to severe. There are more than 90 different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) bacteria (known as serotypes), some of which cause more serious infection than others.
What is Streptococcus pneumoniae. The type Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a gram-positive, round-oval to lanceolate cocci with a size of 0.5 to 1.25 mm, which as the previous name Diplococcus pneumoniae expresses, are usually mounted in pairs. The adjacent cells are surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule.
