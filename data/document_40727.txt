Introduction. Bacteria are microorganisms that grow everywhere. We can collect and grow them in specially prepared petri dishes. Blood agar or tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep's blood is an excellent medium for supplying bacteria with nutrients and an environment in which we can see them grow. Sterile powdered agar with nutrients can be mixed with water, heated and then poured into empty petri plates or ready-to-use dishes can be purchased. The undigestible agar is a gelatin-like substance with a semi solid surface on which the bacteria can grow while they consume the added nutrients (like sheep's blood). In this type of experiment, bacteria is transferred directly to the prepared petri plate via direct contact. You can test the effectiveness of different soaps by treating different petri dishes with dirty hands before washing and clean hands after washing.
Bacteria must be grown in a medium, which is a liquid or gel designed to support the growth of a bacterial culture. The media must contain everything the bacteria need to survive and can be liquid or solid. Agar is added to hot liquid media to make a gel used for culturing in plates, tubes, slants, and stabs. So, you have your bacteria and you have put it on your medium of choice, but that is not all you need to know. Like you, bacteria require very specific environmental conditions to survive. You wouldn't survive very long in the freezer, sitting in stomach acid, or with no oxygen or food, and neither will your bacteria.
Safety in the lab. Bacteria grow and reproduce more quickly when they are warm than when they are cold. It would be dangerous to incubate (keep and grow) cultures at temperatures close to body temperature (37°C) because doing so might allow the growth of pathogens harmful to health.
Overview. Students grow, observe and compare bacteria and/or fungi in petri dishes, learning that microbes are everywhere and can grow rapidly on sources of food and water. This activity is from The Science of Microbes Teacher's Guide, and is most appropriate for use with students in grades 6-8. 
C. Growth Conditions To grow bacteria in the lab, environmental conditions, as well as nutrients, must beconsidered. Bacteria may be isolated from a variety of environments. For cultivation of bacteriain the lab, the conditions of the environments must be mimicked. 
Smaller numbers can be cultured [cultured: Grown deliberately by humans.] in the lab by growing them on agar plates [agar plate: A petri dish that contains agar gel and usually some nutrients. Agar plates are used to culture (grow) bacteria and fungi in the lab.] . 
For E. coli, however, growth conditions are well known and very simple. E. coli is a chemoautotroph; it can synthesize all it needs to grow from water, simple inorganic chemicals and an energy source. It can extract the energy it needs through the oxidation of organic compounds. Traditional methods for studying the growth and behavior of microbes rely on the ability to grow the organism as a monoculture; a monoculture contains one and only one type of organism. This is not always easy and in some cases, it may not even be possible.
Some bacteria can be beneficial while others can be harmful. Pathogen bacteria are sometimes referred to as germs. Bacteria can be grown (cultured) in petri dishes with nutrient agar. Nutrient agar is a gelatin substance that contains the nutrients necessary for growing bacteria. Individual bacteria are tiny organisms which can only be seen through a powerful microscope. 1of2 7 th LAB “Grow Bacteria” LAB: Growing Bacteria Name _________________________ period ___ Date ____________________ Introduction Bacteria are tiny micro-organisms that can be found almost anywhere. A host of different types of bacteria live within your body.
microorganisms can be grown in laboratory by using suitable medias and optimum condition. MEDIA; it is a artificial arrangement or a material that which allows growth and multiplication of microbe by providing suitable or optimum conditions.generally various types of microbe requires various types of media. bacteria can grow at high sugar concentrations and fungi grow at low sugar con. THUS MOST OF THE MICROBES CAN BE GROWN IN LABORATORY BY PROVIDING SUITABLE OPTIMUM CONDITIONS AND GROWTH MEDIA FOR THEIR GROWTH AND MULTIPLICATION.
The best place to successfully and safely grow bacteria, mold and yeast are in specially shaped glass or plastic dishes called Petri Dishes. Cultures grow best with gentle heat in the range between 70 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures will grow at lower temperatures but at a much slower rate. If your dishes are fogged up inside, storing them in the refrigerator overnight before you add your cultures will usually clear enough of the fogging so you can see. Remember, most bacteria, molds and yeast grow well in a moist environment so if there is some drops of moisture inside the dishes this is fine.
