These AMDRs are 45 percent to 65 percent of calories from carbs, 10 percent to 35 percent from protein and 20 percent to 35 percent of total calories coming from dietary fat. Divide the number of calories eaten from each nutrient by the total number of calories you’ve consumed that day. Using the previous example, divide the 1,000 calories you ate from carbohydrates by 1,965, which is your total daily calorie intake -- equaling about 51 percent of your intake from carbohydrates.
How to calculate the Energy available from foods. To calculate the energy available from a food, multiply the number of grams of carbohydrate, protein, and fat by 4,4, and 9, respectively. Then add the results together. 
Multiply your daily calories by the percentage of carbohydrates you require in your diet. For example, if you require 50 percent carbohydrates from a 2,000-calorie diet, multiply 2,000 by 0.50 to equal 1,000 calories from carbohydrates. 
To calculate the percent of calories from protein and fat, divide 380 by 1,965 – which equals about 19 percent – and divide 585 by 1,965, which is about 30 percent of your calories from fat. The Institute of Medicine provides acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges (AMDR) for carbs, protein and fat. Divide the number of calories eaten from each nutrient by the total number of calories you’ve consumed that day. Using the previous example, divide the 1,000 calories you ate from carbohydrates by 1,965, which is your total daily calorie intake -- equaling about 51 percent of your intake from carbohydrates.
Step 5. Find the total number of calories in the food. This will be the sum of the calories from fat, carbohydrates and protein. A food that has 99 calories from fat, 28 calories from carbohydrates and 32 calories from protein will have a total of 99 + 28 + 32 = 159 calories. Step 6. Calculate the percentage of calories that come from fat, carbohydrates and proteins. This example has 99 calories from fats and 159 total calories, so 99 / 159 x 100 = 62.3 percent of the calories in the food come from fat. 
Step 1. Set targets for fat, protein and carbohydrate intake. A balanced diet will consist of between 20 to 35 percent calories from fat, 10 to 35 percent from protein and 45 to 65 percent from carbohydrates, the Institute of Medicine states. Convert calorie targets into grams of fat, protein and carbohydrates. For a 2,000 calorie diet and the desired 30/20/50 distribution, this amounts to 600 calories from fat, 400 from protein and 1,000 from
Carbohydrates should comprise 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories. Carbohydrates, your body’s main energy source, provide four calories per gram. Knowing this you can calculate the percentage of carbohydrate in any food, if you also know the total grams of carbohydrate in that food and the calories it contains. The total calories a food contains is listed near the top of the nutrition facts label, with grams of carbohydrate several lines underneath. To calculate the percentage of carbohydrate, take the grams of carbohydrate listed and multiply it by four.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs. 
How to Calculate the Carbohydrate Percentage. The total calories a food contains is listed near the top of the nutrition facts label, with grams of carbohydrate several lines underneath. To calculate the percentage of carbohydrate, take the grams of carbohydrate listed and multiply it by four.
Step 6. Calculate percent calories from carbohydrates by dividing calories from carbohydrates by the total calorie intake and multiplying the answer by 100. This would be: 1,180/ 2,300 X 100 = 51 percent calories from carbohydrates.
