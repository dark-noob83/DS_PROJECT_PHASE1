Urinary catheterization is the insertion of a catheter through the urethra into the urinary bladder for withdrawal of urine. Straight catheters are used for intermittent withdrawals, while indwelling (Foley) catheters are inserted and retained in the bladder for continuous drainage of urine into a closed system.
Urinary Catheter Pain. A catheter is a rubber tube which is inserted into the body through the urethra until it reaches the neck of the bladder. These catheters are used to monitor urine, taking into consideration the flow, consistency, and sediment found in the urine.
If you have to have an indwelling catheter in your penis for a few days, it can be slightly uncomfortable at the tip of your penis as the catheter can rub a bit as you move around. It is not painful, but a bit uncomfortable, as the catheter is removed since it cannot be lubricated as it was when inserted. You may find that it stings a bit to urinate for a day or two afterwards whilst your urethra gets used to normality again.

Acute urinary retention or the inability to release urine, even with the catheter in place, can cause excruciating pain. This is a very serious matter which requires emergency medical treatment. If left unaided it could lead to serious bladder, kidney or heart problems that can be fatal.
An indwelling catheter is a catheter that resides in the bladder. It may also be known as a Foley catheter. This type can be useful for both short and long periods of time. A doctor usually inserts an indwelling catheter into the bladder through the urethra.
However, depending on the type of catheter you had installed (a urethral or a suprapubic catheter), you may still experience some catheter pain, especially in the case of an indwelling catheter that is expected to stay in your bladder for awhile â€“ usually from a few days all the way up to forever.

You don't need to be under anaesthetic, but they usually put some anaesthetic gel into your urethra (piss slit) and coat the catheter with more of the same to make it slide in easily and lightly numb your urethra as it passes.
