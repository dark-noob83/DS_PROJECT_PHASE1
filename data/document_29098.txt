Consequently, many experts say, by strength training, young athletes can reduce their risk of injury, not the reverse. “The scientific literature is quite clear that strength training is safe for young people, if it’s properly supervised,” Dr. Faigenbaum says.
In fact, the ideal weight-training program for many children need not involve weights at all. “The body doesn’t know the difference between a weight machine, a medicine ball, an elastic band and your own body weight,” Dr. Faigenbaum said.
But a major new review just published in Pediatrics, together with a growing body of other scientific reports, suggest that, in fact, weight training can be not only safe for young people, it can also be beneficial, even essential.
A. Strength training is a program of exercises that increases muscle strength and endurance. Strength training is not necessarily the same thing as power lifting or even weight lifting. While power lifters use heavy weights to build large muscles, people who strength train may use lighter weights or resistance and multiple repetitions. You can do strength training with weight machines or free weights.
Your muscles need at least 48 hours to recover between strength training sessions. These seven tips can keep your strength training safe and effective. 1  Warm up and cool down for five to 10 minutes. 2  Walking is a fine way to warm up; stretching is an excellent way to cool down. 3  Focus on form, not weight. 4  Align your body correctly and move smoothly through each exercise.
I think the emphasis should be on strength training and children and not the use of weights. Strength training is very beneficial for youth and children. Body weight exercises are much safer and can produce the same results with less danger: push ups and pull ups for example.
