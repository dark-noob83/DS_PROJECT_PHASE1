From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Sialolithiasis (also termed salivary calculi, or salivary stones), is a condition where a calcified mass or sialolith forms within a salivary gland, usually in the duct of the submandibular gland (also termed  Wharton's duct ). About 85% of stones occur in the submandibular gland, and between 5-10% occur in the parotid gland. In about 0-5% of cases, the sublingual gland or a minor salivary gland is affected. When minor glands are rarely involved, caliculi are more likely in the minor glands of the buccal mucosa and the maxillary labial mucosa.
