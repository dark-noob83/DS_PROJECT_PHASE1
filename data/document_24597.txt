(Answer #1). The skeletal system consists of a number of different types of tissue. The most obvious ones are the bones themselves, the dense and rigid structures that support the body and the connective tissues that connect those structures.
Another major role of the skeletal system is to provide mobility. Tendons, bones, joints, ligaments and muscles work in concert to produce various movements. The skeleton is composed of fibrous and mineralized connective tissues that give it firmness and flexibility. It consists of bone, cartilage, tendons, joints, and ligaments. Bones are a major component of the skeletal system. Bones that comprise the human skeleton are divided into two groups.
Bone and Cartilage are two types of connective tissue in the skeletal system. There is also dense fibrous tissue (in periosteum and joint capsules mainly) Ligaments and cartil â€¦ age are also
1 Bones, cartilage, and ligaments make up the skeletal system. 2  The skeleton supports the body against the pull of gravity. 3  The skeleton provides a framework that supports and protects the soft organs of the body. 4  Bones work together with muscles to move the body. 5  Blood cells are mostly made inside the bone marrow.
The skeletal system includes all of the bones and joints in the body. Each bone is a complex living organ that is made up of many cells, protein fibers, and minerals. The skeleton acts as a scaffold by providing support and protection for the soft tissues that make up the rest of the body.
The skeletal system supports and protects the body while giving it shape and form. This system is composed of connective tissues including bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. Nutrients are provided to this system through blood vessels that are contained within canals in bone. The skeletal system stores minerals, fats, and produces blood cells.
