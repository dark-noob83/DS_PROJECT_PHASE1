A zero-energy building, also known as a zero net energy (ZNE) building, net-zero energy building (NZEB), or net zero building, is a building with zero net energy consumption, meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site.
Document Actions. The net energy yield refers to the gross energy produced by the biomass, minus the energy provided from the fossil fuels used in the production and processing of the biomass. It is usually expressed on a per unit basis. 1  Log in.
Net Energy Gain (NEG) is a concept used in energy economics that refers to the difference between the energy expended to harvest an energy source and the amount of energy gained from that harvest.
Best Answer: Net Energy Gain (NEG) is a concept used in energy economics that refers to the difference between the energy expended to harvest an energy source and the amount of energy gained from that harvest.
5. Energy quality matters. Net energy is only one attribute of an energy system that determines it usefulness to society. The usefulness of an energy system is determined by a complex combination of physical, technical, economic, and social attributes.
Part of the Data centers glossary: A net-zero energy (NZE) building is one that relies on renewable sources to produce as much energy as it uses, usually as measured over the course of a year. Net-zero energy buildings start with energy-conscious design.
