hypocenter. The hypocenter is the point within the earth where an earthquake rupture starts. The epicenter is the point directly above it at the surface of the Earth. Also commonly termed the focus. See also epicenter. Epicenter & Hypocenter.
Epicenter of an earthquake The point where the rocks actually break is the earthquake focus. Large subduction zone earthquakes can break along a fault for hundreds of kilometer. The epicenter of these earthquakes is directly above where the earthquake actually started along the fault line.
The tectonic activity lies much below !! The epicentre is the point on the earth's surface directly above the earthquake's focus or hypocentre (the point within the earth where the fault rupture or movement actually occurs). As such, the seismic waves produced by an earthquake radiate away from this point.
Epicenter (epi being Greek for above). Point directly above the hypocenter. The locations of earthquakes are frequently identified by the geographic location of their epicenter. The point on earths surface that is directly above the focus, the point where an earthquake or underground explosion originates.
As such the epicentre is the point on the earth's surface directly above the earthquake's focus or hypocentre (the point within the earth where the fault rupture or movement actually occurs).
The epicenter is the point on the surface directly above the focus, used for location purposes. When an epicenter slips, the fault is the point of slippage where all energy is released to form the earthquake. The focus is the point on the surface
The hypocenter is the point within the earth where an earthquake rupture starts. The epicenter is the point directly above it at the surface of the Earth. Also commonly termed the focus. See also epicenter.
