Johnstoneâ€™s Alkali Resisting Primer is a solvent based primer and sealer for interior and exterior use on, new or bare plaster, concrete, cement, render, or wood and metal surfaces. Used as a primer on unpainted surfaces, or sealer on powdery substrates it provides exceptional resistance to alkali attack.
If this is not possible, you should apply a quality, alkali-resistant sealer, or latex primer, followed by a top-quality 100% acrylic latex exterior paint. The acrylic binder in these paints resists alkali attack. Note: Images provided by The Rohm & Hass Paint Quality Institute.
