Parts will cost you about $30 for brakes (per axle) and $60 per rotor but it depends on the type of car you have and if you have drum brakes in the rear or not.

If you wish to replace the discs on the front an average price for a set of brake pads is approximately $60.00 - $111.00 but depending on the make and model of your car it could cost a lot more than that.

Keep in mind, this is the repair you’ll face most of the time. If you’re going to a local repair facility you can expect to pay somewhere in the range of $150 to $200 for replacement of the pads and rotors, on average. Nearly half of this cost is in parts, so you may want to consider that if you’re a do-it-yourselfer. In a standard disc-brake repair (which is the front brake style for nearly 100% of all cars on the road today) you’ll be replacing only the brake pads and the rotors. There was a time, not so long ago, when repair facilities would simply machine the rotors instead of replacing them.
