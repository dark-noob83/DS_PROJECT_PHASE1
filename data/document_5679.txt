For example, if you're measuring velocity in miles per hour (mph) and time in seconds, your units will be miles/(hours*seconds). If you're using meters per second and seconds, it will be meters/(seconds^2). Note that velocity is a vector quantity (it has a direction associated with it) and so is acceleration.
A: The basic equation for solving this is: d = vt + (1/2)at2. where d is distance traveled in a certain amount of time (t), v is starting velocity, a is acceleration (must be constant), and t is time. This gives you the distance traveled during a certain amount of time. If you know any 3 of those things, you can plug them in to solve for the 4th.
Force is related to acceleration because F= mass X acceleration.   Velocity is speed with a direction included. For example, 35 mph is a speed, but 35mph north is a v â€¦ elocity.   Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes. Say that over the course of 10 seconds, a car goes from zero to 100 meters per second. The car increases its velocity 10 meters per second every second.
Like this: x is displacement, t is time, v is velocity, a is acceleration: x(t) v(t) = x'(t) = x'(t) (Where x'(t) denotes dx/dt) a(t) = v'(t) = x''(t) So in simple words, velocity is how fast the location of an object changes over time, and acceleration is how fast the velocity of an object changes over time.
