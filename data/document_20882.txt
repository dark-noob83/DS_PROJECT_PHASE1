TAENIA SAGINATA. T. saginata, the most common tapeworm in humans, is found wherever raw or undercooked beef is eaten, especially in Africa and the Arab world. In certain cultures where raw beef is considered a delicacy, the number of tapeworms harbored may be considered a status symbol. Humans are the definitive host of T. saginata, and infection occurs after ingestion of beef containing viable larvae. The larvae are released with digestion and mature in the upper small intestine. Adult worms may inhabit the GI tract for as long as 25 years.
1 Larval infection is called cysticercosis (Taenia solium, T. saginata, T. asiatica, T. crassiceps, T. ovis, T. taeniaeformis, and T. hydatigena) or coenurosis (T. multiceps, T. serialis, T. brauni). 2  Disease that is caused by adult worms is called taenosis. (Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, Taenia asiatica) and associated diseases. Life cycles of all taenids are very similar. T. solium is distinguished by its ability to use humans not only as definitive hosts but also as intermediate hosts. Because of this, the species is most important within this group of parasites.
ShareCompartir. Cysticercosis is a parasitic tissue infection caused by larval cysts of the tapeworm Taenia solium. These larval cysts infect brain, muscle, or other tissue, and are a major cause of adult onset seizures in most low-income countries. Both the tapeworm infection, also known as taeniasis, and cysticercosis occur globally. The highest rates of infection are found in areas of Latin America, Asia, and Africa that have poor sanitation and free-ranging pigs that have access to human feces.
The cestodes (tapeworms) Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) and T. solium (pork tapeworm). Taenia solium eggs can also cause cysticercosis. The eggs contained in the gravid proglottids are released after the proglottids are passed with the feces. T. saginata may produce up to 100,000 and T. solium may produce 50,000 eggs per proglottid respectively. Life cycle image and information courtesy of DPDx.
1 Disease that is caused by adult worms is called taenosis. 2  There are three species of taenids that use humans as definitive hosts: Taenia solium, T. saginata, an T. asiatica. 3  In addition, Taenia solium can also use humans as intermediate hosts causing cysticercosis. 4  This ability makes this parasite especially important. (Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, Taenia asiatica) and associated diseases. Life cycles of all taenids are very similar. T. solium is distinguished by its ability to use humans not only as definitive hosts but also as intermediate hosts. Because of this, the species is most important within this group of parasites.
Taenia solium is the causative agent of taeniosis and cysticercosis. Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) is 3-4m long and is thus smaller than Taenia saginata. The scolex has a rostellum armed with two rows of hooks in addition to the four suckers. TaeniasisCysticercosis. Taeniasis. Cysticercosis. Taenia solium in the intestine causes no or only mild symptoms Symptoms of cysticercosis depend on the befall of organs (e.g. headache, feeling of sickness, vomiting, rheumatic discomfort). Taenia solium in the intestine causes no or only mild symptoms.

People do not get cysticercosis by eating undercooked pork. Eating undercooked pork can result in intestinal tapeworm if the pork contains larval cysts. Pigs become infected by eating tapeworm eggs in the feces of a human infected with a tapeworm. Both the tapeworm infection, also known as taeniasis, and cysticercosis occur globally. The highest rates of infection are found in areas of Latin America, Asia, and Africa that have poor sanitation and free-ranging pigs that have access to human feces.
Life Cycle: Taeniasis is the infection of humans with the adult tapeworm of Taenia saginata or Taenia solium. Humans are the only definitive hosts for T. saginata and T. solium. Eggs or gravid proglottids are passed with feces; the eggs can survive for days to months in the environment. The eggs contained in the gravid proglottids are released after the proglottids are passed with the feces. T. saginata may produce up to 100,000 and T. solium may produce 50,000 eggs per proglottid respectively. Life cycle image and information courtesy of DPDx.
