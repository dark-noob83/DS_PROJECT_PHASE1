I'm starting a new job in 3 weeks. Yay!! I did my tracking and after all bills/necessities are paid I have $1200 left over. I don't know where that money is going-but it seems like something ALWAYS comes up-car costs, birthdays, weddings, glasses, etc.
Best Answer: as a general rule after bills and rent you should be aiming to have roughly 40-50% of your net pay (after tax and NI has been taken off) left for everything else. This is changing though as the cost of houses etc has changed and food etc is going up.

I probably spend about 50 pct of what I do on my mortgage on my bills, so about $350 and then theres Food and the Car (Insurance and Gas) to pay for...

After all your bills are paid, how much money do you have at the end of the month, either for savings? By all bills, I am including all bills to creditors, rent, mortages, groceries, gas, cell phone, loans, car insurance, cable, internet, entertainment/recreation etc etc.
The median household savings rate in America is zero, but after all the monthly bills are paid, a median-income household should have $668 left over each month, according to a new Interest.com analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
