Let the sausages cook. Cover the simmering water with a lid. If the sausages were previously cooked (as is the case with most hot dogs), you'll only need to cook them until they're hot all the way through (about 10 minutes). If they weren't pre-cooked, you may need to cook them for up to 30 minutes before taking them out.
Place the sausages into boiling water. To prevent hot splashes, lower the sausages in one-by-one with a set of tongs or another long utensil. Don't drop them in. When all the sausages are in the water, turn the heat down so that the boiling reduces to a gentle simmer.
Step 3. Cover the pan and cook the sausages for about 20 minutes, turning them periodically with a pair of tongs. Keep the water to a low boil, since trying to cook the sausages quickly in a high boil will make them split open.
Fresh Sausage. To parboil, place sausage links in a heavy skillet. Add water to cover sausage and par-boil until sausage is grey throughout (about 10 to 15 minutes.) The sausage then can be fried until nicely browned. Parboiled sausage also may be grilled slowly over coals, turning frequently until grey-brown throughout.
Get a deep skillet and add 1 pound of sausage. Don't prick the sausage or all of the juices will come out. Add 1/2 cup of water, and turn on the stove to cook for 15 to 20 minutes on medium heat until the sausage is almost done. Remove the sausage from the skillet and drain off any liquid in the pan.
