A bog turtle, was the opposite of the wood turtle, and traveled only 56 feet (17 m) in one day. It took this same bog turtle two weeks to traverse a 600 foot wide (200 m) meadow. The average turtle swims at a pace of 10 to 12 mph (4 to 5 m/s) and walks at 3 to 4 mph (1 to 2 m/s). Newborn hatchling turtles swim about 25 miles (40 km) in 30 hours on average. Female turtles usually swim at a faster pace than that of their babies or the male turtle in order to protect their young from predators. 
Most rabbits including the dwarf rabbit can run in a wide range of  speed. They average 25 to 45 miles per hour depending on breed and  health of the animal. What is the rabbits speed per hour? They are rambunctious with short burst of speed by bounding at 50-60 km /hr .Jack rabbits bound about 35 miles per hour up to a hundred yards if raced with automobile.
70/5 = 14. Her Average Speed for the whole trip was 14 mph. The Average Speed in this problem is 14 mph, which is different from the “Average of the Speeds.” If we had just averaged the two speeds (10mph and 20mph), we would have gotten 15mph. Think of Average Speed as a weighted average
So in the case of this problem we have an average velocity of $\,0\,\,mph$ and an average speed of ${{120miles + 120miles} \over {{{120miles} \over {40mph}} + {{120miles} \over {60mph}}}}\,\,\,mph$ which equals $\,48\,\,mph$ . 60 miles per hour is 1 minute per mile, while 40 miles per hour is 1.5 minutes per mile. Since we travel the same number of miles at each speed, we can now take the mean of these two figures. That's 1.25 minutes per mile on average. For 240 miles total, 240miles*1.25minutes/mile = 300 minutes = 5 hours.
Average Speed = 2ab/(a+b) = 2*30*60/(30 + 60) = 40 mph. Answer (B). Question 3: Myra drove at an average speed of 30 miles per hour for the first 30 miles of a trip, at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for the next 30 miles and at a average speed of 90 miles/hr for the remaining 30 miles of the trip.
Most rabbits including the dwarf rabbit can run in a wide range of  speed. They average 25 to 45 miles per hour depending on breed and  health of the animal. Average speed is called average speed because it represents an average speed of something over a distance. Avarage could be thought of as a way to even out speed over a dist … ance to see how fast an object was moving across that distance if it moved at a constant speed.
Unlike the jackrabbit, they seek protection in hiding rather than in swift flight. They can achieve speeds up to 35 mph. Therefore if you do not have a specific rabbit to measure the speed for it will be a guess between 35 to 45 mph or 15 to 20 m/s. All the sources seemed to be accurate except the text book source. This is a result of lack of common sense
It [Snowshoe Hare] has a top speed 27-30 mph., can jump 10 ft in one hop, is a good swimmer and will jump in the water to make an escape.. 12–13 m/s. Doherty, James G. Natural History. March 1974. as cited in Speed of Animals. Therefore if you do not have a specific rabbit to measure the speed for it will be a guess between 35 to 45 mph or 15 to 20 m/s. All the sources seemed to be accurate except the text book source.
Average speed is measured in units of distance per time. Common units include miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), meters per second (m/s), or feet per second (ft/s). As for your brand-new red sports car, your friend was exactly right in his calculation of the average speed. He used the distance traveled by the car (45 miles) divided by elapsed time (1.25 hours).
Rabbits can reach top speed of 80 mph. In the desert, rabbits have been known to outrun helicopters (talking relatively; air to floor). Rabbits are significantly underrated in … regards to speed and size. What is the rabbits speed per hour? They are rambunctious with short burst of speed by bounding at 50-60 km /hr .Jack rabbits bound about 35 miles per hour up to a hundred yards if raced with automobile.
