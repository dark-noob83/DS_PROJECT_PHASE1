You are a yogi or a yogini if you practice yoga for health, beauty, strength, relaxation, or healing. You are a yogi or yogini if you practice yoga for inner peace, happiness and enlightenment. You are a yogi or yogini if you are enlightened. Enlightenment means to live in God, in the light, in a cosmic consciousness.
Yoga means union; the union of self and God. Yoga is the practice of merging with God that is done through mental, spiritual and physical practices. Yogi and yogini are related terms to describe a person who is a master practitioner of yogic discipline. Yogi is the male form and yogini is the female form.
Female Yogini. Yogini is a more expansive word than yogi and refers primarily to a female master practitioner of yoga. However, the word yogini encompasses much more than simply a female teach
According to the Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika text, a yogini is a woman initiate who can preserve her own genital ejaculate (rajas) and contain the male semen (bindu) by means of the practice of the vajroli-mudra, also practiced in reverse by advanced yogis.
A Yogini is the sacred feminine force made incarnate: the goddesses of mythology (Lakshmi, Parvati, Durga, Kali) as well as the ordinary human woman who is enlightened, both having exuberant passion, spiritual powers and deep insight, capable of giving birth to saints, peacemakers, and Yogis.
Numerous great yoginis and female mystics are mentioned in the Vedas; in fact, many of the vedic rishis were yoginis, rishikas. In classical Sanskrit literature, Yogini is the name of a class of female tantric sorceresses in the train of Durga, sometimes enumerated as 60, 64 or 65 (Harivaṃśa, Kathāsaritsāgara). Female power here denotes balance.
