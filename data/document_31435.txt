1 The typical gas furnace cost is $3,000 to $6,000 installed, although higher efficiency models and/or complex installations could push the cost up to $7,500 to $10,000 or more. 2  Oil furnace cost is roughly $2,500 to $5,000 installed, but similar to gas furnace prices, itâ€™s not unheard of to spend $10,000+.
The average cost to install a new furnace is $3,602. As always, the price largely depends on the efficiency and size of your furnace, as well as its heat source. We have seen homeowners spend as little as $1,500 on a new furnace or as much as $7,000. However, know that most homeowners pay between $3,200 and $4,420.
1 Floor furnaces cost $1,500 to $2,000 installed. 2  The average electric furnace cost is $1,750 to $3,500 installed. 3  The typical gas furnace cost is $3,000 to $6,000 installed, although higher efficiency models and/or complex installations could push the cost up to $7,500 to $10,000 or more.
Furnace Average Costs. The actual cost of a new furnace is subject to vary based on your location, the product selected, the complexity of the installation (i.e. whether the existing ductwork and exhaust flue also need to be upgraded), and other factors. 1  A wall furnace averages $750 to $1,500 installed.
1 Replacing an oil-fired furnace in a central heating system starts typically costs $2,000-$5,000 for a basic installation, but can reach $6,000-$10,000 or more for complex installations.
1 Replacing an old furnace with a high-efficiency new one can also require installing a chimney liner for about $300 -$700 for a gas furnace or $700 -$1,800 for a fuel oil model. 2  If needed, make sure this is included in all estimates.
1 Replacing a gas floor furnace (the heat rises from a grill flush with the floor) typically costs about $900-$2,500 for just the unit, depending on size, BTUs and features like the type of thermostat; installation brings the total cost to $2,000-$4,500 or more.
