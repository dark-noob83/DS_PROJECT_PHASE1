Just as evaporation and precipitation are processes that move water through the water cycle, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rock-forming processes move rocks through the rock cycle. In this investigation, you ll examine a detailed example of a rock traveling
The three types of rocks igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic are all subject to processes that change one rock type into another. The images below show several types of rocks undergoing these processes.
Confidence votes 83.4K. A diamond is a crystalline mineral form of the element carbon. Igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary are descriptive terms used to classify types of rocks, not minerals such as diamond. Diamond is accepted as a valid mineral by the International Mineralogy Association.
However, the diamond itself is a metamorphic  mineral, as it forms under heat and pressure from solid-state  processes. It forms independently of the igneous rock in which it  is found, qualifying it as a type of xenocryst. + 30 others found this useful.
Gemstones associated with metamorphic rock include beryl, jade, lapis lazuli, turquoise, spinel, ruby, sapphire and zircon. Rocks and minerals are in a constant state of change, which is referred to as the rock cycle. Igneous rock can change into sedimentary or metamorphic rock.
Diamonds are found in igneous rock which is brought to the surface of the earth by volcanic eruptions bringing magma to the surface. Diamond itself is strictly an allotrope of the element carbon, a mineral, one form of crystal that can be created from carbon.
