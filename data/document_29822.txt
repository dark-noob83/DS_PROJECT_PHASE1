In infants under 3 months of age, any fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher should be reported to a doctor. For babies older than 3 months, the benchmark is 102 degrees. Newborns who have a rectal temperature of less than 97 degrees should also be seen by a doctor. Normal temperature for a baby actually depends on what method you use to measure it. The 98.6 benchmark is generally for temperatures taken orally, but you can't measure temperature this way in a baby. The two most common ways to measure temperature in babies is rectally or in the ear.
1 If your baby is under 3 months old and has a temperature of 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) or higher, call the doctor immediately. 2  A baby this young needs to be checked for serious infection or disease. 3  If your baby is 3 months old or older, the most important thing is how he looks and acts. 
An infant up to 3 months old has a normal body temperature range of 97 to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, 36 to 38 degrees Celsius, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Temperatures both higher and lower than this range are a cause for concern. In infants from birth to 3 months old, an abnormal temperature--either too low or too high--can be a sign of something serious. A baby with a low body temperature may have a serious infection, according to MedlinePlus.com, and an infant with a fever requires an immediate call to the doctor.
Report Abuse. Normal body temperature is around 37°C or 98.6°F, although babies tend to be slightly hotter than older children. At this age, a fever is considered any temperature above 37.2°C or 98.9°F, measured under the arm. Report Abuse. That is high
A higher-than-normal body temperature is called a fever. A fever is usually a sign that the body is waging a war against infection. Taking your baby's temperature can confirm your suspicions and help you and your child's doctor figure out the best way to get your baby back on the road to health. Most doctors – and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) — agree that a normal body temperature for a healthy baby is between 97 and 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit. If your baby's rectal temperature is 100.4 degrees or higher, he has a fever
A normal temperature is about 98.6°F (37°C) when taken orally (in your child’s mouth) and 99.6°F (37.5°C) when taken rectally (in your child’s bottom). Many doctors define a fever as an oral temperature above 99.5°F (37.5°C) or a rectal temperature above 100.4°F (38°C). 
A baby’s temperature is no different. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, normal body temperature for a health baby ranges between 97 degrees and 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees to 38 degrees Celsius). A rectal temperature reading above this range indicates a fever
In terms of a typical range for baby, as outlined by the AAP, anywhere between 97.5° F (36.4° C) and 99.5° F (37.5° C) is totally normal. A temperature reading of 100.4° F (38° C) is considered to be the beginning of a fever and should typically be accompanied by other symptoms.
