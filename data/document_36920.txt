Vegetable and fruit garden crops can be an open invitation to hungry animals of all kinds, especially during harsh environmental conditions such as drought or cold weather. Animals hone in on seedlings, tender young foliage, leaf crops and vegetable plants harvested for their fruits. Other home garden crops such as berries and stone fruits also attract wildlife. Preventing animals' access to garden plants is the only certain method to control damage from most kinds of wildlife.
Mice, Rats and Other Rodents. Animals with a pair of sharp upper and lower gnawing teeth can lay waste to garden crops. Those animals include mice, rats, voles, woodchucks, squirrels and pocket gophers. Squirrels harvest nuts, seeds and fruits right from the plants.
Birds that damage garden crops include blackbirds, starlings, crows, thrashers, mockingbirds, sparrows, jays, robins and magpies. They often feed on young seedlings, including newly germinated seedlings. Protect seedlings with row covers or bird netting held away from the plants by wooden or pipe supports.
