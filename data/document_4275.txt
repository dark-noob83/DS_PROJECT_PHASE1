Reabsorption... occurs when the filtrate passes from the peritubular capillaries back to the nephron tubules. occurs when blood fluids leave the afferent arteriole and enter the Bowman’s capsule. occurs when blood fluids leave the glomerulus and enter the Bowman’s capsule. occurs when the filtrate passes from the nephron tubules back to the efferent arteriole. occurs when the filtrate passes from the nephron tubules back to the peritubular capillaries. 4.
Reabsorption in a nephron occurs in the Loop of Henle Reabsorption has been addressed to substances which are absorbed back from the nerphrone back in to the blood(capillaries …). On other hand Secretion is the absorption of substances from blood.
Best Answer: Secretion: It occurs in the distal convoluted tubule. It gets rid of the remaining waste from the capillaries. Movement is from the capillaries into the nephron. This is where large molecules are removed from the blood, such as drugs. In filtration smaller molecules are just removed. This is the last place that you have movement of product

Two major parts of the nephron are the renal corpuscle and the renal tubule. The corpuscle has the glomerulus (see illustration). Cleansing of the blood occurs in this part of the nephron. The glomerulus, which is a tuft of very small blood vessels, has tiny holes that act as a filter.
