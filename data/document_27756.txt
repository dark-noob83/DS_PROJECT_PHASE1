1 Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) : ALPS is characterized by lymphoproliferative disorder, autoimmune cytopenias, and a susceptibility to malignancy. 2  The pathogenesis involves defective FAS-induced apoptosis, which, in turn, leads to dysregulation of lymphocyte homeostasis.

Lymphoproliferative disorders: Malignant diseases of the lymphoid cells and of cells from the reticuloendothelial system that usually occur in people with compromised immune systems, such as patients with AIDS and recent transplant patients.
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). ALPS is characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of lymphocytes (lymphoproliferation).
