Each kidney is broadly divided into an external part called as renal cortex and an internal part termed as medulla. The main function of a renal cortex is to filter blood and remove unwanted substances out of the body. This task is accomplished with the help of nephrons and glomeruli that are housed in the renal cortex. Renal cortex is the external, outermost part of kidney and the filtration process is termed so, as this filtration can only be completed when the blood coming into the kidney through the renal artery is already carrying high pressure.
The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections, known as the renal pyramids. Blood enters into the kidney via the renal artery, which then splits up to form the arcuate arterioles. The arcuate arterioles each in turn branch into interlobar arterioles, which finally reach the glomeruli. The renal medulla only receives about 10% of all the blood flowing through the kidneys. You could say that the function of the renal medulla, or the kidney in general, is maintaining homeostasis of a large number of solutes and water.
The renal medulla is a term used for the innermost portion of the kidney. It is divided into several sections known as renal pyramids because of their cone-like appearance. Inside are structures known as nephrons, and they have the responsibility of maintaining the balance of water and salt within the blood. Decreased kidney function may occur if the renal medulla is damaged, requiring immediate medical attention. A diagram of a nephron, located inside the renal medulla. High blood pressure is the most common symptom of a damaged renal medulla. A diagram of a kidney, including the renal medulla in pink. Long-term use of narcotics may damage the renal medulla
The renal artery provides the blood supply to the kidney, then branches into what are known as arcuate arterioles. These blood vessels are located at the border of the renal medulla and are responsible for renal, or kidney, circulation. Decreased kidney function may occur if the renal medulla is damaged, requiring immediate medical attention. A diagram of a nephron, located inside the renal medulla.

The renal cortex is the kidney’s external section and comprise of medulla pyramids that filters around 43 gallons of water every day via nephrons which are small structures present in millions inside these pyramids. Every group of 10000 nephrons constitute small vessel clusters termed as glomerulus capillaries. Renal cortex is the external, outermost part of kidney and the filtration process is termed so, as this filtration can only be completed when the blood coming into the kidney through the renal artery is already carrying high pressure.
Most of this liquid, which we call “ultra-filtrate” is re-absorbed in the medulla and put back into the blood. Here is a diagram of the kidney showing a nephron broken up into six parts. Each part has a specific function. You can click on a letter to find out what that part does. Here is a diagram of a nephron put back together again. You can click on a green or red area to find out what happens there.
The renal medulla is hypertonic to the filtrate in the nephron and aids in the reabsorption of water. Blood is filtered in the glomerulus by solute size. Ions such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and calcium are easily filtered, as is glucose. The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections, known as the renal pyramids.
The renal medulla is the innermost part of the kidney. The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections, known as the renal pyramids. Blood enters into the kidney via the renal artery, which then splits up to form the interlobar arteries
Best Answer: There are two main parts of the kidney. The renal medulla and the renal cortex. The renal medulla is the innermost part of the kidney. The whole thing in general doesn't have one specific function. However, it HOUSES structures that DO have functions. The renal medulla only receives about 10% of all the blood flowing through the kidneys. You could say that the function of the renal medulla, or the kidney in general, is maintaining homeostasis of a large number of solutes and water.
