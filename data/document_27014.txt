Thanks to the film Finding Nemo, the popularity of Clownfish has rocketed. Nemo is actually an Amphiprion ocellaris. There are several other Clownfish species that can look similar to the A. ocellaris. All need specialist care and a proper marine set up. The fish tank shown in the film would in fact be impossible to keep alive for any period of time.
The clown fish (also known as the anemonefish) is a small species of fish that is found around tropical coral reefs. The most commonly known species of clown fish is orange with white markings but clown fish can be found in many different colours and can also differ in shape.
There are 28 species of clown fish. They are orange, yellow, maroon and many other colors. The most common clown fish-and the one that looks most like Nemo-is the percula clown fish which is bright orange with white stripes. Clown fish are between two and five inches long.
Anemones are fish-eating animals that look like underwater flowers and have hundreds of poisonous tentacles. Clown fish find most of their food by mooching off the anemone. Clown fish wait until the anemone paralyzes and eats a fish, then helps itself to the bits which the anemone doesn't eat.
The easiest species to raise to the post-larval stage are tomato anemonefish (Amphiprion frenatus), percula (A. percula) and ocellaris clownfish (A. ocellaris). After metamorphosis is completed, and the young fish look like miniatures of the adults, they enter what is referred to as post-larval stage.
Of the nearly 30 species of clownfish, there are two types commonly referred to as the orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula and A. ocellaris). The percula clownfish is distinguished by its vivid orange color with distinctive white bands outlined in black.
