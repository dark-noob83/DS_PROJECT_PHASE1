The size of sediment is defined by the size of the particles that make up the sediment. The largest sediment size is called a boulder. Boulders have a diameter that is larger than 256 millimeters (about 10 inches). Cobbles are the next largest sediment, they are 64 - 256 mm in diameter (about 3-
The largest particle still considered as sediment is ----------------------------; the smallest is ---------------------------------. a. cobble, silt. b. cobble, sand. c. boulder, sand. d. boulder, clay. 17. The study and description of layered sedimentary deposits is called: a. sedimentology. b. seismic profiling.
If the sediment is buried deeply, it becomes compacted and cemented, forming sedimentary rock. Clastic sedimentary rocks may have particles ranging in size from microscopic clay to huge boulders. Their names are based on their clast or grain size. The smallest grains are called clay, then silt, then sand. Grains larger that 2 millimeters are called pebbles. Shale is a rock made mostly of clay, siltstone is made up of silt-sized grains, sandstone is made of sand-sized clasts, and conglomerate is made of pebbles surrounded by a matrix of sand or mud.

The next sizes of sediments are very small, granules are 2-4 mm, sand 1/16-2mm, silt 1/256-1/16 mm, and the smallest sediment size is clay which is less than 1/256 of a millimeter in diameter. Sedimentary rocks are formed in three ways from these different sized sediments.
· detrital sediment classification (Wentworth's particle size) is based on the size of the sedimentary particle---the largest size called a boulder, the smallest called clay. · click here to see the sedimentary particle sizes. · Kinds of clastic rocks---based primarily on sediment (particle) size.
