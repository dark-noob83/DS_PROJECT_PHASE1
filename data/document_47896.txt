Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) is the most common congenital (birth) heart defect, present in up to 1 in 50 people in the United States population. ‘Normal’ aortic valves have three leaflets and three aortic sinuses (aortic root bulges joined to the aortic valve leaflets).
Family Screening for Bicuspid Aortic Valve. The most common congenital heart disorder, bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) affects approximately one to two percent of people. Those with the condition experience impacts to both the aortic valve (which controls the flow of blood into the aorta) and the thoracic aorta (the major vessel that sends blood throughout the body).
Bicuspid, or bicommissural, aortic valve (BAV) describes an aortic valve with 2 rather than 3 leaflets (Cripe et al., 2004). In 1 to 2% of the population a bicuspid aortic valve is present. Bicuspid aortic valve is frequently an antecedent to aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency.
Abstract. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect, affecting 1-2% of the population. It is generally diagnosed late in adulthood when deterioration of the abnormal leaflet becomes clinically evident.
Bicuspid aortic valve is the commonest congenital cardiac abnormality in the general population. This paper article will discuss our current knowledge of the anatomy, pathophysiology, genetics, and clinical aspects of bicuspid aortic valve disease.
Introduction. The population frequency of a bicuspid aortic valve is ≈0.9% to 1.36%, 1–3 with a 2:1 male:female ratio. It is likely that the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve has a genetic basis, with the pattern of transmission in some families suggesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.
Bicuspid aortic valve. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac malformation with a prevalence of 1% and occurs when the aortic valve has only two cusps instead of the normal three.
