How long does it take for greens to recover from aeration? I am playing a very nice course this Friday, one of the best in the state. Also note, with 10 days between the aeration and your game, top dressing should be completely worked in. I would anticipate that if the greens were healthy before the aeration, they will be quite good when you play.
Answer: Most golf courses, at least once a year, aerify their greens. Aerification, or aeration, is the process of punching small holes in the green; actually, small cores of turf and sod are cut and removed from the green (read more about aerification and its purposes here), which leaves holes. It usually takes the green a couple weeks to heal following aerification. The process of reaching our conclusion may have been convoluted, but the answer to our original question-do you get relief from aeration holes on the putting green-is pretty straightforward. No, unless the local rule cited above is in effect. Return to Golf Rules FAQ.
On average I like to give it at least 3 weeks, depends on how big the punch is and what type of greens they are. Yes, I wouldn't play a red flag right now, just was curious how long it took to change back to yellow and then green. I see some yellows about aerations in the next week.
Some grasses recover much quicker than others, and the more frequently you aerate, the healthier your greens are likely to be, and thus quicker recovery. Also note, with 10 days between the aeration and your game, top dressing should be completely worked in. I would anticipate that if the greens were healthy before the aeration, they will be quite good when you play. Perhaps, after your game, you should come back on and tell us what was your opinion of the greens.
