When a bulging disc, disc herniation or disc rupture occurs, it is typically due to either: 1  a pre-existing weakness in the annulus, or. 2  a sudden increase in pressure through the disc causing fibres of the annulus to tear.
Approximately 90 percent of bulging discs occur in the lower back, or lumbar area, of the spine. The most common lumbar bulging disc is seen between lumbar vertebra L4 and L5, and between vertebra L5 and S1, causing pain in the L5 nerve or S1 spinal nerve, respectively.
A bulging disc injury is a common spine injury sustained to your spine's intervertebral disc. It can occur in your lumbar spine (lower back), thoracic spine (upper and mid-back) or your cervical spine (neck).
Bulging disc is a degenerative spinal disorder that occurs when the vertebral disk shifts out of its normal position and extends outside the space it should normally occupy. This is a condition related to the spine, usually the lumbar or lower back.
A bulging disc is a spinal condition, where the outer wall of the disc (the Annulus Fibrosus) becomes weak and starts to bulge into the spinal canal. This condition may also be referred to as a Protruding Disc or a Slipped Disc.
A bulging disk is different from a herniated disk in that a bulging disk typically occurs gradually over time rather than suddenly. A herniated disk is often the result of an injury or trauma to the spine.
A bulging disk is a condition related to the spine, usually the lumbar, or lower back, that occurs when a disk bulges through a crevice in the spine. Disks are the soft, gelatinous material that cushions the vertebrae of
Save. Your spinal bones are cushioned by small discs along the vertebrae. A bulging disc occurs when one of the discs is damaged, eventually causing the disc to bulge or break off. A bulging disc is also referred to as a herniated disc in the medical profession.
