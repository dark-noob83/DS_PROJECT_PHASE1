no matter what the breed a chicken can only lay one egg about every 24 hours the real difference is how many eggs a year some industrial chickens can lay over 250 eggs a ye ar on average
so obviously someone is laying two per day i have a dog kennel in the coop with straw in it that is where they lay there eggs well 90 % of the time i collect them every day and sometimes there are 7 eggs in there i thought you would only get one egg per day per hen
best answer very few chickens will lay one egg every day how frequent a chicken lays has to do with the breed and the amount of day light hours in a day in commercial production egg houses they control the light these production breeds such as the california white will lay and average of about 325 eggs a year
for laying eggs regularly a hen requires at least 14 hours of light if you can manage 16 hours of light exposure daily then your hens will produce their maximum they generally lay eggs within six hours of sunrise
the typical interval between eggs laid is about 25 hours so a hen that lays an egg every day will lay a bit later each day this is slightly less than one a day and work out to about 350 a year
a chicken lays one egg a day or one every other day more infothe actual time it takes for a hen to make an egg and lay it is 24 to 26 hours then the hen rests about 30 minutes or so before starting to make another one in addition to resting about 1 2 hour each time an egg is laid some hens rest about every 3 to 5 days and others rest about every 10 days
within about every 28 hours a hen can produce at most only one egg hens do not ovulate or lay eggs in dark length and timing of photoperiod also influence the egg production of a hen so dark and light has a great impact in the egg production the time of the day an egg is laid is influenced by all those factors
some chickens will lay up to one egg a day others will lay two eggs a week it depends on the breed of chicken and how well they are taken care of if you have seven chickens you will normally get about 5 eggs a day
you egg lay rate will not be the same throughout the life of the layer when you first place you point of lay birds at 18 weeks to 20 weeks they will lay almost no eggs per day as they grow so the number of eggs per chicken will increase
