Speed and simplicity for targeted and small genome sequencing. The MiSeq desktop sequencer allows you to access more focused applications such as targeted gene sequencing, metagenomics, small genome sequencing, targeted gene expression, amplicon sequencing starting at 10 ng DNA, and HLA typing.
The MiSeq system is a fully integrated sequencing ecosystem, in a compact and economical instrument. For results in hours, not days, MiSeq uses TruSeq, Illumina's reversible terminator-based sequencing by synthesis chemistry to deliver the fastest time to answer.
Illumina MiSeqâ„¢ Systems. The Illumina MiSeq is a benchtop sequencer that employs the same proven sequencing by synthesis chemistry as its higher throughput counterpart, the HiSeq. The MiSeq was designed for lower throughput and quicker turn-around time.
QUESTIONS. MiSeq is the only desktop sequencer that can produce 2 x 300 paired-end reads in a single run. This allows small genome sequencing and assembly, and enables detection of target variants with unmatched accuracy, especially within homopolymer regions.
Yes, you can sequence your enriched libraries on the MiSeq System, obtaining results in hours instead of days. However, the MiSeq Reporter currently cannot process the manifest file provided for your enrichment experiment.
User-Friendly, Intuitive Software. The MiSeq System is the first desktop sequencer to offer a fully integrated sequencing ecosystem. In addition to the system software, which is accessed through a user-friendly touchscreen interface, MiSeq can connect to BaseSpace, Illumina's secure, cloud-based resource.
