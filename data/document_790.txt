Cinnamon is one of the most common colors apart from normal grey. It is exactly the same for the above descriptions, but instead of a grey color over the body, it is a pale dusty' silver/brownish color. It can be mistaken for a light grey, but has a browner overtone, and a paler, softer appearance. Some are a very obvious brown color too. The bright face and clear tail feathers of the male, as well as the immature and the females' dull face and barred tails is the same as for the normal grey.
Cinnamon is one of the most common colors apart from normal grey. It is exactly the same for the above descriptions, but instead of a grey color over the body, it is a pale dusty' silver/brownish color. It can be mistaken for a light grey, but has a browner overtone, and a paler, softer appearance. Both dominant and recessive silver have the same face/sex-linked colors as the normal grey. The mature male will have a bright face and plain tail, the immature bird and the mature female will have the dull faces and barred tails. They all have the white wing stripe and spots on the flight feathers.
This drink smokes elegantly, changes from a calm blue to fuschia as it cools from room temperature to drinkably cold, and tastes like a dirty martini. It's all to do with the pH at which the color changes. So beets have a great color... but they don't change unless you take the pH *very* high (12-13, and they go yellow). So this would create something undrinkable. It turns out blueberry juice isn't that great either-the change in that case happens at too acidic a pH.

Normal Grey Male. Normal Grey is the natural color that cockatiels are in the wild. A mature male will have a dark grey body everywhere except for the white stripe on each wing, the bright yellow face and crest, and the orange cheek spots. Both dominant and recessive silver have the same face/sex-linked colors as the normal grey. The mature male will have a bright face and plain tail, the immature bird and the mature female will have the dull faces and barred tails. They all have the white wing stripe and spots on the flight feathers.

After the molt the male's tail feathers will be a solid gray color with no barring, but the female's will remain patterned. The above is easily applied for normal gray cockatiels but other color varieties such as albinos, cinnamons, lutinos, pearls and pieds are more difficult to sex. In the meantime, use the general guide below to assist with the sexing of other varieties: • Males have a great vocal ability and whistle a lot. 
If you went to Australia to look at cockatiels in the wild, you’d find a predominantly gray flock. They still have the yellow heads (the males) and orange cheek patches but their body color is gray. Many cockatiels offered as pets come in this “normal grey” color. The color of gray can vary from cockatiel to cockatiel. In the US, we use the English/Australian spelling of the word gray when referring to the color type of the cockatiel. 
Shake with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. Made with ingredients that would have been readily available during the period, this identically named cocktail aims for the same effect. If this drink is in fact the source of the modern Cosmopolitan then it would be an adaption of a Daisy rather than a Kamikaze. The Cosmopolitan is usually served in a large cocktail glass, also called a martini glass. For this reason, the drink is mistakenly categorized as a type of martini.
