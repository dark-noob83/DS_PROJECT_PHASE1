Papaya. Papaya juice contains an enzyme called papain. This natural enzyme is used in commercial meat tenderizing products, but those do not add a tropical touch to the steak when used in a marinade. Add papaya juice or mashed papaya to marinades to take advantage of the enzyme to tenderize your meat.
Unripe Green Papaya. Unripe papaya contains an enzyme called papain. Even the leaves of the papaya tree contains this enzyme. Papain works as a meat tenderizer by breaking down the connective tissues of the meat that it comes into contact with. This works on all types of meat such as chicken, beef, lamb, and pork.
My go-to juice is pineapple juice, along with adding a bottle of Tiger Sauce. Not only does pineapple juice give your meat a good, sweet flavor, it also contains the enzyme bromelain. Bromelain is the most common form of meat tenderizer used in America.
Fruit Juice. Instead of buying processed tenderizer, fruit juice can be used to tenderize the meat. Marinating the meat in pineapple juice or papaya juice will break down the meat fibers, and the flavor normally cooks off during grilling. It is from these fruits that many processed tenderizers are made. It is important to find a pure juice and not a pineapple or papaya drink or punch.
