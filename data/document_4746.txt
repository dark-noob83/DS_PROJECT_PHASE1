Brick Calculators and Block Calculators Before you can build a retaining wall or any other masonry wall you will need to be able to calculate the concrete masonry blocks you will need to order. Use this calculator to calculate the amount of concrete block needed to construct a masonry wall. 
Calculate the surface area of a single block in the wall, including its mortar allowance. For example, if your standard concrete block is 1 foot by 0.5 feet and is separated from its neighbours by a half-inch of mortar, then each block accounts for 1.0417 x 0.5417, or 0.5643 square feet. The simplest and surest way to obtain that number, of course, is to count them all, but that could take a long time, and it isn't of any help to someone who wants to know how many blocks are needed to build a wall that isn't there yet.
Step 3. Multiply the total square footage of the wall surface by the blocks per square foot to find the amount of blocks for the wall. Multiply this number by 1.06 to add a 6 percent waste margin to find the total number of blocks needed for the wall. Multiply the length of the block you are going to use by its width to find its surface area. Divide 144 (the number of inches in a square foot) by the surface area of the block to calculate the number of blocks per square foot.
Step 2. Multiply the length of the block you are going to use by its width to find its surface area. Divide 144 (the number of inches in a square foot) by the surface area of the block to calculate the number of blocks per square foot. Example: An 8-inch by 16-inch concrete block has a surface area of 128 square inches; 144 divided by 128 is 1.125 blocks per square foot
Now, compute the total number of stone blocks needed with the formula. Number of Blocks = 144L(H + 0.5)/(AB). The factor of 144 is necessary convert feet to inches. Example: Suppose a wall is to be 20 feet long and 3 feet hight, built with stones that are 6 inches by 10 inches. Then the number of stones needed is. 144(20)(3 + 0.5)/[(6)(10)] = 10080/60 = 168. You should purchase stone blocks to spare in case of breakage. Multiply the wall's length by its height plus 1/2 a foot to find the total square footage of the wall. That is, calculate. Wall Area = L(H + 0.5) sq. ft, where L is the length of the wall in feet and H is the finished height of the wall in feet.
There are several formulas to figure out how many blocks are needed for a wall project, but the first step is to determine the width and height of the wall, in inches. Once you know the size of your wall, calculate the square footage by multiplying the width(in feet) times the height(in feet). Simply enter the dimensions for your wall project and the concrete block calculator will figure out how many blocks are needed. If you are interested in hiring a professional to estimate your material and installation costs then find a contractor and request a block wall installation estimate.
Add. Fill in all the boxes to find how many bricks or blocks are in a wall (or how many you need to build a specific wall). The wall thickness should be quoted in number of brick thicknesses (i.e. 2 in the diagram above). Standard UK bricks are 8.5 x 2.5 inches, and standard US bricks are 8 x 2.25 inches.
0.5LH cubic feet, or. LH/54 cubic yards. For example, for a retaining wall that is 24 feet long and 2.5 feet high, we will need (24)(2.5)/54 = 1.111 cubic yards of gravel for backfill. Calculate the number of capstones needed by dividing the length of the wall in feet by the length of the capstones in inches. Then multiply by 12. 
Step 1. Estimate the number blocks you need for each course. (length of the wall in inches) รท (length of a block) = blocks per course. Example: 228 in รท 11.5 in = approximately 20 blocks per course.
