There are people drowning in financial debt who make $90,000 a year. To me, it is about perspective. I have seen all sides of the financial coin. What I have deduced is that is how you live your life, regardless of how much money you make. I&#39;m starting to look into careers and i was interested in social work but my mom and stepdad say i shouldn&#39;t do it because they don&#39;t make enough. They say i should pick something that makes at least 60k A year to live comfortably.
We then assume you can live comfortably off of 85% of your pre-retirement income. So if you earn $100,000 the year you retire, we estimate you will need $85,000 during the first year of retirement. To figure out how much you will save by the time you retire, we first estimate your future income by growing your current income at a rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). Then, we determine what the sum of your annual contributions will be between now and retirement.
Report Abuse. I live comfortably on between $1,000-$2,000 a year. YES one thousand to two thousand dollars a YEAR. I spend 3-6 months making jewelry in my father's shop and the rest of the year wandering the country as a homeless man. It really depends on where you live and the lifestyle you lead. If you're single and have an apartment and whatnot, I'd think 32-35k would enable you to live comfortably and enjoy life a little bit. Of course there are some out there that could be single and need 100k a year to live comfortable.
7. New York City — To live comfortably, you'd need $131,365 in Brooklyn, $169,639 in Manhattan, and $116,907 in Queens. 8. Los Angeles — $102,061 would have you sitting pretty in LA. These are the 10 richest cities, and the salary a person would need to live comfortably in each of them: 1. San Francisco — You'd need $124,561 to live comfortably in SF. 2. San Jose — You'd need around $115,515 here.
Your average landlord will require that your annual income be 40 times the monthly rent. For instance, if you want to live in a $2,000/month studio apartment in Manhattan (which is on the low end of the range for apartments in Manhattan, but not uncommonly so), you'll need $80,000 a year. That's not a bad basis for your calculations. Figure on 30 percent going to taxes. 
Its not much easier in NJ. The 3 bedroom 1 1/2 bath house next to me just listed for $735,000, property tax of $15,000. If you put 20%=$150,000 down your mortgage and tax payment will be about $3300 a month. Which will cost you about $40,000 a year. If you make $60,000 a year your net is about $40,000. And in NJ you need a car. If you work in NYC and live in NJ you pay both NY and NJ state income tax so your tax burden will be greater.
