we now know that a pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron star whose radiation is emitted like a spinning flashlight over 700 pulsars have now been detected with rates of rotation ranging from once every 4 seconds to more than 600 times per second
the time interval between consecutive pulses is called the pulsar s period periods of one second are typical although pulsars have been discovered with periods from a few milliseconds one millisecond equals 0 001 seconds up to eight seconds the time between pulses is incredibly regular and can be measured very precisely
what sets pulsars apart from regular neutron stars is that they re highly magnetized and rotating at enormous speeds astronomers detect them by the radio pulses they emit at regular intervals formation the formation of a pulsar is very similar to the creation of a neutron star when a massive star with 4 to 8 times the mass of our sun dies it detonates as a supernova the outer layers are blasted off into space and the inner core contracts down with its gravity
they are what is known as the lighthouses of the universe rotating neutron stars that emit a focused beam of electromagnetic radiation that is only visible if you re standing in it s path
for example a pulsar called psr j1603 7202 is known to have a period of 0 0148419520154668 seconds however the periods of all radio pulsars are increasing extremely slowly the period of psr j1603 7202 increases by just 0 0000005 seconds every million years there are two main types of pulsar
take 95 seconds to watch this video from nasa astrophysics a pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is the small incredibly dense remnant of much more massive star
