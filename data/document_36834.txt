Despite the fact, your dog can’t get pregnant in the first days of the heat, problems arise if we need to define “first days”. 1  Phase when dog can get pregnant during heat may be as short as three days. 2  It’s easy to miss the beginning of the heat. 3  Sperm may survive up to seven days inside uterus.
A female dog can only become pregnant if she mates during her heat cycle. The pregnancy should last roughly 63 days from the date of the breeding, give or take several days.
The heat cycle in dogs, also known as estrus is the time female dogs can mate and get pregnant. The very first heat cycle typically occurs when the female dog reaches sexual maturity, approximately at 6 to 12 months old. However, there are larger breeds that mature later (at 18 months).
Dog Pregnancy Time Line-In Heat. To understand dog pregnancy, you should first get a general comprehension of how her body works. Your dog will experience a heat cycle before she is able to get pregnant. Veterinarians suggest that you do not breed her during her first heat period unless it happens after she is 1 year old. Any earlier would stunt the growth of your young female. Most dogs go into heat 2 times a year, but it is common to skip one on occasion.
While in heat she will be able to breed with more than the one male. She will be in heat for 3 weeks and her cycle will arrive every 6-9 months. The first thing you will recognize when your dog goes into heat is a swollen vulva and bloody discharge. Eggs are not released yet in this phase of her heat cycle. Male dogs will be chemically drawn to her more than ever before.
When your female dog is receptive to mating, she is in a stage of her reproductive cycle known as being in “heat.” You can expect this to happen about twice a year beginning between six months to one year of age. Each time your dog goes into heat, the cycle will last about 21 to 28 days.
