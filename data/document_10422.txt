Kevlar® is an extremely strong material that derives its strength from its spider web-like weave. Stephanie Kwolek and Herbert Blades created this special material in 1965 for the Dupont Company.
It was the first organic fiber with sufficient tensile strength and modulus to be used in advanced composites. Originally developed as a replacement for steel in radial tires, Kevlar is now used in a wide range of applications.
Today, there are three grades of Kevlar available: Kevlar 29, Kevlar 49, and Kevlar 149. The table below shows the differences in material properties among the different grades. If you purchase Kevlar cloth, it is most likely Kevlar 49.
Sorry, something has gone wrong. Best Answer: kevlar is the world's strongest and toughest fabric. it was first used for early cars and it was then thought of to be used as an body armor. Source(s): Blog · 5 years ago. Thumbs up.
The chemical composition of Kevlar is poly para-phenyleneterephthalamide, and it is more properly known as a para-aramid. Aramids belong to the family of nylons. Common nylons, such as nylon 6,6, do not have very good structural properties, so the para-aramid distinction is important.
The first paraaramid fiber under the trademark of Kevlar® was invented in 1965 and patented by DuPont. It was about 25 years ago that the first generation of Kevlar® fibers under the name of Kevlar® 29 was used in US ballistic vests for the first time.
