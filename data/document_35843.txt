Remove the detergent from the VCT flooring by wiping it off with a clean mop. Rinse the mop in the bucket of water frequently and wring it out well. Allow the floor to air dry.
Installation. VCT installation is similar to that of other floor tiles. Glue the VCT to the sub-floor. There are different types of adhesive; the main difference in each is the amount of time you have to work with it.
Vinyl Composite Tile (VCT) flooring requires special maintenance in order to retain a professional, safe and clean appearance at all times. Too much heat, water, dirt and grime can lead to a tarnished and less-than-professional floor that does absolutely nothing to enhance the customer or employee experience.
Vinyl composition tile (VCT) is a resilient floor covering. Relative to the other types of vinyl flooring (vinyl sheet flooring and vinyl tile), VCT contains a high proportion of inorganic filler. The tile size modeled in BEES is 30 cm x 30 cm x 0.3 cm (12 in x 12 in x 1/8 in), with a weight of about 0.613 kg (1.35 lb).
