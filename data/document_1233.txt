Onyx Care. Onyx is a type of marble and should be treated accordingly. It should be sealed on a regular basis in wet areas, and cleaned with a stone cleaner or mild detergent. If possible, onyx should be squeegeed or toweled dry to help prevent staining or etching of the stone.
Onyx is similar to travertine in the way it is formed, resulting from water dissolving existing limestone and re-depositing it as a new type of stone known as sinter. In limestone caves, onyx is formed by drip water, in the formation of stalagmites and stalactites.
The main types of stone used to create sinks and tubs are onyx, marble, granite, travertine, sandstone and soapstone. Specialty stones such as river rock and petrified wood are less common, but welcome additions to the collection. Hereâ€™s a little information about each of these beautiful, natural materials.
Onyx is a compact sedimentary rock that is a type of limestone that formed by evaporation of cold water containing dissolved calcium, leaving a translucent variety of calcite, often in the form of stalagmites and stalactites inside caves. Onyx is extremely dense but lacking in bending strength.
