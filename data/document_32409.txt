To calculate the operating cost of an 18,000 BTU oven, for example, divide 18,000 by 100,000 to get 0.18. As of January 2013, the average price per therm of natural gas in California is $0.93, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Assuming you use your 18,000 BTU oven for one hour each day, the operating cost per day is $0.17 (0.18 times $0.93 times 1), or $61 per year. At the average price of $0.164 per kWh of electricity in California as of January 2013, a 1,500 watt oven costs $0.25 to operate for one hour each day. This equates to an annual operating cost of $89.80.
While gas ovens cost less to operate than electric ovens, gas ovens cost about 50 percent more than electric units in terms of upfront costs, says Aclara Technologies, a utility communications company. In addition, gas ovens require access to commercial gas lines. At the average price of $0.164 per kWh of electricity in California as of January 2013, a 1,500 watt oven costs $0.25 to operate for one hour each day. This equates to an annual operating cost of $89.80.
