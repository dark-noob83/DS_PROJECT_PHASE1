How to Cook a Turkey in an Electric Roaster. Help!!!! This is the first Thanksgiving dinner I am cooking! I am using a 20-quart Rival Roaster Oven to cook it instead of the conventional oven. I am doing this to free up my oven for other dishes (that I don't know how to cook either!).
According to the manufacturer, the roaster oven cooks at approximately the same temperature and in the same time as would a conventional oven. Rival suggests you cook your turkey at 375°F (190°C) for 13 to 18 minutes per pound  a pretty broad range. For a 20-pound turkey, that's 4 hours and 20 minutes to 6 hours.
1 Put the insert pan back into the roasting pan. ( 2 If your roaster doesn't have an insert pan, it's ok-just be very careful putting the bird into that hot oven, you don't want to burn your hands on the sides of the oven!) Cover. 3  Roast at highest setting for 30 minutes.
Prepare the Turkey. Cover turkey in foil and place turkey in oven. Roast turkey for determined cooking time. Remove foil one hour into the cooking to allow skin to brown. Add vegetables to the bottom of the pan at this time if desired.
1 Put the insert pan with the bird into the roaster oven and cover. 2  I don't recommend adding water to the pan. 3  Put the rack into the insert pan (make sure the handles are up, not tucked below), and put the bird in the insert pan on top of the rack.
