Selecting a racket with the correct grip size is limited because most children's rackets come with a grip size of 4 inches -- the circumference of the grip. Some manufacturers, though, do make grips as small as 3 1/2 inches and as large as 4 1/8 inches.
Know the Guidelines. Major brand tennis racket manufacturers provide sizing guidelines to help you select the correct racket. If you child is 5 years old or younger and is 44 inches or shorter, a 19- or 21-inch racket is a good fit. If your child is age 6 to 8 and measures 45 to 49 inches, select a 23-inch racket.
Most manufacturers provide basic sizing recommendations based on age or height. Junior rackets start at 15 inches and go up in two-inch increments to 27 inches. For example, for a 5-year-old child who stands 3 feet, 11 inches, the appropriate size racket is typically between 19 and 21 inches.
Kids tennis rackets ranging from 19 to 26 inches in length for players between 2 and 12 years old. As a general rule, the appropriate size racket length for your child is the distance from finger tip to ground when standing upright. Tennis rackets for competitive junior players between 5 years old
