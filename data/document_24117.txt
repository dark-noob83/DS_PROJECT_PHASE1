Congress expressed shock and dismay to learn that regional airline pilots start at very low salaries after the NTSB said the co-pilot on the Colgan Air commuter plane that crashed near Buffalo on Feb. 12 earned only $16,000 a year. (The company later said she earned $23,900.). In 1966 all the major airlines were recruiting new pilots to replace the WWII pilots that were coming up for retirement. Starting salary was $654.00 per month. Even for those times, that worked out to be just about the national average income.

The union also lobbies Congress on behalf of its members. JetBlue pilots on average earned slightly more than some of its rival airlines, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Airline Data Project. The university's data showed a JetBlue pilot earned a total of $187,000 in salary plus benefits in 2012. A pilot at low-cost rival Southwest Airlines, which is also unionized, earns $185,000. In a statement, JetBlue confirmed that a majority of its pilots had voted to join the union. JetBlue CEO Dave Barger said the airline will authorize the union as the representative body for JetBlue pilots. JetBlue (JBLU) stock fell more than 2%.
