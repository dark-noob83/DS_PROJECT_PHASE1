The average amount of waste generated per person per day in South Africa is 0.7 kg. This is closer to the average produced in developed countries (73 kg in the UK and 0.87 kg in Singapore), than to the average in developing countries such as 0.3 kg in Nepal (DWAF 1997). 
Teacher professional development and classroom resources across the curriculum. Solid Waste Every year, the United States generates approximately 230 million tons of trash--about 4.6 pounds per person per day. Less than one-quarter of it is recycled; the rest is incinerated or buried in landfills.
1 on average Americans generate 4.3 pounds of trash per day. 2  Do the math: 4.3 X 365 = 1569.5 pounds per person per year. 285 million people in the US = 447307.5 Million pounds of trash. 3  The figure was consumer trash production on average and did not account for industrial waste, but it is a start. If the rest of the world produced as much as Americans, there would be about 10 MILLION tons daily, or 4 TRILLION tons yearly. on average Americans generate 4.3 pounds of trash per day. Do the math: 4.3 X 365 = 1569.5 pounds per person per year. 285 million people in the US = 447307.5 Million pounds of trash.
Food for Thought: The average person generates 4.5 pounds of trash every day â€“ about 1.5 tons of solid waste per year. Although the EPA estimates that 75 percent of solid waste is recyclable, only about 30 percent is actually recycled. 
In the Middle East and North Africa, solid waste generation is 63 million tonnes per year. Per capita waste generation is 0.16 to 5.7 kg per person per day, and has an average of 1.1 kg/capita/day.The OECD countries generate 572 million tonnes of solid waste per year. Per capita waste generation is generally low in this region, but spans a wide range, from 0.09 to 3.0 kg per person per day, with an average of 0.65
This equates to approximately 1.46 lbs. of recovered recyclables out of nearly 4.5 lbs. of waste materials produced each day per person (see References 1). Based on 2005 to 2009 census estimates, this means the average household produces 3.8 lbs. of recyclables per day (see Resources 2). In 2009, the amount of paper recovered for recycling or composting averaged 325 lbs. per person in the United States (see References 5), or about 845 lbs. for each household. And the recovery rate for paper exceeded the industry's goal, reaching 63.4 percent in 2009 (see References 5).
The total amount of waste generated per year in this region is 160 million tonnes, with per capita values ranging from 0.1 to 14 kg/capita/day, and an average of 1.1 kg/capita/day. Per capita waste generation is generally low in this region, but spans a wide range, from 0.09 to 3.0 kg per person per day, with an average of 0.65
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average American produces about 4.4 pounds (2 kg) of garbage a day, or a total of 29 pounds (13 kg) per week and 1,600 pounds (726 kg) a year. This only takes into consideration the average household member and does not count industrial waste or commercial trash. The average American household produces about 1,600 pounds (726 kg) of garbage per year. Personal garbage can be reduced significantly by recycling. The average American produces an estimated 29 pounds of garbage each week.
The average American household generates 1.46 lbs. of recovered recyclables per person every day. Environmental Protection Agency statistics indicate that American households collectively produced 243 million tons of trash in 2009, of which 82 million tons was composted or recycled (see References 1). In 2009, the amount of paper recovered for recycling or composting averaged 325 lbs. per person in the United States (see References 5), or about 845 lbs. for each household. And the recovery rate for paper exceeded the industry's goal, reaching 63.4 percent in 2009 (see References 5).
