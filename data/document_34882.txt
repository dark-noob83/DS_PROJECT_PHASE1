Electrical Conductivity Definition: Electrical conductivity is the measure of the amount of electrical current a material can carry. Electrical conductivity is denoted by the symbol Ïƒ and has SI units of siemens per meter (S/m). Most Conductive Element.
n the capacity for conduction; ability to convey. conductivity, electrical, n the ability of a material to conduct electricity. Metals are usually good conductors, and nonmetals are poor conductors. conductivity, thermal, n the ability of a material to transfer heat.

Full Definition of CONDUCTIVITY. : the quality or power of conducting or transmitting: as a: the reciprocal of electrical resistivity b: the quality of living matter responsible for the transmission of and progressive reaction to stimuli. See conductivity defined for English-language learners.
noun (plural conductivities). 1 (also electrical conductivity) The degree to which a specified material conducts electricity, calculated as the ratio of the current density in the material to the electric field which causes the flow of current.
