these are located in the wrist area metacarpals there are five metacarpals each one related to a digit phalanges most distal the bones of the fingers each finger has three phalanges except for the thumb which has two
the metacarpals are the tubular bones that comprise most of the space in the palm each of the fingers digits has a corresponding metacarpal that links the wrist bones to the phalanges individual bones of the fingers by scott kaar m d a metacarpal fracture is a fracture break of the tubular bones within the palm metacarpals they classically occur in the small finger metacarpal bone in boxers or athletes of other pugilistic sports or activities
metacarpals the metacarpals are long bones within the hand that are connected to the carpals or wrist bones and to the phalanges or finger bones the metacarpals together are referred to as the metacarpus the tops of the metacarpals form the knuckles where they join to the wrist 
a metacarpal fracture is a type of hand fracture occurring in the bones which form the palm of the hand these bones located between the bones of the wrist and the bones of the fingers are called the metacarpals there are five metacarpal bones each articulating with a digit of the hand 
summary information metacarpals metacarpals the metacarpals are a group of bones located in the hand forming the palm area of the hand there are five metacarpals in each hand and they form a part of the appendicular skeleton the metacarpals articulate with the carpals to form the wrist joint and the phalanges to form the knuckle joints metacarpophalangeal joints each metacarpal corresponds with one of the five fingers on each hand and is named by a number one through five
symptoms of a fractured metacarpal the metacarpals particularly the base of the first metacarpal are usually fractured as a result of impact or sudden trauma such as punching something hard fractures can also occur as a result of a fall onto the hand where the thumb is extended out to the side symptoms will include sudden pain usually from the impact 
metacarpal shaft the treatment of metacarpal shaft fractures can be further subclassified based on the fracture geometry transverse oblique spiral or comminuted transverse fractures usually result in an apex dorsal angulation from the deforming force of the interosseous muscles 
description the metacarpals are essential for hand function fractures to these bones may affect hand strength and motion inhibiting the ability to grip and hold objects fractures are often the result of high energy impact likely seen in athletics trauma and work injuries structure and function the metacarpals consist of five tubular bones that articulate proximally with the carpus and distally with the phalanges from radial to ulnar the bones are numbered one thumb through five small finger and consist of a shaft base and head figure the 5 metacarpal bon
