1 Though the only way to be absolutely sure how much you'll receive in unemployment benefits each week is to actually file a claim, typically, you can expect to make about 40-60% of your previous income (depending on where you live). 1 In Texas, a recipient's maximum benefit amount is 26 times the weekly benefit amount or 27% of all wages earned during the base period-whichever is smaller. 2  Our hypothetical worker's weekly payment is $320 - 320 × 26 = $8320. 3  His total base period wages are $29,000. 4  29,000 × 0.27 = $7,830.
The state determines the percentage of that wage that will be replaced. The weekly wage is divided and the weekly benefit is calculated based on the weekly wage. For example, a worker who earned $3,200 during the high quarter made an average weekly wage of $246 per week ($3,200 divided by 13). Depending on the state, the benefit amount may replace one half of the average weekly earnings. 
To qualify for benefits in California, a claimant must have (1) earned at least $1,300 in the highest quarter of the base period. You can receive a minimum of $40 to a maximum of $450 a week up to 26 weeks depending on your past quarterly earnings. The base period is 12 months long, but it is important to think of it as 4 quarters of 3 months each.
If you earned $15,000 in your highest paid quarter, you would divide that by 26 to come up with half of your weekly wages: $576.92. That amount is more than the maximum benefit, so you would be eligible to receive $450 each week in benefits. California doesn't provide any extra amount for dependents. The amount of unemployment compensation you will receive depends on your prior earnings and on how your state calculates benefits. Talk to an Employment Lawyer.
The first $50 in earnings will not be deducted from unemployment insurance benefits. However, you must report all earnings, even if under $50. Any earnings over $50 per week will be deducted from your benefit payment on a dollar for dollar basis. No. At this time you are eligible to receive a maximum of twenty-six times your weekly benefit amount (26 weeks of full benefits). You may file claims for more than 26 weeks if you earn some wages and partial benefits are paid. During times of high unemployment, there may be additional weeks available.
The amount you can earn through part-time or temporary work while on unemployment depends on your state's policies. In many cases, you can still receive partial benefits, provided that your earnings don't exceed the amount that you are making in benefits. 
Weekly benefit amounts range from a minimum of $40 to a maximum of $450 depending on the claimant’s quarterly earnings. To qualify for the maximum amount each week ($450) an individual must earn at least $11,674.01 in a calendar quarter during the base period (an individual’s earnings during a specific 12-month period). 
If you are found eligible for unemployment benefits, the notice you receive from the state unemployment insurance department may indicate how much you can expect to receive per week. If not -- or to learn more about your state's benefit amounts -- contact your state's department. In a normal economic climate, most states offer unemployment benefits for up to 26 weeks, or half a year, although a handful of states now offer benefits for fewer weeks.
Weekly Benefit RateThe amount of unemployment benefits you may receive each week is your Weekly Benefit Rate (WBR). The amount will be 60% of the average weekly earnings during your base year period. Example 2: An individual who is entitled to a maximum 26-week claim (because he worked at least 26 or more weeks during the base year period) at a Weekly Benefit Rate of $300 will have a Maximum Benefit Amount of $7,800.
