1 But, a good pace will vary depending on your fitness level, walking technique, walking goals, and terrain. 2  For general fitness walking you should walk at a pace that increases your heart rate, and you can maintain for 30 to 60 minutes. 1 For general fitness walking you should walk at a pace that increases your heart rate, and you can maintain for 30 to 60 minutes. 2  Use the talk test... 3  if you can't speak without gasping for air you are walking too fast. 4  If you are walking slow enough that you can carry a tune you are probably walking too slow.
If you are walking casually with a friend, maybe shopping in a mall, you're probably also taking 100 steps a minute. If you are walking as exercise, here's how to calculate the number of steps you take, according to walking expert Mark Fenton, author of Complete Guide to Walking for Health, Fitness, and Weight Loss. Walking purposefully (@ 3mph)= 120 steps per minute. Power walking; if you went any faster you'd be running (@4.5 mph) = 150 steps per minute. To add 6,000 steps to your day can be relatively easy. By taking a few short breaks a day, you can sneak them in without much more time and effort. Walking with purpose (@ 3mph) = 120 steps per minute. Walking briskly, like you're late for a bus (@3.5-4 mph) = 135 steps per minute. Power walking; if you went any faster you'd be running (@4.5 mph) = 150 steps per minute Each mile walked = 2,000 steps.
A 10 minute walk at about 120 paces per minute is 1 200 paces. You might even like to break that up into 2 five minute walks of 600 paces each. Your overall goal in Stage 1 is to develop the habit of 'going for a walk' every day. This will give you your speed in metres per minute. If you walk at 120 paces per minute and your pace is 750 mm (0.75 metres), you will be walking at 90 metres per minute (120 x 0.75 = 90 m/min), and if you walk for an hour 90 metres multiplied by 60 minutes equals 5.4 km (90 x 60 = 5400 metres = 5.4 km).
How long will it take you to walk 10,000 steps? Most of us walk briskly at about 3.5 miles per hour which takes about 17 minutes per mile or about 85 minutes for 5 miles. The faster your pace (MPH), the faster you can walk the 5 miles. If you walk at a pace of 4 MPH, then you will take 15 minutes to walk one mile or 11/4 hours to walk 5 miles. If you walk 5 MPH (which is a jog for most folks), then it will take 12 minutes to walk one mile or 1 hour to walk 5 miles. Some websites equate walking 10,000 steps with only 30 minutes of walking. Nope. That isn't possible.
1 If you're walking for your health, a pace of about 3 miles per hour (or about 120 steps per minute) is about right. 2  That's a 20-minute mile. 3  To walk for weight loss, you'll have to pick up the pace to 4 miles per hour (or 135 steps per minute), a 15-minute mile. 1 That's a 20-minute mile. 2  To walk for weight loss, you'll have to pick up the pace to 4 miles per hour (or 135 steps per minute), a 15-minute mile. 3  Aerobic fitness comes at 4.5 miles per hour (you're moving along at 150 steps per minute).
Here's a quick way to figure out how fast you walk. Instead of timing yourself on a measured track, you can calculate your walking speed by counting your steps. Once you're warmed up, count how many steps you take in a minute of walking (or count your steps for 20 seconds and multiply by 3). 1  If you're walking for your health, a pace of about 3 miles per hour (or about 120 steps per minute) is about right. 2  That's a 20-minute mile. 1 That's a 20-minute mile. 2  To walk for weight loss, you'll have to pick up the pace to 4 miles per hour (or 135 steps per minute), a 15-minute mile. 3  Aerobic fitness comes at 4.5 miles per hour (you're moving along at 150 steps per minute).

So if you're walking for your health, the marching pace of 90 metres per minute is about right. If you are walking to reduce your body mass, you'll have to pick up the pace to a brisk 140 paces (or 100 metres) per minute. Aerobic fitness effects begin at 160 paces (or 115 metres) per minute, but this speed is relatively difficult to do. This will give you your speed in metres per minute. If you walk at 120 paces per minute and your pace is 750 mm (0.75 metres), you will be walking at 90 metres per minute (120 x 0.75 = 90 m/min), and if you walk for an hour 90 metres multiplied by 60 minutes equals 5.4 km (90 x 60 = 5400 metres = 5.4 km).
Researchers had 58 adults walk at a pace that felt “brisk” while wearing pedometers and heart rate monitors. After adjusting for age, gender and fitness level, the adults averaged 118 steps per minute, just a few steps shy of the 122 needed to reach their target heart rate. In other words, perceived exertion was an effective method of gauging the intensity of a moderately intense walking workout
