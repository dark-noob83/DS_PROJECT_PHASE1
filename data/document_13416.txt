* Repression. This was the first defense mechanism that Freud discovered, and arguably the most important. Repression is an unconscious mechanism employed by the ego to keep disturbing or threatening thoughts from becoming conscious.
Psychiatry An unconscious defense mechanism by which a person assimilates or copies another's activities, behavior, and reactions, a process that plays a major role personality and superego development. See Complementation, De-identification, Gender identity/role. Cf Imitation/role modeling.
A defense mechanism as described in psychoanalysis. Projection identification occurs when a subject projects their own unacceptable qualities onto another. That person (consciously or unconsciously) then internalizes the projection and comes to believe himself or herself to be characterized by it.
2. In Melanie Klein's object relations theory, projection identification is a defense mechanism in which a person fantasizes that part of their ego is split off and projected into the object, allowing for control or destruction of the part. This reinforces their feelings of omnipotence.
Introjection, one of many defense mechanisms posited by Sigmund Freud, occurs when a person internalizes the ideas or voices of other people. This behavior is commonly associated with the internalization of external authority, particularly that of parents.
This feeling is called anxiety, and it serves as a signal to the ego that its survival, and with it the survival of the whole organism, is in jeopardy. In order to deal with conflict and problems in life, Freud stated that the ego employs a range of defense mechanisms. Defense mechanisms operate at an unconscious level and help ward off unpleasant feelings (i.e. anxiety) or make good things feel better for the individual.
