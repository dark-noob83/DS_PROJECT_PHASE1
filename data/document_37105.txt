The absorption rate of protein also determines the maximum amount of protein that should be consumed at each meal. The University of California-Los Angeles explains that the body is able to absorb and utilize a maximum of 0.91 grams of protein per pound of body weight. A 2,000 calorie diet, for instance, would equate to 175 grams of protein each day, or approximately 60 grams of protein
I consume around 300 grams protein per day and it is working well with my weight training/body building program. I eat 6 meals per day and shoot for 40-50 grams of protein per each meal. On my work out days, I consume around 150-200 grams of carbs and on my non-work out days I drop the carbs to around 100 grams. I’m staying lean and building muscle! Thanks, Max. 
Getting Your Protein. According to the Institute of Medicine, adult women need about 46 grams of protein per day, and adult men need about 56 grams, which breaks down to 15 to 19 grams of protein per meal if you eat three meals a day. However, those figures are based on a recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, which makes them accurate for women who weigh about 125 pounds and men who weigh about 155 pounds. If you weigh more or are more active, you probably need more protein.
So if you eat 2,100 calories per day or about 700 calories at each meal, about 350 to 420 calories per meal should come from carbs. One slice of whole-wheat bread has about 14 grams of carbs, and a large banana has 31 grams. However, those figures are based on a recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, which makes them accurate for women who weigh about 125 pounds and men who weigh about 155 pounds. If you weigh more or are more active, you probably need more protein.
Adults in the U.S. are encouraged to get 10% to 35% of their day's calories from protein foods. That's about 46 grams of protein for women, and 56 grams of protein for men. It's not hard to get this amount if you eat two to three servings of protein-rich foods a day, according to the CDC. 1  A small 3-ounce piece of meat has about 21 grams of protein. 2  A typical 8-ounce piece of meat could have over 50 grams of protein.
Rice University recommends that active adults get up to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and that athletes intending to build muscle mass get up to 1.8 grams per kilogram. A scoop of protein powder has about 20 grams of protein, and a 3-ounce grilled chicken breast has 26 grams. However, those figures are based on a recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, which makes them accurate for women who weigh about 125 pounds and men who weigh about 155 pounds. If you weigh more or are more active, you probably need more protein.
As a general rule, between 10 percent and 15 percent of your total calories should come from protein. So, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, at least 200 should come from protein, or about 50 grams. You should try to eat around one gram of protein per one kilogram of body weight, or around 0.4 grams per pound. An easier way to figure this out in your head is to take your weight, divide it in half, and subtract 10. 
Shoot for 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Split up the total over the course of 5-6 meals. So, if your weight is 150 pounds then try to consume around 150 grams of protein per day and about 25 grams per meal (6 total meals). Evenly spacing your protein throughout the day is much better than consuming huge amounts in one sitting.
Giving elderly women 80% of their protein for the day at one meal over a period of two weeks led to almost 20% more synthesis and retention of protein compared to dividing it into smaller doses. So it appears that daily total protein is more important than per-meal protein. A good rule of thumb for daily intake, and a safe range based on the literature, is 0.8–2.5 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For muscular gain, I suggest at least 1.25 grams per pound of current lean bodyweight, which means you subtract your bodyfat ﬁrst. There's a popular (mis)belief that the human body can't absorb more than 30 grams of protein per meal. The science refutes this. Researchers in France have found that eating protein all at once can be just as well absorbed as spreading it out over your day.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recommended dietary allowance for protein for women over the age of 14 is 46 grams of protein. Teenage boys, on the other hand, should have a daily intake of 52 grams of protein, while adult men require 56 grams of protein. The CDC also states, however, that as much as 35 percent of the total calories for the day may derive from protein sources. A 2,000 calorie diet, for instance, would equate to 175 grams of protein each day, or approximately 60 grams of protein at each meal.
