Of course, a bit of price inflation over time can be a good thing. But the growth in the price of a college education has grown much faster than prices in many other categories. According to data from the Labor Department, the price index for college tuition grew by nearly 80 percent between August 2003 and August 2013. 
College tuition and fees, a component of the tuition, other school fees and childcare index, is included in the education and communication group of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

On average, tuition tends to increase about 8% per year. An 8% college inflation rate means that the cost of college doubles every nine years. For a baby born today, this means that college costs will be more than three times current rates when the child matriculates in college. College cost inflation rates are based on the Digest of Education Statistics for the years 1958-1970 and the College Board figures for four-year private colleges for the years from 1971 to the present.

Use the options below to generate a report on the highest (top 5%) and lowest (bottom 10%) academic year charges for each sector. Tuition reports include tuition and required fees. Net price is cost of attendance minus grant and scholarship aid. Data are reported by institutions and are for full-time beginning students.
