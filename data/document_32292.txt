Answers. Best Answer: Hi! Generally it takes 3 weeks for a passport renewal to go through and it says on the website that the time frame doesn't include postage so it could be longer. Check and send which is a few pounds more expensive will take two weeks.
You can renew or replace your passport at any time. It costs £72.50, or £82.25 through the Post Office’s Passport Check and Send service. Time left on an existing passport is added to your new one, up to a maximum of 9 months.
How long it takes. It should take 3 weeks to get the passport-use a different service if you need the passport urgently. It can take longer if more information is needed or your application hasn’t been filled out correctly. Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport-doing so is at your own risk.
Expedited Passport Service. Using an expedited passport process service will allow you to get your passport sooner than using the standard service. It generally takes two or three weeks to receive your passport using an expedited application process.
Standard passport processing generally takes between four to six weeks, but it can take longer during peak travel times.
The application procedure for an expedited passport is the same as for the standard service with two important exceptions. You must pay include a $60 expedition fee with your application as well as proof of travel plans.
