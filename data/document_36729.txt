BiPAP is a term that is sometimes used colloquially to refer to bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). A BiPAP machine, which is more accurately called a BPAP machine, is a breathing apparatus that helps its user get more air into his or her lungs.
CPAP, or continuous positive airway pressure, is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep the airways open. CPAP typically is used by people who have breathing problems, such as sleep apnea. CPAP also may be used to treat preterm infants whose lungs have not fully developed.
BiPAP (also referred to as BPAP) stands for Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, and is very similar in function and design to a CPAP machine (continuous positive airway pressure). Similar to a CPAP machine, A BiPAP machine is a non-invasive form of therapy for patients suffering from sleep apnea. Both machine types deliver pressurized air through a mask to the patient's airways. The air pressure keeps the throat muscles from collapsing and reducing obstructions by acting as a splint.
The main difference between BiPAP and CPAP machines is that BiPAP machines have two pressure settings: the prescribed pressure for inhalation (ipap), and a lower pressure for exhalation (epap). The dual settings allow the patient to get more air in and out of their lungs.
You have choices about how to breathe with greaterease and less stress. These choices include:• Being put on a ventilator or “vent” (breathing machine)• Using a mask that gently pushes air into your lungs (BiPAP)• Using medicineThis sheet describes and explains your choices.
