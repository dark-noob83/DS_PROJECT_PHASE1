Oogenesis. Just like spermatogenesis, oogenesis involves the formation of haploid cells from an original diploid cell, called a primary oocyte, through meiosis. The female ovaries contain the primary oocytes. There are two major differences between the male and female production of gametes.
During the process of meiosis diploid cells produce haploid cells.  There are two types of haploid cells ovum (eggs) and sperm, these  cells are called gametes.
Meiosis. Spermatogenesis is the process by which the male gametes, called sperm, are created. Now, you may recall that in order to create sperm that can combine with a female gamete, each sperm must be haploid and contain only one copy of each chromosome.
Spermatogenesis is the process of sperm cell development. Rounded immature sperm cells undergo successive mitotic and meiotic divisions (spermatocytogenesis) and a metamorphic change (spermiogenesis) to produce spermatozoa.
While mitosis produces 2 daughter cells from each parent cell, meiosis results in 4 sex cells, or gametes in males and 1 in females. Unlike the cells created by mitosis, gametes are not identical to the parent cells. In males, meiosis is referred to as spermatogenesis because sperm cells are produced.
Explanations. Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis. Meiosis, the process by which gametes are formed, can also be called gametogenesis, literally “creation of gametes.” The specific type of meiosis that forms sperm is called spermatogenesis, while the formation of egg cells, or ova, is called oogenesis.
