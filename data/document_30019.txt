An electric furnace can cost, on average, between $1,000 to $1,500. Higher-priced units usually offer better efficiency, which can help control ongoing expenses. Installation will typically add another $1,000 to $2,000 to the overall cost. While electric furnaces are usually less expensive to buy than other types of heating systems, they can cost more to operate on a month-to-month basis. Here’s an estimate of the cost of operating an electric furnace, from initial purchase to long-term operation. Purchase and Installation.

Assuming an electric heater with 100 percent efficiency, homeowners should expect to pay roughly $34.32 per million BTUs of heat. Natural gas is generally sold in therms, where one therm is equal to 100,000 BTUs. The EIA reports that one therm costs about $1.01 as of Nov
The average cost to install a new furnace is $3,602. As always, the price largely depends on the efficiency and size of your furnace, as well as its heat source. We have seen homeowners spend as little as $1,500 on a new furnace or as much as $7,000. However, know that most homeowners pay between $3,200 and $4,420. The Average Cost to Repair A Furnace.

Despite its low maintenance cost, there are ways to lower this price. 1  During the winter months, change the furnace filter every 30 days.
Assuming a furnace with a 78 percent efficiency, consumers should expect to pay roughly $12.96 per million BTUs of heat. While prices for gas and electricity vary over time and by region, gas furnaces typically cost much less to operate than electric furnaces or heaters. Assuming an electric heater with 100 percent efficiency, homeowners should expect to pay roughly $34.32 per million BTUs of heat. Natural gas is generally sold in therms, where one therm is equal to 100,000 BTUs. The EIA reports that one therm costs about $1.01 as of November 2012.
