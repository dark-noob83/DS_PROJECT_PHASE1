It’s normal to get your period as early as 9 years old or as late as 15 years old. This is a big time range and it’s hard to be one of the first or one of the last. Girls who are active in sports or are very thin may not get their period until a later age.
The length of a normal menstrual cycle is 28 days, plus/minus 7 days. That is, a period may occur 7 days before the expected date of the period or may be normally delayed for 7 days beyond the expected date. But, if the delay is more than 35 (28+7) days, then the cause of the delay needs to be investigated.
A menstrual cycle is the time from the day a menstrual period starts to the time the next period starts. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. However, a normal cycle can be shorter or longer than this. It may be anywhere from 21 to 35 days long. Most periods last 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal. Menstrual cycles may happen around the same date every month or they may be irregular. A menstrual period is considered late if it hasn’t started 5 or more days after the day you expected it to start.
You should get your period once every month. Your menstrual cycle should be about 28 days. This means that there should be about 28 days from the first day of your period to the first day of your next period. 28 days is an average number, but anywhere between 21 and 35 days is normal. Your period will usually last between 3 and 7 days. The amount of blood flow you have will probably be different each day.
