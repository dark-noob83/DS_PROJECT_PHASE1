Lingual Braces Cost. There's no doubt that braces are an investment of your time and money, but the benefits are worth it! As mentioned, the cost of lingual braces is generally more than traditional braces. Here's why. First, lingual braces are custom-made to your smile using CAD/CAM and robotic wire technologies. As with anything that's custom-made or uses specialized technology, the associated costs tend to be higher. If the lingual braces price might seem beyond your means, remember that there are ways to make the cost of lingual braces manageable. Some dental insurance plans might cover some of the cost of lingual braces. Be sure to contact your dental plan provider for details on your coverage.

Now, that you know how much the lingual braces cost, your probably wondering why these braces are so much more then the traditional metal braces. Well, the first apparent reason why, is because lingual braces are actually invisible. I had regular braces when I was 12-14, didn’t really wear the retainers… I am 30 now and I got lingual braces about 4 months ago (my entire treatment is 12 months). It does not hurt at all, a little bit after your monthly appointment but that’s it (just like regular braces). I paid $6000 for the treatment.
However, treatment may take longer than it does for children. The average adult wears braces for 18 months to three years. As with children, adults may need to wear a retainer to maintain the results of treatment after braces are removed. The cost of braces depends on the type you select. On average, metal braces cost $5,000 to $6,000. Keep in mind that your out-of-pocket costs will likely be higher if you choose non-metal braces. Check your Evidence of Coverage, Summary Plan Description or Group Dental Service Contract to see if your dental plan covers orthodontic treatment for adults.
