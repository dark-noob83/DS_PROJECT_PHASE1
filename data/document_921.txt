why do carp jump as high as they can out of the water, to my thinking its not feeding as i thought when carp rolled on the surface there going down to feed, so what are they doing, cleaning themselfs, or just sticking there fins up to me saying you cant catch me lol. 1  Share. 2  Share this post on. 3  Twitter.
A silver carp jumping out of the water can result in injury to the operator and damage to the boat, or in the most extreme cases, death to the boater. Both silver and bighead carp pose a threat to the local Louisiana freshwater fishery by out competing local fish for food.
Report Abuse. Different kinds of fish jump for different reasons. Carp are a bottom feeding fish and rarely jump. I have caught carp a few times on topwater lures so I know that if they get hungry enough they do hit critters on top of the water such as frogs and bugs and this can cause quite a splash.
So one can see that there are numerous reasons why carp leap out of the water. But also the nature of this leaping, (straight up and down, a sideways flop, of a dolphin like jump,) also gives precious clues as to the behaviour of the fish in the water and as such how to best lay our traps to catch them.
It is the silver carp, most recognized for its jumping ability, that can leap several feet out of the water when disturbed by boat propellers. Silver carp can grow up to 50 pounds, posing a threat to boaters and their equipment.
Bighead carp and Silver carp are the species that have spread the most aggressively and can be considered one of the greatest threats to the Great Lakes. Silver carp are a hazard for boaters. The vibration of boat propellers can make Silver carp jump up to three metres out of the water. Boaters and water-skiers in areas of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers have been seriously injured by jumping fish.
