A sirloin roast of 8- to 12-lbs will take 16-20 minutes for rare, 20-22 for medium rare, 23-25 for medium, and 26-30 for well done. A boneless top round, by contrast, will take 28-30 minutes for rare, 30-33 for medium rare, 34-38 for medium, and 40-45 for well done. If you roast at 325°F (160°C), subtract 2 minutes or so per pound. If the roast is refrigerated just before going into the oven, add 2 or 3 minutes per pound. How long and at what temperature should I cook a beef roast in the oven? Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast. Sirloin-tip, rump, rolled-rump, eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice
Cook the bottom round roast in a large cooking pot, Dutch oven or slow cooker. Any of these methods can produce a perfectly tender roast, so choose whichever method is convenient for you. 1  Regardless of which cooking vessel you choose, place a layer of chopped onions on the bottom and sit the meat on top. 1 Oven: If you're cooking the roast in a Dutch oven, preheat the oven to 300 °F (149 °C) and slow roast the meat for 3 to 4 hours, depending on the weight. 2  A 3 to 4 pound roast will typically take about 4 hours to cook — you'll know it's done when it reaches an internal temperature of 165 to 170 °F (74 to 77 °C).
Cooking a Large Roast Medium Well Done. I have a round beef tip roast, 11 pounds. I have never cooked more than a 4- to 5-pound roast. I need to know how many hours to cook for medium well. We are having 20 people over in less than a week, so I have to know soon. 
Transfer the roast to a rack in a shallow baking pan. Put the baking pan into a preheated oven. After 60 to 90 minutes of cooking, add the vegetables to the pan. Cook uncovered for a total of 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until an instant-read meat thermometer reaches 135 degrees for medium rare. 
Take the beef out of the oven when its internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. A temperature of 155 degrees F signifies a well-done roast for most cuts of beef. Drape a piece of aluminum foil loosely over the roast and allow it to sit out for about half an hour. Cooking a beef roast well-done makes the meat less tender and juicy, and considerably more chewy, than beef cooked to a lower temperature. For this reason, it's important to pick the best beef cuts for roasting.
Place the seasoned roast in your roasting pan with the fat side up. It will drip down and improve the flavor of the lean meat. 3. Multiply the weight of the roast by 30 minutes to find your cooking time. For example, a two and a half pound (1.1kg) roast will need 75 minutes or 1.25 hours. A five pound roast (2.3kg) will need 150 minutes or 2.5 hours. 1  If you want it to be medium rare, use 25 minutes per pound. 2  If you want it to be medium, bordering on well, increase it to 35 minutes. 3  Top round roasts are best served rare and medium rare. 5. Remove the roast and test it with a meat thermometer when there are 30 minutes remaining in your cook time. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. Follow these guidelines to achieve the right doneness: 1  A rare roast should read 125 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit (52 to 54 Celsius) when it is done.
The secret to tender, moist top round roast is to cook it slowly in a small amount of liquid. Spray the bottom of a pan that has a tight lid with vegetable spray. Add two tablespoons of oil. Season the roast and brown the top round, on all sides, over moderately high heat. Add the braising liquid to the meat in the pan. You will need one fourth of a cup of liquid for a four pound roast. Use beef broth, leftover wine, dark beer or water.
