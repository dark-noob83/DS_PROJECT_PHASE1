In 2012, the world relied on renewable sources for around 13.2% of its total primary energy supply, and in 2013 renewables accounted for almost 22% of global electricity generation, a 5% increase from 2012.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that about 11% of world marketed energy consumption is from renewable energy sources (biofuels, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, and wind) with a projection for 15% by 2040.
Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world.
Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight, or solar energy, can be used directly for heating and lighting homes and other buildings, for generating electricity, and for hot water heating, solar cooling, and a variety of commercial and industrial uses. The sun's heat also drives the winds, whose energy, is captured with wind turbines.
Renewable Energy. There are many forms of renewable energy. Most of these renewable energies depend in one way or another on sunlight. Wind and hydroelectric power are the direct result of differential heating of the Earth's surface which leads to air moving about (wind) and precipitation forming as the air is lifted.
The forest industry is the biggest user of electricity in manufacturing and the most significant user of renewable energy. Most of renewable energy consumed in Finland consisted of bioenergy, largely in the form of wood-based residuals combusted in pulp and paper plants to fuel industrial processes.
Within the EU Finland is a leading user of renewable energy, together with Sweden and Austria – two countries where hydropower is the most widely exploited source of renewable energy. Renewable Energy Trends in Finland – 2014 (pdf) (507.5 KB) – Updated November 20th 2014.
