The normal range of testosterone levels in healthy adult males is between 280 to 1,100 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL), reports the University of Rochester Medical Center. It’s important to determine if a low testosterone level is due to normal aging or if it’s due to a disorder.
Testosterone levels affect women as well. However, women create lower levels and are more sensitive to androgens than men. Testosterone levels in women vary. According to the University of Rochester Medical Center, normal measurements range from 15 to 70 ng/dL.
If it is used, then levels should be kept within the normal female range at all times. Bioavailable (TTBS / Testosterone, Total and Bioavailable, Serum) or free testosterone (TGRP / Testosterone, Total and Free, Serum) levels should also be monitored to avoid overtreatment.
Testosterone is the prototypical male hormone. It’s what puts hair on your chest and muscles on your frame during puberty. Put simply, testosterone is what makes a man a man. In healthy men, normal testosterone levels generally range between 300 ng/dL and 1050 ng/dL. Unfortunately, levels decline with aging and may fall below the normal range.
Normal Levels of Testosterone. According to Quest Diagnostics, the normal range of total testosterone levels is 250 to 1,100 nanograms per deciliter, or ng/dL, in men age 18 to 69 and 90 to 890 ng/dL in men 70 to 89.
When determining what’s considered a normal testosterone level, it’s best to look at what the reference range is for men your age. Researchers have known for years that T levels typically drop by about 1% every year after you hit your mid-30s.
Monitoring of testosterone replacement therapy: The efficacy of testosterone replacement in females is under study. If it is used, total testosterone levels should be kept within the normal female range at all times. Bioavailable or free testosterone levels also should be monitored to avoid overtreatment.
