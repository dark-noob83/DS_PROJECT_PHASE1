The quotient between the cumulative frequency of a particular value and the total number of data is called as relative cumulative frequency. It is calculated by dividing the cumulative frequency in a frequency distribution by the total number of data points.
An Ogive (cumulative frequency graph) is a graph that represents the cumulative frequencies of the classes in a frequency distribution. It shows the data below or above a particular value. The two types of Ogives are less than Ogive and greater than or more than Ogive.
The relative cumulative frequency or percentage cumulative frequency is the cumulative frequency divided by the total frequency. A cumulative relative frequency distribution shows the proportion of data items and can be computed either by summing the relative frequencies in the relative frequency distribution.
In statistics, it is the running total of all frequencies. Cumulative frequency corresponding to a particular value is the sum of all the frequencies up to and including that value. For example, the below cumulative frequency table displays the valconic eruption between 1991 to 2000.
Cumulative frequency is used to determine the number of observations that lie above (or below) a particular value in a data set. The cumulative frequency is calculated using a frequency distribution table, which can be constructed from stem and leaf plots or directly from the data. The cumulative frequency is calculated by adding each frequency from a frequency distribution table to the sum of its predecessors. The last value will always be equal to the total for all observations, since all frequencies will already have been added to the previous total.
The cumulative frequency is important when analyzing data, where the value of the cumulative frequency indicates the number of elements in the data set that lie below the current value. The cumulative frequency is also useful when representing data using diagrams like histograms.
