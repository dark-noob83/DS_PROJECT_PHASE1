The best time to prune deciduous trees is late winter or early spring (February, March, and early April) before they begin to leaf out. Some trees, such as maples, bleed heavily when pruned in late winter or early spring. If possible, avoid pruning deciduous trees in the spring as they are leafing out. At this time, the tree's energy reserves are low and the bark slips or tears easily. Another poor time to prune is during leaf drop in the fall.
