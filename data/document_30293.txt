Craft brewer retail dollar value in 2011 was an estimated $8.7 billion, up from $7.6 billion in 2010. As of March 26, 2012, the Brewers Association is aware of 250 brewery openings in 2011 (174 microbreweries and 76 brewpubs) and 37 brewery closings (12 microbreweries and 25 brewpubs). Counting brewpubs and microbreweries, the brewery industry in the US includes more than 2,000 establishments, according to the Brewers Association. Annual beer production in the US is about 230 million hectoliters, according to the Barth-Haas Group.
The Brewers Association brewery count is based on the number of brewing facilities actively selling beer in the marketplace. This requires having a Brewers Notice from TTB and paying federal excise taxes on beer.

Together, these terms give the calories per 100 g beer. This is easily converted to calories per 100 ml beer by accounting for the final gravity (FG, in (g beer)/(ml beer)). In turn, 100 ml is converted to 12 oz by a scalar (3.55, in (100ml/12 oz)). The point of all of this is simply to be mindful of what, and how much, you are putting into your body. If you work-out four days per week, burning a couple thousand calories in the process, but then you drink 15 or 20 pints in a week, then you’re still in the hole by a couple thousand calories.
