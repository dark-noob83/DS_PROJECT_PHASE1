1 So, an anesthesiologist might bill $600 for an appendectomy that takes an hour, or bill $2,500 or more for heart surgery that takes six hours. 2  Hospital anesthesia charges typically depend on the complexity of the procedure. The surgeon got paid $140 and the anesthesiologist billed for 1350. After insurance I was billed $928 for 30 minuets of general anesthesia. The hospital and both doctors were in network.
Sutter Health provides the following average cost of the hospital technical component of anesthesia services per surgery based on anesthesia department cost data reported to CMS in Sutter’s Medicare cost reports for the year 2012 and operating room surgery utilization data in the work papers in those reports. 
1 A 2010 survey by the American Society of Anesthesiologists showed a median of about $60 to $64 per unit. 2  So, an anesthesiologist might bill $600 for an appendectomy that takes an hour, or bill $2,500 or more for heart surgery that takes six hours.

1 HealthcareBlueBook.com lists approximate anesthesia costs for a variety of procedures: $469 for a leg fracture surgery, $582 for hernia repair, $619 for a tonsillectomy, $1,243 for a total hysterectomy without cancer, $1,159 for spinal fusion surgery and $2,495 for coronary bypass grafting.

Overall, the average PCCF and NCCF were $49.02 ± $13.63 and $47.27 ± $14.44 per anesthesia unit, respectively (P = 0.595). 1 The mean cost difference of $1.75 in favor of nurse anesthetists is not statistically significant. For example, when there is maximal variance of commercial conversion factors (i.e., 2 standard deviation increase in PCCF to $79.86 and 2 standard deviation decrease of NCCF to $19.25), the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness of physician anesthesia is $13,481/YLS.
Typically, an anesthesia bill for services provided by an Anesthesiologist (Medical Doctor) and/or a CRNA (Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist), is broken into three parts. Each part is assigned a unit value. 1  The anesthetic procedure is first assigned a number of base units based on the complexity of the procedure. 
Best Answer: Anesthesia billing is complicated. We charge by units-there are base units, which vary by procedure, and time units, which are usually one every 15 minutes. The total number of units is multiplied by the unit charge for a total bill. So, it depends on what you're having done, how long it takes, and what that particular anesthesia group's unit charge is. My guess for your situation: $500-750 range, if it is truly an hour. RE: How much does it cost for general anesthesia? I am having surgery to remove a lump in my armpit and they will do a biopsy of another lump at the same time.
1 On average, the cost of anesthesia without any sort of insurance will vary anywhere from $100 for a simple procedure to as much as $3,200 for a complex surgery. 2  To put things in perspective, anesthesia will be charged based on the units. 3  Units can vary anywhere from $50 to $70. 1 Units can vary anywhere from $50 to $70. 2  The more complex a surgery is, the more units it will required. 3  For instance, a bypass surgery could take up to 20 units while getting your wisdom teeth removed can take less than six units.
1 Hospital anesthesia charges typically depend on the complexity of the procedure. 2  For example, at Akron General in Ohio, the typical hospital anesthesia charge is about $200-$1,050, depending on the surgery. The surgeon got paid $140 and the anesthesiologist billed for 1350. After insurance I was billed $928 for 30 minuets of general anesthesia. The hospital and both doctors were in network.
