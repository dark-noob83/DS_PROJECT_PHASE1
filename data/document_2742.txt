The FDA Food Code says that restaurants should cook ground beef to 155°F for 15 seconds. But CDC and USDA say that consumers should cook ground beef to 160°F. The guidance for consumers is different because it is simpler to meet one standard (temperature) than two (temperature and time). 1 Undercooking of ground beef. 2  We defined undercooking as cooking to less than 155°F because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code says that restaurants should cook ground beef to 155°F for 15 seconds. 3  We also looked at whether restaurants used a thermometer to check final temperatures of hamburgers
Bacteria multiply rapidly in the Danger Zone — temperatures between 40 and 140 °F (4.4 and 60 °C). To keep bacterial levels low, store ground beef at 40 °F (4.4 °C) or below and use within 2 days, or freeze. To destroy harmful bacteria, cook ground beef to a safe minimum internal temperature of 160 °F (71.1 °C). Change the water every 30 minutes. Cook immediately. Do not refreeze raw ground meat thawed in cold water or in the microwave oven unless you cook it first. Never leave ground beef or any perishable food out at room temperature for more than 2 hours (1 hour at 90 °F and above).
If ground beef is refrigerated promptly after cooking (within 2 hours; 1 hour if the temperature is above 90 °F), it can be safely refrigerated for about 3 or 4 days. If frozen, it should keep its quality for about 4 months. Change the water every 30 minutes. Cook immediately. Do not refreeze raw ground meat thawed in cold water or in the microwave oven unless you cook it first. Never leave ground beef or any perishable food out at room temperature for more than 2 hours (1 hour at 90 °F and above).
Destruction of the pathogens that may be present in raw ground beef, particularly E. coli, requires a cooking procedure that heats the beef to an internal temperature of 160°F (20). Use of a food thermometer is the only way to determine that the internal temperature of ground beef patties has reached 160°F (13, 19). (Unfortunately, only 13% of consumers always or often use a thermometer when cooking or grilling hamburgers (9).). Prior to 1997, consumers were encouraged to cook ground beef until “brown” in the middle to assure a safe temperature had been reached (11). However, research conducted in the 1990s determined that cooked ground beef color. does not correlate to safe endpoint temperature (2, 6, 7, 11).
Seafood should be thoroughly cooked to an internal temperature of at least 145° F (63° C). Fish that's ground or flaked, such as a fish cake, should be cooked to at least 155° F (68° C), and stuffed fish to at least 165° F (74° C). 
For safety, the USDA recommends cooking hamburgers and ground beef mixtures such as meat loaf to 160°F (70°C) on a meat thermometer. However, “whole muscle” meats such as steaks and roasts may be cooked to approximately. 1  145 °F (60° C) medium rare. 2  160 °F (70° C) medium. 3  175 °F (75° C) well done. Cooking times are based on starting with beef at refrigerator temperature (40 °F). Remember that appliances and outdoor grills can vary in heat. Use a meat thermometer to check for safe cooking and “doneness” of beef.
1 Ground Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 ºF and do not require a rest time. 2  Poultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 ºF. 
Ground beef can turn brown before it reaches 160°F or it may retain a pink color at temperatures above 160°F–cooked color change in ground beef depends on a number of factors, including pH, meat source, packaging, freezing history and added ingredients (8). Prior to 1997, consumers were encouraged to cook ground beef until “brown” in the middle to assure a safe temperature had been reached (11). However, research conducted in the 1990s determined that cooked ground beef color. does not correlate to safe endpoint temperature (2, 6, 7, 11).
