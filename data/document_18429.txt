astigmatism is a common eye condition marked by an irregular curvature of the cornea this type of condition is also known as a refractive error and occurs in nearly everyone to some degree if the cornea is significantly curved the condition must be treated however the eye of a person with astigmatism is shaped more like a football or the back of a spoon for this person when light enters the eye it is refracted more in one direction than the other allowing only part of the object to be in focus at one time objects at any distance can appear blurry and wavy
astigmatism is an optical defect in which vision is blurred due to the inability of the optics of the eye to focus a point object into a sharp focused image on the retina this may be due to an irregular or toric curvature of the cornea or lens the two types of astigmatism are regular and irregular 
description astigmatism refers to curvature of the cornea which is the front surface of the eye this part of the eye is naturally curved to aid the eye in focusing on near and distant objects when the curve of the cornea is irregularly shaped the result can be out of focus vision astigmatism is often congenial however this problem with the cornea may develop after an injury to the eye when astigmatism is present it causes visual images to focus at two places in the back of the eye instead of the normal one place this results in blurry vision and eye strain
astigmatism is a common and usually minor eye condition that causes blurred or distorted vision it occurs when the cornea or lens isn t a perfectly curved shape many people who wear glasses have some degree of astigmatism astigmatism belongs to a group of related eye conditions known as refractive errors regular astigmatism is where the cornea is curved more in one direction than the other it s more common than irregular astigmatism and can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses irregular astigmatism is where the curvature of the cornea isn t even across the surface of the eye
astigmatism is a common eye condition that s usually corrected by eyeglasses contact lenses or surgery astigmatism is caused by an eye that is not completely round and occurs in nearly everybody to some degree for vision problems due to astigmatism glasses contact lenses and even vision correction procedures are all possible treatment options a person s eye is naturally shaped like a sphere
astigmatism is a common condition where the cornea or lens of the eye isn t a perfect curve causing blurred or distorted vision astigmatism is easily corrected by glasses contact lenses or surgery 
astigmatism usually occurs when the front surface of your eye the cornea has an irregular curvature astigmatism is one of a group of eye conditions known as refractive errors and these errors cause a disturbance in the way that light rays are focused within your eye 
astigmatism is usually the result of an irregular shaped cornea or lens the cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the front of the eye the cornea should be regularly curved like the surface of a football but in cases of astigmatism it has an irregular curve more like the shape of a rugby ball regular astigmatism is where the cornea is curved more in one direction than the other it s more common than irregular astigmatism and can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses irregular astigmatism is where the curvature of the cornea isn t even across the surface of the eye
