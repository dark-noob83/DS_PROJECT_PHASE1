Aufbau Principle-electrons fill orbitals starting at the lowest available energy state before filling higher states (1s before 2s). Pauli Exclusion Principle. An orbital can hold 0, 1, or 2 electrons only, and if there are two electrons in the orbital, they must have opposite (paired) spins. When we draw electrons, we use up and down arrows. So, if an electron is paired up in a box, one arrow is up and the second must be down.

There should not be electrons in 2s until 1s is filled! c) violates the Pauli Exclusion Principle since both electrons in the 1s orbital are spin up. This means that both have the same m s and so they have the same four quantum numbers. 
Then that system is described by some wavefunction $\Psi(e_1, e_2)$ where I've used $e_1$ and $e_2$ to denote the two electrons. The Pauli exclusion principle states: $$\Psi(e_1, e_2) = -\Psi(e_2, e_1)$$. that is if you swap the two electrons $\Psi$ changes to $-\Psi$. But suppose the two electrons were exactly the same. In that case swapping the electrons cannot change $\Psi$ because they're identical
As each orbital is filled in the sublevels of the principle quantum numbers, or main energy levels, the electrons exist in an excited state rather than at ground state. The Pauli Exclusion principle states that in each orbital, which can fit two electrons, no two electrons can have identical spins. A spin can be represented by a down arrow or an up arrow, being named similarly. 
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Electrons, which are a Fermion particles, obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means in a system there can never be 2 identical fermions (in this case no 2 electrons in an atom) that occupy the same quantum state.

In lay terms, why is it that particles with 1/2 integer spin cannot occupy the same quantum state but 1 integer spin can? And what exactly does that mean stating that a particle has a 1/2 integer spin versus a 1 integer spin? 
Pauli Exclusion Principle. The nature of the Pauli exclusion principle can be illustrated by supposing that electrons 1 and 2 are in states a and b respectively. The wavefunction for the two electron system would be. but this wavefunction is unacceptable because the electrons are identical and indistinguishable. No two electrons in an atom can have identical quantum numbers. This is an example of a general principle which applies not only to electrons but also to other particles of half-integer spin (fermions). It does not apply to particles of integer spin (bosons). Applications.
The Pauli exclusion principle can be stated as two electrons cannot occupy the same energy state, but this is really only a rough way of stating it. It's more precise to say that the wavefunction of a system is anti-symmetric with respect to exchange of two electrons. The Pauli exclusion principle states: $$\Psi(e_1, e_2) = -\Psi(e_2, e_1)$$. that is if you swap the two electrons $\Psi$ changes to $-\Psi$. But suppose the two electrons were exactly the same.
