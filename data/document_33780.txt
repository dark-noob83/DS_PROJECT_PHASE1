Hamstrings 101. The hamstring group comprises three muscles and their tendons, which originate on the ischial tuberosity (the part of the hip you sit on), flow down the back of the thigh and attach to the front and back of the knee. Like all muscles, the hamstrings are tethered by tendons, in this case to the hip and knee bones.
Stretching Hamstrings is always a challenge. The hamstrings are a group of muscles in the back of your thigh that you use constantly to hold yourself upright. Hence, they are prone to becoming tight. They consist of the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In human anatomy, a hamstring is any of the three tendons contracted by three posterior thigh muscles (semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps femoris), and the term is often also used to refer to the muscles themselves.
Hamstring origin tendinopathy, also called proximal hamstring tendinopathy or high hamstring tendinopathy, are a group of pathologies of the proximal hamstring tendon. They contain tendon degeneration, partial tearing and peritendinous inflammatory reaction.
The Hamstrings consist of three muscles the Biceps Femoris muscle, the Semitendinosus muscle, and the Semimembranosus muscle. These muscles combined are primarily responsible for the flexion of the knee joint (bending of the knee) as well as assisting the extension of the thigh (moving the upper leg backwards).
