Answers. Best Answer: Yep, I can tell you. I just signed up for a new set of school loans. Devry will run you approx $6600 per semester plus books, parking and administrative fees. I normally expect to pay between $400 and $600 for books per semester. admin and parking stuff is cheap. I am assuming that the $7800 per year you were looking at is actually per semester and Devry has 3 semesters per year. Source(s): laparatus · 9 years ago.
