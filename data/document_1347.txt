Motorcycle helmets are the best and often the last line of defense for any biker. They protect what is truly most important -- your head. All of the biker helmets for sale at LeatherUp are either DOT or SNELL approved (and sometimes both); meaning that when you shop with us, the lid you buy is guaranteed to have passed or exceeded the latest and strictest safety standards for the USA. Full-face helmets are exactly that -- they cover your entire face. Because of this full face styles offer the most amount of protection for your head as humanly possible.
