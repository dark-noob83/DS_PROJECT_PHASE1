Gentamicin Bone Cement Injury Lawyers. Antibiotic Gentamicin, when mixed with DePuy Orthopaedics bone cement products, may weaken the bond between cement and bone in joint replacement patients, and cause the prosthetic to slide off of the bone after the patient has suffered a great deal of pain and immobility. In many cases, revision surgeries are needed.
Abstract. Acrylic cement is used to secure implants to bone. When mixed with antibiotics or anticancer agents, acrylic cement slowly releases these agents while retaining its mechanical properties, thus providing specific in situ treatment.
Similar benefits could probably be obtained with other antibiotics mixed into cement, but the clinical experience is too limited to draw conclusions with the same confidence as for gentamicin. The best approach is probably to use both systemic prophylactic antibiotic therapy and ALBC.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antibiotic-impregnated cement is used as a spacer or during re-implantation surgery for the treatment of infected total hip arthroplasties. The routine use of antibiotic-impregnated cement during primary or uninfected revision total hip arthroplasty remains controversial.
- In vitro characteristics of tobramycin-PMMA beads: compressive strength and leaching. - Antibiotic impregnated bone cement in total hip arthroplasty. An in vivo comparison of the elution properties of tobramycin and vancomycin.
Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is mixed in bone cement for the prevention of infections after arthroplasties, and the substance is slowly absorbed by the surrounding tissues.
