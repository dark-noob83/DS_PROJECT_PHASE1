1 UWEX keeps up with the weekly hay market demand, as well as what the price report is for the upper Midwest area. 2  In March of 2011, a small square of prime hay was $179 on average, a small grade 1 hay bale is $90 per ton, and a small grade 2 hay bale averaged $62 per ton. 1 For a larger, round bale of hay, the average hay price is going to vary anywhere from $60 to $200. 2  Generally, the more that is purchased in bulk, the more you’re going to be able to save with your purchase. 3  Larger bales can weight more than 1,000 pounds
Most horse owners have noticed that the price of feed (both hay and grain) has increased. At a hay auction in Sauke Center, MN, the 10-year average for horse quality hay (101-125 relative feed value) is $100 a ton; however, this year (2013), that same hay is averaging $220/ton. Plan ahead and know how much hay you need. Horses eat roughly 2 to 2.5% of their body weight in feed (hay plus grain) each day. For example, an average 1,000 pound horse will eat around 20 to 25 pounds of feed daily, plus water. Weighing the amount of feed offered will help to avoid over-feeding.

I have 8-ish acres of grass. I spend about $300 on grass seed and $300 to have someone no-till drill it. My hay guy has $20 round bales (about 600lb) at $25/ea which means 24 bales for that $600 at, by Winter feeding rates, 1 bale a week among 3 horses. My 3 horses eat a bale and a half a day in winter, next to nothing in summer. I buy a year at a time, though. Hay cost total: are around $1,200 a year, so around $100/month, $33/horse though really winter costs are much higher.

125 lb. $ 26.00 difference per ton. Conclusion to Example I: By purchasing the heavier alfalfa hay (Bale #2) at $9.00 per bale, the horse owner would save $26.00 per ton. For the two different bale weights to be of similar price per ton, the Bale #2, the heavier alfalfa hay, would need to cost $10.63 per bale. 
Hay waste was found to be higher for horses fed costal bermudgrass and alfalfa round bales without a feeder (38% and 31%, respectively) compared to utilizing a ring feeder (2% and 9%, respectively) (1). When fed to beef cattle, different round-bale feeder designs resulted in different amounts of wasted hay (3). The cost of hay fed in a round bale package is typically lower on a per ton basis than small square bales. The lower price coupled with the convenience of feeding are likely factors horse owners consider when feeding round bales.
Ongoing Maintenance. Currently a single bale of hay is $15 to $20 depending on the season and type of hay. A horse eats about one and a half bales per week or 2% of their optimum body weight per day. The monthly cost of hay per horse is approximately $100 to $120. Supplements such as grain, bran and psyllium can be as much as $25 per month per horse. Some horses require special supplements such as glucosomine for arithritic conditions and this can add $40 extra per horse needing it per month.
The farm manager said he had done the math, and that the bales would be over $6.50 each, which was just outrageous! I saw hay in his feed stall and asked if that was the hay he purchased. He said yes, and was proud to say it was only $5 per bale. He had purchased 200 bales for $1000. I lifted one of the bales and was surprised how light they were, so I asked if he knew what the hay has cost per ton. He had no idea.
