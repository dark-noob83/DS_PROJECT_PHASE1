A GFCI receptacle is required to be located within 3 feet or less from the outside edge of each basin; located in a wall or partition that is adjacent to the basin or basin countertop; or installed on the side or face of the basin cabinet not more than 12 below the countertop. This is incorrect. Its not 'code in Mass'. GFCI outlets must be installed in any area where electricity and water may come into contact, including basements, pools, spas, utility rooms, attached garages and outdoors. At least one GFCI outlet is required in an unfinished basement and for most outdoor outlets. rb732.
Is there an NEC non-dwelling unit requirement for receptacles located within 6' of a water source to be GFCI-protected? I'm working commercial construction in Virginia, which is still under the '99 code, and I can't find it in the '99 or '02 code. 
GFCI protection is not required for receptacles serving appliances like dishwashers, or convenience receptacles that do not supply countertop surfaces. Receptacles installed within 6 ft of the outside edge of a wet bar sink must also be GFCI-protected [210.8(A)(7)]. Once again, all 15A and 20A, 125V receptacles installed within a dwelling unit crawl space [210.8(4)] or in each unfinished portion of a basement not intended as a habitable room but used for storage or as a work area [210.8(5)], must be GFCI-protected.
The Code also requires GFCI protection for luminaries, lighting outlets, circulation and sanitation system equipment, and pump motor receptacles located near swimming pools. Per 680.22(A)(5), all 125V receptacles located within 6 m (20 ft) of the walls of a pool or fountain must be protected by a GFCI. In addition, receptacles that supply pool pump motors and that are rated 15A or 20A, 120V through 240V, single phase, must have GFCI protection. Once again, all 15A and 20A, 125V receptacles installed within a dwelling unit crawl space [210.8(4)] or in each unfinished portion of a basement not intended as a habitable room but used for storage or as a work area [210.8(5)], must be GFCI-protected.
Bathroom Outlets. Every bathroom must have at least one electrical outlet. It must be a GFCI, and it must be within 3 feet of the edge of the sink. Either behind or beside the sink is acceptable -- across from the sink on an opposite wall is not. If the bathroom has two sinks, each must have an electrical receptacle within 3 feet. Additionally, no point on the wall should be farther than 24 inches from an outlet in either direction (meaning 4 feet total between outlets), so you must have an outlet within 2 feet of the kitchen sink.
The NEC (NFPA 70 2011 edition) requires GFCI receptacles in kitchens of dwelling units where the receptacles are installed to serve the countertop surfaces. It does not mention a distance requirement in kitchens. The distance requirement of 1.8 meters (6 feet) is for sinks located in areas other than kitchens. Section 210.8 A of NFPA 70 2011 Edition deals with GFCI protection in dwelling units (see below). All outlets that support convenience plug in items within 8 feet of a water source must be GFI protected. However, the new NEC calls for a separate non GFI circuit (home run) for the fridge or other fixed appliances.
Any 15- or 20-ampere, 125-volt receptacle located within 6 feet of the same sink, but not supplying power to a critical load, must be GFCI-protected. 
However, GFCI protection is not required for receptacles installed outside a commercial or industrial occupancy. In addition, 210.63 requires you to install a 15A or 20A, 125V receptacle outlet within 25 ft of heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration equipment. Once again, all 15A and 20A, 125V receptacles installed within a dwelling unit crawl space [210.8(4)] or in each unfinished portion of a basement not intended as a habitable room but used for storage or as a work area [210.8(5)], must be GFCI-protected.
