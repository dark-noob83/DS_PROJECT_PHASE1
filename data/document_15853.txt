Extended Opening hours at Lidl Malta. Malta Independent Wednesday, 11 August 2010, 00:00 Last update: about 2 years ago. For the first time ever, Lidl Malta is organising an extended opening hours week until Saturday. All five Lidl stores in Santa Venera, San Gwann, Zejtun, Safi and Luqa will be open all week from 7am till 11pm. Shoppers who work late will have no reason to rush to other supermarkets as they can take advantage of the longer opening hours and shop to their hearts content at Lidl. From 11am face painters and from midday balloon modellers will be giving kids a smile on their face in the St Venera, Zejtun, Safi and Luqa shops. “The extended opening hours week at Lidl should be quite exciting with daily late night shopping, special sales on non-food items and the ‘Lidl Happy Family Day’ on Saturday.
