Mystery of Va.'s First Slaves Is Unlocked 400 Years Later. By Lisa Rein. JAMESTOWN -- They were known as the 20 and odd, the first African slaves to set foot in North America at the English colony settled in 1607. For nearly 400 years, historians believed they were transported to Virginia from the West Indies on a Dutch warship. Indentured servants from England were common in the settlement, now close to 1,000 people strong. John Rolfe, Virginia's first tobacco planter and husband of the Indian princess Pocahontas, wrote the widely held account of the African landing in a letter to the Virginia Company of London.
The first Africans brought to an English colony in North America were forcibly landed in Virginia in late August 1619. The two privateers sailed to the West Indies and then to Virginia’s post at Old Point Comfort (now Hampton, VA). Some of the Angolans were traded there, including a Christian woman named “Angelo” who was purchased by Lieutenant William Pierce of Jamestown. Some of the Angolans became the property of the governor.
The enslavment of Africans and Indians had been common in Central and South America a century before it was introduced into the English Colonies of North America. In 1619 the first Africans were brought to Jamestown. Their status is presumed to have been indentured servitude. Over the course of a few decades the enslavement of black Africans was established, in the individual English Colonies of North American, one law at a time and one colony at a time. 
In 1619 a Dutch slave ship brought Africans to Jamestown. The captain of the ship traded his slaves for food and the Africans became indentured servants. White farmers traded their tobacco for slaves and made them work on their tobacco plantations. African indentured servants were usually very cheap. Tobacco was easy to grow in Virginia but the colonists could not harvest all of the tobacco by themselves. Both white people from Europe and Africans were brought to Jamestown to help with the farming. Europeans came to Jamestown because they wanted work and to live in the new colony.
