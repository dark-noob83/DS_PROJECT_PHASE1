As a food additive, it is an acidity regulator. It is used in cleaning products where it dissolves mineral deposits especially in alkaline solution. Uses for gluconic acid are also found in the cosmetic industry, treatment of wastewater, in agrochemicals, textile industry, and in photography. It finds use as a food preservative and acidity regulator. Like tartaric acid, calcium tartrate has two asymmetric carbons, hence it has two chiral isomers and a non-chiral isomer. Most calcium tartrate of biological origin is the chiral levorotatory (–) isomer.
It is used as acidity regulator in food products. Fumaric acid esters are used to treat psoriasis, as it has been suggested that the condition is caused by an impairment of fumaric acid production in the skin. It finds use as a food preservative and acidity regulator. Like tartaric acid, calcium tartrate has two asymmetric carbons, hence it has two chiral isomers and a non-chiral isomer. Most calcium tartrate of biological origin is the chiral levorotatory (–) isomer.
Acidity regulators are used to alter and control the acidity or alkalinity on a specific level important for processing, taste and food safety. Inadequate control of the pH can result in the growth of undesirable bacteria in the product that could be a potential health hazard. Examples of acidity regulators in the EU. A pH less than 7 is acidic, a pH of 7 is neutral and a pH greater than 7 is alkaline or basic. Our sense of taste can recognize only major differences in the pH within complex food systems. An acid product would taste sour, while an alkaline product would taste bitter.
1 E366 Potassium fumarate Potassium fumarate is the potassium salt of fumaric acid, E297, and is used as an acidity regulator in food. 2  Journal Articles and References E367 Calcium fumarate Calcium fumarate is the calcium salt of fumaric acid, E297, and is used as an acidity regulator in food. 1 E365 Sodium fumarate Sodium fumarate is the sodium salt of fumaric acid, E297, and is used as an acidity regulator in food. 2  Journal Articles and References
Disodium fumarate is the sodium salt of fumaric acid, used as an acidity regulator in processed foods. Sodium fumarate and fumaric acid are sometimes used as terminal electron acceptors in the cultivation of certain anaerobic microorganisms. It finds use as a food preservative and acidity regulator. Like tartaric acid, calcium tartrate has two asymmetric carbons, hence it has two chiral isomers and a non-chiral isomer. Most calcium tartrate of biological origin is the chiral levorotatory (–) isomer.
The pH of a food is the measure of that product's acidity or alkalinity. The pH-scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH less than 7 is acidic, a pH of 7 is neutral and a pH greater than 7 is alkaline or basic. Our sense of taste can recognize only major differences in the pH within complex food systems. An acid product would taste sour, while an alkaline product would taste bitter.
ACIDITY REGULATORSlactic acidDescription: also known as milk acid, is a chemical compound that plays a role in various biochemical processes and was first isolated in 1780 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele.adipic acidDescription: the organic compound with the formula (CH2)4(COOH)2. It is used in foods (as a baking powder) and given medicinally.
