Corticosteroids are a class of medications that are related to cortisone, a steroid. Medications of this class powerfully reduce inflammation. They are used to reduce the inflammation caused by a variety of diseases. Cortisone is one type of corticosteroid. For the purpose of this review, cortisone is used interchangeably with corticosteroid.. Corticosteroids can be taken by mouth, inhaled, applied to the skin, given intravenously (into a vein), or injected into the tissues of the body. Sometimes these are the desired effects of the injection, as when we inject steroids around nerve entrapments, with the intent that the atrophy will decrease the pressure on the nerve.

A. Steroids (short for corticosteroids) are synthetic drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone that your body produces naturally. Steroids work by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system. They are used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases and conditions
Cortisone (/ˈkɔrtɨsoʊn/ or /ˈkɔrtɨzoʊn/ ; 17-hydroxy-11-dehydrocorticosterone) is a 21-carbon steroid hormone. It is one of the main hormones released by the adrenal gland in response to stress. Cortisone was first produced commercially by Merck & Co. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical.
In the peripheral tissues, cortisol is converted to cortisone by the enzyme 11-beta-steroid dehydrogenase. Cortisol has much greater glucocorticoid activity than cortisone, and, thus, cortisone can be considered an inactive metabolite of cortisol. Cortisone was first produced commercially by Merck & Co. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical.
Oral use of cortisone has a number of potential systemic side-effects: hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression, amenorrhoea, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome and glaucoma, among other problems. Cortisone was first produced commercially by Merck & Co. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical.
A cortisone shot is an injection of synthetic cortisone into an inflamed area of the body. Cortisone is a powerful anti-inflammatory and is used to treat a number of syndromes with inflammation as a cause or side effect. Some syndromes are: 1  Tendonitis. 2  Bursitis. 1 Cortisone can crystallize and cause pain worse than before the shot. 2  This is called  cortisone flare  and is often brief. 3  Cortisone can cause a lightening of the skin. 4  Cortisone can damage the tissues where it is injected.
If steroid use is brief (from a few days to a few weeks), it is possible that none of the listed side effects will occur. The side effects listed here generally do not occur when occasional steroid injections are given for arthritis, tendonitis, or bursitis. However, if steroid use involves high doses and is prolonged (for a few months to several years), an increase in the number of side effects might occur.
Cortisone is a type of medication that treats a wide variety of conditions, mainly by suppressing inflammation. Often referred to as corticosteroids, cortisone drugs belong to a class of medication known as glucocorticoids. Doctors may prescribe cortisone to prevent allergic reactions and to treat arthritis, ulcerative colitis, skin problems such as psoriasis and acne, lupus, eye conditions, and some cancers. Cortisone Shot. Shots of cortisone are used to treat a range of conditions, including bursitis, gout, acne cysts and nodules, tendinitis, and different types of arthritis. To administer a cortisone shot, doctors inject the drug directly into the area of inflammation.
A cortisone injection can also be used to give short-term pain relief and reduce the swelling from inflammation of a joint, tendon, or bursa in, for example, the joints of the knee, elbow, and shoulder and into a broken coccyx. Cortisone was first produced commercially by Merck & Co. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical.
