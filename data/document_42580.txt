Different internal and external conditions are necessary for each type of learning. For example, for cognitive strategies to be learned, there must be a chance to practice developing new solutions to problems; to learn attitudes, the learner must be exposed to a credible role model or persuasive arguments. The specific operations that constitute instructional events are different for each different type of learning outcome. 4. Learning hierarchies define what intellectual skills are to be learned and a sequence of instruction. References: Gagne, R. (1962). Military training and principles
Principles. 1  Different instruction is required for different learning outcomes. 2  Events of learning operate on the learner in ways that constitute the conditions of learning. 3  The specific operations that constitute instructional events are different for each different type of learning outcome. Gagne identifies five major categories of learning: verbal information, intellectual skills, cognitive strategies, motor skills and attitudes.

Conditions of Learning (R. Gagne) http://tip.psychology.org/gagne.html Overview: This theory stipulates that there are several different types or levels of learning. The significance of these classifications is that each different type requires different types of instruction. The specific operations that constitute instructional events are different for each different type of learning outcome. 4. Learning hierarchies define what intellectual skills are to be learned and a sequence of instruction. References: Gagne, R. (1962). Military training and principle

A Tornado WATCH is issued by the NOAA Storm Prediction Center meteorologists who watch the weather 24/7 across the entire U.S. for weather conditions that are favorable for tornadoes. A watch can cover parts of a state or several states. A tornado is a narrow, violently rotating column of air that extends from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground. Because wind is invisible, it is hard to see a tornado unless it forms a condensation funnel made up of water droplets, dust and debris. Tornadoes are the most violent of all atmospheric storm
Summary. This is a popular summary of the most important sections of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act of 1997. Workers must be able to see a summary at their workplaces in the official languages that are spoken there.
