it is 10,100 tons (or 7,300 tons if you consider only the metal frame). The pressure on the ground is equal to that oa a man sitting on a chair (4.5 kg/sq centimeter). Tour Eiffel When built: 1887-1889 Why: International Exhibition; France to have the world's tallest building.
The Eiffel Tower, located on the Champ de Mars, was constructed between 1887 and 1889. It was designed by Gustave Eiffel to act as the entrance to the International Exhibition of Paris of 1889 which commemorated the centenary of the French Revolution.
It cost £35 million to build. It is 300 metres tall, but this height does not include the 24 m aerial (antenna) on the top; the total height of the structure is 324 m (1058 feet). There are also 1,665 steps inside the Eiffel Tower. It weighs 10,000 tons.
The Eiffel Tower is 324 m tall and sits on a square base with sides of 125 m. It would therefore fit inside a cylinder with a radius of 88 metres, giving the cylinder a volume of just under eight million cubic metres. This much air would have a mass of 10 million kilograms.
Its base is square, 125 metres (410 ft) on a side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930.
The Eiffel Tower is an iron lattice tower located in Paris, France, and is one of the most well known landmarks in the world. The tower was completed in 1889. It serves as a … tourist attraction, a venue for observations of the city of Paris, and as a location for TV and radio broadcast antennae.
Including its antennas, the tower reaches a height of 1,063 feet (324 m), or 81 stories. The tower marked the entrance to the 1889 exhibition and was originally built as a temporary structure.
Built in commemoration of the French Revolution, the Eiffel Tower is one of the world's premier tourist attractions. It has been compared to the Great Pyramid of Giza and St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Nothing remotely like it has ever been constructed.
The metal structure of the Eiffel Tower has a mass of 7300 tons, or 7.3 million kilograms. The design of the tower is very space-efficient: if you melted down the pure iron* that it is made of, it would occupy a volume of only 930m3, equivalent to a sphere with a radius of just six metres.
