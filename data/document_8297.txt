We are wondering the amount of time it takes for the skin and flesh to decompose off a body. We were joking about digging up TUPAC to see if the bone marrow was his and was wondering if 14 years was long enough for that to decompose.
Even if perfectly embalmed, every body will sooner or later decompose. How soon depends on the quality of embalming, burial container, burial location (such as mausoleum or in-ground). One funeral director I know exhumed a body 5 years after it was buried.
The process of decomposition is the same for everyone, but how much time it would take varies if the body is in a casket buried in the ground. Some may decompose within a few â€¦ months, and some may take many years.
Answer by Bernard Baumann. Confidence votes 453. The process of decomposition is the same for everyone, but how much time it would take varies if the body is in a casket buried in the ground. Some may decompose within a few months, and some may take many years. There's no cut-and-dry answer.
It depends on the environmental conditions on how long it takes it to completely decompose. It can take several weeks or even months. Extra: It takes about a year for the body to decompose to a skeleton and teeth. The process of decomposition slows if it is in a casket.
underground it takes 40- 50 years for the bones to become dry and brittle. it takes alot longer for the body to decompose underground that it is in water or above ground. and yes maggots can get into the coffin-but it is by the fly known as the coffin fly. it can live its whole life underground. it takes about 4 days to dig .5m into the earth.
