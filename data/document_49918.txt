Crater Lake is the remnant of a volcano formerly known as Mount Mazama. It is located 97 km NW of Klamath Falls, OR. From a probable elevation of roughly 12,000 feet, the top of former Mount Mazama was lost to eruption and collapse that left the present caldera and the deepest lake (1,949 feet) in North America. 
Formation. Crater Lake sits atop Mount Mazama, a Quaternary volcano that is part of the Western Cascade Range. Mazama began to form a half million years ago. 42,000 years ago it stood at its tallest height at 12,000 feet.
Mount Mazama is a stratovolcano in the Oregon segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range located in the United States. The volcano 's collapsed caldera holds Crater Lake, and the entire mountain is located within Crater Lake National Park. 
Crater Lake is 1,932 feet (589 m) deep, making it the deepest lake in the United States. Additional information about Mount Mazama and Crater Lake is presented on the Cascade Volcano Observatory homepage of the U.S. Geological Survey.

Geologic History. Crater Lake partially fills a type of volcanic depression called a caldera that formed by the collapse of a 3,700 m (12,000 ft) volcano known as Mount Mazama during an enormous eruption approximately 7,700 years ago. The caldera has a diameter of approximately 8 km (5 mi) north to south and 10 km (6 mi) east to west, with an approximate depth of 1,200 m (4,000 ft) from the caldera rim to the lake floor. Pyroclastic flows deposited pumice and ash on all flanks of Mount Mazama and in valleys below.

About 6,850 years ago Mount Mazama, a stratovolcano, collapsed to produce Crater Lake, one of the world's best known calderas. The caldera is about 6 miles (10 km) wide.

Mount Mazama began its climactic eruption about 7,700 years ago, blowing out about 50 km 3 (12 mi 3) of magma as pyroclastic materials (mostly rhyodacite pumice and fine ash) in at most a few days. The volcanic ash covered parts of the northwestern states to as far as central Canada. The caldera has a diameter of approximately 8 km (5 mi) north to south and 10 km (6 mi) east to west, with an approximate depth of 1,200 m (4,000 ft) from the caldera rim to the lake floor. Pyroclastic flows deposited pumice and ash on all flanks of Mount Mazama and in valleys below.
Before Crater Lake came into existence, a cluster of volcanoes dominated the landscape. This cluster, called Mount Mazama (for the Portland, Oregon, climbing club the Mazamas), was destroyed during an enormous explosive eruption 7,700 years ago. In the more than 100 years since Duttonâ€™s first survey, scientists have steadily unraveled the mystery of the formation of Crater Lake and with it the demise of Mount Mazama. Mount Mazama. Mount Mazama was formed over a period of nearly half a million years by a succession of overlapping volcanoes. The first eruptions about 420,000 years ago built Mount Scott, located just east of Crater Lake
