Tina, You would not have to pay any taxes whatsoever on any gift received. The only people who would have to worry about taxes in this situation would be the family members but even they won’t have to pay or file a gift tax return because they are allowed to give up to $14,000 per person per year in 2015. For example, say someone gives you $20,000 in one year, and you and the giver are both single. The giver must file a gift tax return, showing an excess gift of $6,000 ($20,000 – $14,000 exclusion = $6,000).
In 2014, you can give a lifetime total of $5.34 million in taxable gifts (that exceed the annual tax-free limit) without triggering the gift tax. Beyond the $5.34 million level, you would actually have to pay the gift tax. But most gifts are not subject to the gift tax. For instance, you can give up to the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 in 2014) to any number of people every year, without facing any gift taxes. Recipients generally never owe income tax on the gifts.
Also, another way for parents to avoid the gift tax is to remember that each parent is entitled to their own individual $14,000 exclusion. This means that your mother and father could each give you $14,000 this year — for a total of $28,000 — without being taxed on that gift. However, if you gave $14,000 to Friend A, but $15,000 to Friend B, you would then be taxed on that $1,000 gift to Friend B. (So, as you can see, unless you’re regularly throwing around five-figure gifts, the gift tax limitations will exclude the gifts most of us give and receive).
That limit is $13,000 under the 2012 regulations. You can also pay tuition to a college or university and claim an educational exclusion. Pay medical expenses directly to a hospital or clinic and claim a medical exclusion. Just like gifts to your spouse or a charity, you’ll pay no gift tax on any of these gifts. If you’re married, you and your spouse can split the value of the gift but you’ll have to report anything over the annual exclusion. You can each give the exclusion limit to the same person -- for a total of $26,000 in 2012. If the person has a spouse, you can give the spouse an equal amount without filing a gift tax return. A gift of a future interest doesn’t qualify for an annual exclusion. 
If you give people a lot of money, you might have to pay a federal gift tax. But the IRS also allows you to give up to $14,000 in 2014 to any number of people without facing any gift taxes, and without the recipient owing any income tax on the gifts. But most gifts are not subject to the gift tax. For instance, you can give up to the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 in 2014) to any number of people every year, without facing any gift taxes. Recipients generally never owe
1 Any taxable money you gift an heir during your lifetime will count toward the estate that you leave them upon your death. 2  For example, if you give your child $200,000 each year for ten years for a total of ten years, and upon death leave them 5 million, your total gift will have a value of $7 million for tax purposes. 1 While you will still be required to file a gift tax return each of the 5 years, you may use $1,000 of your lifetime exemption each year, to exempt that $1,000 from gift tax. 2  At the end of the 5 years, you will have used $5,000 or your $5.43 lifetime exemption.
In 2015, a taxpayer can give up to $14,000 per person per year without being taxed on the gift. For example, this year you could give Friend A $14,000, Friend B $14,000, and your sister $14,000 and not be taxed on your gifts. However, if you gave $14,000 to Friend A, but $15,000 to Friend B, you would then be taxed on that $1,000 gift to Friend B. (So, as you can see, unless you’re regularly throwing around five-figure gifts, the gift tax limitations will exclude the gifts most of us give and receive).
1 For example, there is usually no tax if you make a gift to your spouse or to a charity. 2  If you make a gift to someone else, the gift tax usually does not apply until the value of the gifts you give that person exceeds the annual exclusion for the year. 3  For 2011 and 2012, the annual exclusion is $13,000. 1 If you make a gift to someone else, the gift tax usually does not apply until the value of the gifts you give that person exceeds the annual exclusion for the year. 2
Gifts subject to the gift tax. The following gifts are considered to be taxable gifts when they exceed the annual gift exclusion amount of $14,000 in 2014. Remember, taxable gifts count as part of the $5.34 million in 2014 you are allowed to give away during your lifetime, before you must pay the gift tax. But most gifts are not subject to the gift tax. For instance, you can give up to the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 in 2014) to any number of people every year, without facing any gift taxes. Recipients generally never owe income tax on the gifts.
1 For 2011 and 2012, the annual exclusion is $13,000. 2  Gift tax returns do not need to be filed unless you give someone, other than your spouse, money or property worth more than the annual exclusion for that year. 3  Generally, the person who receives your gift will not have to pay any federal gift tax because of it. 1 If you make a gift to someone else, the gift tax usually does not apply until the value of the gifts you give that person exceeds the annual exclusion for the year. 2
