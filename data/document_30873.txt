Specific causes of high white blood cell count include: 1  Acute lymphocytic leukemia. 2  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). 3  Allergy, especially severe allergic reactions. 4  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 5  Chronic myelogenous leukemia. 6  Drugs, such as corticosteroids and epinephrine. 7  Myelofibrosis. 8  Certain bacterial infections.

1 White blood cell (WBC, leukocyte) count. 2  White blood cells protect the body against infection. 3  If an infection develops, white blood cells attack and destroy the bacteria, virus, or other organism causing it. 4  White blood cells are bigger than red blood cells but fewer in number.
