Both the main minuet and the trio tend to be small ternary structures. Like the minuet/trio movement, the small ternary form follows an ABA' structure. However, the small ternary structure found in the typical minuet is of the rounded binary type.
Formal containers in the classical minuet. A classical minuet movement typically contains a main minuet, followed by a trio that is very similar in structure with a minuet, followed by a da capo repeat of the main minuet (usually performed without taking the repeats). The movement, then, has a large-scale ABA' form: minuet–trio–minuet da capo.
Full Definition of MINUET. 1. : a slow graceful dance in 3⁄4 time characterized by forward balancing, bowing, and toe pointing. 2. : music for or in the rhythm of a minuet.
Minuet and Trio form has a special type of compound temary design (in which. each of the sections has its own small form): 1  Minuet (an aristocratic dance in 3/4 meter). 2  This section usually has a strong downbeat, and has a binary design. 3  in which each sub-section is repeated.

Formal functions in the classical minuet. Each container in the minuet's (or the trio's) small ternary form has its own formal function attached to it. The formal function exhibited in the A section is called exposition function; the B section contrasting middle function; and the A' section recapitulation function.
A minuet is a type of dance piece. It is often associated with Minuet and Trio which usually was the form of the third movement in a traditional symphony from the Classical period.
