Step 2. Marinate your flank steak in a food-safe plastic bag or stainless steel bowl to make it tender and flavorful. Use approximately Â¼ cup of liquid marinade for every pound of flank steak and let it soak for six to 24 hours before cooking. Use a pre-made marinade or create your own.
Broil the steak 4 to 6 minutes per side: Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off any excess, and place it in the middle of the broiler pan. Slide it directly under the broil. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes, flip it over, and broil for another 4 to 6 minutes (8 to 12 minutes total).
1 Let skillet heat for at least 30 minutes. 2  Carefully put flank steak in pan and close oven door. 3  After 5 minutes, flip the steak (it should be well browned on the bottom) and cook just until juices appear on surface of steak, 3 to 4 minutes more for medium-rare meat.
Directions. Preheat oven broiler. Marinate flank steak in lime juice, salt and pepper. Do this right on the paper the steak comes wrapped in for easy clean up. Place on broiler pan and cook, turning once until medium rare, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove to a cutting board to rest.
Coat the grill grate or pan with olive oil, and place the steak on the cooking surface. Allow it to cook for no more than 4-6 minutes on each side, for a total of 16-24 minutes. Flank steak is too thick to be cooked well-done. The end result should be medium-rare.
