Chromosome diseases are genetic diseases where a large part of the genetic code has been disrupted. Chromosomes are long sequences of DNA that contain hundreds or thousands of genes.
There are three types of genetic disorders: 1  Single-gene disorders, where a mutation affects one gene. 2  Chromosomal disorders, where chromosomes (or parts of chromosomes) are missing or changed. 3  Complex disorders, where there are mutations in two or more genes.
Summary. A genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene. A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain. Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure, such as cigarette smoke.
Monogenic diseases result from modifications in a single gene occurring in all cells of the body. Though relatively rare, they affect millions of people worldwide. Scientists currently estimate that over 10,000 of human diseases are known to be monogenic.
This can cause a medical condition called a genetic disorder. You can inherit a gene mutation from one or both parents. A mutation can also happen during your lifetime. There are three types of genetic disorders: 1  Single-gene disorders, where a mutation affects one gene. 2  Sickle cell anemia is an example. 3  Chromosomal disorders, where chromosomes (or parts of chromosomes) are missing or changed. 4  Chromosomes are the structures that hold our genes. 5  Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder.
Spontaneous chromosome errors: Most chromosomal diseases arise spontaneously from parents where neither has the disease. A large genetic mistake typically occurs in the woman's egg, which may partially explain why older women are more likely to have babies with Down syndrome.
