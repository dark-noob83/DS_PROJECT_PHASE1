Your driveway, would be roughly $1,000 of asphalt assuming 3 inches thick and $140/ton. Again, this is just an estimate, because your driveway is small, the unit price will likely be higher. Let’s say it’s $1,500 in paving and then likely another $1,000 to $2,000 in prep work. If you budget around $3,000 you’d likely be safe.
1 A cost estimate for driveway resealing is between twelve and eighteen cents per square foot. 2  For a 1000 square foot driveway this costs a total of $120-$180. 3  Removing an existing driveway costs $50-$60 per hour. 4  Driveways with slopes, curves, or that are otherwise difficult to surface will cost more in labor. 1 For a 1000 square foot driveway this costs a total of $120-$180. 2  Removing an existing driveway costs $50-$60 per hour. 3  Driveways with slopes, curves, or that are otherwise difficult to surface will cost more in labor.
This calculator will estimate the number of tons of asphalt/hot mix that will be required. This estimate is based on a density for the mix of 150 lbs per cubic foot. Please note that densities will vary somewhat between different mixes, but this value is a standard rule of thumb for estimating. 
1 Asphalt driveway paving costs $2-$6 per square foot installed. 2  For a 500 square foot (50 x 10) driveway this works out to an average cost of $2500. 3  A Macadam driveway, also known as tar and chip, consist of crushed stone or gravel sprayed with liquid asphalt. 4  They cost around $2-$5 per square foot. 1 For a 1000 square foot driveway this costs a total of $120-$180. 2  Removing an existing driveway costs $50-$60 per hour. 3  Driveways with slopes, curves, or that are otherwise difficult to surface will cost more in labor.
For the purpose of this discussion we will consider the costs of paving a driveway that is roughly 12'x50' (or 600 square feet) in size. Before the paving process can begin, however, the space must be suitably prepared for the work. According to the RSMeans cost calculation software a standard paving project will include costs such as: 1  Excavation, clearing, and tree chipping or removal-costs include: 2  Workers to clear, cut or chip light trees of less than 6 in diameter will cost $48 per hour; 3  Stump removal averages at $68 per tree;
So if you are looking to get a ball park estimate on how much it will cost to pave your driveway or parking we can can help give you good idea here. 1st of all please note that asphalt paving is substantially cheaper than concrete. 
Average Cost for Asphalt Paving. The average cost of an asphalt paving project is $6,393. The final cost of a project will depend on the square footage that needs to be paved, whether or not permits are required, and whether any obstructions like trees need to be removed before the project can begin. 
1 A concrete driveway 90 feet long and ten feet wide would be around $1800 for materials plus an additional $2000 or so for labor, for a total cost of nearly $4000. 2  Asphalt driveway paving costs $2-$6 per square foot installed. 3  For a 500 square foot (50 x 10) driveway this works out to an average cost of $2500. 1 For a 1000 square foot driveway this costs a total of $120-$180. 2  Removing an existing driveway costs $50-$60 per hour. 3  Driveways with slopes, curves, or that are otherwise difficult to surface will cost more in labor.
Divide the overall weight by 2000. The calculation provides the estimated weight of asphalt in tons. Multiply the total weight of asphalt by the current unit cost of asphalt to estimate the total asphalt price. The unit cost of asphalt varies depending on the price of oil which is between $85 and $150 per ton. Find the current asphalt price from CalTrans (California Department of Transportation)
