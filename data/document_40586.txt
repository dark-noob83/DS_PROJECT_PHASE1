Around 1750, men stop carrying rapiers, and guns became the weapon of choice for a duel. Various guns were used, until a true dueling pistol was officially standardized in 1777, as a 9 or 10 inch barreled, smooth bore flintlock of 1 inch bore, carrying a ball of 48 to the pound.. Historical timeline of the development of modern weapons starting at 1364 with the first recorded use of a firearm and ending in 1892 with the introduction of automatic handguns. 1364 - First recorded use of a firearm. 1380 - Hand guns are known across Europe. 1400s-The matchlock gun appears
The first weapon that worked like a pistol was the matchlock arm, used by Spanish armies in the late 15th Century. Wheel locks were then invented and the weapon was in common … use by French armies by 1544. In 1836 the revolving pistol (revolver) as it now exists was patented by Samuel Colt of Connecticut.
They were originally invented in Germany in the middle 1600's and were the standard military weapon (musket) from that time until about 1830 when they were replaced by the percussion Cap system. The flintlock musket is the weapon prominent in the American Revolution and the Napoloenic Wars. Wheel locks were then invented and the weapon was in common … use by French armies by 1544. In 1836 the revolving pistol (revolver) as it now exists was patented by Samuel Colt of Connecticut.

A musket is a muzzle-loaded, smoothbore firearm, fired from the shoulder. Muskets were designed for use by infantry. A soldier armed with a musket had the designation musketman or musketeer. The musket replaced the arquebus, and was in turn replaced by the rifle (in both cases, after a long period of coexistence).
Flintlock is the general term for any firearm based on the flintlock mechanism. The term may also apply to the mechanism itself. Introduced at the beginning of the 17th century, the flintlock rapidly replaced earlier firearm-ignition technologies, such as the doglock, matchlock, and wheellock mechanisms. Most flintlocks were produced at a time before modern manufacturing processes became common. Even in mass-produced weapons, parts were often handmade. If a flintlock became damaged, or parts wore out due to age, the damaged parts were not easily replaced.

1,589 pages on this wiki. The flintlock mechanism, or just flintlock, was an earlier style of gunlock invented in the mid-1600s, that succeeded the wheellock. It was later adopted by the British Army during the 1660s; they later built and manufactured the iconic Brown Bess rifle, which utilised a flintlock mechanism. An animated diagram of a snaphance while being fired. The snaphance was actually an early version of the flintlock, which was invented around 1570, that is mainly labeled as the main flintlock invention in timelines.
