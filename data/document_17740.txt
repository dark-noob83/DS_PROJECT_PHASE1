The effect of urine pH on the stability of these hormones and creatinine was examined next. Two urine specimens were divided into six portions, and the pH was adjusted to 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10, respectively, using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Samples were stored in a freezer (−20 °C), in a refrigerator (∼4 °C), or at room temperature (15–20°C) for up to 4 weeks. These urine samples were transferred to the −80 °C freezer after their allotted storage time so that all samples could be analyzed together at the conclusion of the experiment.
Urine specimens should not remain unrefrigerated for longer than two hours. Aurine specimen that cannot be delivered to a laboratory within two hours should be stored in a refrigerator. The reason for this precaution is that urinesamples undergo chemical changes at room temperature.
As long as the sample remains in its vacuum seal it may be kept at room temperature away from direct sunlight for days at a time. It will be good for up to six months, in the vacuum seal, if stored in the refrigerator. If frozen in the vacuum seal, it can last for about 1 year. Once the sample is removed from the vacuum seal, it should not remain at room temperature for more than 18 hours. It will keep in the refrigerator, unsealed, for 30 days. In the freezer, an unsealed bag can last up to 6 months.
That includes heat-up and cool-down time -- so for example, if you let t … he turkey sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then put it in the refrigerator, it will be ok as long as it gets to 40 within an hour and a half (total time under 40 is two hours or less). The same goes for cooked turkey.
Fresh-brewed tea can sit at room temperature for up to eight hours if unsweetened. The flavor will begin to sour in sweetened tea after about six hours. The sour taste whi … ch develops is bacteria growth and thus tea that sits too long at room temperature should be avoided.
