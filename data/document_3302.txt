A temperature of more than 103 F is considered a dog fever. When dogs have high temperatures that are the result of hot external temperatures or excessive exercise in humid conditions, the condition is referred to as hyperthermia or heat stroke. When temperatures reach 106 F, serious and fatal complications can occur.
Dogs have higher body temperature than we do. Therefore, even if your dog may feel hot or feverish to you, his body temperature may still be within normal limit. The normal dog temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C). A body temperature of 102°F (38.9°C) or above is considered a fever. Dogs can run a high fever of 104°F (40°C) and sometimes up to 105°F (40.5°C).
The normal body temperature for a dog falls within the range of 100°F to 102.5°F (about 38°C to 39.2°C). If your dog's temperature is outside of this range, you should contact your veterinarian. Body temperature over 104°F or under 99°F indicates an emergency situation. In general, the most accurate way to measure a dog's body temperature is rectally.
The normal body temperature for dogs is between 101 and 102.5 F, compared to 97.6 to 99.6 F for humans. This means your dog may feel feverish to you even when his temperature is completely normal. The word “fever” is typically used to describe elevated body temperature caused by infection or inflammation.
A temperature of 100.5° to 102°F degrees is normal. Taking your dog's temperature by ear. When used properly, ear thermometers are a reliable and less invasive way to take your dog's temperature. An ear thermometer works by measuring infrared heat waves that are emitted from the dog's eardrum area.
