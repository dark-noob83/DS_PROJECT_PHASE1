In addition to the paint being expensive, a professional collision repair and paint shop may charge as much as $500 or more to repair major scratch damage, and will usually not charge any less than $150-$200 for small jobs. Your local new car dealership may charge even more.
Instead of allowing your car's value to depreciate, you can get it fixed. The average cost of repairing a paint chip at a shop is around $400 to $1000 including all paint and labor costs. However, there are ways to save money on your paint repair.
Car Chip Paint Repair Costs. On average you can expect to spend about $50 to $60 to repair your chipped paint yourself. This covers all materials and the paint you need. This is much less then having it done professionally, which can run to several hundreds of dollars.
The whole process can usually be completed in an hour or two save for the waxing of the vehicle. You should allow the touch up paint to dry for one or two days before waxing the repaired area. The total cost of this type of repair-around $20 - $40 and a couple of hours of your time.
The paint itself can cost between $50 to $300 depending on your car's make and model. A shop will also charge you more for the amount of paint used to repair big, deep scratches than small chips. For a major scratch, a shop may charge more than $500 in labor costs alone although if it is a smaller job, that cost may range from $150 to $200 instead.
