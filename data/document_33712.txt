The giant sequoia given good conditions and good gardening techniques will put on growth rings of one inch per year. That would increase the trunk diameter by 2 inches per year. At that rate you could expect the tree to have a trunk diameter of 20 inches in its 10 th year, 60 inches in its 30 th year, 100 inches in its 50 th year, and 200 inches in its 100 th year. 200 inches is nearly 17 feet in trunk diameter. We expect 4 feet of upward growth in the third year for trees in large pots and one-inch plus growth rings. They have the potential to grow faster every year. Giant sequoias grow rapidly tall and less dense when the rising and setting sun is blocked.
Answers. Best Answer: Growth of seedlings is very fast, with young trees known to reach 65 feet tall in 20 years. Growing to heights of 120 feet or more at maturity, most sequoia trees will grow at a rate of 3 to 5 feet per year. Seed production begins at 10–15 years of age.

Annual Growth. Redwoods grow faster than almost any other tree in the world, obtaining 3 to 10 feet of growth per year. Most of this growth occurs in the first century of a redwood's life. Redwoods are large, long-living trees that grow quickly, according to the University of California Davis Arboretum. They grow in a limited area in northern California and southern Oregon, providing shade and protection for plants and wildlife in the area.
Giant sequoias are the world's largest single trees and largest living thing by volume. Giant sequoias grow to an average height of 50–85 m (164–279 ft) and 6–8 m (20–26 ft) in diameter. Record trees have been measured to be 94.8 m (311 ft) in height and over 17 m (56 ft) in diameter. They occur in scattered groves, with a total of 68 groves (see list of sequoia groves for a full inventory), comprising a total area of only 144.16 km 2 (35,620 acres). Nowhere does it grow in pure stands, although in a few small areas, stands do approach a pure condition.
Rate of Growth. Coast redwoods may put on six, eight or even more feet of height in a single season whereas the giant sequoia is more likely to grow about two feet in height per year throughout its first fifty to one hundred years. On the other hand, the massive trunk of the giant sequoia continues to grow-increasing its overall volume-at a rate far surpassing that of any other tree. Growth rings one half inch in thickness are common in young giant sequoias under optimal conditions. This amounts to an increase of one inch of diameter per year.
Overview. Sequoia trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum) grow to approximately 300 feet. These giant trees may live to be 3,000 years old. Also known as sierra redwood trees, sequoias make useful trees in windbreaks and screens. These big trees, native to California, thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Sequoia trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum) grow to approximately 300 feet. These giant trees may live to be 3,000 years old. Also known as sierra redwood trees, sequoias make useful trees in windbreaks and screen
The distance between newly planted sequoias depends on what you are trying to achieve. If you are seeking screening for privacy or windbreaks they can be planted as close together as six feet. If you are attempting to grow specimen giants, 30 to 60 feet apart would be more appropriate. We expect 4 feet of upward growth in the third year for trees in large pots and one-inch plus growth rings. They have the potential to grow faster every year. Giant sequoias grow rapidly tall and less dense when the rising and setting sun is blocked.
The giant sequoia is the fastest growing conifer on earth given the right conditions. We expect 4 feet of upward growth in the third year for trees in large pots and one-inch plus growth rings. They have the potential to grow faster every year. Giant sequoias grow rapidly tall and less dense when the rising and setting sun is blocked.
