In less severe cases, the dog may be treated for two months with a heartworm preventive to kill any migrating heartworm larvae. Then an injection of melarsomine is given to kill the adult heartworms. Four weeks later, the dog is treated with two more injections of the adulticide.
Ask your veterinarian about heartworm prevention. Preventive treatment should begin at 6 or 8 weeks of age in puppies and after tests have been conducted in older dogs to determine if your dog has already been infected. An annual blood test should be run to confirm the dog continues to be negative for heartworms.
Mosquitoes generally carry heartworm larvae and transmit them to pets through bites. Although most pets are required to undergo a heartworm blood test before they’re given any preventive medications, pets that are 6 to 8 weeks of age don’t have to do this test in order to take the medication.
Heartworm disease is only spread through the bite of a mosquito. Inside a dog, a heartworm’s lifespan is five to seven years. Adult heartworms look like strands of cooked spaghetti, with males reaching about 4 to 6 inches in length and females reaching about 10 to 12 inches in length. The number of worms living inside an infected dog is called the worm burden.
Tips for Pet Owners. If you live in an area where the mosquito population is high, you must start giving your puppy the heartworm medication as soon as possible. Interceptor is one such medication that can be given to puppies that are 4 weeks old, provided that they weigh over 2 pounds.
Some heartworm preventives can be given to puppies as young as 4 weeks of age, and kittens at 6 weeks of age. Consult with your veterinarian and consider the preventive you choose. Pay close attention to the medication's label and follow the manufacturer's guidelines.
