Quarter Barrel Keg: Short and stubby in size, the Quarter barrel keg is the same width (16⅛”) as a full barrel, yet approximately 10″ shorter in terms of height. Commonly called a “Pony Keg” or a “Stubby Keg,” this popular keg size will hold the equivalent of sixty-two pints or eighty-two bottles off beer. This smaller sized keg functions just like their larger counterparts with the only difference being that it holds less beer than other types of kegs. This size keg is also a great choice for restaurants and/or bars that have little space, but want to have a large variety of beer available for customers.
One of the great developments in draft beer over the last few years has been expansion of size choices and the reduction of keg sizes. In the past, there was the standard keg – a 1/2 barrel of beer containing 15 gallons. They are heavy and usually a big commitment in terms of price and volume to be of much use to a home user. Other then for a party, a standard 1/2 barrel is not usually the best option for your use at home. Now most domestic beers from the major brewers come in sizes less than 1/2 barrel kegs. You can get most of the major brands in 1/4 kegs that are 7 3/4 gallon
A barrel (Bbl) is the standard method for measuring kegs of beer. Depending on the brewery, beers are kegged in various size containers, as follows: 1  1/2 barrel = 15.5 gallons = 124 pints = 165 12oz bottles - (Full Size Keg). 2  50 Liter = 13.2 gallons = 105 pints = 140 12oz bottles. 3  1/4 barrel (30 Ltr) = 7.75-8.1 gallons = 62-66 pints = 83-88 12oz bottles (Pony Keg). Keg Deposits and Other Charges. There is a $30 deposit for every keg (regardless of size), $60 deposit for every tap, and $30 deposit for every bucket.

Aside from these widely recognized sizes, there is also the torpedo keg or 1/6 barrel keg. Although smaller than the half keg, import keg and quarter barrel, this size is bigger than the corny keg and mini-keg. For a better understanding of this size, it is good to know the dimensions of a 1/6 barrel keg. The average height of 1/6 barrel kegs is 23.375 inches. In addition, they have an average diameter of 9.25 inches. Also called a torpedo keg, a sixth barrel has a net capacity of 19.8 liters, the equivalent of which is 5.23 U.S. gallons.

Most U.S. brewers sell beer in 1⁄2 barrels of 15.5 gallons, 1⁄4 barrels of 7.75 gallons, and 1⁄6 barrels of 5.17 gallons. Since keg sizes are not standardized, the keg cannot be used as a standard unit of measure for liquid volumes. It is half the size of the standard beer keg and equivalent to a quarter of a barrel. The term pony refers to its smaller size – compare pony glass (quarter-pint) and pony bottle. It will serve roughly 82 twelve-ounce cups.
