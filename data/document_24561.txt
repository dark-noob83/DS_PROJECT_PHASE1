These tests include: 1  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . 2  This test is usually the first one used to detect infection with HIV. 3  If antibodies to HIV are present (positive), the test is usually repeated to confirm the diagnosis. 4  If ELISA is negative, other tests are not usually needed. 1 This test is usually the first one used to detect infection with HIV. 2  If antibodies to HIV are present (positive), the test is usually repeated to confirm the diagnosis. 3
The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is a technique used to detect antibodies or infectious agents in a sample. For an antigen ELISA, antibodies are bound to a plastic surface, a sample is added and if antigens from the virus we are testing for are present they will stick to the antibodies. This test then proceeds in the same way as the antibody ELISA. Figure 1. Detection of antigen-antibody binding (IFA and ELISA tests).
ELISA is a popular format of wet-lab type analytic biochemistry assay that uses a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect the presence of a substance, usually an antigen, in a liquid sample or wet sample. ELISA, is used to detect sample antigen. The steps are: 1  A surface is prepared to which a known quantity of capture antibody is bound. 2  Any nonspecific binding sites on the surface are blocked.

ELISA, or EIA, is an acronym for enzyme-linked immuno assay. ELISA is a test that detects and measures antibodies in your blood. This test can be used to determine if you have antibodies that are related to certain infectious conditions. Antibodies are proteins that the body produces in response to harmful substances (antigens). An ELISA test may be used to diagnose: 1  HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). 2  Lyme disease. 3  pernicious anemia.
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a plate-based assay technique designed for detecting and quantifying substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies and hormones. Other names, such as enzyme immunoassay (EIA), are also used to describe the same technology. 
Best Answer: The Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay, or (ELISA), is a biochemical technique used mainly in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. It uses two antibodies. One antibody is specific to the antigen. The other reacts to antigen-antibody complexes, and is coupled to an enzyme. This second antibody, which accounts for enzyme-linked in the test's name, can also cause a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate to produce a signal.
What is ELISA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), also known as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), is a biochemical technique used mainly in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), also known as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), is a biochemical technique used mainly in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample.
An ELISA test uses components of the immune system and chemicals to detect immune responses in the body (for example, to infectious microbes). The ELISA test involves an enzyme (a protein that catalyzes a biochemical reaction). A mixture of purified HCG linked to an enzyme and the test sample (blood or urine) are added to the test system. If no HCG is present in the test sample, then only HCG with linked enzyme will bind. The more HCG that is present in the test sample, the less enzyme linked HCG
