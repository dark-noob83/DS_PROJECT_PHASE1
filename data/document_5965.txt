1 Just Breathe: Studies in Pulmonary Function The lungs move oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out into the air. 2  Pulmonary function studies are conducted to measure the effectiveness of your lung function.
Your heart is located under your ribcage in the center of your chest between your right and left lungs. Its muscular walls beat, or contract, pumping blood to all parts of your body.
The organs of your body that allow you to breathe are called your lungs. You have twoof them that work together, located in your chest inside the rib cage. The main purpose of your lungs is to breathe in good air and breathe out bad air. The good air contains oxygen, which your body needs.
After absorbing oxygen, the blood leaves the lungs and is carried to your heart. Your heart then pumps it through your body to provide oxygen to the cells of your tissues and organs. As the cells use the oxygen, carbon dioxide is produced and absorbed into the blood. Your blood then carries the carbon dioxide back to your lungs, where it is removed from the body when you exhale.
The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic.
Your heart is located between your lungs in the middle of your chest, behind and slightly to the left of your breastbone (sternum). A double-layered membrane called the pericardium surrounds your heart like a sac.
