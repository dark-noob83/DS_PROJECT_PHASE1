Average Annual Dog Walker Salary. Dog walking has increasingly become a popular job for many people. There are relatively low start up costs, ample training opportunities, and millions of dog owners across the United States need to hire a dog walking service on a daily basis. The annual salary for a dog walker would depend upon how many hours the person works per week walkin dogs. For the sake of figuring this out and estimating a dog walker’s average annual salary, let’s use an example of a dog walker that can walk two dogs an hour for $15 each walk.
In some large (and expensive) cities like New York City, dog walkers can charge around $15-20 for a 30 minute walk, while the same $15 might get you an hour long walk in cities such as Houston or San Diego. If your dog is walked alone, you can expect to pay more for the service. If other dogs are walked with yours, it will be less expensive. The downside with pack walking is that your dog will receive less attention and you need to consider whether your dog gets along with other dogs well enough to do this.
