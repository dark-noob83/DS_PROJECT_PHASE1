The manner in which the baby is observed and treated depends upon the doctor taking care of the baby because there are many different ways to approach this issue. Consider reading my long comments about withdrawal in newborns here: http://suboxonetalkzone.com/2010/02/01/withdrawal-in-newborns-lay-off-the-guilt-trip/ If you can taper off the opioids, do so-- slowly, at a rate that you work out with your doc. If you cannot do that, seek the help of an addiction doc. Read More.
Fetal and neonatal addiction and withdrawal as a result of the mother's dependence on drugs during pregnancy. Withdrawal or abstinence symptoms develop shortly after birth. Symptoms exhibited are loud, high-pitched crying, sweating, yawning and gastrointestinal disturbances. PubMed Health Glossary. When a sedative is needed to ameliorate symptoms in newborn infants with opiate withdrawal due to maternal opiate use in pregnancy, phenobarbitone is preferred. Use of opiates (commonly prescribed methadone or illicit heroin) by pregnant women may result in a withdrawal syndrome in their newborn infants.
Symptoms of withdrawal may begin as early as 24 to 48 hours after birth, or as late as five to 10 days. The following are the most common symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome. However, each baby may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms of withdrawal in full-term babies may include: Tremors (trembling). Irritability (excessive crying). Sleep problems. High-pitched crying. Tight muscle tone. Hyperactive reflexes. Seizures. Yawning, stuffy nose, and sneezing
Newborns undergoing withdrawal from opiates and synthetic narcotics such as methadone are classified as having Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, or NAS. Central nervous system symptoms of NAS include irritability, shrill cry, increased startle reflex and Moro reflex and increased muscle tone. The majority of mothers who take methadone in pregnancy will give birth to an addicted baby. Withdrawal affects many systems in your newborn's body. Babies born addicted to methadone will go through withdrawal after delivery, usually within 24 to 48 hours.
Neonatal withdrawal syndrome, generically termed neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), is a complex disorder. It is defined as a constellation of behavioral and physiological signs and symptoms that are remarkably similar despite marked differences in the properties of the causative agent. Withdrawal is generally a function of the drug's half-life; the longer the half-life, the later the onset of withdrawal. A longer half-life is also associated with a decreased likelihood of neonatal abstinence syndrome in the infant.
Overview. Women who are addicted to heroin are often given methadone, a synthetic narcotic, to take instead of heroin. Methadone withdrawal is a common cause of withdrawal in newborns. The majority of mothers who take methadone in pregnancy will give birth to an addicted baby. Withdrawal affects many systems in your newborn's body. Babies born addicted to methadone will go through withdrawal after delivery, usually within 24 to 48 hours.
However, maternal methadone use is also associated with neonatal abstinence syndrome, and its effects on the fetus are similar to the effects of heroin. Methadone's half-life is longer than 24 hours, and acute withdrawal may occur within the first 48 hours after birth and as long as 7-14 days later. Withdrawal is generally a function of the drug's half-life; the longer the half-life, the later the onset of withdrawal. A longer half-life is also associated with a decreased likelihood of neonatal abstinence syndrome in the infant.

Patients discontinuing breast-feeding should develop a plan to wean with the baby's healthcare team. 3) Use of other substances of abuse during breast-feeding will expose the baby to additional risks
