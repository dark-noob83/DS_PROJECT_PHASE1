1 Expect to pay about $2,000-$8,000 for installation of a whole-house air-source heat pump system in an average home (three-ton capacity) with existing usable ductwork. 2  The total costs can double or triple to $4,000-$24,000 or more if new ductwork must be installed or failing ductwork must be replaced. 1 In an older home, adding an electric heat pump might require hiring an electrician to upgrade the electrical panel to 200 amps, which can cost an additional $1,300 -$3,000.
Standard efficiency heat pumps cost much less than the price of high efficiency heat pump systems for your home. In this next price table, we want to share the effect of efficiency, on heat pump prices. Table below is based on a complete, and ARI matched 3-ton heat pump system. 
1 Air source heat pump prices are relatively low, ranging between about $1,500 and $7,500 to buy and install a unit for the average home. 2  The amount of energy needed to create heat drops as the outside temperature rises. 3  Heat pumps double as cooling systems. When entering the market for a heat pump, know that there are two general types of heat pumps available for you: air source heat pumps and geothermal heat pumps. Costs for an air source heat pump usually range from $1,500 to $7,500 for the purchase and installation.
1 For less moderate climates, installing a dual-fuel air source heat pump that works with a natural gas or propane furnace under a single control system can cost $2,500-$5,500 to install just the heat pump, or $5,000-$25,000 or more for a complete system that includes both the electric heat pump and a fossil-fuel furnace. 1 In an older home, adding an electric heat pump might require hiring an electrician to upgrade the electrical panel to 200 amps, which can cost an additional $1,300 -$3,000.
1 Complete installation of a geothermal heat pump (ground-source or water-source) can cost $10,000-$25,000 or more, depending on the length and depth of the underground pipes, soil conditions and other excavation and installation factors. 1 In an older home, adding an electric heat pump might require hiring an electrician to upgrade the electrical panel to 200 amps, which can cost an additional $1,300 -$3,000.
1 The total costs can double or triple to $4,000-$24,000 or more if new ductwork must be installed or failing ductwork must be replaced. 2  CostHelper readers report paying $3,000-$15,000 to have an air source heat pump installed, for an average cost of $7,792. 1 Lower prices are do-it-yourself installation, particularly for window units, which are relatively easy to install. 2  It typically costs about $2,000-$8,000 to install a whole-house electric heat pump system in an average home (three-ton capacity) with existing usable ductwork.
A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. It may be costly to install, with the national average falling between $3,956 and $6,702, but it will save you considerable money in energy costs. Consider the following factors before installing a heat pump: The biggest single factor is determining the price of your heat pump is the size of your house. Air-source heat pumps are less expensive than geothermal heat systems and optimal in cold and mild temperatures. The cost of installing a heat pump will be more expensive for the geothermal type than air-source as it needs to be installed underground.
According to the United States Department of Energy the average cost of a geothermal heat pump system is $2,500 per ton. The agency goes on to say that the average residential property is going to require a unit of three tons to supply their needs. 
Geothermal heating system price varies depending on the type of loop system, usually either vertical or horizontal. On average, a typical home of 2500 square feet, with a heating load of 60,000 BTU and a cooling load of 60,000 BTU will cost between $20,000 to $25,000 to install. 
Heat pump prices and heat pump estimates. When entering the market for a heat pump, know that there are two general types of heat pumps available for you: air source heat pumps and geothermal heat pumps. Costs for an air source heat pump usually range from $1,500 to $7,500 for the purchase and installation.
