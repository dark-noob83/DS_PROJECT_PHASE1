Summary: While the Glass-Steagall Act technically refers to 2 separate federal laws-the G-S Act of 1932 and the G-S Act of 1933 - the term most commonly refers to the 1933 Act, also known as the Banking Act of 1933. It Effectively separated commercial banking from investment banking.
The Banking Act of 1933, widely known as the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, separated banking according to the types of banking business-commercial banking and investment banking. It was passed when a large portion of the U.S. banking system collapsed during the Great Depression in the 1920s and 1930s.
The Glass-Steagall Act, also known as the Banking Act of 1933 (48 Stat. 162), was passed by Congress in 1933 and prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the investment business. It was enacted as an emergency response to the failure of nearly 5,000 banks during the Great Depression.
Glass, a former Treasury secretary, was the primary force behind the act. Steagall, then chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, agreed to support the act with Glass after an amendment was added to permit bank deposit insurance.1 On June 16, 1933, President Roosevelt signed the bill into law.
The Glass-Steagall Act was sponsored by Senator Carter Glass, a former Treasury secretary, and Senator Henry Steagall, a member of the House of Representatives and chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee.
