The accord ended 13 years of Cuban military presence in Angola which was finalized one month early on 25 May 1991, when General Samuel Rodiles Planas boarded the aircraft that took him back to the island. At the same time the Cubans removed their troops from Pointe Noire (Republic of the Congo) and Ethiopia.
In response to the invasion of Angola by South Africa, Cuba deployed an estimated 36 000 troops to Angola to support the MPLA in 1975. By 1979 there was an estimated 60 000 South African troops in Angola with additional support coming from the United States. Cuban military support for the MPLA continued into the 1980s. In 1988 South Africa, Cuba and Angola agreed to withdraw foreign troops from Angola and grant Namibia independence.
On Dec. 22, 1998, Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed a peace agreement in New York that was brokered by the United States, through which South Africa granted full independence to neighbouring Namibia, while Cuba agreed to withdraw its troops.
10,000 Cubans Reported Killed in Angola War. June 16, 1987 | Associated Press. WASHINGTON â€” The Cuban general who defected to the United States last month has told U.S. officials that 10,000 Cuban troops have been killed in Angola since 1976, according to senior Administration officials.
1 (1) It is estimated that Cuba may now have as many as 9,000 troops in Angola, based on the number of Cuban airlifts and sealifts which have presently transited Angola. 2  Military assistance to the MPLA may have cost Cuba the equivalent of US$30 million.
If the estimate of Del Pino is accurate, it would mean that Cuban losses in Angola are proportionately much higher than American fatalities in Vietnam. There were slightly more than 50,000 U.S. servicemen killed in Vietnam, but the U.S. population is about 22 times the size of Cuba's. Jonas Savimbi, leader of the U.S.-backed anti-Communist rebels in Angola, said last year that the number of Cuban dead in Angola totaled 6,200 as of 1984.
I seriously doubt the Cuban motivation to be in Angola was a paltry US$20 million. Cuba at that time was virtually a second world country, and $20 million would hardly cover the expeditionary force's costs even for a few weeks.
