How quickly you recover depends on how serious your shoulder injury is. Separated shoulders may heal over a period of 6 weeks. Dislocated shoulders may take longer -- more like 3 to 12 weeks. But these lengths of time are just approximations. Everyone heals at a different rate. 1  1. 2  2. 3  3.
The same treatment would also be used for a separated shoulder. To treat either injury, you should: 1  Ice your shoulder to reduce pain and swelling. 2  Do it for 20-30 minutes every three to four hours, for 2 to 3 days or longer.
A broken collarbone, or fractured clavicle, is a common injury. It usually happens after a fall or a blow to the shoulder. It takes about six to eight weeks to heal in adults, and three to six weeks in children. The collarbone, or clavicle, is a long slender bone that runs from the breastbone to each of the shoulders.
Your arm will be in a sling for four to six weeks after surgery. If you have regional anesthesia, it will take 12 to 18 hours to wear off, during which time your hand and arm will be numb. When you are able to move your hand, begin making a fist and holding it for five seconds.
In adults, it usually takes about six to eight weeks for a broken collarbone to heal, although it can take longer. In children, it usually takes about three to six weeks to heal. However, it will take at least the same period again to restore full strength to your shoulder. While the fracture heals, a lump may develop along the collarbone. This is normal and often improves over the following months. Occasionally, the fracture doesn't heal (non-union) and you may need to have surgery.
