Then, determine the low end of the range by subtracting 30 percent from your midpoint number, and determine a high end by adding 30 percent. For example, if the number you have in mind as the midpoint is $50,000, subtract 30 percent to get $35,000 ($50,000 x .30 = $15,000), and add 30 percent to get $65,000. Your range is then somewhere between $35,000 and $65,000.
To find the maximum, multiply the minimum times 1 plus the range spread. This creates a salary range that has a minimum of $108,000, a midpoint of $135,500, and a maximum of $162,000. This simple formula can be used to establish a salary range for any job based on the midpoint of available salary market data.
Salary range is the range of pay that has been established to be paid to employees performing a particular job or function. Salary range generally has a minimum pay rate, a maximum pay rate, and a series of mid-range opportunities for pay increases.
To determine the salary range percentile, you must first calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum salary figures. For example, if the salary range for a particular position is between $45,000 and $75,000, the difference between those two figures would be $30,000. Next, find the difference between the salary offer and the minimum salary. In this example, assuming the offer was $55,000, the difference would be $10,000. Finally, divide this difference by the difference in salary range. For this scenario, $10,000 would be divided by $30,000 to give a percentage of 33%. This means that the salary offered is higher than 33% of other salaries in the range, or in the 33rd percentile.
