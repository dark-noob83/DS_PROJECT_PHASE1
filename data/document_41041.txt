Various techniques are used to achieve an etched surface in glass, whether for artistic effect, or simply to create a translucent surface.

High pressure air mixed with an abrasive material cuts away at the glass surface to create the desired effect. The longer the stream of air and abrasive material are focused in one spot, the deeper the cut. Leptat glass is glass that has been etched using a patented acid process.
Etched Glass. Etched glass is sandblasted glass, either by machine or by hand. You can get various gradients and opacities.

By adjusting the abrasive nature of the sand, different textures can be created from a fine dusting, to carving out something that resembles hammered metal.
