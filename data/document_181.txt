It must be healed before you even think about getting in the water. Tattoos take anywhere from two weeks to a months to heal, it can be longer though. Color should not effect healing. If you can't stay out of the water for that long, wait until the following fall to get the tattoo, that way you won't have to miss out. crazzy_nascar_chick · 6 years ago. Thumbs up.
best answer about four weeks how long a tattoo takes to heal depends on your immune system how detailed the tattoo and the size of the tattoo it can take a couple of weeks to around a month
yes its normal. my foot tattoo started to scab only a couple of days after getting it done. it takes about 2 weeks for it to look and feel healed but about 30 days to be completely healed under the skin. my back tattoo also did the same. just take care of it as your tattoo artist instructed you to and u should be fine!
A tattoo normally takes anywhere from 7 to 14 days to look fully healed, depending on the type, style, size and placement. The truth is that it can really take up to a month for a tattoo to be fully healed below the surface of the skin and for your body’s natural healing abilities to lock the ink in completely.

Best Answer: A tattoo will surface heal in approx. one week, varying from person to person, but the healing process beneath will take 1-3 months, during which time strong sunlight and extremes of temperature should be avoided. Make sure you clean your tattoo and use an oniment such as Savlon whilst it's still healing.
Best Answer: It takes a tattoo about 3 weeks to heal completely. It's fair to say it should be treated like an open wound for the first 2 weeks of this time. That means no swimming, soaking in the bath, or doing anything where the transfer of germs is possible.
