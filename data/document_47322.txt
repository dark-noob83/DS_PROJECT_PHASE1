I miscarried 12-6 at 8 weeks. I had a natural miscarriage and only bled for four days. My docotr said we could start trying as soon as we wanted too so my husband and I started TTC right after the bleeding stopped. My HCG counts were 13,100 two days before I miscarried and then 12,500 on the day we lost the baby. Turns out I am pregnant again after my miscarriage.
