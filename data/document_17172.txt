Earthquakes are caused by the release of built-up pressure inside the Earth's crust. An earthquake's power is measured on the Richter scale [Richter Scale: A logarithmic scale used to measure the impact of an earthquake by measuring the amount of energy it generates.
Earthquake Size. The magnitude is the most often cited measure of an earthquake's size, but it is not the only measure, and in fact, there are different types of earthquake magnitude. Early estimates of earthquake size were based on non-instrumental measures of the earthquakes effects.
The location below the earthâ€™s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows.
Magnitude / Intensity Comparison. Magnitude and Intensity measure different characteristics of earthquakes. Magnitude measures the energy released at the source of the earthquake. Magnitude is determined from measurements on seismographs. Intensity measures the strength of shaking produced by the earthquake at a certain location. Intensity is determined from effects on people, human structures, and the natural environment.
The severity of an earthquake can be expressed in several ways. The magnitude of an earthquake, usually expressed by the Richter Scale, is a measure of the amplitude of the seismic waves. The moment magnitude of an earthquake is a measure of the amount of energy released-an amount that can be estimated from seismograph readings.
