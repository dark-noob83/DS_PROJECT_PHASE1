phenol. 1. an extremely poisonous compound obtained by distillation of coal tar or produced synthetically; used as a disinfectant and used extensively as a wood preservative. Called also carbolic acid. 2. any organic compound containing one or more hydroxyl groups attached to an aromatic or carbon ring.
Definition of PHENOL. 1. : a corrosive poisonous crystalline acidic compound C6H5OH present in the tars of coal and wood that in dilute solution is used as a disinfectant. 2. : any of various acidic compounds analogous to phenol and regarded as hydroxyl derivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons.
Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, is an aromatic organic compound with the molecular formula C 6 H 5 OH. It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile.
Medical Definition of PHENOL. 1. : a corrosive poisonous crystalline acidic compound C6H5OH present in coal tar and wood tar that is used in the manufacture of resins and plastics, dyes, and pharmaceuticals (as aspirin) and as a topical anesthetic in dilute solutionâ€”called also carbolic, carbolic acid, hydroxybenzene. 2.
Carbolic acid, more commonly called phenol, is a compound of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with the chemical formula C 6 H 5 OH. The six carbon atoms are arranged in a ring, with a hydroxyl (OH) group bonded to one carbon atom and a hydrogen atom bonded to each of the other five.
Phenol was first extracted from coal tar, but today is produced on a large scale (about 7 billion kg/year) from petroleum. It is an important industrial commodity as a precursor to many materials and useful compounds.
Phenol is appreciably soluble in water, with about 84.2 g dissolving in 1000 mL (0.88 M). Homogeneous mixtures of phenol and water at phenol to water mass ratios of ~2.6 and higher are also possible. The sodium salt of phenol, sodium phenoxide, is far more water-soluble.
