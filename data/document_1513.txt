This estimate is on the high side as the average for this type of work is closer to $25 to $27 per square foot for a basic set-up. The majority of the estimated $51,000 to finish a basement is in labor cost. According to RJK Construction, only about 25 to 30 percent of these costs are for materials. The remaining 70 to 75 percent are for labor and other expenses. This is the highest disparity of any remodel.
1 A lot depends on how much is included and the quality of the final project. 2  Finishing a basement in a relatively new home can start around $20 -$35 a square foot, or $30,000 -$70,000 for 1,500-2,000 square feet -- but it can cost $100,000 or more to create a fully-finished space. 1
1 Adding a basement to an existing house can cost $30,000-$70,000 or more, depending on the size of the existing crawlspace or half-basement or if the house is on a slab foundation, and how much of the work is do-it-yourself and how much is done by contractors. 1 A finished basement typically includes all of that plus flooring, walls, ceilings, drywall, windows, and additional waterproofing and more in order to provide the desired living space. 2  Overall, a basement adds about 3-4 weeks to the new-house construction schedule.
As for the cost of finishing a basement a simple finish should run around $23 to $25 per sq. ft. add $6,000 for a nice bar, $2,500 for a full bath with tiled floor, figure more for higher quality trim like crown, and wainscotting.

The cost of a basement is between 10 and 35 dollars per square feet. Let's say an average basement is 1,000 square feet of finished space.

If your renovation is extensive, requiring plumbing or electrical work (such as building a bathroom or installing HVAC), we recommend hiring a contractor. Expect this type of basement to cost more at least $65,000. A basement finishing system is another option, running $45,000 to $55,000.

The average cost to finish a basement properly, and correctly, varies but the price tag ranges between $45-$65 per square foot of finished space. Finishing a 700 square foot basement may cost a homeowner between $31,500 and $45,500 to create an additional functional, beautiful and useable living space. This cost to finish a basement per square foot is about half the cost of building an addition of the same size onto your home. According to Remodeling Magazine, a Basement Remodel has a 77.6% cost-to-value ratio. Say, you got to pay $20,000 more to finish a basement to a house you pay $600,000 with 20% down, then you need to have $120k for downpayment, plus another $20k to do the work. But if you can find one with basement already finished, you pay $620,000, your upfront money is only $124k, not $140k
