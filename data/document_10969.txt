Scientists have named and cataloged 1.3 million species. How many more species there are left to discover is a question that has hovered like a cloud over the heads of taxonomists for two centuries.
Over 750,000 have been described. Some suppose that there are perhaps as many as three million different species of insects in the world. The most diverse family of insect is beetles, with over 375,000 types identified.
There are over 140,000 invertebrates in the United States--a number that is growing as researchers identify more and more species. Of the 140,000 plus species in the U.S., there are approximately 200 invertebrates on the Endangered Species List.
Of all invertebrates, the insects are by far the most numerous. There are so many species of insects that scientists have yet to discover them all, let alone name or count them. Estimates of the total number of insect fall in the range of 1 to 30 million. The vertebrates represent the remaining 3% of all species and include species that are the most familiar to us: amphibians, reptiles, birds, fishes, mammals.
For the number of different kinds of animals, or species, is higher than youâ€™d ever imagine. The class of animals that human beings belong to, the mammals, includes close to 5,000 species. The number of birds is over 15,000. There are more than 3,000 kinds of snakes, and 300 kinds of turtles.
There are some 15,000 species of protozoans, or one-celled animals, but the record for the number of different species is held by insects, with well over 750,000! The best estimate is that there are at least three million different kinds of animals on earth!
There are 997 species of bats alive today. Bats include two basic groups, the megabats and microbats. There is some controversy over just how closely the megabats and microbats are related, with some scientists arguing that the two groups are differ markedly in brain structure.
