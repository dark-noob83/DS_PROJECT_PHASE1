Introduction. The period of European history referred to as the Renaissance was a time of great social and cultural change in Europe. Generally speaking, the Renaissance spanned from the 14th to the 16th centuries, spreading across Europe from its birthplace in Italy.
The Renaissance: A Creative Change in Art. The Renaissance period -- that spanned roughly from the 14th century to the 17th century -- was a time for change and movement in society. The word Renaissance is derived from the Italian word “Rinascimento” meaning born again.
Revolution is defined as a drastic and far-reaching change in ways of thinking and behaving. There is indeed change during the Renaissance period; however, those changes cannot be considered as drastic change. Hence, I would like to say that the Renaissance is not a revolutionary period. First of all, there is no drastic change in the politics in the Renaissance period. Renaissance inherited Feudalism from the Medieval Period.
The Renaissance was an influential cultural movement which brought about a period of scientific revolution and artistic transformation, at the dawn of modern European history. It marks the transitional period between the end of the Middle Ages and the start of the Modern Age.
The term 'Renaissance' - referring to the revolution in cultural and artistic life that took place in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries-was first applied as late as the 19th century, when the French historian Jules Michelet used it in his History of France of 1855.
