A new home with the radon piping pre-installed by the builder will be a couple of hundred dollars less. We use the most energy efficient fan sold that will effectively reduce the radon levels. Two thirds of our mitigation systems use a 70-watt fan that costs about $80/year to operate. One third of our systems use an 20-watt fan that costs about $25/year to operate.
