When you are referring to a species, you use what it called binomial nomenclature. This means that you use the name of the genus followed by the specific epithet. It's the n â€¦ ame of the genus that is always capitalized, so Homo sapiens (modern humans) or Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood).
The Kapok tree is an emergent tree of the tropical rainforests, and is often described as majestic. It can grow to a height of 150 feet or more, towering over other trees in the rainforest.
Botany: A giant in the rainforests, the kapok tree can reach up to 200 feet in height, sometimes growing as much as 13 feet per year. Due to its extreme height, the kapok, or ceiba tree, towers over the other rainforest vegetation. The trunk can expand to nine or 10 feet in diameter.
Graduate study, travel, work make me an expert in benthics, European languages, wildlife mapping, world fauna and flora. Ceiba pentandra is the scientific name for the kapok tree. Specifically, that's the Latin name for the tree that's native to Caribbean islands, Central America, Mexico, and northern South America. There's another variety that's native to tropical west Africa. Its scientific name is Ceiba pentandra var. guineensis.
The kapok tree is deciduous, shedding all of its leaves during the dry season. As its seeds are easily blown into open areas, kapok trees are some of the first to colonize open areas in the forest. The white and pink flowers of the kapok tree emit a foul odor that attracts bats.
