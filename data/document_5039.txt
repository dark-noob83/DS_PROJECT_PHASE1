The caramelisation reaction occurs when foods containing a high concentration of carbohydrates are cooked at high temperatures using a dry-heat e.g., roasting peanuts, setting-off a chain of chemical reactions: 1  As the food is heated, the sucrose in the food melts and starts to boil. Grilling is the cooking of food using a direct, dry heat. There are several sources of dry heat that may be used for grilling including; charcoal, wood, gas or electric heated grills. Common types of food that are grilled include; fish, meat, vegetables and bread.
Acrylamide is a chemical that can form in some foods during high-temperature cooking processes, such as frying, roasting, and baking. Acrylamide in food forms from sugars and an amino acid that are naturally present in food; it does not come from food packaging or the environment. High temperature cooking, such as frying, roasting, or baking, is most likely to cause acrylamide formation. Boiling and steaming do not typically form acrylamide. Acrylamide is found mainly in foods made from plants, such as potato products, grain products, or coffee.
Cooking brings about chemical changes in food. The texture and taste changes when food is cooked. Baking powder contains sodium hydrogencarbonate. This breaks down when heated, releasing carbon dioxide that helps cake mixtures to rise during baking. Food additives are included in food to improve their shelf-life, appearance and flavour.
Print. By Dr. Mercola. Acrylamide, a cancer-causing and potentially neurotoxic chemical, is created when carbohydrate-rich foods are cooked at high temperatures, whether baked, fried, roasted, grilled or toasted. Acrylamide forms from a reaction between sugars and an amino acid (asparagine) during high-temperature cooking. While many foods – from coffee and breakfast cereal to bread – contain it, the highest levels have been detected in starchy plant-based foods, particularly French fries and potato chips.
Cooking is the process of producing safe and edible food by preparing and combining ingredients, and (in most cases) applying heat. Cooking is a means of processing food, without which many foods would be unfit for human consumption. Grilling is the cooking of food using a direct, dry heat. There are several sources of dry heat that may be used for grilling including; charcoal, wood, gas or electric heated grills. Common types of food that are grilled include; fish, meat, vegetables and bread.
Baking is the process of cooking foods in the dry heat of an oven. During baking, moisture within the food is converted to steam, which combines with the dry heat of the oven to cook the food. Common types of foods that are baked include; bread, cakes, jacket potatoes, and pastries. Grilling is the cooking of food using a direct, dry heat. There are several sources of dry heat that may be used for grilling including; charcoal, wood, gas or electric heated grills. Common types of food that are grilled include; fish, meat, vegetables and bread.
Heat is required to start the cooking reaction that causes a cascade of chemical changes which ultimately result in the “browning” of the food and the formation of a range of odour and flavour compounds. 1 Acrylamide can be formed in foods during heating processes that reach temperatures of 120°C or higher e.g., frying, baking and roasting. French fries, potato crisps, biscuits and crackers, crispbreads, breakfast cereals, roast potatoes, bakery products and coffee were originally found to contain acrylamide.
Spherification of juices and other liquids is a technique of molecular gastronomy. Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking. Its program includes three axes, as cooking was recognized to have three components, which are social, artistic and technical. 
Hide this. 1  Acrylamide, a cancer-causing and potentially neurotoxic chemical, is created when carbohydrate-rich foods are cooked at high temperatures, whether baked, fried, roasted, grilled or toasted.

While many foods – from coffee and breakfast cereal to bread – contain it, the highest levels have been detected in starchy plant-based foods, particularly French fries and potato chips.
As a general rule, the chemical is formed when food is heated enough to produce a fairly dry and brown/yellow surface … so if you're eating cooked foods that contain this characteristic, even if it was once a healthy natural food, like a sweet potato, it could be increasing your risk of cancer significantly.
