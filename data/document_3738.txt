Small animals in the forest called rodents eat the seeds of plants and insects eat the leaves of plants. [Rabbit] [Squirrel] Rabbits and squirrels eat whatever kind of plant food they can find on the forest floor. Herbivores don’t always eat the same things. Herbivores like squirrels eat grass and small plants near the ground and are called grazers. Herbivores that eat leaves, shoots, and twigs are called browsers. Very large animals like elephants, rhinos, and moose are grazers an
The Temperate Deciduous Forest. Temperate deciduous forests can be found in the eastern part of the United States and Canada, most of Europe and parts of China and Japan. The temperate deciduous forest is a biome that is always changing. It has four distinct seasons: winter, spring, summer and fall. Winters are cold and summers are warm
They create a type of canopy for the lower areas of the forest. The tallest of all trees that grow in a temperate deciduous forest biome is the Sequoia. They can be up to 275 feet tall and more than 95 feet in circumference. They are found in areas of California in the United States. For those temperate deciduous forest biomes high up in the mountains, they will be at the cooler side of temperatures. The average temperature is about 50 degrees. It can also snow during the winter in this particular biome. The average precipitation is from 30 to 60 inches per year.
South America has two big areas of deciduous forests in southern Chile and Middle East coast of Paraguay. There are deciduous forests located in New Zealand, and southeastern Australia also. The average annual temperature in a deciduous forest is 50° F. The average rainfall is 30 to 60 inches a year. Most of the forests have been cleared for agriculture. China has been clearing the natural trees for at least 4,000 years and most of the forests are man-made. There are many types of animals in the deciduous forest ranging from mammals like deer to bugs like mosquitoes.
Deciduous Forests Range Deciduous forests are found in the eastern half of North America, Europe, Asia, Russia, Japan, China, and a few spots in South America, Australia and New Zealand. Habitat Deciduous forests are located in the earth’s temperate zones, where it is colder than the rain forests zones, but milder than the conifer forest zones. They have fertile soils with a good amount of rain (30-60 inches a year).
Northeast Asian Deciduous Forest. Deciduous forests can be found in the eastern half of North America, and the middle of Europe. There are many deciduous forests in Asia. Some of the major areas that they are in are southwest Russia, Japan, and eastern China. Most of the forests have been cleared for agriculture. China has been clearing the natural trees for at least 4,000 years and most of the forests are man-made. There are many types of animals in the deciduous forest ranging from mammals like deer to bugs like mosquitoes.
You will also find quite a few larger animals living in the temperate deciduous forest biome. Many of them such as the deer and Black Bear eat grass and shrubs. Others including the fox though feed upon other animals that live in this biome. The winter can be very cold and result in a lack of food. Many birds and other animals migrate from this area during the winter months. For those temperate deciduous forest biomes high up in the mountains, they will be at the cooler side of temperatures. The average temperature is about 50 degrees. It can also snow during the winter in this particular biome. The average precipitation is from 30 to 60 inches per year.

A trophic (feeding) group that is very important in any ecosystem is the scavengers, the animals that feed on organic matter that is already dead. Deciduous = A term used to describe trees or shrubs that drop all their leaves to survive a cold or dry season; not evergreen. Many animals root and store food. Rooting is done by wild boar and such where they look for roots and such during winter. Deer do this to some extent as well.
