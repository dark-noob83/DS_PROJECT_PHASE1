Kilowatt-Hour (kWh). Standard unit of electricity or consumption equal to 1000 watts over one hour, and equivalent to about 3412 British thermal units (Btu) or 860 kilocalories. 
The kilowatt hour (kWh) is a unit of energy... The Calorie is a unit of energy... And the joule (J) is a unit of energy... And these aren't the only units of energy-there's the BTU, the watt hour (Wh), the therm, and plenty of obscure units that you're unlikely to have heard of. 
Kilowatt-hour definition. Kilowatt-hour is an energy unit (symbol kWh or kW h). One kilowatt-hour is defined as the energy consumed by power consumption of 1kW during 1 hour: 1 kWh = 1kW 1h. One kilowatt-hour is equal to 3.6 10 6 joules: 1 kWh = 3.6 10 6 J. The energy E in kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to the power P in kilowatts (kW), times the time t in hours (h).

Part of the IT standards and organizations glossary: The kilowatt-hour (symbolized kWh) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power expended for one hour (1 h) of time. The kilowatt-hour is not a standard unit in any formal system, but it is commonly used in electrical applications. The consumption of electrical energy by homes and small businesses is usually measured in kilowatt-hours. Larger businesses and institutions sometimes use the megawatt-hour (MWh), where 1 MWh = 1,000 kWh.
One kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts (W): 1kW = 1000W. One kilowatt is defined as energy consumption of 1000 joules for 1 second: 1kW = 1000J / 1s. One kilowatt is equal to 1000000 milliwatts: 1kW = 1000000mW.
The kilowatt-hour (symbolized kW⋅h) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power sustained for one hour. One watt is equal to 1 J/s. One kilowatt-hour is 3.6 megajoules, which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour. Note that the international standard SI unit of energy is the joule
Demand = KW Consumption = KWH The difference between demand (KW) and consumption (KWH) is vital to your choices in reducing your energy costs. A simple way to see the difference between demand and consumption is by considering two examples. LIGHTING EXAMPLE: One 100-watt light bulb burning for 10 hours consumes 1,000 watt-hours. or 1 kWh.
The kilowatt hour (symbol kWh, kW·h, or kW h) is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules. One watt is equal to 1 J/s. One kilowatt-hour is 3.6 megajoules, which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour.
