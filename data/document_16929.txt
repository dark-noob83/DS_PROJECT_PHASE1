Multiply the number of hours by the labor rate. This will give you the total direct manufacturing costs. Assuming that the wage rate was $10 per hour, you would multiply it by 1,400 -- the number of hours in this example -- to get total direct manufacturing costs of $14,000.
Other Direct Labor Calculations Once you've determined direct labor costs, you can use the figure to calculate other ratios and metrics. If you want to know direct labor cost per unit, divide total direct labor costs by the total amount of units of goods produced during the period. You could also evaluate direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue. To calculate this metric, divide direct labor costs by total revenue for
Step 4. Finally divide the average hourly direct labor rate by the units produced per hour. This equals the direct labor cost per unit. Use this figure to determine the effectiveness and cost benefit for the production process. This represents one piece of the costing process.
Next multiply every employee's wage rate by the hours worked. Add the total wages earned in one column and add the total hours worked in a second column. Divide the total wages earned by the total hours worked. Once this step is complete you have a direct labor rate per hour for the entire worker population.
The actual hours of direct labor at standard rate equals $43,200. The standard cost of direct labors comes to $48,000. To compute the direct labor price variance, subtract the actual hours of direct labor at standard rate ($43,200) from the actual cost of direct labor ($46,800) to get a $3,600 unfavorable variance.
With these numbers in hand, you can apply the formula to compute the direct labor price variance: According to the direct labor price variance, the increase in average wages from $12 to $13 cause costs to increase by $3,600. Now plug the numbers into the formula for the direct labor quantity variance:
