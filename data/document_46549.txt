It's usually the length of your usual cycle minus 17 days. So, if you have a 28-day cycle, start testing on day 11 and carry on for six days. Use our ovulation calculator to help you work out when your fertile window is likely to be. Paracetamol and other common drugs don't affect the tests. Your egg only survives for between 12 hours and 24 hours if it is not fertilised. There's only a small window each month during which you can conceive, typically no longer than about six days. This time leading up to ovulation is when you are most fertile (your fertile window).
The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase and is from the day of ovulation until the next period begins. The luteal phase has a more precise timeline and usually is only 12-16 days from the day of ovulation. This ultimately means that the day of ovulation will determine how long your cycle is. If fertilization does not occur the egg dissolves after 24 hours. At this time your hormone levels will decrease and your uterine lining will begin to shed about 12-16 days from ovulation. This is menstruation (menstrual period) and brings us back to day 1 of your cycle. The journey then begins all over again.
1 Ovulation testing — to confirm if ovulation is occurring by looking through your temperature charts, using ovulation predictor kits and blood tests and ultrasound. 2  Ovarian function tests –These tests are looking to see how the hormones are functioning and working during your ovulation cycle. Tests for female infertility and a semen analysis should start immediately. Because male factors account for approximately 50% of all infertility cases, it is important to examine both partners for possible infertility issues. At-home semen analysis kits are available to help encourage male fertility testing.
Ovulation, then, may occur much earlier or later than typical guidelines suggest. For example, ovulation may occur on cycle day 23 during a cycle that is 35 days long for a woman with a 12 day luteal phase while ovulation may occur on cycle day 10 for a woman with a 24 day cycle and a 14 day luteal phase length. The lifespan of the egg after ovulation is just 12-24 hours, maybe even less. Fertilization must take place within this timeframe. After this timeframe, the egg begins to degenerate and is no longer capable of being fertilized. This seems like a very short window of time for conception to take place.

Pricing ranges from $1.10/test to $.55/test based on the number of tests you purchase, and shipping is free for orders of $15 or more. The first is so that you can see if your LH surge corresponds properly with your thermal shift. You should shift 1-3 days after your positive OPK, though sometimes it takes as long as five days for those with a slow shift. Another reason is to make sure your temperatures stay up for at least 10 days after ovulation.
You can also begin testing for pregnancy as early as 7-10 days past your ovulation date with an Early Detection Pregnancy Test. If fertilization does not occur the egg dissolves after 24 hours. At this time your hormone levels will decrease and your uterine lining will begin to shed about 12-16 days from ovulation. This is menstruation (menstrual period) and brings us back to day 1 of your cycle. The journey then begins all over again.
Eggs live (and can be fertilised) for 12–24 hours after being released, and sperm can stay alive and active in your body for 12–48 hours after ejaculation, so you don’t have to have intercourse at the exact moment of ovulation to get pregnant. –or–. 1  If the tests reveal a possible fertility issue, especially if you are in your thirties or older, they may make an appointment for you to see a specialist for further tests and possible treatment at your local hospital or fertility unit. 2  For information on what happens at a fertility clinic, see:
Ovulation takes place, on average, about two weeks before your period, though it can vary from 10-16 days before the onset of menstruation depending on the length of your luteal phase. During an “average” 28 day cycle, ovulation is usually expected to take place between cycle days 13-15. The lifespan of the egg after ovulation is just 12-24 hours, maybe even less. Fertilization must take place within this timeframe. After this timeframe, the egg begins to degenerate and is no longer capable of being fertilized. This seems like a very short window of time for conception to take place.
1 Sex once on the day of ovulation should be good enough. 2  However if the ovulation day is not certain, then intercourse every other day (or every day) around the time of ovulation is a good option. 3  If sperm is normal it should live in the reproductive tract of the female for 3 to 5 days. 1 However if the ovulation day is not certain, then intercourse every other day (or every day) around the time of ovulation is a good option. 2  If sperm is normal it should live in the reproductive tract of the female for 3 to 5 days. 3  However, the egg has a life span of only 12 to 24 hours.
