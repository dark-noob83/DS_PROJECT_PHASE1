In late 55, BMW introduced a series with a different fork and frame. Meanwhile they were still selling some of the /3. I have one brochure showing both the new (/2) and the old (/3) series for sale.
The F Series of single-cylinder BMW motorcycles was first launched in 1994, as the F650, and was built by Aprilia around a carbureted 650 cc four-stroke, four-valve, single piston engine, and chain drive. The mission for the F 650 was to provide an entry level BMW motorcycle.
BMW 's motorcycle history began in 1921 when the company commenced manufacturing engines for other companies. Motorcycle manufacturing now operates under the BMW Motorrad brand. BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG) introduced the first motorcycle under its name, the R32, in 1923.
BMW’s first motorcycle, the R32, debuted in 1923, and its Flat-Twin engine layout is still used in its current lineup. The BMW name is known for premium motorcycles that can go long distances, although its current offerings are also geared toward younger and faster riders.
In 1955, BMW began introducing a new range of motorcycles with Earles forks and enclosed drive shafts. These were the 26 hp (19 kW) 500 cc R50, the 30 hp (22 kW) 600 cc R60, and the 35 hp (26 kW) sporting 600 cc R69.

Wobbles are of two types, low and high speed. A low speed wobble is usually in the 30-50 mph range. A high speed wobble is usually in the 65 mph and up range. They are different but can have one source, or they can have several causes. My approach to a wobble is to carefully examine the motorcycle. A visual inspection can often find the most likely causes.
