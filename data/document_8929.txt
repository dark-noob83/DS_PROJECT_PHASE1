Normal body temperature, the neutral zone, the body temperature set point, and the inverse relationship between core and skin temperature. The neutral zone for humans is defined as the range of skin temperatures over which adjustments of skin blood flow suffice to maintain core temperature constant in a resting person.
The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius.
For most people, average temperature is 98.6°F, which is the set point established by the master temperature regulator within the brain--the hypothalamus. If core body temperature varies by about 10°F above or below this range, it poses a high risk of being lethal.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below
At the normal set point, the body temperature, as measured with an oral thermometer, will be approximately 37°C (98.6°F). If body temperature rises above 37.2°C, activity in the control center targets two effectors: (1) muscle tissue in the walls of blood vessels supplying the skin and (2) sweat glands.
It follows that changes in normal body temperature must occur under the control of the regulatory system that operates in the neutral zone and, if there is such a thing as a set point in thermoregulation, it must be manifest in the control of skin blood flow.
The normal body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius, when tested for buccal temperature. Source(s): little medical exp.
