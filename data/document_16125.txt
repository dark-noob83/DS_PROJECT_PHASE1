Definition. Classic galactosemia type I is a metabolic disorder. It causes a low level or lack of an enzyme called galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme changes galactose to glucose. Galactose is a simple sugar found in milk products.
A missing enzyme needed to break down galactose in a person's body causes galactosemia. This disease is an inherited genetic mutation called an autosomal recessive condition.
Galactosemia is a rare hereditary disease that can lead to cirrhosis in infants, and early, devastating illness if not diagnosed quickly. This disease is caused by elevated levels of galactose (a sugar in milk) in the blood resulting from a deficiency of the liver enzyme required for its metabolism (breakdown).
What causes galactosemia? Classic galactosemia occurs when an enzyme called galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) is missing or not functional. This liver enzyme is responsible for breaking down galactose (a sugar byproduct of lactose found in breast milk, cowâ€™s milk and other dairy foods) into glucose.
Galactosemia is a rare disorder that affects the body's ability to break down a food sugar called galactose (found in milk and other dairy products). The body breaks down lactose into galactose and glucose and uses these sugars for energy.
