Tonic muscles are much slower than twitch fibers in terms of time from stimulus to full activation, time to full relaxation upon cessation of stimuli, and maximal shortening velocity.
The iliopsoas is an example of a tonic muscle group. One of the major differences between phasic and tonic muscles that is of particular interest to triathletes is how these muscles respond to faulty loading. Loading is the resistance which the muscles of the body must overcome. In the gym, it may be a dumbbell. In life, it’s gravity.
Tonic seizures. During a tonic seizure, the person’s muscles initially stiffen and they lose consciousness. The person’s eyes roll back into their head as the muscles (including those in the chest, arms and legs) contract and the back arches.
Tonic muscles respond to faulty loading by shortening and tightening. With a lower threshold for stimulation, tonic muscles need very little encouragement to turn on. This can, and often does, result in hyperactivity of a tonic muscle, limiting the motion at the joint(s) over which that muscle crosses.
1 Tonic muscles are antigravity muscles. 2  They can be described as those skeletal muscles that are inherently active to help us oppose gravity and keep us on our feet (particularly on one foot during the gait cycle). 3  Because of this they are also termed as ‘antigravity’ muscles or ‘postural’ muscles.
Here's my notes about muscle groupings into phasic / tonic category. I took them from three different lists. The first one is from Dvorak's book 'Manual Medicine' in which he says his data are based on research by Trischler 1981.
