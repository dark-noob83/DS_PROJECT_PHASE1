Change is a process Change occurs as a process, not as an event. Organizational change does not happen instantaneously because there was an announcement, a kick-off meeting or even a go-live date. Individuals do not change simply because they received an email or attended a training program.
Change Management now submits major Changes to the Change Evaluation process for a formal assessment. Change Scheduling has been revised so that the detailed planning of a Change and the corresponding Release is performed by Release Management.
The definition of a change is the act becoming different. An example of change is how a flower looks the morning after it blooms. Change means to replace one thing for another or to become different. 1  An example of change is someone getting five one dollar bills for a five dollar bill.
