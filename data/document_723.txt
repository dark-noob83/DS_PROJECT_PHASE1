What qualifies as a good typing speed depends on the population you're examining: the general population or professionals. The average person types between 38 and 40 words per minute -- between 190 and 200 characters per minute. However, professional typists type a lot faster on average -- upwards of 65 to 75 WPM. A good typing speed compared to the general population would be over 40 WPM, but compared to professionals it would be in the 75 WPM range.
The average typing speed is 38-40 words per minute (wpm) for adults in a professional working environment (despite many incorrect reports on the web that it is 50-60 wpm).
A respectable typing speed is around 65 words per minute. Approximate average speaking speed can be anywhere fr … om 70 to 130 words per minute. Of course there are many speed talkers who can speek far faster than that, and some people speak slower than that too.
The WPM typing metric is the most commonly used typing speed measurement. However, the WPM metric has a few adjustments to just counting words to compensate for the contrasting length of long words and short words: a word in the WPM standard is five characters.
A typing speed above 40 WPM (Words Per Minute) is higher than the average score, and over 100 WPM is usually considered a high speed (when it is achieved with zero errors).
The average 7th grader should type about 25 WPM (Words Per Minute). The average for an adult is around 40 WPM. However, now-a-days, children are spending more time on the comp … uters thus, increasing their typing speed. So as of 2012, I would say about 30-35 WPM for a seventh grader.
