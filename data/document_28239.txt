DEFINITION of 'Life Expectancy'. 1. The age until which a person is expected to live. 2. The remaining number of years an individual is expected to live, based on IRS issued life expectancy tables. The life expectancy, for required minimum distribution (RMD) calculation purposes, is determined by the current age of the individual.
Life expectancy at birth is the total person-years lived beyond exact age 0 (newborns-column 5 - Tx) divided by the number of newborns (100,000). If you plot the “number of survivors out of the 100,000 newborns to an exact age x” - column 2 Ix above, you’ll see the survival curve for a population. In the real world, a child born today in a country where the life expectancy is 75 is likely to live longer than 75 as the mortality level continues to fall in the future. If a child is born today in a country where the life expectancy is 75, they can expect to live until they are 75… right?
Not exactly. The statistic “ Life expectancy at birth ” actually refers to the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future. In the real world, a child born today in a country where the life expectancy is 75 is likely to live longer than 75 as the mortality level continues to fall in the future. If a child is born today in a country where the life expectancy is 75, they can expect to live until they are 75… right?
Life expectancy. Life expectancy is the expected number of years of life remaining at a given age. It is denoted by, which means the average number of subsequent years of life for someone now aged, according to a particular mortality experience. Because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may well die many years before or many years after their expected survival. The term maximum life span has a quite different meaning. The term life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects although the related term shelf life is used for consumer products and the terms mean time to breakdown and mean time before failures are used in engineering.
So if we wanted to know the life expectancy of a newborn in 2013 using this technique, we’d likely need to wait over 100 years for the answer. Fortunately, there are some statistical techniques that can offer good estimates of life expectancy for both whole populations and cohorts. In the real world, a child born today in a country where the life expectancy is 75 is likely to live longer than 75 as the mortality level continues to fall in the future. If a child is born today in a country where the life expectancy is 75, they can expect to live until they are 75… right?
Report Abuse. It is the average life span of humans or a specific category of humans (such as women or men). If your life expectancy is 70, then you have a 50% chance of dying before you reach 70, and a 50% chance of dying after 70. Aaron · 9 years ago. Thumbs up. 0.
Expectancy refers to what an individual anticipates will happen in a given situation. Expectancy violations refer to actions which are noticeably discrepant from an expectancy and are classified as outside the range of expectancy. In psychology, such behavior is frequently referred to as behavioral dis-confirmation. Expectancy Violations Theory, or EVT, is a theory of communication that analyzes how individuals respond to unanticipated violations of social norms and expectations.
Life expectancy is: how long doctors expect you and/or the population they are dealing with to live. It is usually linked with the terms birth rates and mortality rates. scrawndogg25 · 9 years ago.

Situation. Life expectancy at birth reflects the overall mortality level of a population. It summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups in a given year – children and adolescents, adults and the elderly. Life expectancy at age 60 reflects the overall mortality level of a population over 60 years. In 2013, the global population aged 60 years can expect to live another 20 years on average, 2 years longer than in 1990.
Best Answer: It means how long they predict newborns will live. Someone who's 50 years old right now may have a life expectancy of 85 years old, but those being born right now have a life expectancy of probably more considering what we have today for medical care. This estimate assumes that we don't get any better or any worse over the course of their lifetime. Source(s):
