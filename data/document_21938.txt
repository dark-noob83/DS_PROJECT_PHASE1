As always, there are many different recipes for cooking a leg of lamb. Elise cooks her leg of lamb with the bone in by starting at 425 degrees for 20 minutes then turns the oven down to 300°F and continues to roast the meat for about 10-12 minutes per pound for medium rare lamb. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before cooking it. Preheat the oven to 450 F. degrees. (450º F = 230º C = gas mark 9). Snip the corner of the bag and squeeze the marinade out into the sink.
Medium Rare. Cooking your leg of lamb to a medium-rare finish, with a pronounced pink hue to the meat, means the internal temperature should reach 145 degrees F. With your oven preheated at 325 degrees F, you will cook the lower leg half (called the shank) for 25 to 30 minutes per pound. Medium. Medium for leg of lamb means the inside meat is barely pink, with the internal temperature reaching 160 degrees F. So for the shank half, you will cook the same three-to four-pound specimen for 30 to 40 minutes per pound at 325 degrees F. Cook the sirloin half for 35 minutes per pound.
4 Roast at 425°F for 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 300°F and roast an additional 40 minutes (for a 6 pound boneless roast) to an hour (for a 6 pound bone-in roast). If you are cooking a roast bone-in, the bone will act as an insulator and will require a longer cooking time than a boneless roast. If you are cooking the roast directly in a roasting pan, rack or not, start the roast at 450°F and then reduce the heat to 325°F. Also, the shape of the roast will have an impact on the cooking time. Our roast was rather long and thin, so it cooked up fairly quickly. A thicker roast may take longer than expected.

Sear the lamb roast for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Do Not Cover the roast.
