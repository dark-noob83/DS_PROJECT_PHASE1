A thyroid nodule is simply a lump or mass in the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are relatively common; 6% of adult women and 2% of adult men in the U.S. have a thyroid nodule that can be felt on examination.
Definition. Thyroid nodules are solid or fluid-filled lumps that form within your thyroid, a small gland located at the base of your neck, just above your breastbone. The great majority of thyroid nodules aren't serious and don't cause symptoms. Thyroid cancer accounts for only a small percentage of thyroid nodules.
A thyroid nodule is a lump in your thyroid gland. It can be solid or filled with fluid. You can have a single nodule or a cluster of nodules. Thyroid nodules are common and rarely cancerous. Your thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland that is located near your larynx (voice box). Your thyroid produces two hormones and secretes them into your bloodstream.
Sometimes a thyroid nodule can cause problems. Sometimes a nodule can make too much thyroid hormone. When a nodule makes too much hormone, the rest of the gland is suppressed and doesn't work as hard as usual. Most thyroid nodules are not cancerous.

But if tests show cancer, surgery will be done to remove the nodule.
