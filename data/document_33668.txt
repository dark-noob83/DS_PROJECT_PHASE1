A cameraâ€™s megapixel count simply reflects the number of pixels it can capture by the million. For example, a digital camera capable of 3.1 megapixels has a sensor that can capture an image of 2048 pixels wide by 1536 pixels tall, because 2048 times 1536 = 3,145,728 pixels.
The foundation of megapixels is the lowly pixel. A pixel is one dot of information in a digital photograph. Digital photos today are made up of millions of tiny dots (Mega = Million). This means that a 10 megapixel image contains approximately 10 million pixels, while an 18 megapixel image contains 18 million pixels.
Larger sensors are the reason that 8 megapixels from a digital SLR camera (or 5 or 13) best those 8 megapixels from a smartphone camera. You get roughly the same number of pixels, but the pixels on the dSLR get to be larger, and therefore let in more light.
Digital cameras capture images as pixel elements, known as pixels. Simply put, a megapixel is equal to one million pixels. Digital images are made up of thousands of these tiny, tile-like picture elements. The more pixels, the higher the image resolution. Resolution relates primarily to print size and the amount of detail an image has when viewed on a computer monitor at 100%.
For example if the camera utilizes a 4000x3000 pixel image sensor the total number of pixels is 12,000,000 or 12 million pixels. Resolution rates the number of pixels in megapixels (1 megapixel = 1 million pixels), so a camera with a native resolution sensor of 4000x3000 would be a 12MP camera.
This is the amount that you eat. Some cameras use all the pixels on the sensor (and wind up with a clean plate) and others only use a portion of the pixels for the photograph. A camera's effective megapixel number is the number of pixels on the sensor that are actually used to capture the photographic image.
A megapixel (MP) is a million pixels; the term is used not only for the number of pixels in an image, but also to express the number of image sensor elements of digital cameras or the number of display elements of digital displays.
