For example, two bumpers for the same car may be a considerably different price due to different degrees of deterioration. For estimates, please feel free to contact us; for firm prices, we need to see your parts. Some general price ranges for show chrome items are listed below.
1 Auto Parts Warehouse estimates that a basic steel chrome-plated bumper can cost $120-$1,000 or more, while a carbon fiber bumper might be $650-$5,000 or more.
We specialize in chrome bumper repair and chrome plating of bumpers, bumper guards, moldings, door handles and other misc. custom chrome. Shop with confidence. View our eBay online feedback here; we have helped hundreds of car enthusiasts with chrome for their classic automobiles.
1 Replacing a typical passenger car bumper can cost $100-$1,000 or more for just the bumper, depending on the year, make and model of vehicle; the material the bumper is made of; and whether the bumper was produced by the vehicle's original manufacturer (OEM) or is an aftermarket bumper made by other companies.
For instance I'll quote a bumper at $250-$300 then set the actual price when I've seen the condition of the bumper. You can price shop to know if your getting a fair deal. Almost all chrome shops will give you a quote for free. We offer a free quote online at www.justchromeit.com.
