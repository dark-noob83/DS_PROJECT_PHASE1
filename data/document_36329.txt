Neptune takes 60,190 earth days or 164.79 earth years to complete one rotation around the sun. 19 hours 165 Earth years The orbital period for Neptune is roughly 60,190 days o … r about 165 Earth years (164.79 Earth years). That makes a year on Neptune the equivalant of 165 years on Earth. The planet travels  a distance of approximately 1.43 billion kilometers (888 million  miles) in 686.971 Earth days. It takes 1.88 years for mars to make one revolution around the sun. It takes Mars 25 hours to orbit the sun, (24 hours, 37 mins).
Mars revolves or orbits around the Sun once every 1.88 Earth years, or once every 686.93 Earth days. Mars travels at an average speed of 53,979 miles per hour or 86,871 kilometers per hour in its orbit around the Sun. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 
How long does it take? It takes the Earth one year to orbit the Sun and it takes Mars about 1.9 years (say 2 years for easy calculation) to orbit the Sun. The elliptical orbit which carries you from Earth to Mars is longer than Earth's orbit, but shorter than Mars' orbit. 
It takes Mars about 687 Earth days (1.882 Earth years) to orbit the  Sun.    The orbital path of Mars is about twice that of Earth. Mars orbits  about 227 million kil … ometers away from the Sun. The planet travels  a distance of approximately 1.43 billion kilometers (888 million  miles) in 686.971 Earth days. It takes 1.88 years for mars to make one revolution around the sun. It takes Mars 25 hours to orbit the sun, (24 hours, 37 mins).
Venus revolves or orbits around the Sun once every 0.615 Earth years, or once every 224.7 Earth days. Venus travels at an average speed of 78,341 miles per hour or 126,077 kilometers per hour in its orbit around the Sun. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 2  Learn how. 
Mars takes about 686 Earth days (1.88 earth years) to revolve around the Sun. Because Mars is farther from the Sun, its orbit is longer, and it moves in that orbit at a slower … speed than Earth. + 8 others found this useful. Mars period of revoultion around the sun, its orbit, is 686.971 Earth days long. Earth takes 365.25 days.
Mars period of revolution around the sun, its orbit, is 686.971 Earth days long. The time it takes to make one spin on its axis relative to the background stars is 24h:37min:2 … 2.663sec. The apparent day or solar day on mars is 24h: 39min : 35sec. Mars period of revoultion around the sun, its orbit, is 686.971 Earth days long. Earth takes 365.25 days.
Mercury, the first planet in our solar system can completely orbit around the sun in a mere 88 Earth Days, but nearly takes 60 days to complete a turn of its axis. Venus, which is the closet planet to Earth, takes 224 days to orbit around the sun. Oddly enough Venus takes longer to complete a rotation of its axis, 243 days, than it does to completely orbit the sun. Mars, one of the closest planets to Earth in size takes around 686.97 days to orbit around the earth and has a nearly identical day of 24.3 hours. Uranus takes 30,7999.09 days to orbit around the sun, which is impressive but cannot compare to the 60,190 days it takes Neptune to complete the same task. However, Uranus and Neptune have comparable rotation times of 17.14 and 16 hours respectively.
The orbit of Mars is the second most eccentric in the Solar System. Only Mercury’s orbit is more eccentric. At perihelion Mars is 206,655,215 km from the Sun and at aphelion it is 249,232,432 km distant. That is a variation of of just under 42,600,000 km. The average distance from Mars to the Sun (called the semi-major axis) is 228 million k
