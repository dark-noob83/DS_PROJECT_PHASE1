Chloroplasts are the organelle in plant cells that produce sugar and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water through photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis consists of two stages, the light reactions and the dark reactions. The light reactions convert light into energy (ATP and NADHP) and the dark reactions use the energy and carbon dioxide to produce sugar.
During this process, also known as carbon fixation, energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules generated by the light reactions drives a chemical pathway that uses the carbon in carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere) to build a three-carbon sugar called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
In photosynthesis, solar energy is converted to chemical energy. The chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose (sugar). Carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are used to produce glucose, oxygen, and water.
These sugar molecules are the basis for more complex molecules made by the photosynthetic cell, such as glucose. Then, via respiration processes, cells use oxygen and glucose to synthesize energy-rich carrier molecules, such as ATP, and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product.
Function Chloroplasts are large organelles found in plants cells which are responsible for photosynthesis. Plants use photosynthesis to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose. Chloroplasts are green because of the pigment chlorophyll. Plants can store other pigments in organelles similar to chloroplasts.
As illustrated below, this is the process in which the enzymes in the matrix, which is a liquid in the mitochondria, create usable energy. The organelle use oxygen and the sugars stored in food (glucose), to produce carbon dioxide, water and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These ATP molecules serve as the energy sources for all basic functions of life: such as, breathing, eating, moving, thinking and everything that a living thing must do to survive.
