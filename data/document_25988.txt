The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world when it was completed. in 1937. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2011). They said it couldn't be built. The strait that connects the Pacific Ocean with the San Francisco Bay is one of the most unforgiving stretches of water in the world. 
Total length of Bridge including approaches from abutment to abutment, plus the distance to the Toll Plaza, is 9,150 ft (2,788 m). Length of suspension span including main span and side spans is 1.2 miles (6,450 ft or 1,966 m). The Golden Gate Bridge has two main towers that support the two main cables. The height of a tower above water is 746 ft (227 m). The height of a tower above roadway is 500 ft (152 m). Tower base dimension (each leg) is 33 ft x 54 ft (10 m x 16 m).
Passionate about all things Australian. The main materials used to make the Golden Gate Bridge were 75,293,000 kg of steel; two main cables, each made of 27,572 strands of wire; 600,000 rivets in each of the towers; and concrete. The steel was made in New Jersey, Maryland and Pennsylvania and shipped through the Panama Canal.

Construction of the Golden Gate Bridge started in 1933. The bridge, which was designed by engineer Joseph Strauss was built to connect San Francisco with Marin County across the 1600 meter (+5000ft) wide strait known as the Golden Gate which links the San Francisco Bay with the Pacific Ocean. The total length of the bridge is 8,981ft or 2,737 m. The main span between the two enormous towers is 4,200 ft or 1,280 meters long, making the Golden Gate Bridge the world's largest suspension bridge,
The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, to Marin County, bridging both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. The Golden Gate Bridge is the top most used suicide site/ suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (see List of suicide sites). The deck is about 245 feet (75 m) above the water. After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph or about 120 km/h.
Golden Gate Bridge Facts. The Golden Gate Bridge links the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County. This suspension bridge is an iconic symbol of San Francisco, California. It spans the Golden Gate, the part of San Francisco Bay that opens to the Pacific Ocean. It took only four years to build and was opened in 1937 for traffic. 
Until 1964, the Golden Gate Bridge had the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,300 m). Since 1964 its main span length has been surpassed by ten bridges; it now has the second-longest main span in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. The Golden Gate Bridge is the top most used suicide site/ suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (see List of suicide sites). The deck is about 245 feet (75 m) above the water. After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph or about 120 km/h.
The Golden Gate Bridge has two main cables. Each is 7,650 feet long and contains 27,572 galvanized wires which are bundled into 61 strands. The total length of wire used in both main cables is 80,000 miles. Photos: Original Construction | Main Cable | Main Cable Painting.
