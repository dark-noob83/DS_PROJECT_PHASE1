Answers. Best Answer: 3rd wash sink contains sanitizer. 1st is wash sink (dishsoap), 2nd is rinse. Mop water and sanitizing rags should be changed as often as necessary, or every 2 hours and definitely every shift. Equipment should be sanitized at least every 2hours or more often if needed.
If you want to know when to change the water in your mop bucket, refer to the first paragraph. If you want to know how to clean your floors, keep reading. There is a much better system for cleaning your floor which is a microfiber mop bucket system with the microfiber flat mops.
It is important as nobody wants to put dirty water back on the floor. For general purpose cleaning using a standard dirty water mop bucket, the bucket should be changed frequently but it depends upon how dirty the floor is as well. To minimize the number of water changes, we recommend that the floor first be dusted and then mopped.
Before I get to the “how it works” you will first need to know what you will need to get started with a microfiber mop bucket system. 1  Chemical Bucket – This is to mix your floor cleaning chemicals in as to prepare for mopping. 2  Microfiber Mop Bucket – To hold pre-treated microfiber flat mops.
Let me get right to the point here. You should change the water in your mop bucket when the water is dirty to the point that you can’t see the bottom of your bucket.
One microfiber pocket mop should be enough to clean an area of about 400 to 600 square feet depending on how much soil is on the floor. You then replace the dirty mop with a fresh clean one. Place the dirty one aside to be washed later.
