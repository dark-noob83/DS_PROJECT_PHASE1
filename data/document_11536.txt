Blood sugar level (or blood sugar concentration) is the amount of glucose (a source of energy) present in your blood at any given time. A normal blood glucose level for a healthy person is somewhere between 72 mg/dL (3.8 to 4 mmol/L) and 108 mg/dL (5.8 to 6 mmol/L). It, of course, depends on every individual alone. Note: mg/dL and mmol/L are units of measure. mg/dL is mostly used in USA whereas mmol/L is mostly used in EU and other parts of the world. For easier conversion try our mg/dL mmol/L conversion tool. A blood sugar level between 72 mg/dL (4 mmol/L) and 108 mg/dL (6 mmol/L) is considered normal for a healthy adult.
Normal levels of glucose. Fasting normal glucose range. It is the glucose range after you have fasted with no liquid or food though, water is allowed for 8 hours before testing. This normal glucose range should be 70 – 110 mg/deciliter. Random normal level range of glucose. The sample for this test can be taken any time.
When you measure blood sugar after fasting for at least eight hours, commonly before breakfast, this is called normal fasting blood sugar level. And you must look for these ranges: 70-100 mg/dl. After taking a meal, your blood sugar will rise. In a normal adult it will not pass the ranges of 135-140 mg/dl. Now, you can see that there exists only a narrow range of blood sugar all the day for a normal adult.
A normal fasting blood glucose target range for an individual without diabetes is 70-100 mg/dL (3.9-5.6 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70–130 mg/dL (3.9-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). A person with prediabetes has a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl. If the blood glucose level rises to 126 mg/dl or above, a person has diabetes.&quot; and &quot;•An A1C 5.6% or below is normal. In prediabetes, A1C levels range between 5.7%-6.4%
Adults. A normal blood sugar level is between 72 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (4 to 6 mmol/L) for a healthy person. The concentration of glucose in the blood of a healthy person in the morning on an empty stomach is between 68 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (3.8 and 6.0 mmol/L). Note: mg/dL and mmol/L are units of measure. mg/dL is mostly used in USA whereas mmol/L is mostly used in EU and other parts of the world. For easier conversion try our mg/dL mmol/L conversion tool. A blood sugar level between 72 mg/dL (4 mmol/L) and 108 mg/dL (6 mmol/L) is considered normal for a healthy adult.
Best Answer: In EMS, we consider anything under 60 mg/dl as treatable with glucose. A normal blood sugar is anywhere around 100 mg/dl. Probably in a healthy adult without diabetes you may see a range of 80-120 depending on when they have eaten. If this sounds somewhat subjective you are right. 
Normal blood glucose range for adults without diabetes is 70 - 100 mg/dl. Actually, the sugar levels keep on changing. They are not constant throughout the day. In the morning, low levels are noticed while after lunch, the levels rise, and then they again come down to the normal value. Generally, the levels are first measured after fasting for at least 8 hours (usually overnight fasting). This is known as fasting blood glucose. In adults, the readings that lie between 70 to 99 mg/dl (3.9 to 5.5 mmol/l) are considered as normal. In children, 100 mg/dl is considered as normal level of sugar after fasting. The level of glucose measured two hours after lunch is known as postprandial level
