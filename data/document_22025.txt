LT Tires. LT is not a tire rating but a category of tire. LT stands for light truck and as the name suggests, these tires are designed for trucks and SUVs. The label LT is usually placed in front of the tire size. The other common type of tire is a P tire.
Best Answer: LT (Light Truck) Metric tires have higher maximum inflation pressures and higher load carrying capacities at higher inflation pressures than P-Metric (Passenger Metric) tires. Conversely, below 35 psi Passenger Metric tires carry higher loads than LT Metric tires of the same size. For example: A Passenger Metric tire sized P245/75R16 109S carries its maximum load at 35 psi which is 2,271 pounds. A Light Truck Metric tire sized LT245/75R16 at 35 psi carries a load of only 1,700 pounds.
LT Tires vs. Passenger Tires. …to use a standard load tire on their truck or sport utility when a higher load range is required. Based on the specs they read, they assumed they would carry the load. That was not the case. LT (light truck) tires are designed around the same basic rules as commercial tires.
P tires refer to Passenger tires and LT refers to Light Truck tires. One of the main differences that can be noticed between the two types of tires is that the LT tires are not as flexible as the P tires.
…selected large LT tire sizes be designed with reduced maximum load pressures P-metric tires used on passenger cars and station wagons are rated to carry 100% of the load indicated on the tire's sidewall (or listed for the tire in industry load/inflation charts).
