Lapse in coverage: If your Pennsylvania auto insurance policy lapses, your vehicle registration will be suspended for three months. If the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) determines that you drove your vehicle without insurance, your driver's license will also be suspended for three months. To serve the suspension your registration plate, sticker, card and driver's license need to be surrendered to PennDOT. This pays medical expenses for you and anyone on your policy up to its limits, even if the accident was your fault. Time heals your driver's license: Pennsylvania removes three points from your motor vehicle record when 12 months pass without a violation.
