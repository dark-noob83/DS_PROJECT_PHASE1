The tertiary structure of a protein is a description of the complex and irregular folding of the peptide chain in three dimensions. It is essentially a picture of what the shape of the entire protein actually looks like.
Proteins: Tertiary and Quaternary Structures. The tertiary structure of a protein is a description of the complex and irregular folding of the peptide chain in three dimensions. It is essentially a picture of what the shape of the entire protein actually looks like. Examples are shown in the following ribbon figure of human growth hormone.
In this lesson, the three-dimensional structure of proteins will be discussed: the primary structure of polypeptides, secondary structures found in proteins (α-helix, β-sheet), and the tertiary structure. The concept of an enzyme active site will be introduced.
The tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein. Quaternary structure: the structure formed by several protein molecules (polypeptide chains), usually called protein subunits in this context, which function as a single protein complex. Proteins are not entirely rigid molecules.
Best Answer: In biological systems, structure commonly determines function. The tertiary structure of an enzyme involves all the peptide bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds and disulphide bridges. All these different bonds in combination gives an enzyme its specific 3d structure.
Enzymes as catalysts Enzymes are mainly globular proteins-protein molecules where the tertiary structure has given the molecule a generally rounded, ball shape (although perhaps a very squashed ball in some cases).
