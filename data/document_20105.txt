Messenger RNA is copied (transcribed) from DNA. It carries a special nucleic acid code (template) that is used by Transfer RNA to synthesize proteins. It takes three adjacent … nucleic acids in the Messenger RNA template to code one Amino Acid in a protein.
The genetic code can be expressed as either RNA codons or DNA codons. RNA codons occur in messenger RNA (mRNA) and are the codons that are actually read during the synthesis of polypeptides (the process called translation).
A messenger-RNA code word is called a .2. is the process that takes place when proteins are made from the instructions of messenger-R N A .3. Tr a n s f e r-RNA carries to the messenger-R N A .4. is the process thattakes place when DNA makes a copy of itself. 5.
messenger RNA. a molecule of RNA that is synthesized in the nucleus from a DNA template and then enters the cytoplasm, where its genetic code specifies the amino acid sequence for protein synthesis.
Definition of MESSENGER RNA. : an RNA produced by transcription that carries the code for a particular protein from the nuclear DNA to a ribosome in the cytoplasm and acts as a template for the formation of that protein — compare transfer rna. See messenger RNA defined for kids. ADVERTISEMENT.
