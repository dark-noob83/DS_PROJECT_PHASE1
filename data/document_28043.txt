(8.4.1.1 Thermography of the Human Body.) Nanomedicine. After 3 hours in a hot room (50°C), skin temperature differentials amounted to only 2.5°C (= 35°C to 37.5°C), with an average core/surface gradient of ~1°C. With normal clothing in a room at 15-20 °C, mean skin temperature is 32-35°C.. 32–35 °C. Koehler, Kenneth R. Body Temperature Regulation
Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period. Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) 
When the core body temperature is 89.6 F to 75.2 F (32 C to 24 C), shivering stops and basic metabolism progressively slows down. At a body temperature lower than 75.2 F, almost every mechanism for heat conservation becomes inactive. Core body temperature continues to plummet. 
Your body temperature goes up when you smoke. Here's why: The temperature at the tip of a cigarette is 95 degrees C, or 203 degrees F. Inhale hot smoke, and it raises your lung temperature. When your lungs are hot, they are unable to perform one of their responsibilities, which is to cool or remove heat from your body. 
Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures. The range for normal human body temperatures, taken orally, is 7002309950000000000♠36.8±0.5 °C (7002309927777777777♠98.2±0.9 °F). Other circumstances also affect the body's temperature. The core body temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the second half of the sleep cycle; the lowest point, called the nadir, is one of the primary markers for circadian rhythms.
The body is very good at keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. When you are too hot, the blood vessels in your skin expand (dilate) to carry the excess heat to your skin's surface. Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) 
One square inch (6.5 square centimeters) of skin contains up to 4.5 m of blood vessels, which have as one of their functions the regulation of body temperature. The skin varies in thickness from 0.5 mm on the eyelids to 4 mm or more on the palms and soles. More about your skin: Skin and core body temperatures. As evidence of the importance of radiant heat exchange to the body’s thermal equilibrium, physiologists have discovered that living human skin has extraordinarily high absorptivity and emissivity (0.97), greater than almost any other known substance, matte-black metals included.
Although conduction and convection constantly remove body heat when the air temperature is lower than your skin temperature, their contribution to your body's total heat loss in air is relatively small-only about 10% -20%. This means that when the surrounding (ambient) temperature is lower than average body temperature, i.e., 98.6o Fahrenheit, or 37.0o Celsius, the body loses heat to the environment, and when the ambient temperature is higher, the body gains heat from the environment.
