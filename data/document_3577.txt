Store ginger in a zipper storage bag. To store ginger in a zipper storage bag, simply take the unpeeled ginger and place it in a zipper bag, taking care to push all of the air out of the bag. Place it in the veggie crisper in your fridge and have it stay crisp and fresh for several weeks.
Ginger is a delicious root, but the problem is that it's hard to use the ginger from one root at once, which leads to the problem of storing it. If you want your ginger to last a few weeks -- or even a few months -- then you need to know how to store ginger in the freezer and refrigerator.
Ginger juice will last for upto 1-2 days if stored in the refrigerator. After that there will be loss of nutrients from the juice. It is good to drink freshly made juice everytime. 1  Login to post comment.
Canning. Foods that have a pH above 4.6 require pressure canning for long-term preservation. Pressure canners cook food at up to 250 degrees Fahrenheit for as long as needed to sterilize them; the canning time depends on the food's pH. To preserve ginger juice, pressure-can it at 10 to 15 psi for 1 hour and 25 minutes.
Either way, as long as the ginger is fresh, there should be no problem squeezing out enough juice. (Ginger should be stored, unpeeled, in the vegetable crisper section of the refrigerator-it will last for up to one week if stored in a paper bag, and for 3 - 4 weeks if stored in a plastic bag).
