Nutrient, Liquid and Energy Distribution. Most of the advantages of vascular tissues stem from this functional one: A tracheophyte's xylem and phloem--which comprise the vascular system and are housed in the stem--enable liquids, nutrients and energy to be transported and distributed throughout the whole of the plant.
Land plants can be divided into two main groups: bryophytes and tracheophytes. Bryophytes, which evolutionarily precede tracheophytes, are plants that lack true vascular tissues by which to circulate liquids. These plants include mosses, hornworts and liverworts.
Vascular tissue would be advantageous to plants adapting to life on land as it allows for the ready transfer of water and nutrients found in the substrate to be carried … to the photosynthetic leaves, and for energy to be transferred throughout.
Vascular tissue is used to transport nutrients from the base of the plant to throughout the organism.     That's the gist of it.     Here's how it works:  …    First off, plants don't move like animals. For example, humans can pick up their nutrients (food/water, etc.) with their hands. Plants can't.
The vascular tissue in seedless vascular plants, like ferns, is made up of long,tube like cells. These cells carry water, minerals, and food to the cells throughout the plant. Non vascular plants like the moss are usually only a few cells thick.
