Because PRAMS employs a mixed-mode methodology, two types of questionnaires are available. The self-administered questionnaire is used with the mailing packets, and an interviewer-administered questionnaire is used with the telephone phase. Topics addressed in the PRAMS core questionnaire include barriers to and content of prenatal care, obstetric history, maternal use of alcohol and cigarettes, physical abuse, contraception, economic status, maternal stress, and early infant development and health status.
Questionnaires have advantages over some other types of surveys in that they are cheap, do not require as much effort from the questioner as verbal or telephone surveys, and often have standardized answers that make it simple to compile data. However, such standardized answers may frustrate users. Although they are often designed for statistical analysis of the responses, this is not always the case. The questionnaire was invented by the Statistical Society of London in 1838. A copy of the instrument is published in the Journal of the Statistical Society, Volume 1, Issue 1, 1838, pages 5–13.
A questionnaire is a research instrument consisting of a series of questions and other prompts for the purpose of gathering information from respondents.

Introduction. Questionnaires are the most frequently used data collection method in educational and evaluation research. Questionnaires help gather information on knowledge, attitudes, opinions, behaviors, facts, and other information. This article describes the sequential steps involved in the development and testing of questionnaires used for data collection. Figure 1 illustrates the five sequential steps involved in questionnaire development and testing.
A field of applied statistics, survey methodology studies the sampling of individual units from a population and the associated survey data collection techniques, such as questionnaire construction and methods for improving the number and accuracy of responses to surveys. Polls about public opinion, public health surveys, market research surveys, government surveys and censuses are all examples of quantitative research that use contemporary survey methodology to answer questions about a population.
Structured questionnaires are usually associated with quantitative research, i.e. research that is concerned with numbers (how many? how often? how satisfied?). Within this context, questionnaires can be used in a variety of survey situations, for example postal, electronic, face-to-face and telephone. Postal and electronic questionnaires are known as self-completion questionnaires, i.e. respondents complete them by themselves in their own time. Face-to-face (F2F) and telephone questionnaires are used by interviewers to ask a standard set of questions and record the responses that people give them.
Survey Research. Survey research is a commonly used method of collecting information about a population of interest. There are many different types of surveys, several ways to administer them, and many methods of sampling. There are two key features of survey research: 1  Questionnaires -- a predefined series of questions used to collect information from individuals. Considerations for Designing a Questionnaire. 1  It is important to consider the order in which questions are presented. 2  Sensitive questions, such as questions about income, drug use, or sexual activity, should be put at the end of the survey.
 Define your objectives. The most critical part of developing your questionnaire is defining what you want from it and how you will use the information to answer your evaluation questions. By taking the time to define your purpose and objectives you will reduce the likelihood of gathering unusable information. Evaluation: Questionnaires. This brief is about questionnaires as a data collection method for evaluation. The brief includes a basic overview of questionnaires; when to use them; how to plan and develop them; and their advantages and disadvantages.
The types of surveys according to instrumentation include the questionnaire and the interview. On the other hand, the types of surveys according to the span of time used to conduct the survey are comprised of cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal surveys.
