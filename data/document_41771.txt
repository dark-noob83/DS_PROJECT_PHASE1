Instead of leaving their home, however, they could opt for the installation of an elevator. According to Jay Romano, in the New York Times, the average cost of a residential elevator installation is $15,000.
The hoistway and car are installed directly into your home and simply need a flat surface. Pneumatic elevators, however, only hold one to two people and do not make a home or building wheelchair accessible. One of the safest designs, a hydraulic elevator requires more installation, which may cost $20,000 to $30,000. Your home needs a pit, a machine room, and an interior or exterior hoistway for a hydraulic elevator, and in preparation, you may need to contact an architect to draw up plans.
How much does a residential elevator cost? In general, the fixture of a cab and hoistway can run from $15,000 to $100,000. Several factors go into the overall cost of purchasing and installing a residential elevator.
The average cost for a basic two-stop home elevator in a new home is $21,000 to $25,000, experts say. Three stops run from $28,000 to $30,000 and costs increase for customized cabs, as the residential cars are called. Adding an elevator within an existing home can easily double the expense.
The cost of a commercial elevator ranges from $75,000 to $150,000 for larger buildings and from $20,000 to $28,000 for buildings up to two or three stories, as of September 2014. Many factors affect the cost of elevators, including the size, number of floors it can access, the basic design and safety features.
The cost of home elevators can vary drastically, and if you're in the market, it's important to know how much you should be paying. On the conservative end, a home elevator can cost from $5,000 to $10,000 just to install. On average, an elevator should cost you between $19,000 and $25,000. Cheaper elevators can be as low as $10,000 and the most expensive can reach a heart stopping cost of $100,000.
