Kidney stones, also known as ureteral stones, are created when certain substances in urine – including calcium, oxalate and sometimes uric acid – crystallize. These minerals and salts form crystals, which can then join together and form a kidney stone.
Kidney stones are also known as calculi (plural), or calculus (singular). When it is in the kidney, it is a renal calculus. The tube draining the kidney to the bladder is the ureter, and a stone in the ureter is a ureteral calculus. It is estimated that 20% of us will have a kidney stone in our lifetime.

Increased water intake may help reduce the risk of recurrence of kidney stones but more studies are needed.
