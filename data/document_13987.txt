The Boxer Rebellion began with a series of attack on Chinese Christians. Foreigners in the interior and foreign diplomats in Beijing were also attacked. Armies from Japan and the west crushed the uprising and forced China to grant more privaleges to foreign powers. China also had to pay a large indemnity. The cause of the Boxer Rebellion were pretty much two things: primarily the intrusion of westerners and their Christian missionaries and the weakness of the Qing dynasty. During some time in 1898, a group of Chinese people were fed up and sick of the way westerners were acting in their village

Introduction. In 1900, in what became known as the Boxer Rebellion (or the Boxer Uprising), a Chinese secret organization called the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists led an uprising in northern China against the spread of Western and Japanese influence there. In 1900, the Boxer movement spread to the Beijing area, where the Boxers killed Chinese Christians and Christian missionaries and destroyed churches and railroad stations and other property.
Background. The Boxer Rebellion was a militant uprising within China that lasted from 1898 to 1900. At its core, the rebellion was a grass-roots movement that sought to expel the unwanted influence of Western nations. The rebellion was able to gain wide support amongst the large populations of poor and unemployed in northern China. The Boxer Protocol forced China to repay the Western nations for the loss of life and property caused by the Boxers. Furthermore, the Protocol allowed foreign troops to be stationed in China's capital permanently. Thus the Boxer Rebellion's aim of expelling foreign influence was largely a failure.
The Boxer Rebellion erupted in China in late 1899 and really reached a peak in the early part of 1900. The Boxers came from the north of China. They were largely peasants. About 70 percent of all the Boxers were peasants, it seems like.
