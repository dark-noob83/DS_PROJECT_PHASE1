Calculating Conception. Gestational age, or the age of the baby, is calculated from the first day of the motherâ€™s last menstrual period. Since the exact date of conception is almost never known, the first day of the last menstrual period is used to measure how old the baby is. Use our Pregnancy Calculator to calculate these dates for you. For a woman with a regular period, conception typically occurs about 11-21 days after the first day of the last period. Most women do not know the exact date of conception because it can be challenging to know exactly when ovulation occurs.

Pregnancy lasts an average of 280 days or 40 weeks (almost 10 months) from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). The first day of your last menstrual period is considered day one of pregnancy, even though you probably didn't conceive until about two weeks later. For example, if your cycle is consistently 35 days and the first day of your last menstrual period was November 1, than you probably ovulated 21 days later on November 22. Subtracting 14 days from the date of ovulation gives you November 8 as the adjusted LMP date that you can use to determine the EDC.
The estimated due date (EDD or EDC) is the date that spontaneous onset of labor is expected to occur. The due date may be estimated by adding 280 days (9 months and 7 days) to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP). This is the method used by pregnancy wheels. The accuracy of the EDD derived by this method depends on accurate recall by the mother, assumes regular 28 day cycles, and that conception occurs on day 14 of the cycle. Use of the LMP to establish the due date may overestimate the duration of the pregnancy, and can be subject to an error of more than 2 weeks [5-7].
