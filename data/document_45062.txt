IgE primes the IgE-mediated allergic response by binding to Fc receptors found on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Fc receptors are also found on eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages and platelets in humans.
In medicine, the term IgE would refer to immunoglobulin E. It is considered one of the 5 different types of immunoglobulins for human response as well as sensitivity of the immune system. They are most commonly known as antibodies and they do belong to the family of proteins which is also called gamma globulins.
Guide. An immunoglobulins test is done to measure the level of immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, in your blood. Antibodies are substances made by the body's immune system in response to bacteria, viruses, fungus, animal dander, or cancer cells.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a kind of antibody (or immunoglobulin (Ig)  isotype ) that has only been found in mammals. Monomers of IgE consist of two heavy chains (ε chain) and two light chains, with the ε chain containing 4 Ig-like constant domains (Cε1-Cε4).
Immunoglobulin E (IgE). A type of protein in blood plasma that acts as an antibody to activate allergic reactions. About 50% of patients with allergic disorders have increased IgE levels in their blood serum.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a type of antibody that is present in minute amounts in the body but plays a major role in allergic diseases. IgE binds to allergens and triggers the release of substances from mast cells that can cause inflammation.
Hyper IgE Syndrome (HIES) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by eczema, recurrent staphylococcal skin abscesses, recurrent lung infections, eosinophilia (a high number of eosinophils in the blood) and high serum levels of IgE.
The allergen-specific IgE antibody test is a blood test used to help diagnose an allergy to a specific substance or substances for a person who presents with acute or chronic allergy-like symptoms.
