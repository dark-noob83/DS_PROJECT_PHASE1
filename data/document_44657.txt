Fume Bistro is a locals neighborhood restaurant, nestled north of downtown Napa, off of HWY 29. We are an American bistro with French, Italian and Mediterranean influences. We like to call our food simple, honest and seasonally correct. This is the second time we have been eating on the patio when a private party landed. In this case there were 4 pre-set large tables, and maybe 30 people mingling around them. The problem is when the minglers encroach on the private diners' personal space.
