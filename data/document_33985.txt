From day care to the monthly grocery bill, the cost of raising a child is climbing at a rate that many families can't keep up with. It will cost an estimated $241,080 for a middle-income couple to raise a child born last year for 18 years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday. That's up almost 3% from 2011 and doesn't even include the cost of college.
The report found geographic variations in the cost of raising a child. They were the highest in the urban Northeast at $282,480, followed by the urban West at $261,330 and the urban Midwest at $240,570, which includes Iowa and South Dakota. The urban South came in the lowest at $230,610 for each child.
$245,340. That's the magic number for how much it will cost a middle-income American family, on average, to raise a child born in 2013 until he or she becomes an adult. And families living in the Northeast will be taking on a greater burden, according to a report out Monday.
Nevertheless, the USDA reports that the average cost of raising a child born in 2012 to age 18 is $216,910 for low-income parents, $301,970 for middle income parents and $501,250 for high-income parents.
The average cost of raising a child born in 2013 up until age 18 for a middle-income family in the U.S. is approximately $245,340 (or $304,480, adjusted for projected inflation), according to the latest annual Cost of Raising A Child report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The amount spent on raising a child varies by household income. Husband-wife families with annual before-tax incomes of more than $105,000 in 2012 will spend a whopping $501,250 to raise a child born in 2012 to age 18.
To raise a child born in 2013 to the age of 18, it will cost a middle-income couple just over $245,000, according to newly released estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's up $4,260, or almost 2%, from the year before. Estimates can vary widely depending on where you live and how much you earn.
