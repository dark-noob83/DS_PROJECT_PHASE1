The modes of Smite. Before getting to grips with the Smite gods and their roles, you should know how each mode works. Conquest is the most traditional of all the modes. It’s a 5 vs 5 three lane map with jungle in between the lanes. Within the jungle are camps with NPC enemies protecting special boons that increase damage, mana and speed.
Jungler-In smite, due to patch changes, it's harder to jungle. But basically this character gets his exp/gold in the jungle, i.e. farming neutral creeps, coming out to gank once in a while. It also give advantage to a side lane since he doesn't leech exp. Pusher-Character that are good at pushing lanes.
Joust might be the game mode for you. You can think of Joust as the little brother of Conquest. Instead of teams of 5 you’ll be matched with 2 other players for a 3 v 3 battle. If you really consider yourself affluent in the ways of Joust, there is also a 1 v 1 mode of the game.

Edit Page Last Edit: 1 year 6 months ago. Conquest is your standard 5 vs 5 MOBA game type. Here players will choose a god and go into a lane and fight it out with the enemy. Your goal in this mode is to accumulate gold and levels, killing your enemies towers, phoenix's and finally their Minotaur. A balanced team and good teammates go a long way to success in a Conquest match.
