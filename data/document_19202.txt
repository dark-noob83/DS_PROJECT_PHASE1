Undergraduate Coursework. To become a marine biologist, students must select a major in marine biology or an equivalent. To achieve a bachelor of science in marine biology, students study physics, genetics, oceanography, chemistry and general marine biology.
You'll need a degree -- preferably an advanced degree -- with coursework in the sciences, including biology, oceanography, marine sciences, chemistry and biochemistry. While pursuing your education, you'll need to gain as much experience as you can in a variety of marine science environments.
Education and training/entrance requirements. In order to become a marine biologist you need to complete a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in marine biology, marine science, marine environment, Antarctic science or a related field at university.
Education Requirements. To gain an entry-level job in marine biology, you need to have a Bachelor of Science degree in marine biology or a related field such as biochemistry, biology, botany, ecology, microbiology or zoology.
Education Needed to Become a Marine Biologist. To gain an entry-level job in marine biology, you need to have a Bachelor of Science degree in marine biology or a related field such as biochemistry, biology, botany, ecology, microbiology or zoology.
If you want to become a marine biologist you will have to learn about science. Ask your teachers for projects to do with living creatures. Don't think that you only need to know biology. Marine creatures are made of chemicals and they are physical things, just like plastic toys and wooden chairs.
To become a marine biologist, you will likely need at least a bachelor's degree, and possibly graduate work, such as a master's or Ph.D. degree. Since marine biology jobs are competitive, it will usually be easier to get a position if you have gained relevant experience during high school or college.
