Congress holds the power to declare war. As a result, the president cannot declare war without their approval. However, as the Commander in Chief of the armed forces, many presidents have sent troops to battle without an official war declaration (ex. Vietnam, Korea).
None-it is Congress, not the President, who declare war. Five Presidents have sought and obtained such declarations of war Madison (Gt Britain, 1812) Polk (Mexico, 1846) McKinley (Spain, 1898) Wilson (Germany, Austria-Hungary 1917) FD Roosevelt (Japan, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria 1941/42).
Strictly speaking, Congress declares war, after the president requests that they do so. The Republican Party was created in 1854. It was the election of the first Republican president, Lincoln, which triggered the secession crisis and brought on the Civil War.
Presidents can ask Congress to declare war. The presidents who made such a request and had it granted were James Madison (against Great Britain â€¦), James Polk (against Mexico), William McKinley(against Spain), Woodrow Wilson (against Germany and allies) and Franklin Roosevelt (against Japan and allies).
