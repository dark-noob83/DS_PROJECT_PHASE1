1 Whitney Houston. By far Whitney has the most voice control ever, she has set the standards for singing that has not been matched, she is also the most influential singer in the world. Love you whitney you just the best singer I ever heard and the most awarded. Christina Aguilera is a very inspiring singer that will never lose her amazing voice. She is the best singer of the generation, and absolutely one of the best singers of all time. She sings to express herself, and she doesn't care if that means less album sales, or less popularity. Christina, never stop singing.
3 Madonna. Madonna did some bad roles but she was really great in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989), Dick Tracy (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), Dangerous Game (1993), Evita (1996), Girl 6 (1996). To be honest, I enjoyed her acting in The Next Best Thing (2000) too. She had her own musical TV show with Sonny Bono, she starred in numerous films, from drama to comedy! She also published many hit songs solo, or with others!
