Groupings. The granular leukocytes are the neutrophils, the eosinophils and the basophils. The agranular cells are the monocytes and the lymphocytes. The basis for the division of the white blood cells into these two groups is the presence of granules inside the granular cells.
They include lymphocytes and monocytes. Apart from the difference in function regarding each individual type of white blood cell, the primary difference between granular and agranular leukocytes is that the former has visible granules, whereas the later does on have any noticeable granules.
White blood cells, or leukocytes, make up one of the three types of blood cell. The others are red blood cells and platelets. The leukocyte group contains several different types of cell, each with their own functions and each with a particular appearance under the microscope.
The agranular cells are the monocytes and the lymphocytes. The basis for the division of the white blood cells into these two groups is the presence of granules inside the granular cells. These granules are observable under a microscope after a sample is treated with a coloured stain.
One of the most important cells of our immune system are the leukocytes or white blood cells (WBCs). These cells are free from hemoglobin and belong to the reticuloendothelial cell system. White blood cells are divided into two types, granular and agranular leukocytes. The agranular ones contain a single nucleus while granular ones are polynucleated cells. In the following paragraphs, we shall concentrate solely on granular leukocytes and their types.
