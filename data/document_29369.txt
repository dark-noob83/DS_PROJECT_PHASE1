Net realizable value (NRV) is a method of evaluating an asset’s worth when held in inventory. Net realizable value is generally equal to the selling price of the inventory goods less the selling costs (completion and disposal).
Example of Net Realizable Value. ABC International has a green widget in inventory with a cost of $50. The market value of the widget is $130. The cost to prepare the widget for sale is $20, so the net realizable value is $60 ($130 market value - $50 cost - $20 completion cost). Since the cost of $50 is lower than the net realizable value of $60, you continue to record the inventory item at its $50 cost. In the following year, the market value of the green widget declines to $115.
One method, referred to as the cost-of-goods-sold method, debitscost of goods sold for the write-down of the inventory to net realizable value. As aresult, the company does not report a loss in the income statement because the costof goods sold already includes the amount of the loss.
The cost is still $50, and the cost to prepare it for sale is $20, so the net realizable value is $45 ($115 market value - $50 cost - $20 completion cost). Since the net realizable value of $45 is lower than the cost of $50, you should record a loss of $5 on the inventory item, thereby reducing its recorded cost to $45.
Mander’s net realizable value is computed as follows. Inventory value—unfinished $1,000Less: Estimated cost of completion $ 50Estimated cost to sell 200 250Net realizable value $ 750 Mander reports inventory on its statement of financial position at $750.
It will cost $0.80 to get the item ready for sale (by way of such costs as packaging the item), and to actually sell it (by way of such costs as sales commissions). This makes the net realizable value $4.20 (selling price of $5.00 less $0.80 of cost to complete and dispose). Net realizable value is a key component in determining market in the lower of cost or market rule.
