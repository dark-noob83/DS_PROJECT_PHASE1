is that mountain are only little but not that little and escarpment are just between the mid range of a mountain. Well a mountain is huge and majestic, a mountain range is a group of mountains, a cliff is a tiny part of a mountain and one mountain may have thousands, and an escarpment is … basically a large cliff. I apologize for a pretty lame answer but I'm not that experienced.
The difference between a mountain range and a mountain chain is that a mountain chain is a row of mountains and a mountain range is lots of mountains in one area. 22 people found this useful. Edit.

Shaded and colored image from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission —shows an elevation model of New Zealand's Alpine Fault running about 500 km (300 mi) long. The escarpment is flanked by a vast chain of hills squeezed between the fault and the mountains of New Zealand 's Southern Alps. Northeast is towards the top. Most commonly, an escarpment is a transition from one series of sedimentary rocks to another series of a different age and composition. Escarpments are also frequently formed by faults. When a fault displaces the ground surface so that one side is higher than the other, a fault scarp is created.

The portion of the Great Escarpment that could be designated a “mountain” is where it forms the international border between KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho. The Lesotho Highlands form a localized high spot on the Central Plateau. Main article: Karoo. The western section of South Africa on the inland side of the Cape Fold Mountains is dominated by the Great Karoo, a semi-desert region that is divided by the Great Escarpment into the Upper Karoo (at an elevation of 1100–1600 m) and the Lower Karoo (at an elevation of 600–800 m).
Usually escarpment is used interchangeably with scarp (from the Italian scarpa, shoe). But some sources differentiate the two terms, where escarpment refers to the margin between two landforms, while scarp is synonymous with a cliff or steep slope. The surface of the steep slope is called a scarp face. Most commonly, an escarpment is a transition from one series of sedimentary rocks to another series of a different age and composition. Escarpments are also frequently formed by faults. When a fault displaces the ground surface so that one side is higher than the other, a fault scarp is created.
Najwa, The difference between a cliff and an escarpment is one of scale. Escarpments are large geographic features where there is a sudden change in elevation between two terrains or physiographic provinces. A cliff is a local topographic feature that may or may not be part of an escarpment. Perhaps a fitting analogy that illustrates the difference is a mountain versus a mountain range.
