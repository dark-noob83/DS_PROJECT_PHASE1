There are three main network ports (and one named socket), which are typically used by SNMP. These are: However, these are simply the default well-known ports for these purposes, and it is perfectly possible to accept requests on other ports.
As I know UDP 161/162 are used for SNMP. On my network a monitor only these two ports concerning the SNMP. If you want to verify if it is udp or tcp you can do it very easily with an access list.
Simple network management protocol (SNMP). Used by various devices and applications (including firewalls and routers) to communicate logging and management information with remote monitoring applications. Typically, SNMP agents listen on UDP port 161, asynchronous traps are received on port 162.
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for network management. It is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as s â€¦ ervers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. A port for this ^. Google is your friend.
SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It is a standard way of monitoring hardware and software from nearly any manufacturer, from Juniper, to Cisco, to Microsoft, Unix, and everything in between. SNMP requires only a couple of basic components to work: a management station, and an agent.
Changing SNMP Port Settings. SNMP uses the default UDP port 161 for general SNMP messages and UDP port 162 for SNMP trap messages. If these ports are being used by another protocol or service, you can change the settings by modifying the local Services file on the agent. The Services file is located in \ % SystemRoot %\System32\Drivers\Etc.
