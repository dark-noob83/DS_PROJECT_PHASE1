The Einstellung Effect reflects a tendency to rigidity in human thought, to the supposed inflexibity of experts, to get ego invested in certain methodologies. Einstellung literally means “attitude” in German and may be thought of as a mindset: mind·set or mind-set (noun): 1. A fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermines a person’s responses to and interpretations of situations. 2. An inclination or a habit
Einstellung literally means setting or installation as well as a person's attitude in German. Related to Einstellung is what is referred to as an Aufgabe (literally, task in German). The Aufgabe is the situation which could potentially invoke the Einstellung effect. Another phenomenon similar to Einstellung is functional fixedness (Duncker 1945). Functional fixedness is an impaired ability to discover a new use for an object, owing to the subject's previous use of the object in a functionally dissimilar context.
The Einstellung Effect refers to the human tendency to repeat a known solution, even if it no longer is the optimium solution. It represents the negative value of experience.

Often called a problem solving set, Einstellung refers to a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist. Another phenomenon similar to Einstellung is functional fixedness (Duncker 1945).

The Einstellung effect has been tested experimentally in many different contexts. The most famous example (which led to Luchins and Luchins' coining of the term) is the Luchins' water jar experiment, in which subjects were asked to solve a series of water jar problems.
