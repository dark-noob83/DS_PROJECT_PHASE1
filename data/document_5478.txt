Planet Distance Matrix. Below is a matrix of the eight planets in our solar system and their respective distances from each other. Each distance is calculated as an average and converted into astronomical units (AU) where 1 AU = the distance between the Sun and Earth = 149,598,000 kilometres. This chart is based on averages and the distances from one planet to another have been calculated by the difference in their mean distance from the sun. For this reason, it is easiest to look at the average distance between planets as opposed to a specific distance at any point in time; however we have also included minimum and maximum distances.
The reason for this is that the planets have elliptical orbits and none of them are perfect circles. As an example, the distance between the planet Mercury and Earth can range from 77 million km at the closest point, to as far as 222 million km at the farthest. There is a huge amount of different in the distances between the planets depending on their position on their orbit path. The table below shows the eight planets and the average distance between them. The AU column is the distance in astronomical units. 1 AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth, which is 149,600,000 km
Its mean (average) distance from the sun is about 67 million miles (108 million kilometres). Other interesti … ng facts about Venus: The diameter of Venus is about 7,520 miles (12,100 kilometers), approximately 400 miles (644 kilometers) smaller than that of the Earth. In terms of Astronomical Units (AU), the … average distance of the Earth from the Sun,the planetary distances are: Mercury: 0.4 AU Venus: 0.7 AU Earth: 1 AU Mars: 1.5 AU Jupiter: 5.2 AU Saturn: 9.5 AU Uranus: 19.2 AU Neptune: 30 AU. 1 AU = exactly 149,597,870,700 metres (or about 150 million km).
Furthest: 109 million km / 68 million miles (.728 AU). Average: 108 million km / 67 million miles (.722 AU). Closest to Venus from Earth: 40 million km / 25 million miles. From the Solar Dynamics Observatory: Planet Venus transiting the Sun in the 304 Anstrom wavelength at approx. 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit in July 2012. Average: 779 million km / 484 million miles (5.20 AU). Closest to Jupiter from Earth: 588 million km / 346 million miles. The “pale blue dot” of Earth as seen from Cassini on July 19, 2013.
We should like to make a proposal that the average mean distance between the planet Mercury and the Sun be considered for computations of the astronomical unit. The average mean distance between Mercury and the Sun is generally cited as being 36 ,000,000 miles or, 57,900,000 kilometers. Tweet. The astronomical unit (AU) currently in use is derived from the average mean distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is generally cited as 93 ,000,000 miles or 149,600,000 kilometers.
Distances Between the Planets. The distances between each planet in our solar system will vary depending on each orbit. No planet has a perfectly circular orbit around the sun and therefore the distance between each planet can take on two very extreme numbers. For this reason, it is easiest to look at the average distance between planets as opposed to a specific distance at any point in time; however we have also included minimum and maximum distances.
Astronomical Unit (A.U.). An astronomical unit (A.U.) is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. Astronomical units are usually used to measure distances within our solar system. 
(An AU is the distance from Earth to the Sun, about 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles). The table below lists the distance of each planet from the Sun in AU. To find the distance between the orbits of two planets in AU, subtract the two planet-Sun distances. For example, Earth orbits at 1 AU from the Sun and Venus orbits at 0.72 AU from the Sun. The difference between these two distances is 1 - 0.72 = 0.28 AU. 
Distances in the solar system are commonly measured in Astronomical Units (AU). An AU is simply the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. Because the Earth's orbit around the Sun is an ellipse, the Earth is not always the same distance from the Sun. An AU is equal to ~149,600,000 km.
