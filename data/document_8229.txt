Do you get a refurbished Apple iPhone when you need a replacement phone? I had a problem with my iPhone and Apple replaced it for me with a new one. In most cases, they will try to give you a refurb. You can contest it and try to get a new one, but it depends in the situation. In my case, they gave me a brand spankin new 3G when my 2G crashed.
O.P. I'm aware that if you break your shiny new phone then you can take it to an Apple store and they'll usually offer you a refurbished unit for a reasonable price. I was in the Perth Apple store yesterday and I saw them offer a customer a refurb iPhone 5 for $269. 
Apple does not send out used phones as replacements. They DO send our refurbs and they will NOT tell you if it is new or a refurb. That is standard procedure for all corporations everywhere. This is the same as the iPods, or any other repair Apple does on an Apple product. For example, if you had your iPhone for 11 months, and had it replaced by Apple at that point. You have 1 month of the original warranty left. However, the replacement has 90 days of coverage.
#15. It should be a refurbished unit, but you will not be able to tell the difference, and it make no difference what so ever on resale, or daily use. The only other thing you can do, is return the phone to the carrier, and then go buy a new one at apple. It's unfair that you could have paid like $600 for a brand new iPhone which turns up defective and they replace it with a second hand one. That's like the biggest slap in the face ever. samven582 said: â†‘. yup.

Apple decided that the phone couldn't be fixed so they sent me a new one. Today I received my replacement from Apple, and it appears that they sent me a used iPhone.

Level 10 (169,810 points). They can replace it with a new or refurbished iPhone at their option. Typically they will use refurbished units, but you would not be able to tell the difference between new or refurbished service stock. Regards.
2 - Apple backs its refurbished products with the same warranty as new. If its a service replacement it assumes the same warranty as the one it is replacing, or 90 days whichever is longer. Many retailers only give a 7, 14 or 30 day warranty at most on refurbished products. Many sell them as is. This is the same as the iPods, or any other repair Apple does on an Apple product.
