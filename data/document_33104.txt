Dissociative Identity Disorder, formerly referred to as Multiple Personality Disorder, is a condition wherein a person's identity is fragmented into two or more distinct personalities. Sufferers of this rare condition are usually victims of severe abuse. 1  Definition. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is a severe condition in which two or more distinct identities, or personality states, are present in—and alternately take control of—an individual. The person also experiences memory loss that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.
The main symptom cluster for dissociative disorders include a disruption in consciousness, memory, identity, or perception. In other words, one of these areas is not working correctly and causing significant distress within the individual.
Dissociative Disorders are disorders such as psychogenic fugue, multiple personality, and psychogenic amnesia in which a person's conscious awareness becomes separated (dissociated) from previous memories, thoughts, and feelings.
Dissociative disorders are characterized by an involuntary escape from reality characterized by a disconnection between thoughts, identity, consciousness and memory. People from all age groups and racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds can experience a dissociative disorder.
Definition Edit. Dissociative identity disorder is a diagnosis described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Revised, as the existence in an individual of two or more distinct identities or personalities, each with its own pattern of perceiving and interacting with the environment.
