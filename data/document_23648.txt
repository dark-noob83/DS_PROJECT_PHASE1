1 Some providers will negotiate a discount of up to 20% or more for uninsured patients who pay cash or pay within a certain timeframe. 2  For example, Lincoln County Ambulance Service in Kansas offers a 20% discount for payment within 30 days and a 10% discount to uninsured patients. Charged roughly $7500 to transfer from one hospital to another for a non-emergency. The hospital told us it was mandatory we take an ambulance.

1 The city of Nichols Hills, OK, offers a membership plan for $2.50 per month for ambulance rides at no out-of-pocket cost, but non-members pay $1,100 plus $9 per mile for ambulance service. 2  Woodburn Ambulance Service in Woodburn, OR, offers a membership plan, but non-members pay $1,220 plus $20 per mile per trip.

However, GAO estimated that approximately 39 to 56 percent of providers without shared costs would have average Medicare payments above their average cost per transport under the national fee schedule in 2010. From 2001 to 2004, utilization of ambulance transports per beneficiary increased 16 percent overall. To assess the effect of the ambulance national fee schedule on payments, we used Medicare claims data to compute average payments for ambulance transports in 2001, before the implementation of the ambulance national fee schedule, and in 2004, 2 years after the phase-in of the fee schedule had begun.
The stated purpose of ambulance fees is that City residents do not subsidize the cost of ambulance services when those costs are more appropriately borne by those who use the services. The 2011 budget includes 630 firefighter positions assigned to Emergency Medical Services. The Chicago Fire Department (CFD) has been providing ambulance services since at least the 1920s. [1] From 1957 to 1977, the number of ambulances in service increased from 16 to 43. [2] Today, there is an average of at least 60 ambulances in service each day.
1 The cost can be nothing out-of-pocket in cities where services are covered by taxes, but usually ranges from less than $400 to $1,200 or more plus mileage. 2  For example, in Lima, OH, taxes pay for any ambulance services not covered by insurance, so residents do not receive a bill. Charged roughly $7500 to transfer from one hospital to another for a non-emergency. The hospital told us it was mandatory we take an ambulance. Insurance covered only $700 b/c Superior is out of network (I called...they do not participate in ANY networks).
However, as a volunteer helping to manage a non-profit ambulance service, I would offer an explanation. On average, ambulance services recover only a small portion of their billings, about 60% but can go as low as 40% depending on the area. Charged roughly $7500 to transfer from one hospital to another for a non-emergency. The hospital told us it was mandatory we take an ambulance. Insurance covered only $700 b/c Superior is out of network (I called...they do not participate in ANY networks).
In Monterey County, California, the average minimum charge for basic life support (BLS) ambulance transportation is $2,206. A few hours away in Mendocino County, the average is just $575… health insurance may only cover a fraction of the charge if the provider is out-of-network. 
Charges for ambulance transportation vary dramatically across the U.S. and from provider to provider. In Monterey County, California, the average minimum charge for basic life support (BLS) ambulance transportation is $2,206. A few hours away in Mendocino County, the average is just $575. There are 6 licensed ambulance providers in San Francisco and charges can vary quite a bit from provider to provider. The Fire Department’s minimum charge for BLS and ALS transport is $1,642.

2002, total ambulance payments were a blend of 20 percent under the national fee schedule and 80 percent under the historical payment system. In 2004, the blend was 60 percent national fee schedule and 40 percent historical payment system. To assess the effect of the ambulance national fee schedule on payments, we used Medicare claims data to compute average payments for ambulance transports in 2001, before the implementation of the ambulance national fee schedule, and in 2004, 2 years after the phase-in of the fee schedule had begun.
Note. When you get ambulance services in a non-emergency situation, and the ambulance company believes that Medicare may not pay for your particular ambulance service, it must give you an Advance Beneficiary Notice of Noncoverage (ABN) .
