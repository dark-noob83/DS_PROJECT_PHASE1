One such type of virus is the rhinovirus. Rhinoviruses (from the Greek word rhin, meaning nose) are the cause of the common cold in an estimated 30 to 35 percent of all adults. More than 110 distinct rhinovirus types have been identified. This virus belongs to the Picornaviridae family of viruses. A rhinovirus is a very small RNA virus.
Other enteroviruses belonging to Picornaviridae include poliovirus and Coxsackie A virus. Rhinovirus is one of the smallest types of virus, with a diameter of around 30 nanometers. Most other viruses such as vaccinia or smallpox are around ten times this size, with diameters of about 30
: any of a genus (Rhinovirus) of single-stranded RNA viruses of the family Picornaviridae including two species (Human rhinovirus A and Human rhinovirus B) having numerous serotypes that affect humans causing respiratory infections including the common cold.
By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD. The “rhino” in rhinovirus is derived from the Greek for “nose” and these viruses are the most common infective virus to cause the common cold in humans. Rhinovirus describes species that belongs to the enterovirus genus of the family Picornaviridae.
Article Body. More than any other illness, rhinoviruses (rhin means “nose”) are associated with the common cold. Rhinoviruses may also cause some sore throats, ear infections, sinus infections, and to a lesser degree, pneumonia and bronchiolitis (infection of the small breathing passages of the lungs).
Rhinoviruses, a genus of the family Picornaviridae, are the cause of more than 50% of respiratory tract infections. Complications of rhinovirus infections, which include otitis media, sinusitis, exacerbations of asthma, and other pulmonary diseases, can be significant in certain populations.
