Today, most K-12 education uses a modernized version of the original program. Previously known as DISTAR, an acronym for Direct Instruction System for Teaching Arithmetic and Reading, and created by SRA/McGraw-Hill, modern programs offer standard lesson plans for Reading and Arithmetic based on grade level. Though direct instruction is probably the oldest form of teaching, it came into a more modern light when a program was created by a professor at Johns Hopkins University in the mid-1980s as a way to address the problems of inner-city Baltimore schools.
