the Wilderness. The Bitterroot National Forest spans 1.6 million acres. The elevation in the forest varies from 3,200 feet in the valleys to 10,157 feet at the summit of Trapper Peak. There are two major rivers in the forest, the Selway and the Salmon, which drop in elevation to just over 2,000 feet.
A large portion of the Bitterroot Mountains, along with a large river in the region, was selected to be protected under this act. Thus the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, containing 1,340,460 acres in two states, was created. The wilderness area, the third largest in the country, is controlled by the only forest service system in the entire country to rest entirely within the boundaries of a wilderness area.
