ESPN.com and Yahoo Sports report that NFL game officials earned an average of $149,000 in 2011. Pay for NFL officials varies based on seniority, so some officials earned considerably more. Also, keep in mind that a number of NFL referees hold second jobs, ranging from practicing law to teaching school.
How do those figures compare with the salaries of refs in other sports? According to AskMen.com, Major League baseball umpires earn anywhere from $100,000 to $280,000 per season, plus they get a generous expense account. NHL officials make even more -- from $115,000 to $220,000 per season, based on experience. Probably because they have to know how to skate backwards and stay out of the way of swinging hockey sticks.
From $350,000 to $12,000,000 per season. Sidney Crosby is the highest paid player at present in the NHL in the 2010-2011 season. The last CBA, (collective bargaining agreeme … nt) starts the minimum salary for rookies at $900,000 per year in their first year up to a million by the third.
According to TheRichest.org, NHL referees earn a yearly salary between $110,000 and $255,000. Wes McCauley is one of the top referees in the NHL and has worked several Stanley Cup Finals games. In a May 2011 article for Lansingnoise.com, NHL referee Wes McCauley states that he works three to four games per week.
Top NHL officials now cap out at a maximum salary of around $300,000, while players earn a league minimum of over $500,000. Two fourth-line thugs can pound away at each other for a combined income of at least a million dollars, while the linesmen – earning significantly less – are left to jump in and break it up.
From the Hartford Courant in 1997: “[Linesmen] top out at $125,000 on the union scale after 24 years, roughly 60 percent of what senior referees make.” That works out to a senior referee salary of $208,000, or $310,000 in 2014 dollars. NHL players don’t get paid in the playoffs – at least, not formally.
“Incidentally, while the National Hockey League's (NHL) athletes make less than their brethren in football, basketball and baseball, no other officials in any of the four major sports leagues make more than those in the NHL, where starters get a $115,000 salary.
Those figures are in line with referee income, but linesmen end up a few dollars short of that. During the 2004-05 NHL lockout, USA Today reported a base salary range for NHL referees of $110,000-$255,000 and $72,000-$162,000 for linesmen. The Richest concurs with USA Today’s data.
