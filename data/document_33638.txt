A downburst is defined as a strong downdraft with an outrush of damaging winds on or near the ground. If the swath is less than 2.5 miles, it is called a microburst. A microburst is a small, very intense downdraft that descends to the ground resulting in a strong wind divergence. The size of the event is typically less than 4 kilometers across. Microbursts are capable of producing winds of more than 100 mph causing significant damage.
Microbursts downburst less than 2.5 miles in diameter. A downburst is a strong downdraft which includes an outburst of potentially damaging winds on or near the ground. If the diameter of the downburst is less than 2.5 miles, it is called a microburst. The diagrams below depict the evolution of a microburst. A microburst initially develops as the downdraft begins its descent from cloud base. The downdraft accelerates and within minutes, reaches the ground (contact stage).
Share |. A weather phenomenon, called a microburst, may cause destruction just as devastating as a tornado does. A microburst is a small column of exceptionally intense and localized sinking air that results in a violent outrush of air at the ground. It is capable of producing damaging straight-line winds of more than 100 mph that are similar to that in some tornadoes, but without the tornado's rotation.
