Medical Definition of PILUS. : a hair or a structure (as on the surface of a bacterial cell) resembling a hair. ADVERTISEMENT. Latin. First Known Use: 1760.
A pilus (Latin; plural: pili) is a hairlike structure on the surface of a cell, especially Gram-negative bacteria, a protein appendage required for bacterial conjugation. Pili connect the bacterium to another of its species and build a bridge between the cytoplasm of either cell.
(1) (microbiology) Short, filamentous projections on a bacterial cell, used not for motility but for adhering to other bacterial cell (especially for mating) or to animal cells. (singular: pilus). (2) (botany) Philippine tree Canarium ovatum whose seeds are edible; source of Pili nut.
Pili can also aid in attachment between bacterial cells. Some bacteria are able to produce conjugation pili that allow for the transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another. Bacteria have evolved the process of conjugation as a way to increase genetic variability.
Pili. The first external structure is the pilus (plural: pili). A pilus is a thin, rigid fiber made of protein that protrudes from the cell surface. The primary function of pili are to attach a bacterial cell to specific surfaces or to other cells.
Pilus. Definition. noun, plural: pili. (microbiology) Short, filamentous projection on a bacterial cell, used not for motility but for adhering to other bacterial cell (especially for mating) or to animal cells. Supplement. Bacterial pili are involved in cell adhesion.
Above: a pilus projecting from the surface of a Gram negative bacterial cell. 'Pilus' is Latin for 'hair' (plural pili) and describes not so much hair-like bacterial appendages, but thin rod-like appendages that some bacteria have.
