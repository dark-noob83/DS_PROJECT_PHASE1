GSM is a TDMA based wireless network technology developed in Europe that is used throughout most of the world. GSM phones make use of a SIM card to identify the user's account. The use of the SIM card allows GSM network users to quickly move their phone number from one GSM phone to another by simply moving the SIM card. Currently GSM networks operate on the 850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz frequency bands.
CDMA and GSM networks are two types of cellular phone networks and generally if you have a device made for one, it can't be used on the other. In the US, Sprint®* and Verizon run on CDMA networks while AT&T and T-Mobile run on GSM networks.
