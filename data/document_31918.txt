The cost of traveling to and from New York will vary, depending on where you live. So will the price of a night or two in a hotel, although many city hotels have discounted their rates that weekend. The ones listed on the marathon's Web site cost between $155 and $310 for one night in a double-occupancy room.

I logged on to the Boston Athletic Association’s website last night to sign up for the 2012 Boston Marathon, and was a bit surprised to see that the cost to enter next April’s race was $150. It seems like just yesterday (well, it was probably more like a decade) that the price was in the $70 range.

The Boston marathon certainly isn’t alone in charging this kind of price. The ING New York City Marathon was $196 this year, and you have to pay $11 just for the privilege to participate in a lottery for a race number. Chicago’s marathon is in Boston’s ballpark, with the 2011 race costing $145.
