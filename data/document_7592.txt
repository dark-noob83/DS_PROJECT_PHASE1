A newer type of NSAID available is known as the COX-2 inhibitor. COX-2 inhibitors provide the anti-inflammatory effects of blocking the COX-2 enzyme, but do not affect the COX-1 enzyme, reducing the risk of stomach or intestinal damage. There are two types of COX enzymes that exist, both of which play a key role in inflammation, fever, and pain. COX-1 enzymes are located in nearly every type of tissue within the body, including the stomach and platelets. The COX-1 enzymes, in particular, are responsible for regulating the production of prostaglandins.
Plant, or food, enzymes are essential in the proper digestion of food. Present in all raw plants (and also available as supplements), plant enzymes include protease (digests protein), amylase (digests carbohydrates), lipase (digests fat), disaccharidases (digest sugar), and cellulase (digests fiber). One systemic oral enzyme preparation is the No. 1 non-aspirin, over-the-counter medicine for pain and inflammation and the ninth-leading natural medicine among all medical drugs in Germany. In the United States, systemic oral enzymes have been overlooked by most physicians and consumers, but this trend is changing.
In contrast to chemical inhibitors of inflammation such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), enzyme preparations support and accelerate the natural inflammatory process without contributing to pain, redness and swelling. One systemic oral enzyme preparation is the No. 1 non-aspirin, over-the-counter medicine for pain and inflammation and the ninth-leading natural medicine among all medical drugs in Germany. In the United States, systemic oral enzymes have been overlooked by most physicians and consumers, but this trend is changing.
Proteolytic enzymes modulate the inflammatory process by a variety of mechanisms, including reducing the swelling of mucous membranes, decreasing capillary permeability, and dissolving blood clot-forming fibrin deposits and microthrombi. By reducing the viscosity (thickness) of the blood, enzymes improve circulation. Proteolytic enzymes, such as bromelain, papain, pancreatin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and rutin, are essential regulators and modulators of the inflammatory response. Among their important actions is a seven-to ten-fold increase in the “appetite” of macrophages and in the potency of natural killer (NK) cells.
Proteolytic Enzymes versus Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Italian researchers have shown that the ability of proteolytic enzymes to reduce inflammation is equal to or superior to four powerful steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Phenylbutazone, Hydrocortisone, Indomethacin, and Acetylsalicylic Acid. Proteolytic enzymes, such as bromelain, papain, pancreatin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and rutin, are essential regulators and modulators of the inflammatory response. Among their important actions is a seven-to ten-fold increase in the “appetite” of macrophages and in the potency of natural killer (NK) cells.
Systemic enzymes are predominantly protease enzymes that break down protein, and certain proteases have been shown to exhibit profound fibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory effect of systemic proteolytic enzymes is well known and has been in use for over 50 years. Unlike many of the anti-inflammatory drugs available, systemic enzymes are all-natural, well tolerated and free of dangerous side effects. -Welcome, this is an informational and educational website about the use of systemic enzyme therapy for medical conditions related to inflammation. Inflammation is the body's natural line of defense against invading pathogens and the beginning of the healing process.
Due to its strong anti-inflammatory effects, serrapeptase enzyme is used extensively to reduce pain and inflammation mainly in cases of: 1  Swelling of the body after a surgical procedure, such as in dental and ankle surgeries. 2  Ear-nose-throat infections. 3  Some kinds of breast diseases like Fibrocystic Breast Disease. ______________________________________________________________________________. Serrapeptase enzyme is known as one of the most powerful anti-inflammatory supplements.
