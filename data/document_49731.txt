Apparent Temperature. Apparent Temperature-What the air 'feels like' for various combinations of air temperature and relative humidity. Atmosphere-The envelope of gases that surround a planet and are held to it by the planet's gravitation al attraction. The earth 's atmosphere is mainly nitrogen and hydrogen. Apparent temperature What the air temperature feels like for various combinations of air temperature and relative humidity. Arena cloud See Roll cloud. Arid climate An extremely dry climate-drier than the semi-arid climate. Often referred to as a true desert  climate
Apparent temperature is the general term for the perceived outdoor temperature, caused by the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. 1  The heat index and humidex measure the effect of humidity on the perception of temperature. 1 The heat index and humidex measure the effect of humidity on the perception of temperature. 2  In humid conditions, the air feels hotter than it actually is, because of the reduction in evaporation of perspiration.
The combination of the heat index and the wind chill factor are denoted collectively by the single terms apparent temperature or relative outdoor temperature or simply Feels Like. Wind Chill. Wind chill is the apparent temperature felt on exposed skin, which is a function of the air temperature and wind speed. 
APPARENT TEMPERATUR E is the perceived temperature in degrees Fahrenheit derived from either a combination of temperature and wind (Wind Chill) or temperature and humidity (Heat Index) for the indicated hour. 
Wind Chill Is the cooling effect of wind on exposed skin. The formula to compute Wind Chill: Wind chill temperature = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75V (**0.16) + 0.4275TV(**0.16) Where V is the wind speed in statute miles per hour T is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Heat Index combines the effects of heat and humidity. Wind chill temperature = 35.74 + 0.6215 T - 35.75 V (**0.16) + 0.4275 T V (**0.16). Where V is the wind speed in statute miles per hour.
That's a partly valid phrase you may have heard in the summer, but it's actually both. The heat index, also known as the apparent temperature, is what the temperature feels like to the human body when relative humidity is combined with the air temperature. This has important considerations for the human body's comfort. When the body gets too hot, it begins to perspire or sweat to cool itself off. The body actually feels cooler in arid conditions. There is direct relationship between the air temperature and relative humidity and the heat index, meaning as the air temperature and relative humidity increase (decrease), the heat index increases (decrease).
When the temperature at a particular grid point falls to 50 F or less, wind chill will be used for that point for the Apparent Temperature. When the temperature at a grid point rises above 80 F, the heat index will be used for Apparent Temperature. Wind Chill: The portion of the cooling of a human body caused by air motion. Air motion accelerates the rate of heat transfer from a human body to the surrounding atmosphere, especially when temperatures are below about 7째C (45째F) (Source).
