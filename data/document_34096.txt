But that’s nothing. The largest known star is VY Canis Majoris; a red hypergiant star in the Canis Major constellation, located about 5,000 light-years from Earth. University of Minnesota professor Roberta Humphreys recently calculated its upper size at more than 1,540 times the size of the Sun. She noted that the largest stars are the coolest. So even though Eta Carinae is the most luminous star we know of, it’s extremely hot – 25,000 Kelvin – and so only a mere 250 solar radii. The largest stars will be the cool supergiants. For example, VY Canis Majoris is only 3,500 Kelvin. A really big star would be even cooler. At 3,000 Kelvin, a cool supergiant would be 2,60
For years, astronomers were convinced that a structure known as the Sloan Great Wall was the biggest-known structure in the universe. This vast cluster of galaxies and other cosmic matter is a mind-boggling 1.4 billion light-years across. But just recently they found something even bigger. 
Jerome Jérôme. Lalande the largest star that we know of is CALLED Vy Canis majoris’it s a long way From earth 3,900 3900 5,000 5000 light. Years’it s so big if it was The sun in our solar system its surface would extend Past. jupiter The biggest star VY Canis Majoris is so big the Sun would fit inside this about 2100 times. Traveling. If you where to fly a plane around the world it would take about 40-50 hours (depending on fuel stops etc). Now, if you where to fly around the biggest star it’s believed it could take 1100 years!!
Astronomers have discovered the largest known structure in the universe, a clump of active galactic cores that stretches 4 billion light-years from end to end. The structure is a large quasar group (LQG), a collection of extremely luminous galactic nuclei powered by supermassive central black holes. 
---. VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red hypergiant star located in the constellation Canis Major. With a size of 2600 solar radii, it is the largest known star and also one of the most luminous known. It is located about 1.5 kiloparsecs (4.6×1016 km) or about 4,900 light years away from Earth. 
This red hypergiant star is by far the largest known. It has an estimated radius between 1800 and 2100 times the radius of our Sun. With this size it would reach nearly to the orbit of Saturn if placed in our solar system. The star is located roughly 4,900 light-years from Earth in the constellation Canis Majoris. The star that we are most familiar with is our Sun. However, compared to many of the other stars in the Universe our central stars is, well, kinda puny. Below is a list of the 10 largest (by diameter) stars known to exist in the Universe.
The Largest Star Known in the Universe -- A Red Supergiant in Death Throes. When the astronomers studied the images of the most massive cluster of stars in our galaxy, Westerlund 1, they spotted something truly unique. Clouds of this type are rarely found around massive stars and are even rarer around red supergiant stars such as W26, the largest known star in the Universe — this is the first ionised nebula ever discovered around such a star.
Currently, scientists believe that the largest star in the known universe is NML Cygni, a red hypergiant found in the Cygnus constellation. Discovered by astronomers Neugebauer, Martz & Leighton (from where it gets its designation “NML”) in 1965, it measures 1,650 solar radii (1,147,575,000 KM). R136a1 only has about 35.4 solar radii, well below the radius of the largest star NML Cygni. The Most Powerful Star As previously mentioned, R136a1 is a super star and currently holds the title of “most massive” star. It also happens to be the brightest star in the known universe.
UY Scuti as seen in visible light. Below is a list of the largest known stars by radius. The unit of measurement used is the radius of the Sun (approximately 695,500 kilometers, or 432,450 miles). The exact order of this list is not complete, nor is it perfectly defined: 1  There are sometimes high uncertainties in derived values and sizes;
