$40,000 is the minimum for the range. Now to find your maximum, multiply your minimum, $40,000, by 1.50. This equals $60,000. $60,000 is the maximum for your salary range. In this example, your full salary range would be $40,000 to $60,000, with a midpoint of $50,000. In this example, your full salary range would be $40,000 to $60,000 with a midpoint of $50,000.

Below is an illustration of the salary range profile used by the University: Salary Range Profile Range Maximum 4th Quartile 3rd Quartile Range Mid Point 2nd Quartile 1st Quartile Range Minimum Range Minimum: The lowest salary that will be paid to individuals qualified to hold positions in the range. First Quartile (0 - 25th Percentile of Range): Salaries paid in this area typically apply to entry-level employees who are comparatively inexperienced and who are in the process of developing their skills, abilities, and knowledge in their field of endeavor.
To determine the salary range percentile, you must first calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum salary figures. For example, if the salary range for a particular position is between $45,000 and $75,000, the difference between those two figures would be $30,000. Next, find the difference between the salary offer and the minimum salary. In this example, assuming the offer was $55,000, the difference would be $10,000. Finally, divide this difference by the difference in salary range. For this scenario, $10,000 would be divided by $30,000 to give a percentage of 33%. This means that the salary offered is higher than 33% of other salaries in the range, or in the 33rd percentile
