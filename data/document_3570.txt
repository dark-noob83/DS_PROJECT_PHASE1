The cathode of a galvanic cell is its positive terminal. In both galvanic and electrolytic cells, oxidation takes place at the anode and electrons flow from the anode to the cathode. Galvanic or Voltaic Cells. The redox reaction in a galvanic cell is a spontaneous reaction. Oxidation occurs at the electrode termed the anode and reduction occurs at the electrode called the cathode. Electrodes & Charge. The anode of an electrolytic cell is positive (cathode is negative), since the anode attracts anions from the solution. However, the anode of a galvanic cell is negatively charged, since the spontaneous oxidation at the anode is the source of the cell's electrons or negative charge
An electrolytic cell has three component parts: an electrolyte and two electrodes (a cathode and an anode). The electrolyte is usually a solution of water or other solvents in which ions are dissolved. Molten salts such as sodium chloride are also electrolytes. A rechargeable battery, such as a AA NiMH cell or a single cell of a lead-acid battery, acts as a galvanic cell when discharging (converting chemical energy to electrical energy), and an electrolytic cell when being charged (converting electrical energy to chemical energy).
An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical cell that undergoes a redox reaction when electrical energy is applied. It is most often used to decompose chemical compounds, in a process called electrolysis —the Greek word lysis means to break up. When electrical energy is added to the system, the chemical energy is increased. Similarly to a galvanic cell, electrolytic cells usually consist of two half cells. A rechargeable battery, such as a AA NiMH cell or a single cell of a lead-acid battery, acts as a galvanic cell when discharging (converting chemical energy to electrical energy), and an electrolytic cell when being charged (converting electrical energy to chemical energy).
1 The cathode is the electrode where reduction (gain of electrons) takes place; in a galvanic cell, it is the positive electrode, as less oxidation occurs, fewer ions go into solution, and less electrons are left on the electrode. By definition: 1  The anode is the electrode where oxidation (loss of electrons) takes place; in a galvanic cell, it is the negative electrode, as when oxidation occurs, electrons are left behind on the electrode. 2  These electrons then migrate to the cathode (positive electrode).

The anode will definitely gain weight in a voltaic cell. Oxidation occurs at the cathode of both cells. The free energy change, δ G, is negative for the voltaic cell. The electrons in the external wire flow from cathode to anode in an electrolytic cell. None of the above statements is correct
Voltaic cells use a spontaneous chemical reaction to drive an electric current through an external circuit. These cells are important because they are the basis for the batteries that fuel modern society. But they aren't the only kind of electrochemical cell. It is also possible to construct a cell that does work on a chemical system by driving an electric current through the system. These cells are called electrolytic cells. Electrolysis is used to drive an oxidation-reduction reaction in a direction in which it does not occur spontaneously.
