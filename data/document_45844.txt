As this exuberant housing market takes shape, the chance to harvest equity – to tap into idle cash – from your home may prove to be a worthwhile endeavor. In March 2011, Fannie Mae lifted the requirement that you had to hold title to a property for six months before you were allowed to access your cash equity.
Now that you know the house price and terms of the sale, go back to your lender to get your financing approved. If you have purchased a Fannie Mae-owned home that is eligible for HomePath® financing, check with a HomePath lender to see if that financing might be a good option for you.
Essentially, you can pay cash for a house, then turn around and immediately do a cash-out refinance without having to wait six months, as previous guidelines required.
A cash-out refinance has to be worth it financially, says Gumbinger. You won't get any benefit from the transaction if adding $5,000 to your mortgage balance costs you $5,000 in fees.
For example: If you bought a home for $200,000 and still had $150,000 left on the mortgage, a cash-out refinance would allow you to take out a new loan at $170,000 – hopefully at a lower interest rate than the original loan – and pocket the $20,000 difference.
For a cash-out refi on a home the borrower lives in, generally, the lowest credit score is 640, according to Fannie Mae's standards. But such a loan comes with caveats. The borrower can't have an LTV ratio higher than 75%, must have 6 months of reserves in the bank and a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or lower.
Title insurance is crucial for a home buyer because it protects you and the lender from the possibility that your seller doesn't -- or previous sellers didn't -- have free and clear ownership of the house and property and, therefore, can't rightfully transfer full ownership to you.
1 For example, if the price of the home was $400,000, with an appraised value $425,000 — 70% of $400,000 would be used, so the maximum loan amount would be $280,000. 2  That 70% is applicable to a primary home, second home or investment property.
