if you re thinking about getting chickens you might be wondering how many eggs they will give you every day this is a good question and the truth is it varies i think that there are a lot of misconceptions about laying hens people think that if they get 3 hens they ll have 3 eggs per day
most chickens will lay an egg every 25 hours while they are young and as brian stated their egg production will decrease as they age i have 6 year old chickens who are still laying i do not cull my birds after they have served me so well with eggs and instead let them die a natural death when it is their time
for backyard pet chickens the peak laying time is the first 3 to 4 years of age again this can vary greatly between individual birds and breeds hens don t have a definite end to egg laying but eggs become fewer and at greater intervals as they age
this is another varies with the individual bird and the breed answer some chickens lay an egg almost every day others every 1 5 to 2 days younger hens called pullets if less than one year old will lay smaller eggs at larger intervals until they reach maturity
most hens will start laying between 5 7 months of age they will lay best at 1 to 2 years of age all pullets female chicken under 1 year of age lay small eggs at first and after a while will lay larger eggs younger hens will lay 1 egg every 3 4 days a hen 30 weeks old can lay 2 eggs every 3 days
the typical interval between eggs laid is about 25 hours so a hen that lays an egg every day will lay a bit later each day this is slightly less than one a day and work out to about 350 a year
chickens never lay more than one egg per day as a rule chickens lay in the morning but each day a little later sometimes the last egg of a series is produced in the early afternoon when it gets too late they take the next day off my five commercial hybrids will sometimes lay for a series of 30 days or more
the average varies with the age of the hen they average around 307 eggs pa over the first 52 weeks of laying over the 52 weeks from age 49 wks to age 100 wks they average around 171 eggs pa isabrown is a breed of commercial egg layers
