Domperidone Dosage Instructions for Induced Lactation. The maximum dose for domperidone is 20 mg 4 times per day. The suggested beginning dose is 10 mg 4 times per day for 1 week, then increasing to 20 mg 4 times per day. This should be increased gradually as per the instructions in the individual protocols. It is advisable to continue to take the domperidone from the initiation of lactation until weaning.
Using Domperidone: Generally, we now start domperidone at 30 mg (three 10 mg tablets) 3 times a day. In some situations we go as high as 40 mg 4 times a day. Printouts from the pharmacy often suggest taking domperidone 30 minutes before eating, but that is because of its use for digestive intolerance.
The traditional and most accepted dosage of domperidone as a galactogogue is 10-20 mg three to four times a day for a total of 30-80 mg daily, (10) though Dr. Newman has recently begun recommending up to 90-160 mg daily (30 mg 3x/day to 40 mg 4x/day).
In response to reports that women may be using an unapproved drug, domperidone, to increase milk production (lactation), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning breastfeeding women not to use this product because of safety concerns.
Most mothers find that when they forget a dose their milk supply decreases. However, once lactation is well established and the baby is breastfeeding well, the mother may consider slowly decreasing the domperidone. If her milk supply drastically decreases, she can always increase the dose back to 20 mg 4 times per day.
