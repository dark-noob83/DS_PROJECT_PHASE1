weather is the condition of the atmosphere over a short period of time climate is the average course of weather conditions for a particular location over a period of many years one of the factors that influences climate is the angle of the sun s rays this produces a wet climate on the upwind side of the mountains and an arid rain shadow on the downwind side oceans provide moisture that fuels rainstorms they also buffer the temperature of coastal regions regardless of latitude
mountains force wind to rise as it crosses over them this cools the air causing moisture to condense in clouds and rain this produces a wet climate on the upwind side of the mountains and an arid rain shadow on the downwind side oceans provide moisture that fuels rainstorms they also buffer the temperature of coastal regions regardless of latitude

the climate of a location is affected by its latitude terrain and altitude as well as nearby water bodies and their currents climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables most commonly temperature and precipitation a subarctic climate has little precipitation and monthly temperatures which are above 10 c 50 f for one to three months of the year with permafrost in large parts of the area due to the cold winters
climate zones of the contiguous united states the climate of the united states varies due to differences in latitude and a range of geographic features including mountains and deserts west of the 100th meridian much of the us is semi arid to arid even desert in the far southwestern us the state of alaska on the northwestern corner of the north american continent is largely subarctic but with a cool oceanic climate in the southeast alaska panhandle southwestern peninsula and aleutian islands and a polar climate i
east of the 100th meridian the climate is humid continental in the northern areas locations above 40 north latitude to humid temperate in the central and middle atlantic coast regions to humid subtropical in the gulf and south atlantic regions the southern tip of florida is tropical the state of alaska on the northwestern corner of the north american continent is largely subarctic but with a cool oceanic climate in the southeast alaska panhandle southwestern peninsula and aleutian islands and a polar climate
climate is usually defined as the average weather in a place it includes patterns of temperature precipitation rain or snow humidity wind and seasons climate patterns play a fundamental role in shaping natural ecosystems and the human economies and cultures that depend on them 
moist tropical climates are hot and humid steppes and deserts are dry with large temperature variations plentiful lakes rivers or nearby oceans give humid midlatitude climates cool damp winters but they have hot dry summers some of these climates are also called mediterranean this produces a wet climate on the upwind side of the mountains and an arid rain shadow on the downwind side oceans provide moisture that fuels rainstorms they also buffer the temperature of coastal regions regardless of latitude
climate is usually defined as the weather conditions in an area over a long period of time climate is determined by 1 or more of the 5 causes of climate there are 12 different types of climate found on earth each of the 12 climate types are grouped into 5 categories except 1 highland climates in the same category share characteristics and usually are found in the same area climates change over time usually the change is very slow the earth has experienced many different climates over its 4 54 billion years there are many different factors that cause climates to shift and change weather and climate are different weather is a short term description of the air in an area measured by temperature precipitation humidity wind and other factors
