Add 1 tablespoon butter and reduce heat to medium. (Or spray cool skillet with nonstick cooking spray before heating; continue as directed.) Cook, uncovered, for 7 to 9 minutes for 3/4-inch steaks or 10 to 13 minutes for 1-inch steaks to desired doneness (145째F for medium rare and 160째F for medium). Start with beef tenderloin steaks cut 3/4 inch to 1 inch thick (1 inch for grilling). Trim fat from steaks. Season as desired. Timings below are based on meat removed directly from the refrigerator.

You can add potatoes, too, if you'd like to serve them with the corned beef. Set the corned beef on top of the vegetables, sprinkle it with a tablespoon of Pickling Spice, and add enough water to just submerge the beef. Cover and cook on high for about 4 1/2 hours or on low for 8 to 9 hours.

Standard Cooking Times. The USDA recommends the following cooking times: Rib Roast (bone in, 4 to 6 lbs.): Roast at 325 degrees F for 23 to 25 minutes per pound for medium rare, 145 degrees F. Rib Roast (boneless rolled, 4 to 6 lbs.): Roast at 325 degrees F. Add 5 to 8 minutes per pound to above Rib Roast. Steaks (3/4 thick): Broil/Grill 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium rare, 145 degrees F. Stew or Shank Cross Cuts (1 to 1 1/2 thick): Cover with liquid; simmer 2 to 3 hours for medium, 160 degrees F. Short Ribs (4 long and 2 thick): Braise 325 degrees F for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2
Place the beef on top of the vegetables. To cook your beef: Place the roasting tray in the preheated oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 200째C/400째F/gas 6 and cook for 1 hour for medium beef. If you prefer it medium-rare, take it out 5 to 10 minutes earlier. For well done, leave it in for another 10 to 15 minutes.
Add the onions and cook on medium-low to medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 20 minutes or until the onions have caramelized lightly. While the onions are cooking, take the brisket out of its packaging and pat it dry. Season the meat generously with salt and pepper. 
3. Cooking Temperature. There are varying opinions about what the perfect temperature to cook a roast beef but in my experience starting the beef in a very hot oven 425F/220C/Gas 7 for the first 30 mins then lower the temperature to 375F/190C/Gas5 for the remaining cooking time then .... 
Cook the beef for another 17 minutes per 450g (1lb). This will give you rare beef. For medium cooked beef add 15 minutes more, or for well done beef add 30 minutes more-the additional time is for the whole joint not per 450g / 1lb. You can tell if the joint is cooked to your liking by sticking a skewer into the middle of the joint. If the juices are clear it's well done
