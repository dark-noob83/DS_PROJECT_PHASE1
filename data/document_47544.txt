The place where nutrients enter the blood. 7. The pump in the circulatory system. 8. A small vessel that connects veins and arteries. 10. The circulatory system ___________ nutrients, gases, liquids, and heat around the body. 11. The circulatory system transports this, which helps regulate temperature. 12. The liquid in the circulatory system. 13. The place where oxygen enters the blood and carbon dioxide leaves the blood. 14.
1 It has specialized cells, such as platelets, which help the blood to clot (coagulate) when we are bleeding. 2  It transports hormones-chemicals released by a cell in one part of the body that sends out messages that affect cells elsewhere in the body. 3  It regulates our acidity (pH) levels. 4  It regulates our body temperature.
The blood plasma plays a critical role in buffering the body's pH (blood pH values usually are very close to 7.3), circulating antibodies from the immune system, regulating osmotic balance, and even regulating body temperature. It is the movement of water within your cellular system that transports vital blood plasma.
Just like your house, your body has an internal thermostat that it uses to regulate your internal heating and cooling. This system is mostly influenced by two systems, the integumentary and the circulatory system.
The four major functions of the cardiovascular system are: 1. To transport nutrients, gases and waste products around the body. 2. To protect the body from infection and blood loss. 3. To help the body maintain a constant body temperature (‘thermoregulation’). 4.
The circulatory system helps regulate body temperature by transporting heat, carried by the blood, and then either constricting or dilating the blood in the tissues to increase or decrease the temperature.
