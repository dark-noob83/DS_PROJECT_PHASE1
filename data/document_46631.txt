1 The annual gift tax exclusion amount is $14,000 for 2015. 2  In other words, you can give $14,000 or $14,000 worth of property to as many people as you want in a year's time, without needing to file a gift tax return in order to report the gift to the IRS.
Also, another way for parents to avoid the gift tax is to remember that each parent is entitled to their own individual $14,000 exclusion. This means that your mother and father could each give you $14,000 this year — for a total of $28,000 — without being taxed on that gift.
Annual Gift Tax Exemption. In any given year, you can give up to $13,000 per child, without incurring any kind of reporting requirement, and without any gift tax liability. If you are married, you and your spouse can each give this amount, or $26,000 total.
In 2015, a taxpayer can give up to $14,000 per person per year without being taxed on the gift. For example, this year you could give Friend A $14,000, Friend B $14,000, and your sister $14,000 and not be taxed on your gifts.
Give the gift jointly with your spouse. Since you and your spouse each have an annual gift tax exemption, you can give a gift of twice as much to any one person in a year, by giving the gift jointly with your spouse. 1  For example, in 2015, you and your spouse each have a $14,000 per person exemption.
If your child is married, you can also give up to $14,000 each to his or her spouse. If you’re married, you and your spouse can both make gifts, meaning the maximum gift one couple can gift another couple without filing a gift tax is $56,000. This amount is per calendar year, and does not roll over from year to year.
But most gifts are not subject to the gift tax. For instance, you can give up to the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 in 2014) to any number of people every year, without facing any gift taxes. Recipients generally never owe income tax on the gifts.
You are allowed to give away a total of 3,000 each year, without any tax implications after your death. Bear in mind that this is the total annual amount that you can give away, NOT a total amount you can give to each beneficiary, each year.
