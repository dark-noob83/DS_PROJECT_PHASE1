Women should limit sugar intake to no more than 6 teaspoons per day, which provides about 100 calories. Men should limit sugar intake to no more than 9 teaspoons, or about 150 calories. In contrast, the average adult consumes 22 teaspoons per day. The average American consumes 3 pounds of sugar a week and 130 pounds a year, reports Forbes.com. This is equal to about 3,550 pounds of sugar in a lifetime. The consumption of added sugar accounts for an intake of 500 calories per day, which can cause a weight gain of 1 pound per week
If you’re an average person who is moderately active and of a normal body weight, you’re probably eating about 2,000 calories per day. 5 percent of 2,000 calories is 100 calories. Since sugar has 4 calories per gram, you have to stay under 20 grams of sugar per day to keep your sugar consumption to under 5 percent. In comparison, the average American consumes about 0.4 pounds of sugar per day, or about 190 grams of sugar. 
Currently, Western European adults consume an average of 101 grams of sugar per day, while in South America the figure rises to 130 grams. Sugar represents around 16-17% of an adult’s daily energy intake in the United Kingdom and Spain. The World Health Organisation suggests that adults should eat no more than 50 grams of sugar (12 teaspoons) per day to avoid the risks of obesity and tooth decay. The UN body even advises that limiting ourselves to 25 grams – or 5% of our daily energy intake – would provide “additional health benefits.”.
According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the maximum amount of added sugars you should eat in a day are (7): 1  Men: 150 calories per day (37.5 grams or 9 teaspoons). 2  Women: 100 calories per day (25 grams or 6 teaspoons). In 2008 the average intake was 76.7 grams per day, which equals 19 teaspoons or 306 calories. According to this study, sugar consumption went down by 23% between the years 2000 and 2008, mainly because people drank less sugar-sweetened beverages.
For example, the World Health Organization recommends keeping added sugar intake to 10% of total calories. For the average 2000 calorie-diet that's a maximum of 50 grams. The American Heart Association recommends 6 teaspoons of sugar for women and 9 for men (1 teaspoon of sugar has about 4g of sugar). The primary source of added sugars are soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued new guidelines suggesting that cutting the amount of sugar we eat from the current recommended limit of 10% of daily energy intake to 5% would be beneficial. That's about 25g (around six teaspoons) for an adult of normal weight every day. To put this in context a typical can of fizzy drink contains about nine teaspoons of sugar. The limits would apply to all sugars added to food, as well as sugar naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit concentrates. 
This amounts to a max of 37.5 grams of sugar or 150 calories from sugar for men, and 25 grams of sugar or 100 calories from sugar for women. When you’re reading the nutrition facts label, you’ll see the grams of sugar clearly listed under the total carbohydrates. However, the American Heart Association set a recommended limit, so you don’t get too many extra calories in your diet. Men shouldn't have more than 9 teaspoons daily, while women shouldn't have more than 6 teaspoons.
