Like many biochemical tests on bacteria, results of an indole test are indicated by a change in color following a reaction with an added reagent. Pure bacterial culture must be grown in sterile tryptophan or peptone broth for 24-48 hours before performing the test.

The indole test is a biochemical test performed on bacterial species to determine the ability of the organism to convert tryptophan into the indole. This division is performed by a chain of a number of different intracellular enzymes, a system generally referred to as tryptophanase..
The sulfur reduction test is useful in differentiating enteric organisms. The indole test is a component of the IMViC series of tests, which is used for differentiating the Enterobacteriaceae. The motility test is useful for testing a wide variety of organisms. As a whole, the SIM test is primarily useful for differentiating Salmonella and Shigella.
Indole test. The indole test is a biochemical test performed on bacterial species to determine the ability of the organism to split indole from the amino acid tryptophan. This division is performed by a chain of a number of different intracellular enzymes, a system generally referred to as tryptophanase.. Biochemistry.
The Indole Test: The test organism is inoculated into tryptone broth, a rich source of the amino acid tryptophan. Indole positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli produce tryptophanase, an enzyme that cleaves tryptophan, producing indole and pyruvic acid.
