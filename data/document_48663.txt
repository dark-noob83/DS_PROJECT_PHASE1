Posted on. by admin Last updated on: September 22, 2011. Energy vs Matter. Energy and matter are two very important quantities when physics is concerned. These concepts hold a very important place in fields of physics, theory of relativity, astronomy, cosmology, astrophysics and stellar evolution.
Since, by  Einstein's mass-equivalence equation e = mc2, mass is energy and  energy is mass, then lightning contains both ene … rgy and matter  (mass).    Alternatively stated, electrical charge is represented by  electrons. Electrons have mass (matter). As such, lightning  contains both energy and matter.
View full size image. The universe is made up of matter and energy. Matter — anything that has mass and takes up space — is pretty straightforward and easy to grasp, but energy is a bit more abstract. In physics, energy is the ability to do work, or the ability to move or elicit change in matter. In effect, the amount of energy something has refers to its capacity to cause things to happen. Energy has a few important properties.
