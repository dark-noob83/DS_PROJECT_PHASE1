Alcohol is metabolized at a different rate in each person, but there are some factors that play a role in how long alcohol stays in your system. The body can metabolize about one drink per hour, which is the equivalent of the following: 1  One can of beer or a 12-ounce glass. 2  Five ounces of wine.
One serving of alcohol is fully absorbed into the blood stream within 30 minutes to 2 hours after intake. This is because the body can metabolize about 0.25 ounces of alcohol per hour. However, the effects of alcohol vary by individual and by how much alcohol they drink in one session.
If you drink a large (250ml) glass of wine, your body takes about three hours to break down the alcohol. If you drink one pint of beer, your body takes about two hours to break it down. One pint of strong lager is equivalent to three units, so this will take longer.
Still using the two examples above, there would be no measurable alcohol in the woman's body in about 6-1/4 hours, and the man's body in about 2-3/4 hours. Below is a list of BACs and the approximate time it takes for alcohol to leave your system. 1  A BAC of .02 will take about 1.33 hours
How long does it take alcohol to leave your urine: People metabolize alcohol usually, at the rate of 1/2 to 3/4ounce every hour (which is about half an ounce of one standard drink). This is equal to 4 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, 10 ounces of microbrew.
It takes your body around 1 hour to process 1 Unit of Alcohol, so that's about half a pint of beer or one 25 ml shot or 2/3 of a 125 ml glass of wine. That number is for people with a healthy liver.
1 A BAC of .02 will take about 1.33 hours to leave your system. 2  A BAC of .05 will take about 3.33 hours to leave your system. 3  A BAC of .08 (the legal limit in the United States) will take about 5.33 hours to leave your system. 4  A BAC of .10 will take about 6.66
