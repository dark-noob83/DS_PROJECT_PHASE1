View parts and specs. RUSH GEARS inc. manufactures custom spur gears based on your 2D drawings,3D models, or old, worn out parts or samples. We will manufacture them out of the material YOU specify or we will take your sample gear and have it tested to determine the material and hardness.
Spur gears. Spur gears are the most common type of gears. They have straight teeth, and are mounted on parallel shafts. Sometimes, many spur gears are used at once to create very large gear reductions. Spur gears are used in many devices that you can see all over HowStuffWorks, like the electric screwdriver, dancing monster, oscillating sprinkler, windup alarm clock, washing machine and clothes dryer. But you won't find many in your car. This is because the spur gear can be really loud. Each time a gear tooth engages a tooth on the other gear, the teeth collide, and this impact makes a noise. It also increases the stress on the gear teeth. To reduce the noise and stress in the gears, most of the gears in your car are helical

Overview. Boston Gear's spur gears, which are designed to transmit motion and power between parallel shafts, are the most economical gears in the power transmission industry. We offer both 14 1/2째 and 20째 PA (pressure angle), involute, and full-depth system gears. 1 Transmits motion and power efficiently between parallel shafts. 2  Our 20째 PA spur gear has a high load-carrying capacity for enhanced performance. 3  The 14 1/2째 PA spur gear offers smooth, quiet operation. 4  Spur gears are manufactured in Delrin, non-metallic, brass, steel, and cast iron materials for maximum versatility.
Spur gears are simple, easily manufactured gears and are usually the first choice when exploring gear options. Transmitting power between parallel axes, the teeth project radially on the disc.
Spur gears, sometimes referred to as straight-cut gears, are perhaps the most common form of parallel axis gear. The spur gear has a cylindrical shape with teeth cut parallel to the axis. The most common spur gears are external gears, where the teeth are located on the outside of the cylinder. Another variation is internal spur gears where the teeth are cut on the inside of the cylinder. In either case, spur gears are designed to mesh with mating parts located on parallel shafts. The teeth projecting from a spur gear are not straight-sided, as this would not allow for uniform motion.
Spur gears are regularly used for speed reduction or increase, torque multiplication, resolution and accuracy enhancement for positioning systems. The teeth run parallel to the gear axis and can only transfer motion between parallel-axis gear sets.pur gears are simple, easily manufactured gears and are usually the first choice when exploring gear options.
