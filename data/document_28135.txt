Generally, it is used when counting down to a major event that will happen at a specific time. Mathematically, T is time, minus whatever amount of time is left until the event happens.
T is for TIME, and the minus is the amount of time left before takeoff. If you say T minus two, and TIME is 0830, it is 0828. Holding is another term meaning the countdown has stalled usually due to a technical problem. T minus 2 and holding in this case would mean 0828 and countdown has paused until problem is resolved.
Abigail from Pembroke Pines: I've heard that during a launch countdown the T in T minus does not stand for Time.. If so, what does the T really mean? You hear us talk in the Launch Control Center about T-9 minutes, T-20 minutes, etcetera. And so the assumption is that T stands for time.
T-0 does not necessarily mean the exact time in this sequence when the liftoff happens, and can also stand for the time of main engine ignition, or anything similar, though usually close to the actual liftoff and rocket's clearing of the launch tower.
