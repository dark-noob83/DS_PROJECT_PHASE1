Adam was not born of a woman. He was the first human. In l Corinthians 15:45 we read, “And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul.” Adam was the first man. This is an important point by the way, there were no other human beings made alongside Adam.
Earliest Recordings ever made. It was once thought that the earliest recording of the human voice was made by Thomas Edison in 1877, when he recorded Mary had a Little Lamb on his new invention – the phonograph. BUT, a new recording has turned up.
It was made on April 9, 1860 and it is of a woman singing the French folk song “Claire de la lune”. It has now been heard for the first time in 150 years. You can hear the recording here in mp3 format. Don’t expect Dark side of the Moon production here – remember, we’re talking first recordings ever made.

Adam was the FIRST FARMER. I n Genesis 2:15 we read, “And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.” Adam, the first man, was told to work, and to look after the garden God had made. This would not have been a chore. This would have been a joy for Adam.
