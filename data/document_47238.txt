Combining 401(k)s and IRAs can make it even comfier. If your employer offers a retirement plan, like a 401(k) or 403(b), and will match a percentage of your contributions, you should definitely take advantage of it—after all, it's free money for you.
There's an overall cap on your combined pretax and Roth 401(k) contributions. In 2015, you can contribute up to $18,000 ($24,000 if you're age 50 or older) to a 401(k) plan. You can split your contribution between Roth and pretax contributions any way you wish.
Upon your termination, you can roll your Roth 401k into a Roth IRA. If the Roth IRA is at least 5 years old, you can use the funds to purchase an immediate annuity that provides tax-free payments for the remainder of your life.
If your employer doesn't offer a retirement plan, you can always start by putting money in a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. But if you have access to a 401(k) or other employer plan, and your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, that's usually the best place to start. For example, let's say you make $115,000 per year.
With a Roth IRA, you can set up an account with any of the online brokers, choose investment options with them, and then directly deposit after-tax money (from your checking account, for example) into the Roth IRA.
You can also roll all or part of your Roth 401(k) dollars over to a Roth IRA, and your non-Roth dollars to a traditional IRA. You may also be able to roll your funds into another employer's plans that accepts rollovers.
In 2015, you can make a contribution of up to $24,000 to your 401(k), 403(b) or governmental 457(b) plan ($18,000 regular and $6,000 catch-up contributions) and $6,500 to a Roth IRA ($5,500 regular and $1,000 catch-up IRA contributions) for a total of $30,500 for 2015.
If your company doesn’t offer an employer match on your 401(k), you might want to skip it and head straight for the Roth IRA. You can contribute a maximum of $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA for 2013.
A Roth 401(k) is simply a traditional 401(k) plan that accepts Roth 401(k) contributions. Roth 401(k) contributions are made on an after-tax basis, just like Roth IRA
