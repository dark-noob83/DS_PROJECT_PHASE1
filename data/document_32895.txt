Like any medication, it carries the risk of side effects. The most common side effects from metformin include nausea, diarrhea, gas and upset stomach. These are most likely when you first start taking it and usually go away on their own. Until they do, you should try to take your metformin with a meal.
Metformin (prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes) can cause excessive gas and bloating, heartburn, headaches, a cough, muscle pain and a metallic taste in the mouth, but these side effects typically ease after a few weeks.

A Stacy Wiegman, PharmD, Pharmacy, answered. The most common and less serious side effects of metformin are bloating, gas, stomach pain, weakness, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, sneezing, headaches, cough, flushing of the skin, vomiting, runny nose, nausea and muscle pain.
A. Metformin (Glucophage) can cause diarrhea, nausea, heartburn, flatulence and stomachache. Acid-suppressing drugs like lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium) wonâ€™t solve the problem completely and may interfere with absorption of vitamin B12.
