When lava cools it also forms a myriad of different shapes and types of lava. There are two main types of lava pahoehoe (pa-hoy-hoy) and a'a (ah ah). Pahoehoe lava comes out smooth and dense and can form large areas that resemble flat parking lots or smooth bumps. 
Other lavas: Other types of lavas include block lava, which has a surface of large angular blocks, and rhyolite lava. These two types are associated with lava chemistries other than basalt. They tend to be very thick (10-200 meters) and slow moving.
There are three types of basalt lava flows: pillow, pahoehoe, and aa. Pillow Lava: Pillow lavas are volumetrically the most abundant type because they are erupted at mid-ocean ridges and because they make up the submarine portion of seamounts and large intraplate volcanoes, like the Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain. “Pahoehoe” and “aa” are Hawaiian words that describe lava.

There are three main types of volcano-composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite Volcanoes. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows. The eruptions from these volcanoes may be a pyroclastic flow rather than a flow of lava. A pyroclastic flow is a superheated mixture of hot steam, ash, rock and dust.
Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the resulting rock after solidification and cooling. This molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid at temperatures from 700 to 1,200 °C (1,292 to 2,192 °F).
There are several different types of volcanoes: steep stratovolcanoes, wide shield volcanoes, and mounded lava domes. The shape of a volcano actually depends on the types of lava that it’s made up of. And so, there are several different types of lava. A'a lava. The type of lava coming out of a volcano depends on its mineral content. Some lava is very thin, and can flow out of a volcano in great rivers that go for dozens of kilometers. Other lava is very thick, and only flows for a short distance before cooling and hardening.
Lava Flows. The major eruptive product of Hawaiian volcanoes is lava. Lava flows can form during fountaining eruptions or they can well out of the ground with little or no pyroclastic activity. There are two major types of basaltic lava flow, ' a'a and pahoehoe. These are Hawaiian words that have no meaning other than the type of lava, and they have been adopted by geologists working in other basaltic areas besides Hawai'i. They are different in almost every respect possible except for their chemistry.
The threat they pose is largely dependent on how the flow moves, which is in turn determined by the properties of the lava and the landscape. The two main types of lava, pahoehoe and `a`a, differ in various properties, such as crystal and gas bubble content, as well as having slight differences in temperature. These properties, along with the steepness of the underlying slope, determine the ease with which a lava flow moves. Pahoehoe and `a`a lava flows. Lava flows are one of the most common hazards produced by active volcanoes. Here in Hawai`i, they may endanger property but seldom endanger people's lives.
Pahoehoe. Pahoehoe is the second most abundant type of lava flow. Pahoehoe lava is characterized by a smooth, billowy, or ropy surface. Pahoehoe flows tend to be relatively thin, from a few inches to a few feet thick. In map-view the flows tend to be narrow and elongate. Other types of lavas include block lava, which has a surface of large angular blocks, and rhyolite lava. These two types are associated with lava chemistries other than basalt.
