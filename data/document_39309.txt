Producing tart and juicy fruits, grapefruit trees (Citrus spp.) also offer extensive foliage as a shading component to your landscape and nearby home. Aside from amending your soil with rich nutrients to grow your own tree, you must consider your local climate so that the tree can develop fruit efficiently.
Grapefruit become more hardy as they mature – young plants must not be exposed to temperatures below 10°C (50°F). Trees can reach 5m (16ft). A minimum winter night temperature of 10°C (50°F) is fine for lemons. Citrus limon is less cold tolerant than C. × meyeri, which survives down to 5°C (41°F).
When I think of citrus trees, I also think of warm temps and sunny days, perhaps combined with a palm tree or two. Citrus are semi-tropical to tropical fruit crops which are fairly low maintenance and easy to grow, but not usually in regions where temperatures dip below 25 degrees F. (-3 C.).
Heat Protection and Citrus. Protecting your citrus trees from excessively warm temperatures is important to prevent damage to the tree. If temperatures in the 90s or above are predicted, water the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. Check the mulch around your tree and add more if needed.
The fruit is seldom used in any cooked or baked dishes, though it is also popular juiced. Starting Your Tree. A grapefruit tree will grow to be about 15 to 20 feet tall, though older trees can be taller than 30 feet. If you are growing more than one tree, make sure to allow for 15 to 20 feet between them. Dig a hole large enough for the entire root ball to fit comfortably and cover with loose soil.
The flavor of citrus fruits depends on the temperatures during the growing season. Citrus trees can be picky when it comes to the environment they are grown in. If temperatures are too cold, the trees can die, but you actually need the heat of summer for the best fruit flavor.
The best temperature range to grow a successful grapefruit tree is between 60 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
