For example, given a robot fleet of Manhattan taxis, The New York Times reported, the cost per trip-mile of your future ride could drop from $4 per to about 50 cents per trip-mile. For some, that's already reason enough to keep the meter running on next steps for driverless cars. 
A Columbia University study suggested that with a fleet of just 9,000 autonomous cars, Uber could replace every taxi cab in New York City 13 – passengers would wait an average of 36 seconds for a ride that costs about $0.50 per mile. Autonomous cars will be commonplace by 2025 and have a near monopoly by 2030, and the sweeping change they bring will eclipse every other innovation our society has experienced.

The cost of fuel had the largest percentage increase from 2011 to 2012, rising 14.8 percent to 14.2 cents per mile on average for sedan owners. The average cost of regular grade fuel (used by most of the study vehicles) rose 16.6 percent, from $2.880 to $3.357 per gallon. AAA has published ‘ Your Driving Costs ‘ since 1950. That year, driving a car 10,000 miles per year cost 9 cents per mile, and gasoline sold for 27 cents
(click to enlarge). If we look at the long-term picture and include purchase cost of a Sedan (at year 1 and year 10), we can see that uberX is only cheaper than for the average American driver (15,000 miles per year) up until year 3. By year 20, the Sedan is almost 55% cheaper than uberX. At its current large-city fares, Uber is not a suitable economic alternative to car ownership for drivers who log over 5,000 miles per year. The accident-riddled driverless car remains and looks to remain on the left side of The Chasm in the Technology Adoption Cycle.
The analysis found that the per-mile greenhouse gas emissions of an electric vehicle deployed as a self-driving, or autonomous, taxi in 2030 would be 63 to 82 percent lower than a projected 2030 hybrid vehicle driven as a privately owned car and 90 percent lower than a 2014 gasoline-powered private vehicle. But if the vehicle is driven 40,000 to 70,000 miles per year, typical for U.S. taxis, they found that an alternative-fuel vehicle (hydrogen fuel cell or electric battery) was the most cost-effective option.
New Berkeley Lab study finds lower greenhouse gas emissions on per-mile basis for driverless cars deployed as taxis. News Release Julie Chao (510) 486-6491 • July 6, 2015. Imagine a fleet of driverless taxis roaming your city, ready to pick you up and take you to your destination at a moment’s notice. But if the vehicle is driven 40,000 to 70,000 miles per year, typical for U.S. taxis, they found that an alternative-fuel vehicle (hydrogen fuel cell or electric battery) was the most cost-effective option.
For consumers, the economics of SAVs, or transportation as a service, is a win. Barclays estimates the cost per mile for SAVs will be $0.34 a mile, nearly 58% cheaper than traditional new cars. Pooled SAVs, assuming two riders per trip, would push those costs down even more to $0.16 per mile. For companies that make mass market cars, a driverless society would be far more challenging. 
That year, driving a car 10,000 miles cost 9 cents a mile, and gasoline sold for 27 cents per gallon. Methodology Cost calculations in this edition of Your Driving Costs are comparable to the 2012 version. The process used to estimate annual driving costs is proprietary to AAA. If you commute to work by car, figure about $61 in total vehicle expenses per 100 miles. If that seems like a lot, driving a more fuel-efficient model or using public or alternative transportation options could save you money. Vehicle Maintenance Driving costs also are affected by how well your vehicle runs.
Assuming a 15 percent profit, the current cost of taxi service would be about $4 per trip mile, while in contrast, it was estimated, a Manhattan-based driverless vehicle fleet would cost about 50 cents per mile. Google is having 100 cars built by a manufacturer in the Detroit area, which it declined to name. Nor would it say how much the prototype vehicles cost. They will have a range of about 100 miles, powered by an electric motor that is roughly equivalent to the one used by Fiat’s 500e, Dr. Urmson said.
