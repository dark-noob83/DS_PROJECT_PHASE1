Now through May 31, 2014, Southwest is offering a 25% bonus when you buy, gift or transfer Rapid Rewards points. Points can be purchased, gifted, or transferred in blocks of 500 with a minimum initial purchase or transfer of 2,000 points and a daily maximum of 60,000 points.
Southwest Rapid Rewards points are capped out at a value of $1.44 per 100 points. That’s because each $100 in Southwest airfare requires 70 Rapid Rewards points for the best value ‘Wanna Get Away’ fares. So, by doing the balance transfer you are paying $3 per $100 to earn points worth $1.44.
1 A+ credit converts to 1 Rapid Rewards credit. 16 A+ credits can be used to fly two oneways on Airtran, and 16 Rapid Rewards credits can be used to fly two oneways on Southwest. Joanne’s situation is that she has one Rapid Rewards credit and 55,000 Rapid Rewards points.
A Member will have the ability to transfer Rapid Rewards Points to another Member with an active Rapid Rewards account. Transfer transactions must be paid for with a credit card and can be made at southwest.com. Rapid Rewards Points can be transferred in blocks of 500 with a minimum transfer of 1,000 points and a daily maximum of 60,000 points. Point value will be quoted in USD and transactions will be settled in USD.
The Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier card, which offers an opportunity to earn tier qualifying points toward A-List status, has an annual fee of $99. The Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus card, which does not include this perk, has an annual fee of $69. Otherwise they’re mostly the same.
So then the question becomes, is it worth it? You get the best value from your Rapid Rewards points on Wanna Get Away fare redemptions. Southwest recently devalued these from 60 points per $1 in airfare to 70 points per $1 in airfare – so you’re getting a value of 1.4 cents per point.
