Directions. Place brats in a Dutch oven with onions and butter, cover the brats with beer. Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer until brats are cooked. Remove brats and set aside beer mixture. Grill brats until golden brown and return to beer mixture until ready to serve.
Instructions. Pour beer into a pasta pot on medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Slice the onion into rings, then quarter them. Add onion slices, garlic, salt and black pepper to the pot. Pierce the casing of the brats several times, then add to the pot. Allow beer to boil again, adjust heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes. Pre-heat the indoor or outdoor grill to medium heat. Carefully remove brats from the beer and pat dry. Reserve onions from the beer as well.
How long to grill bratwurst depends on how you grill them. You can throw them straight on the grill which will take about 25-30 minutes or boil the brats in beer, wine or water for about 20 minutes. After boiling, then they are grilled for 4-6 minutes.
Add beer, chopped onion and brats to a large pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until brats are done (firm to the touch). Discard liquid and fry onions in butter in a clean pan, if desired. Grill brats over a charcoal grill until browned. Serve with brat buns or hard rolls and condiments.
