The function of the thyroid gland is to take iodine, found in many foods, and convert it into thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid cells are the only cells in the body which can absorb iodine. These cells combine iodine and the amino acid tyrosine to make T3 and T4. Controlling hormones essential to your metabolism.

Your thyroid gland is a small gland, normally weighing less than one ounce, located in the front of the neck.
1 The thyroid gland plays a primary role in your energy level, muscle growth, metabolic rate, and brain function. 2  Hypothyroidism is a common disorder in which the body’s ability to produce enough thyroid hormone is insufficient. Thyroid Hormones. 1  The thyroid gland plays a primary role in your energy level, muscle growth, metabolic rate, and brain function. 2  Hypothyroidism is a common disorder in which the body’s ability to produce enough thyroid hormone is insufficient.
The functions of the thyroid gland include the production of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine, also called thyroxine (T4). Informed Health Online [Internet] - Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). The thyroid is a vitally important hormonal gland that regulates metabolism and growth in the body. The thyroid hormones T3 and T4 increase the basal metabolic rate. In other words, they make the body cells work harder, using more energy.
Every cell in the body depends upon thyroid hormones for regulation of their metabolism. The normal thyroid gland produces about 80% T4 and about 20% T3, however, T3 possesses about four times the hormone strength as T4. Controlling hormones essential to your metabolism.

Thyroid hormone plays an important role in the metabolism of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. With regards to protein, thyroid hormones stimulate the synthesis as well as the degradation of proteins (2). As a result, a deficiency in thyroid hormone can affect protein synthesis, which of course is very important. Thyroid hormone may play an important role in wound healing (14). As a result, someone with a hypothyroid condition might experience slower healing when experiencing a cutaneous wound. So hopefully you now realize how important thyroid hormone is.
Female Male. Your thyroid is a small gland located in the lower part of your neck. It produces hormones that play a major role in your metabolism and energy. The primary thyroid hormones are triidothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Thyroid imbalances occur when your thyroid produces too few or two many of these hormones. An overactive thyroid, known as hyperthyroidism, occurs when the thyroid glands produce too many hormones.
Thyroid hormone plays an important role in brain development and function. Triiodothyronine (T3) is the active form of thyroid hormone, and controls the expression of genes involved in myelination, cell differentiation, migration, and signaling (6). Thyroid hormone may play an important role in wound healing (14). As a result, someone with a hypothyroid condition might experience slower healing when experiencing a cutaneous wound. So hopefully you now realize how important thyroid hormone is.
Thyroid hormone also plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism (3). Thyroid hormones affect the synthesis, mobilization, and degradation of fats (4). Severe hypothyroidism is usually associated with an increased serum concentration of total cholesterol and atherogenic lipoproteins. Thyroid hormone may play an important role in wound healing (14). As a result, someone with a hypothyroid condition might experience slower healing when experiencing a cutaneous wound. So hopefully you now realize how important thyroid hormone is.
