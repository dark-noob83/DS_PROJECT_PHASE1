Phenylketonuria (commonly known as PKU) is an inherited disorder that increases the levels of a substance called phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the diet. It is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners.
The blood sample for PKU is usually taken from your baby's heel (called a heel stick). The test is done in the first few days after birth, as early as 24 hours after birth. The test may be repeated within the first week or two
Phenylketonuria (pronounced fen-l-kee-toh-NOOR-ee-uh), often called PKU, is an inherited disorder that that can cause intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) if not treated. In PKU, the body can't process a portion of a protein called phenylalanine, which is in all foods containing protein.
A phenylketonuria (PKU) test is done to check whether a newborn baby has the enzyme needed to use phenylalanine in his or her body. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is needed for normal growth and development.
Why It Is Done. A phenylketonuria (PKU) screening test is done to see whether a newborn baby has the enzyme needed to use phenylalanine in his or her body. If this test shows that your baby has a phenylalanine problem, the doctor will do further testing to check whether your baby has PKU.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited disease that affects the breakdown of protein. High levels of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood damage the nervous system and can also lead to mental handicap. Newborn babies with PKU are given a special diet low in phenylalanine.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism involving impaired metabolism of phenylalanine, one of the amino acids. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, and other serious medical problems.
