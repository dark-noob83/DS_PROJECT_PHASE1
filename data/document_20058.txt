A standard checkup which includes the vet checking the cat's body, bladder, internal organs (by feel), teeth, eyes, ears and nose costs $35 here. A rabies shot is $15, a distemper shot is $12. A stool sample brought in is looked at and if there's worms that they find, they prescribe the right worming medicine which varies from $8 to about $18. If there's fleas, a $10 dose will clear that up for over 2 months. But your base cost would be $35 or so.
Best Answer. Depending on what vet's cost is how much you'll pay. Where I live the office visits cost between $25 and $47 and this includes physical check-up. Since Specky is new to you and he is an older pup I would suggest having the vet do blood work too, which will add between $60 and $100 to the bill.
Heartworm prevention is recommended, and may cost up to $40. The cat should also be checked out by a vet, to make sure there are no problems; the vet bills may be between $50 (for a simple check up) to $300 for advanced tests, if these are needed.
A routine checkup is also recommended and will cost between $50 and $150. Your vet may recommend a few supplements and vitamins, which can add up to $50 per year. Heartworm prevention medication should be taken also ($40/year).
The cost of a check up will vary with the Vet Clinic. The average price is about $30 - $40. However, if the Vet finds something wrong and prescribes any medication, the cost will go up.
Best Answer: My cat's have always cost me around $200 the first year...that includes everything(shots, deworming, spay/neuter, and declawing-not an option everyone goes for) but that is broke up over 4 visits also with the spay/neuter/declawing visit being the most expensive.
