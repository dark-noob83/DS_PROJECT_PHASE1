Remember that it takes a duck or goose about two weeks to lay a nest full of eggs in the wild before they start sitting on them. So that first egg may be two weeks old before it is warmed up and development starts.
Primarily, the Pekin is kept as a table bird, although your ducks will lay, on average, 140 eggs a year. Pekin Ducks were first imported from China by Mr. J. E. Palmer, of Stonington, Conn., in the spring of 1873. They were at first mistaken for small-sized geese.
I am sure that they are talking about their pet ducks. They start laying between the ages of 6-8 months old. They will usually lay an egg a day or an egg every two days. Normal flock feed with lil veggies as treats. I own ducks. And have had ducks my whole life.
My ducks started laying at 20 weeks old. I have found that my khaki campbell ducks generally lay their eggs early morning which means that it is not difficult to collect the eggs as they usually lay them in the hut before they are let out to free range for the day. I hope this helps.
Best Answer: Ducks are approximately 6-8 months old when they start to lay eggs. I have 2 Peking Drakes,3 Peking Hens and 6 Mallard mix Hens and I feed my ducks the same food I feed my chickens as they are all in the same pens.
I was wondering if anyone has seen or have a pekin duck lay eggs?
I think my girl was about 7-8 months old before she laid. Bantam Cochins are my love! Mille Fleur projects, buff barred projects and black/blue Mottled. Chickens, Guineas, Ducks, Peafowl and Turkeys. Contact me for hatching eggs and a link to my website.
