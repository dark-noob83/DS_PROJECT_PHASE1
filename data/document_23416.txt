Does anyone know of a way to create mail rules for incoming mail on an exchange account you have delegate or shared access to in outlook 2007?
I am delegate for several executives and meeting requests sent to them come into my Inbox. I'd like to differentiate between them so I can see at a glance which are Tom's, which are Mary's, which are Harry's etc. I tried to set up a rule to add a category but can't find the right expression to use.
Rules won't work because the meeting is sent to you, the delegate, and the executive's name is in the Received Representing Name field and this field is not exposed in Rules Wizard. However, you can do it if you can use script to read the field value and set the category.
Hello, Does anyone know of a way to create mail rules for incoming mail on an exchange account you have delegate or shared access to in outlook 2007? The rule needs to be able to run automatically when new mail arrives.
I have Outlook/Office 2010 and I have owner access to two other inboxes. I would like to create a rule that if a specific email address that sends an email then that email can forward to my home account.
