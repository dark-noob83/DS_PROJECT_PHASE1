First pass yield (FPY) , also known as throughput yield (TPY) , is defined as the number of units coming out of a process divided by the number of units going into that process over a specified period of time.
First pass yield is obtained by counting the number of good parts that make it through the process right the first time divided by the total number of parts that enter the process. Say that a product goes through a five-step process. Letâ€™s further assume that each unit has 20 opportunities for a defect.
As you can see, the more process steps you have, the more challenging it will be to get an item through the system without any issues. For example, consider an operation that has 4 processes, each with a yield of 95%. Using the first pass yield equation above, the FYP is: .95 x .95 x .95 x .95 = .81.
Also related, first time yield (FTY) is simply the number of good units produced divided by the number of total units going into the process. First time yield considers only what went into a process step and what went out, while FPY adds the consideration of rework.
First Pass Yield is an important manufacturing metric for measuring quality and production performance and there are many benefits to including first pass yield in the manufacturing executive's dashboard.
FIRST PASS YIELD The FPY is defined as the number of products coming out of a process divided by the number of products going into that process over a specified phase of time. Only good units with no rework are counted as coming out of an individual process. FPY, also known as Throughput Yield (TPY).
Definition. A metric for determining the performance of a production or manufacturing process. The first time yield can be calculated by dividing the number of goods from a manufactured lot that meet pre-specified quality standards by the total number produced by the process. Also called first-pass yield.
