How much do you pay for Internet? According to the White Fence Index, the average cost of Internet among top U.S. cities is $38 a month. Compare that to a country like South Korea where ADSL premium, which blows our best Internet out of the water, is only 30,000 won ($26) a month. 
1 Norway has a relatively expensive broadband, at $49.1 per month. 2  But it is still one of the top ten nations in this list (Table 1) with a price equal to 0.7% of GNI per capita. 3  This can be explained by a very high average income in Norway. The good news is that broadband prices seem to be getting lower and lower in all parts of the world. Three years ago, the world’s average price for fixed broadband was 115% of GNI per capita, and now it is down to 40%. But there are som bad news to. In big parts of the world, the price of broadband is still very high.
The average bandwidth provided by residential services was 55 Mbps, meaning the global average cost per megabit was $1.39. The U.S. ranked 43rd of the 90 countries surveyed in Point Topic’s market research and analysis, ranking just behind Colombia and one place ahead of Greece. Monthly U.S. broadband subscription rates did fall below the global average of $76.61, however.
Edge access providers (MAN) price per voice minute equivalent (PPVME) is $0.001, while in the competitive WAN it is $0.0000004. This level of arbitrage is unacceptable for the country that had scaled the internet first and has the majority of innovation here.

For its residential customers, the average monthly cost of TV service is $76.08, just a dollar more than it was two years ago. But internet service prices are up 21% over the same period, to an average of $47.30 a month. 
This awesome infographic shows the internet costs and speeds around the world for the top 20 nations in the ITIF Broadband Rankings. Unsurprisingly, we don't compare too well. Number one is, predictably, Japan, where the average broadband speed is 60mbps and they pay $0.27 per 1mbps. We, in comparison, average 4.8mbps and pay $3.33 per 1mbps, putting us at #15.

1 One goal of the Broadband commission is that all countries should have a broadband price at a cost of no more than 5% of GNI per capita by 2015. 2  In this report, only 84 countries out of 161 manage to reach that goal. The good news is that broadband prices seem to be getting lower and lower in all parts of the world. Three years ago, the world’s average price for fixed broadband was 115% of GNI per capita, and now it is down to 40%. But there are som bad news to.

Home broadband in the US costs far more than elsewhere. At high speeds, it costs nearly three times as much as in the UK and France, and more than five times as much as in South Korea. Elsewhere in the US, there is a patchwork of other options. In Kansas City, Kansas, residents are enjoying a high-speed fibre network, supplied by Google, at a price of $70 a month for a gigabit (1,000 Mbps) internet-only service. And there's a slower 5 Mbps download speed for free for seven years to those who pay $300 up front
