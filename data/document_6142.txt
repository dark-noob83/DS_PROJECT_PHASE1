Sample brake service estimate. Take a typical brake job, for example. It might take your mechanic one hour to install new brake pads on a car. Based on a $50 per hour straight rate, the brake service cost will be $50 + price of new brake pads. On the other hand, the book rate may indicate that it usually takes 90 minutes to complete the brake job. You would be charged $75 for service + price of new brake pads. So, with the book rate example, if the mechanic only needs one hour to change the brake pads, you will still be charged for 90 minutes of labor. In most cases the garage will benefit more than the client under the book rate system
