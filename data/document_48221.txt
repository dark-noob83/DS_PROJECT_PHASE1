We think you are asking about a hormone given to cattle to increase milk output. This hormone is called bovine somatotropin or BST. It is banned in the UK and Europe but has been licensed in the US since 1995. BST is given to cows to make them produce more milk. The European Union ban was made permanent on January 1st 2000.
Some farmers give a hormone called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST). Cows already make bovine somatotropin (bST). The rbST is made with the same techniques that are used to make insulin to treat diabetics. rbST is the same hormone as the naturally-occurring form that is already in the cows.
Bovine somatotropin (BST) or bovine growth hormone (BHG) is a naturally-occurring hormone in cows that helps them produce milk. Amount of BST secreted in milk depends upon stage of lactation, parity, nutrition and herd environment.
In Canada, no cow can be given artificial hormones to increase its milk production. This means that no milk, cheese or yogurt produced in Canada contains these hormones. To optimize milk production, our farmers use state-of-the-art methods.
Bovine growth hormone, or bovine somatotropin (also called bGH, rbGH, bST, or bST), is given to cows to make them mature faster and produce more milk. The hormone is produced by cows' pituitary gland and an extra amino acid is attached before it's injected into dairy cows. The hormone was first used in 1993.
First off, the growth hormones given to dairy cows and beef cattle are different. In dairy cows, the controversy centers around recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), a synthetic version of a hormone cows produce naturally.
rBGH is a genetically engineered artificial hormone injected into dairy cows to make them produce more milk. Despite opposition from scientists, farmers and consumers, the US currently allows dairy cows to be injected with recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), also known as recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST).
