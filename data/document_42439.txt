If asbestos is found, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has guidelines for proper removal of asbestos. Ask the asbestos abatement professional for an estimate on how much this will cost. Usually, it is around $2 or $3 per square foot. For instance, if you have a building that has 1,750 square feet and was quoted $2 per square foot for asbestos removal, the cost for this part of the demolition will cost $3,500. Add this price to the amount the professional asbestos inspector charged for the discovery of asbestos. 
If your home contains asbestos within the ceilings, flooring, partitions, roof, and pipes an entire removal could be as high as $2 per square foot. Full removal in a 1,000 square foot residence could possibly exceed $20,000. Nonetheless, that is an abnormally high amount. Generally, a 1,500 square foot residence will only cost about $350 to $750 for removal as the toxic material can be encapsulated instead of removed or might only appear in a couple of spots. Some abatement companies could have a minimum payment as high as $2.000 or higher, even for minor jobs. Others will cost as much as $400 or higher for a minor amount of asbestos ceiling removal or to remove insulation around a 10-foot section of pipe.
The cost per square foot can go up to $2. Considering that, complete removal work, in case there is a high asbestos exposure in the home and asbestos is found everywhere, the costs can go as high as $20,000. Well, needless to say, it can go even beyond that (I told you, it is going to cost you!). 
1 The removal period is an entirely separate process and requires containment of any debris or dust. 2  The average costs vary, but standard removal runs at $15 to $25 per square foot while encapsulation or enclosure of stable asbestos runs around $2 to $6 per square foot; 1 Once the initial inspection is done, the removal begins. 2  If the inspector identified areas of concern, most abatement professionals will use a HEPA vacuum system to pre-clean the entire area, at an average cost of $39 per square foot.
