Arrange the steaks in a baking dish. Pour lemon juice over the steaks and add the onion as well as the melted butter. Season with pepper and salt. Set the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and preheat. Place the dish in the oven and cook for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Place salmon, skin side down, on a non-stick baking sheet or in a non-stick pan with an oven-proof handle. Bake until salmon is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with the Toasted Almond Parsley Salad and squash, if desired.
Preparation. 1  Place salmon steaks in a buttered baking dish. 2  Heat the oven to 350° F (180° C/Gas 4). 3  Combine lemon juice and onion; sprinkle a little over each salmon steak. 4  Season with salt and pepper. 5  Bake, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
Ready In. 1  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 2  Pour 1/4 cup olive oil in a shallow bowl and dip salmon steaks in oil to coat. 3  Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon is cooked through and the flesh flakes easily, about 45 minutes.
Bake Until Opaque and Flaky. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for fillets or 350 degrees F for a dressed fish. You can bake the fillets at a lower temperature, if desired, but remember to increase the cooking time. Bake salmon fillets or steaks, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness. For a dressed salmon, bake for 6 to 9 minutes per 8 ounces of fish. To test for doneness, insert a fork into the salmon and gently twist.
The best way to cook the thicker fillets is to use 400° as the set temperature and bake the fish for 18-20 minutes. If a lower heat is desired, season the fillet and wrap it in foil, sealing it tightly and bake at 350° for about 25-30 minutes.
