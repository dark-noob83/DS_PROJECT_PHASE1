A. The serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), now referred to as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), called alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are enzymes whose levels are tested to detect liver damage from any cause. They also rise in muscle and heart disease.
The normal range for SGOT in the blood for an adult is 6- 34 IU/L for women and 8/40 IU/L for men. Higher levels than this indicate that something is wrong somewhere, frequently in the liver.
A. The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is from 7 to 56 units per liter of serum. This answer should not be considered medical advice...

What Are Normal Levels of AST and ALT? The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is from 7 to 56 units per liter of serum.
The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is from 7 to 56 units per liter of serum.
