A cold is an upper respiratory infection caused by a virus called rhinovirus. The common cold incubation period varies greatly from one person to the next. Symptoms can appear in just a few hours or as long as 10 days after exposure. The average incubation period is one to three days. Medications do not affect the incubation of a cold, nor do they eradicate it unless it is accompanied by a bacterial infection.
@burcidi-- I don't think so. Three weeks is too long as an incubation period for a common cold. The incubation period is usually a few days in most people, but it can be up to a week. If you had said two weeks, then I would have said maybe, but I doubt that you picked up the cold from your friend.
This interval is called the incubation period.Cold symptoms can also begin shortly after virus is first produced in the nose (10-12 hours). The time from the beginning of the infection to the peak of symptoms is typically 36-72 hours. http://www.commoncold.org/undrstn3.htm.
Response to Original message. 8. 8-12 hours for incubation, 36-72 hours for symptoms. According to commoncold.org... From the time a cold virus enters the nose, it takes 8-12 hours for the viral reproductive cycle to be completed and for new cold virus to be released in nasal secretions.
