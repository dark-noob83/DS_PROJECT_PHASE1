I explain why there is not centrifugal force in circular motion for a mass and for water in a bucket. The real force at work here is the centripetal force which is not a force in itself but a name for the forces that keep simple circular motion in a circle.
The water stays in the bucket because of inertia. The water wants to fly off from the circle, but the bucket gets in the way and keeps it in place. This is the same effect you feel when you go around a tight corner in the car and get squished against the door.

The water is undergoing centripetal motion, but the water's inertia is what keeps it from spilling out of the bucket. Inertia is not a force. It is the name we give the tendency of objects at rest to remain at rest and objects in motion to remain in motion.
Centrifugal force is caused by the inertia of the water in the bucket. Inertia is the water's momentum to continue in a straight line at a right angle to your arm and the rope, tangential to the circle formed by the whirling bucket.
This particular kind of force is called a centripetal force. The same is true for the pail of water. When you swing the pail back and forth, you can feel the pail and the water inside pulling on your arm because it wants to continue to move in a straight line and you want to make it go in a circle.
The classical way of explaining why the water does not spill is by referring to the centrifugal force, that supposedly cancels out the gravity acting on water that would otherwise make the water spill. And then they show you a picture with an inverted bucket and two forces acting on water: gravity and centrifugal.
