=NOW(). Excel will instantly put the current date and time into that cell. Every time you open the workbook or a new calculation is made in the worksheet, Excel will update the cell with the current date and time. Unfortunately, there is no function to insert only a dynamic time stamp into Excel. However, you can change the formatting of the cell to make the NOW function display only the time.
up vote 3 down vote. I would try inserting the current date into a cell via a macro. The question then only is, when and how to trigger that. You could for example press a button and it would insert today's date (not as a formula) into a cell (one particular or the selected one). In VBA you can use Now() , Date() and Time() , depending on what you need exactly
Because that cell’s value doesn’t change, it’s considered static. On a worksheet, select the cell into which you want to insert the current date or time. Do one of the following: To insert the current date, press Ctrl+; (semi-colon). To insert the current time, press Ctrl+Shift+; (semi-colon).
To enter the current date as a static (unchanging) value in a cell, press the Ctrl+; keys. To enter the current time as a static (unchanging) value in a cell, press the Ctrl+Shift+; keys. To enter a static date and time: Step 1. Enter =NOW() in a cell as shown. After that, to easily change that formula value into a static value: • Select the cell. • Press and release the F2 key. • Press and release the F9 key. • Hit the Enter key.
To insert the current date or time so that it is updatable, use the TODAY and NOW functions, as shown in the following example. For more information about how to use these functions, see TODAY function and NOW function. On a worksheet, select the cell into which you want to insert the current date or time. Do one of the following: To insert the current date, press Ctrl+; (semi-colon). To insert the current time, press Ctrl+Shift
RE: I need a static date/time in Excel. As stated above, you'll need VBA to have the date/time automatically entered into a cell. But just an FYI: [Ctrl]+[;] enters the current date. [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[;] enters the current time. Those entries are not formulas, so they will remain static once entered. If you want both the date and time in a single cell, then you need to add a space between the two: [Ctrl]+[;], [Space], [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[;] enters the current date and time. -John.
To insert a dynamic date stamp into Excel, enter the following formula into any cell: =TODAY(). Excel will instantly put the current date into that cell. Every time you open the workbook or make a new calculation, Excel will update the cell to the current date. Every time you open the workbook or a new calculation is made in the worksheet, Excel will update the cell with the current date and time. Unfortunately, there is no function to insert only a dynamic time stamp into Excel. However, you can change the formatting of the cell to make the NOW function display only the time.
When you press a key combination such as CTRL+; to insert the current date in a cell, Excel “takes a snapshot” of the current date and then inserts the date in the cell. That cell’s value doesn’t change, so it’s considered static. On a worksheet, select the cell into which you want to insert the current date or time. Do one of the following: To insert the current date, press CTRL+; (semi-colon). To insert the current time, press CTRL+SHIFT+; (semi-colon)
Lets say the static date is March 10th, 2015, and is in cell O5. The formula to determine the number of days between today and O5 would be, =O5-Today(). Nothing fancy or DATEDIF stuff. Obviously, the cell where you type this formula in must have a data type of 'number'. For the difference between A1 and Today's date you could enter: =ABS(TODAY()-A1). which returns the (fractional) number of days between the dates. You're likely getting a #VALUE! error in your formula because Excel treats dates as numbers.
Insert an automatically updatable today's date and current time. If you want to input today's date in Excel that will always remain up to date, use one of the following Excel date functions: = 1 TODAY() - inserts the today date in a cell. = 2 NOW() - inserts the today date and current time in a cell. So, if your goal is to enter the current date and/or time as a static value that won't automatically update the next day, you can use one of the following shortcuts: 1  Ctrl + ; shortcut
