Your guess was correct. .ipa stands for iOS App Store Package. Each .ipa file is compressed with a binary for the ARM architecture that can only be installed on iOS devices. If you change the extension to .zip you will be able to unzip it and view the contents. What does the .ipa file extension (used for iOS app bundles) stand for? I'm guessing that it has something to do with iPhone app, but I'm not sure.
India Pale Ale. It is an ale that was originally made in England for the crews of the merchant ships sailing to India. They needed something that would keep for months on the sea so they invented IPA. It was a quite strong very bitter beer. Now its a battle to see whom can make the hoppiest brew. Sometimes one producers pale ale is more hoppy than another's IPA but its usually vice versa. There are even double IPAs and UBER hoppy beers like Dogfish Head 120 (continuously hopped for 120 minutes).
SAVOR THE FLAVOR | The IPA style of beer has a whole lot going for it. First and foremost is taste, which some could argue is an acquired one. The flavor of IPA beer highlights the complex and varied results that can be achieved through hops and other beer ingredient staples. The pronounced and unique flavor profile of IPA allows for a better understanding of brewing beer in general as hops and malts are often identified individually. Black IPA is an example of a sub style that has appeared on the market in limited quantities. Hybrid IPAs such as Wheat IPA or Belgian White IPA have also gained traction. We of course will cover anything having the slightest bit of a relevant connection to IPA.
