BEARPAW AMMONITES & AMMOLITE. Ammolite comes from the fossil remains of the Ammonite Placenticeras Meeki (Female) and Intercalare (Male) and is found in the Black Bearpaw Shales of Southern Alberta, Canada.
Ammolite is a rare material. All of the world's commercial production comes from a small area along the St. Mary River in southwestern Alberta, Canada. There, two companies mine Ammolite from thin layers in the Bearpaw Formation where the ammonite fossils are found.
It is the rarest gemstone in the world. Only 1 out of 100 ammonite specimens is usable as ammolite. The ammolite fossils can be found in museums worldwide and range in size from 20 inches in diameter to 6 feet in diameter. Because ammolite isn t very hard it must be treated like a pearl or opal.
If like gemstones with provenance, then youâ€™re going to love ammolite-iridescent fossilized ammonite shells found in Southern Alberta, Canada. When the earth had only one continent with no forests or mammals, schools of ammonites hunted in the Tethys Ocean.
Iridescent ammonite fossils are found in many outcrops of the Bearpaw Formation, but these are often too damaged by weathering to serve as good gem materials. The best gem-quality material is found in the excavations of mining operations where depth has protected the Ammolite from weathering.
Although fossilized ammonites are found all over the world, supplies of the colorful iridescent gem quality ammolite are found only in southern Alberta, Canada, and only about 5% of this material actually yields gemstone material.
Ammolite is a trade name given to a thin iridescent aragonite shell material that is found on two species of extinct ammonite fossils (Placenticeras meeki and Placenticeras intercalare). Other less-frequently used trade names for Ammolite are Calcenite and Korite..
