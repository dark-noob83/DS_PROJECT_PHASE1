The subunits of proteins are called amino acids. Amino acid molecules are smaller than protein molecules and are inside of the protein molecules. Amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds where the-COOH group and the-NH2 group of two consecutive amino acids bond with the loss of a water molecule.
Structure. The ribosome is made up of two parts, called subunits. The larger of the two subunits is where the amino acids get added to the growing protein chain. The small subunit is where the mRNA binds and is decoded. Each of the subunits is made up of both protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) components. The small ribosomal subunit is made up of one ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and approximately twenty-one proteins in prokaryotes (bacteria) and approximately thirty-three proteins in eukaryotes (mammals).
Confidence votes 4. Proteins are composed of amino acids. These amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds where the-COOH group and the-NH2 group of two consecutive amino acids bond with the loss of a water molecule. The sequence of the amino acids make up the primary structure of the protein.
DNA is made up of nucleotides, and proteins are made up of amino acids. The information in DNA is first transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) , which is also made up of nucleotides. The process of converting the genetic message found in mRNA to an amino acid sequence (protein synthesis) is called translation.
