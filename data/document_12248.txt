blow to the head can be scary. But usually it is not very serious. Often there is just a mild concussion, with no serious injuries like bleeding or cracks to the skull. After a head injury, the doctor may order a test called a CT scan (pronounced “cat” scan). A CT scan takes many X-rays, to create a 3D picture of the brain.
CT after concussion or CAT scanning is the primary neuroimaging technique in the initial evaluation of the acute head trauma patient. CT imaging uses a computer to digitally construct an image based upon the measurement of the absorption of X-rays through the brain.
Brain imaging may determine whether the injury is severe and has caused bleeding or swelling in your skull. A cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan is the standard test to assess the brain right after injury. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your skull and brain. Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to view bleeding in your brain or to diagnose complications that may occur after a concussion. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images of your brain.
If your doctor thinks your child has a mild concussion, a CT scan will probably not be helpful—the CT scan results are usually normal. CT scans are better for other kinds of injuries, such as skull fractures or bleeding in the brain. A concussion is not caused by
Concussions are typically associated with grossly normal structural neuroimaging studies. [1] In other words, unlike other injuries, concussions are usually injuries no one sees and, contrary to popular belief, don't show up on most magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams or CT scans.
