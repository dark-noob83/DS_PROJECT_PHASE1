You can become an RN by completing a diploma program, which is a two-or three-year program from a hospital school of nursing, or by completing an associate degree program, which is a two-year program offered by many community colleges and some universities. Direct Entry. Direct-entry programs take the student through the RN program and straight into the master of science in nursing program. The student can qualify to take the NCLEX-RN exams at the end of 15 months of full-time study. Some direct-entry MSN programs require a baccalaureate in either nursing or another field.
