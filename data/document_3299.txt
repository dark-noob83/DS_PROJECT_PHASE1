1 When using products on frizzy hair, focus the product toward the ends of your hair. 2  Work the product up until it is about halfway through up your hair. 3  The ends dry out faster, and applying product to your scalp will only make your hair look greasy.
Instead, wet your hair and apply conditioner before you brush it. The viscosity of the conditioner will help the brush glide smoothly over your hair and will make knots easy to untangle. *Find the right brush or comb: Never brush your hair with a fine-toothed brush or comb.
2. Choose air-drying over blow-drying your hair. Air drying your hair will help eliminate frizz by reducing friction and heat caused by styling, blow-drying and towel-drying. To help the cuticles dry flat, tie it in a loose bun or braid as it dries.
1 If you choose to blow dry your hair, consider investing in a diffuser. 2  Applying direct heat to hair is one of the leading causes of frizz. 3  When using a standard blow dryer, wait until hair is 90% air dried, then use the blow dryer to dry the last 10% of your hair.
Instead, stylist Connie Eeyerlin of Dionysius Salon in Eugene, Ore., says, towel-dry hair after a shower and brush, comb, or finger-comb it. Next, add a touch of your preferred conditioner or anti-frizz product and just say no to styling with brush or comb. 2. Comb dry hair with wet fingers.
Frizzy hair tends to be drier, so you need to put moisture into it. Use a conditioner, a natural oil, or a frizz cream, Baker says. He says natural oils are better than synthetic because they are absorbed into the hair. Synthetic silicon moisturizers, on the other hand, lie on top of the hair, making it appear dirty.
Water is the key, Eeyerlin says. The problem with frizzy hair is that it's dry. Water is a basic response to this basic problem.. Eeyerlin suggests wetting your hands, then finger-combing to tackle frizz and tame tangles. 3. Tame with a touch of conditioner.
