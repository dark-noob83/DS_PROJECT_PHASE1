From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A mucous membrane or mucosa (plural, mucosae or mucosas; Latin tunica mucosa) is a lining of mostly endodermal origin. It consists of an epithelium (a layer, or layers of epithelial cells) and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue. If the lining is torn or broken, mucus is incapable of performing its roles of preventing infection and retaining tissue moisture levels. In the female, the glans clitoridis and the clitoral hood have mucous membranes.
