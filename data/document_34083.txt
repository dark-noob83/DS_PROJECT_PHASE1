Do not fertilize lawns in summer. Early fall is the best time to apply a 3-1-2 ratio fertilizer. During drought or times of water conservation, turf will go dormant, but the grass plants’ crowns will remain alive with only 1 inch of water. Mow grass at a high level in hot summer, 2½ to 3 inches.
Therefore, need about 47 pounds of 15-5-10 fertilizer to cover entire lawn. After calculating how much to apply, when to apply is the other important decision. Early fall (September 1-15) is a key time for fertilizing lawns in northern Illinois. The schedule below outlines when to apply based on how many applications are to be made annually and desired lawn quality. Use controlled-release nitrogen fertilizers in May and September and a fast-release source in late fall.
The best time to apply fertilizer in spring is when soil temperatures have warmed and the grass plant is actively growing.
If you use a lawn care service, contact the company to request that early spring nitrogen applications be limited. Lawns can be fertilized in the spring. However, wait until the roots have stopped growing. In mid-May, apply 1 pound of actual nitrogen fertilizer per 1,000 square feet.
Fertilizing lawns may not be the best for the grass in the long run, according to David Robson, University of Illinois Extension horticulture educator. But with all the advertising and chemical combination products available in the spring, it is almost impossible not to apply some form of plant food.
If not done in September, fertilize lawns with a slow-release, organic fertilizer with a 4-1-2 or 3-1-2 ratio. The final application of high-nitrogen fertilizer should be applied in November. This late treatment will help the grass to green up faster in spring.
