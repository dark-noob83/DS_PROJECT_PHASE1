The estimated cost for decommissioning the Haddam Neck nuclear plant, a 619-MWe pressurized-water reactor, is $344.4 million in 1996 dollars, not including $82.3 million in spent fuel storage costs (for a total of $426.7 million).
The estimated cost for decommissioning Maine Yankee, an 830-MWe pressurized-water reactor, was $274.9 million in 1997 dollars. This did not include costs for spent fuel management ($53.4 million) or for site restoration ($49.2 million), for a total of $377.6 million.
Decommissioning oil and gas installations can cost operators an average of $4-$10 million in the shallow water Gulf of Mexico.
Decommissioning costs-the funds needed when a reactor is shut down and the site needs to be dismantled, removed and cleaned up-are sky-rocketing. Worse, many utilities have invested these funds in the now troubled stockmarket, meaning decommissioning funds may not be available when needed.

From construction, to maintenance, and even decommissioning, running a nuclear plant can easily cost billions. While the majority of the plant’s life is certainly expensive, it’s the final portion–the decommissioning–that’s surprisingly costly.
3 FOREWORD This report is concerned with exploring current practices on decommissioning cost estimation, having the dual goals of gaining a better understanding of the primary cost elements, including their definition and derivation, and experience of what can go wrong.

Although there are many factors that affect reactor decommissioning costs, generally they range from $300 million to $400 million. Approximately 70 percent of licensees are authorized to accumulate decommissioning funds over the operating life of their plants.
The cost for decommissioning the Trojan nuclear plant (a 1130-MWe pressurized-water reactor) was estimated to be $210 million in 1993 dollars, which did not include $42 million for nonradioactive site remediation or $110 million for independent spent fuel storage installation and related fuel management.
