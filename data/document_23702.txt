Fluorescence is the visible light that a diamond emits when it is exposed to the UV rays. On a GIA Diamond Grading Report, fluorescence refers to the strength, or intensity, of the diamond’s reaction to long-wave UV, which is an essential component of daylight.
Diamond fluorescence, in its most simple form, is the effect that ultraviolet (UV) light has on a diamond. When you stand under a blue light or ultraviolet light, sometimes you can see your whites get brighter or your teeth appear to glow.
Fluorescence is a greatly misunderstood concept. Fluorescence is the reaction of trace minerals within the diamond that cause the diamond to glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. In the laboratory, special ultraviolet lamps are used to check for this but the sun is also a source of ultraviolet rays so diamonds will react in daylight as well.
Fluorescence, the effect ultraviolet (UV) light has on a diamond, is an important consideration when selecting a diamond. When UV light strikes a diamond with fluorescent properties, the stone emits a glow that is usually blue, but can also be shades of green, yellow, white, pink, orange, and red.
Fluorescence refers to how a diamond responds when subjected to ultra-violet light. UV light is what makes your whites look whiter, your teeth bright white, and your black-light posters glow. Some diamonds, when they are exposed to UV light, glow different colors. I’m not going to even try to explain why this is.
Diamond fluorescence is visible light produced by the diamond when excited by ultraviolet (UV) light. Different diamonds react different ways to UV light. Some glow different colors while others look whiter. Most of the time the glow is blue but sometimes it’s green, red or yellow.
