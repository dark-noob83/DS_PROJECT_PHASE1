The organelle that modifies and packages proteins is the Golgi  apparatus. When it does this, it is preparing the proteins for  secretion. The Organelle that break down large molecules is the lysosome. the one that prepares them for secretion is the Golgi body (apparatus).
The organelle that produces and modifies polysaccharides that will be secreted is called the Golgi apparatus. The Organelle that break down large molecules is the lysosome. the one that prepares them for secretion is the Golgi body (apparatus).
Golgi Body: vesicles attach to the Golgi and it modifies them then ships them out to various areas inside or outside the cell where they are needed. It is like layers of panca â€¦ kes stepped on in the middle (appearance wise). 1 person found this useful. The Organelle that break down large molecules is the lysosome. the one that prepares them for secretion is the Golgi body (apparatus).
