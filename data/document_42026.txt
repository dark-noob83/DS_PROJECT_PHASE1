Rivers and streams carry sediments by the force of moving water. This is erosion. When the moving water slows down, its ability to carry sediments decreases. Sediments are … deposited (deposition) when the forces of friction and gravity overcome the force of the
Water is the main force that causes the deposition of sediments thereby causing landforms. Rivers and streams easily move sediment. As the rivers and streams slow, the once suspended sediments fall to the bed and begin to pile up over time.
Primarily a combination of Gravity, solar energy in the form of wind or waves, and tectonic forces. Erosion is the movement of sediment and deposition is when that sediment gets placed somewhere else. Water falls to the Earth in the water cycle, and gravity pulls the water (or ice) down hill, carrying sediment with it (erosion).
Depositional Landforms are Slowly Formed. A depositional landform is one that is composed of material that has been washed ashore. It’s name gives a great hint at its specific formation. Deposition comes from the word deposit. So the materials making up the landform were deposited there through one form or another.
The process of weathering, erosion, and deposition are a main force behind landscape types. Although they are not the only reason for a plain, plateau, and mountain region to form.
In this section we will discuss the meaning of each of the key terms that are on the left link column and how they pertain to the formation of landforms. Aside from glaciation and tectonics the water cycle or hydrologic cycle (see graphic below) is the driving force behind WED (weathering, erosion, and deposition). This process along with winds help form the surface landscape. But without gravity and the sun this whole process would not occur.
