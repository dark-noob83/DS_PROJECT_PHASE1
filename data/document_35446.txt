Associates working at a large law firm in New York are taking home, on average, from $15,000 to $100,000 in bonus payments, depending on their tenure. The top bonuses being doled out by law firms are roughly $40,000 more than most large New York firms handed out to their most senior associates last year.
These analyses reveal a wide range of law firm compensation. For example, the overall prevailing salary for first-year associates in firms of more than 700 lawyers was $160,000 in the Northeast and West, but $125,000 in the Midwest and $135,000 in South.
Again, the size of the firm along with the location can make a big difference. Typically a family lawyer in a medium size firm in New York City can earn from $100,000 – $200,000 a year according to the DOL report. Compensation can go higher, up to $350,000 — or even greater — depending on the area of law in which the attorney practices.
NALP’s 2012 Associate Salary Survey reports that the overall median first-year salary at firms of all sizes was $125,000, up from $115,000 in 2011. Medians ranged from $70,750 in firms of 2-25 lawyers to $125,000 in firms of 501-700 lawyers, and $145,000 in firms of 251-500 lawyers and in firms of more than 700 lawyers.
In firms of 251-700 in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington DC, although some firms still pay first-year associates $160,000, most do not, resulting in medians in the $135,000-145,000 range. The median in San Francisco for firms of 251 or more lawyers remains at $145,000 having reached $160,000 only in 2009.
In the intervening years at least half the first-year salaries in firms of this size were reported at $160,000, with the proportion reaching a high of nearly two-thirds in 2009, confirming the characterization of 2009 as the recent high point for large firm salaries.
Lawyers practicing at larger firms often make larger salaries than those working for smaller firms. The average salary for an associate in New York currently stands at $160,000 a year. All law firms in New York have increased their first-year associate salaries since the mid-1990s.
