Making the world better, one answer at a time. Heterogeneous means that there are different compounds in a sample. Heterogeneous is a term used with mixtures and the way I like to think about it is: If you have cheerios, apple jacks, and coco puffs in a bowl you have a heterogeneous mixture because you can physically separate the cereals from each other. If you can not physically separate out the components, it is not a mixture.
Heterogeneous catalyst: If the catalyst is present in a different phase as the reactants, it is called a heterogeneous catalyst and this type of catalyst is called heterogeneous catalysis. Types of solids used as catalyst: Different types of solids are used in
Homogeneous reactions are chemical reactions in which the reactants and products are in the same phase, while heterogeneous reactions have reactants in two or more phases. Reactions that take place on the surface of a catalyst of a different phase are also heterogeneous.
Best Answer: Homogeneous mixture and Heterogeneous mixture are the two types of mixtures.. Homogeneous mixture-mixtures that have definite, consistent properties all throughout the process. common example is the mixture of salt in water. this is a homogeneous mixture because after the mixing salt and water cannot be separated. Heterogeneous mixture-mixtures with inconsistent, non-uniform composition.
