1 The cost of spray foam insulation is usually expressed per board foot, which is a measure of volume (not linear feet). 2  1 board foot is equal to 144 cubic inches, or a board that measures 1 foot long and 1 foot wide and 1 inch thick. 3  Open-cell spray foam costs $.40 to $.70 per board foot. 1 Closed-cell spray foam: Closed-cell foam insulation usually has an R-value per inch of around 6.0 and is impermeable to both air and moisture.
For example, a wall measuring 10 feet high by 50 feet high has square footage of 500. If the wall cavity is 3.5 inches thick, you need a total of 1,750 board feet of spray foam insulation. Open cell spray foam cost between $0.35 and $0.55 per board foot on average, in 2014. Closed cell ranged from $1.00 to $1.70 per board foot in open spaces and as high as $2.00 per board foot in a confined space. Open cell insulation cost about $1 to $1.20 per square foot; closed cell insulation rang in at $1.75 to $3 per square foot as of 2014. Fiberglass batts cost between $0.70 and $1 per square foot, while cellulose ranged from $1.17 to $1.50
The average price to cover 200 square feet with a spray foam insulation kit will run between $300 and $600 (about two to three kits). Inside spray foam kits is something called Icynene, a foam made from two liquids that are heated and pushed through a gun on the can. Since spray foam takes up less space than other types of insulation -- fiberglass or blown-in insulation, for example -- you can change its thickness to meet the requirements of the application space. The average thickness of spray foam is three inches, but it can be made deeper if needed.
1 Open-cell spray foam costs $.40 to $.70 per board foot. 2  Closed-cell spray foam costs $.75 to $1 per board foot. 3  Expressed in terms of square feet, spray foam installation cost is $1.50 to $3.00 per square foot (for an average-sized home between 2,000 to 2,500 square feet, thatâ€™s a total cost of $3,000 to $7,500. 1 Closed-cell spray foam: Closed-cell foam insulation usually has an R-value per inch of around 6.0 and is impermeable to both air and moisture.
For a general sense of what spray foam insulation costs, if you choose a light density product the cost can be roughly about $0.44 to $0.65 per board foot while opting for a closed-cell insulation product can cost roughly $0.70 to $1 per board foot. Again, these costs should be regarded as a guide only. As with most building products, the cost of spray foam insulation will be influenced by variables such as quantity, labor, type and region. Think about how the price of a car is influenced by the options, model and make you choose.
It may be helpful to know the price per square foot of spray foam to help you better compare this material to other types of insulation. Open cell insulation cost about $1 to $1.20 per square foot; closed cell insulation rang in at $1.75 to $3 per square foot as of 2014. Fiberglass batts cost between $0.70 and $1 per square foot, while cellulose ranged from $1.17 to $1.50 per square foot as of 2014.
In Louisiana, spray foam will cost you anywhere from $1.15 to $2.95 per square foot. The cost difference depends on the quality of the foam, the thickness of the application, and the product sprayed (open or closed cell). This may be a little more than other insulation options, but it's an investment. We have helped build 10,000 square foot homes that have average utility bills under $400!

Spray foam is available in two different types: open-cell spray foam which is usually $0.44 to $0.65 per board foot and closed-cell spray foam which is about $0.70 to $1 per board foot. Since spray foam takes up less space than other types of insulation -- fiberglass or blown-in insulation, for example -- you can change its thickness to meet the requirements of the application space. The average thickness of spray foam is three inches, but it can be made deeper if needed.
