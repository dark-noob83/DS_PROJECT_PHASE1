f(x) = f(−x) for all x. In other words there is symmetry about the y-axis (like a reflection): This is the curve f(x) = x 2 +1. They got called even functions because the functions x 2, x 4, x 6, x 8, etc behave like that, but there are other functions that behave like that too, such as cos(x): They got called odd because the functions x, x 3, x 5, x 7, etc behave like that, but there are other functions that behave like that, too, such as sin(x) : Sine function: f(x) = sin(x). It is an odd function. But an odd exponent does not always make an odd function, for example x3+1 is not
DEFINITION. A function f is even if the graph of f is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Algebraically, f is even if and only if f(-x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f. A function f is odd if the graph of f is symmetric with respect to the origin. Algebraically, f is odd if and only if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain of f. 1  Discussion [ Using Flash 2  ]. Examples. 3  An interactive LiveMath notebook to visualize symmetry with respect to the origin. Objectives: In this tutorial, we define what it means for a function to be symmetric with respect to the y-axis and the origin. Algebraic conditions for these two types of symmetry are obtained from the geometrical definitions.
Definition of Odd Function. The function f(x) is said to be 'odd' if and only if f(x) is a real-valued function of a real variable x, and f(- x) = - f(x). 1  The graph of an odd function is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Definition of ODD FUNCTION. : a function such that f (−x) =−f (x) where the sign is reversed but the absolute value remains the same if the sign of the independent variable is reversed.

A function is odd when: −f(x) = f(−x) for all x. Note the minus in front of f: −f(x) . And we get origin symmetry : This is the curve f(x) = x3−x. They got called odd because the functions x, x 3, x 5, x 7, etc behave like that, but there are other functions that behave like that, too, such as sin(x) : Sine function: f(x) = sin(x). It is an odd function. But an odd exponent does not always make an odd function, for example x3+1 is not an odd function.
Definition of EVEN FUNCTION. : a function such that f(x)=f(−x) where the value remains unchanged if the sign of the independent variable is reversed. ADVERTISEMENT. This word doesn't usually appear in our free dictionary, but the definition from our premium Unabridged Dictionary is offered here on a limited basis. even function. noun. Tweet. : a function such that f(x)=f(−x) where the value remains unchanged if the sign of the independent variable is reversed. ADVERTISEMENT.
Inverse function definition. An inverse function is a function that undoes the action of the another function. A function $g$ is the inverse of a function $f$ if whenever $y=f(x)$ then $x=g(y)$. In other words, applying $f$ and then $g$ is the same thing as doing nothing. We can write this in terms of the composition of $f$ and $g$ as $g(f(x))=x$
1 When $\,-x\,$ is the input, $\,f(-x)\,$ is the output. 2  For odd functions, these two outputs must be opposites. 3  Observe that ‘$\,f(x) = -f(-x)\,$’ is equivalent to ‘$\,f(-x) = -f(x)\,$’ (multiply both sides by $\,-1\,$ and switch sides). 4  Sometimes, the definition is given using this equivalent characterization. $g(-x) = (-x)^3 - 1 = -x^3 - 1$. find $\,g(-x)\,$: definition of $\,g\,$; function evaluation. $-g(x) = -(x^3-1) = -x^3 + 1$. find the opposite of $\,g(x)\,$: definition of $\,g\,$; the distributive law. 1  If an odd function is defined at zero, then its graph must pass through the origin.
