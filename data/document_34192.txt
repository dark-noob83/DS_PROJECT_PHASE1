The larynx, also known as the voice box is a muscle in the neck which allows us to make sound in order to speak, sing and make sound.
The epiglottis is a flexible flap at the superior end of the larynx in the throat. It acts as a switch between the larynx and the esophagus to permit air to enter the airway to the lungs and food to pass into the gastrointestinal tract. Throughout each day, the epiglottis spends the vast majority of its time relaxed at the superior edge of the larynx just posterior to the tongue. In this position, air is able to enter the pharynx from the nose or mouth and pass freely into the larynx and onward to the lungs.
The larynx is another name for the voice box. It is a tube about 2 inches (5cm) long in adults. The larynx sits above the windpipe (trachea) in the neck, in front of the upper part of the food pipe (pharynx). The larynx is where the breathing and digestive systems separate. When you breathe in, air travels through your mouth, larynx, windpipe (trachea), and then into your lungs.
The epiglottis is a thin, leaf-shaped structure at the superior border of the larynx, or voice box. In its relaxed position, the epiglottis projects into the pharynx, or throat, and rests just posterior to the tongue. Viewed from the posterior direction, it is shaped like a teardrop with a wide, rounded region at the superior end and a narrow tapered point at its inferior end.... Click to read more below.

The larynx is a tough, flexible segment of the respiratory tract connecting the pharynx to the trachea in the neck. It plays a vital role in the respiratory tract by allowing air to pass through it while keeping food and drink from blocking the airway. Inferior to the epiglottis is the glottis region of the larynx, which contains the vocal folds. The largest cartilage in the larynx, the thyroid cartilage, supports the glottis.
