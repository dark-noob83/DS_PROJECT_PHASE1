1. Single gene disorders: disorders caused by defects in one particular gene, often with simple and predictable inheritance patterns. 1  Dominant diseases: single gene disorders that occur when an individual has one altered copy of the relevant gene and one healthy copy.
Types of single gene disorders. The occurrence of a disease caused by a single gene mutation may occur in several main patterns or modes. These are grouped according to whether the trait is sex specific (generally X-linked) or not (autosomal). As a rule, single gene disorders (also known as Mendelian traits or diseases) are relatively uncommon.
But the mutations we hear about most often are the ones that cause disease. Some well-known inherited genetic disorders include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, phenylketonuria and color-blindness, among many others. All of these disorders are caused by the mutation of a single gene. Most inherited genetic diseases are recessive, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene to inherit a disorder.
There are three types of genetic disorders: 1  Single gene disorders are caused by a mutation in a single gene. 2  The mutation may be present on one or both chromosomes (one chromosome inherited from each parent). 3  Sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and gCJD are examples of single gene disorders.
Here are some diseases which are caused by gene mutations:- 1)Cystic Fibrosis:- Cystic fibrosis is a single gene mutation. This disease is related with secretory glands of the body like sweat and mucus. This is a hereditary disease.
