Molybdenum is a mineral that is required in only trace amounts in the body in order to be extremely effective. As a dietary mineral, molybdenum is part of sulfite oxidase. Molybdenum is made up of three separate enzymes which are called aldehyde oxidase, xanthine oxidase and sulfite oxidase. The result of this combination is the metabolism of DNA and RNA, food and iron into energy the body uses to function properly.
Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 10 19 y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium -100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150 ns. Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes further corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially so in the so-called super austenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo).
MOLYBDENUM Overview Information. Molybdenum is a trace mineral found in foods such as milk, cheese, cereal grains, legumes, nuts, leafy vegetables, and organ meats. The amount in plant-derived foods depends on the soil content in the growing area. Molybdenum is also present in water in varying amounts. Molybdenum is stored in the body, particularly in the liver, kidneys, glands, and bones. It is also found in the lungs, spleen, skin, and muscles. About 90% of the molybdenum eaten in foods is eliminated by the body through the urine
Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth, but rather in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, which is a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes further corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially so in the so-called super austenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo).

Molybdenum levels in humans. In considering physiological effects of molybdenum deficiency and excess, and possible toxic effects of molybdenum, it is important to know whether it accumulates in the body as a result of repeated exposure to low doses. 
Candida And Molybdenum Connection. Molybdenum is an essential trace mineral that is found in the human body naturally in small quantities and may also be present in certain foods. This mineral is an effective supplement that may be used for protecting an individual from the effects of the Candida overgrowth condition. 
Why molybdenum is good for you. Molybdenum is a trace mineral, which means the body only needs a very small amount of it to maintain good health. Molybdenum assists the body by fighting nitrosamines, which are associated with cancer, may prevent cavities and may help to prevent anaemia. Molybdenum is also part of xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase-both involved in the body's production of genetic material and proteins. Xanthine oxidase also helps the body to oxidize purines and pyrimidines, and produce uric acid, an important waste product. Important molybdenum facts.

Molybdenum is a chemical element with symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek μόλυβδος molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores. Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes further corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially so in the so-called super austenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo).
