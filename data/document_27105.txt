Vegetables. In general, the denser the vegetable, the longer you need to steam it. In addition, smaller chunks steam faster than larger ones. Assuming that your vegetables are cut in 1-inch squares, it takes 8 to 10 minutes to steam hard root vegetables such as beets, potatoes, carrots, turnips and rutabagas. Softer vegetables with higher water contents, such as zucchini and peppers, can take as little as two to three minutes.
