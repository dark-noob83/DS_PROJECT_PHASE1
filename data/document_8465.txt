Horses that are bred for speed, like Quarter Horses and Thoroughbreds, can reach 40 mph for short periods of time. I would say the average fro horses overall is about 33-35 mp … h... it really depends on the horse. I've seen Thoroughbreds only get to 20 and I've ridden my Paint up to about 43. Horses speed varies with their stride length, body build, and other factors, but here is a basic idea of how fast-- in miles per hour-- horses move at their various gaits: Wal … k: Roughly 3-4 MPH. A pleasure show horse can go as slow as 2 mph. Gaited horses-- who do not trot-- can do a 'running walk' as fast as 15 mph
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Secretariat ran the Kentucky Derby in 1:59 and 2/5, but he is the only horse to do it under 2:00. The KY Derby is 1.25 miles and 2:00 goes into an hour 30 times; so multiplying 1.25 by 30 = 37.5 mph. For a short burst a race horse can go faster than that; but that was the easiest computation I could think of using the well known Fastest 2:00 in sports. Edited. 
A fast quarter horse can run about 45mph. at top speed, but this only lasts for a few seconds. Petro Jay, running 6 furlongs at Turf Paradise, AZ, had a time of 1:07.2 and ran 40.18 mph. Thoroughbred The average horse doe run at about 25 mph. Racehorses can gallop up to 40 mph. Sometimes faster. Some horses (mainly Saddlebreds) can do a rack up to 20 mph. We clocked my Spotted Saddle Horse gelding's fastest gait at 16 mph. They can definately go faster than 25mph!
The gallop averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph). The world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is 88 kilometres per hour (55 mph). Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot.
The fastest thoroughbreds average nearly 40mph! And an average thoroughbred runs about 36 mph. The world record for a Thoroughbred racehorse's average speed over a mile is 43 miles per hour...but their spurts of speed can be slightly faster. Converted to kilometers per hour that equals 69.2km/h. In the '73 Belmont, it was estimated that Secretariat hit 55 mph down the stretch.
The Guinness Book of Records reports that the fastest speed of a racehorse ever reported was approximately 70.76 kilometers (43.97 miles) per hour and was achieved by the horse Winning Brew at the 2008 Penn National Race Course at Grantville, over a distance of 402 meters. References. 
The fastest thoroughbred racehorse has reached top speeds of 55mph, almost double that of Usain Bolt’s 100m world record top speed. However, thoroughbred’s aren’t just fast, they’re also known for their stamina and can maintain a pace of 16 mph for 60 miles. Talk about the ultimate ultra marathoner. 
The average top speed of a Thoroughbred racing horse is 63 kph (39 mph). This average for quarter horses is much faster: about 81 kph (50 mph). And an average thoroughbred runs about 36 mph. The world record for a Thoroughbred racehorse's average speed over a mile is 43 miles per hour...but their spurts of speed can be slightly faster. Converted to kilometers per hour that equals 69.2km/h.
Best Answer: … the thoroughbred can run … a mile (1.6 kilometers) in about 1 and 1/2 minutes. The American Quarter Horse is the king of speed.
