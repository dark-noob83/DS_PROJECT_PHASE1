Go Back. The average speed of an object is defined as the distance traveled divided by the time elapsed. Velocity is a vector quantity, and average velocity can be defined as the displacement divided by the time. For the special case of straight line motion in the x direction, the average velocity takes the form:
The average speed and average velocity are also related like the speed and the velocity. The average velocity is the ratio of total displacement of the object over a given time. While average velocity is related to displacement of the object, the average speed is related to the total distance traveled by the object.
$Average\ Speed$ = $\frac{Total\ distance\ travelled}{Total\ time\ taken}$. The velocity of an object is defined as the displacement divided by the time internal during which the displacement occurred. Since displacement is a vector quantity, average velocity is also a vector quantity.
By rearranging the formula gives, $Total\ distance\ travelled$ = $Average\ Speed \times Total\ time\ taken$ And $Total\ time\ taken$ = $\frac{Total\ distance\ travelled}{Average\ Speed}$. Average speed is defined as the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken. Average speed is a scalar quantity. $Average\ Speed$ = $\frac{Total\ distance\ travelled}{Total\ time\ taken}$ The velocity of an object is defined as the displacement divided by the time internal during which the displacement occurred.
