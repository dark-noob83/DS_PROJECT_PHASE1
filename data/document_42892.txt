The general rule of thumb is, the first $200 you earn in a month from employment does not affect your ODSP. For every dollar earned above the $200 a month reduces your ODSP by 50 cents. In other words, if you earned $300 in a month, you can expect that the first $200 does not reduce your ODSP. After that, his ODSP is reduced by 50 cents for every dollar he earns above and beyond the $200. For example, if he receives $6000 in net income the first $200 does not affect his ODSP, leaving $5800 that will affect his income, which will reduce his ODSP by $2900 for the month.
