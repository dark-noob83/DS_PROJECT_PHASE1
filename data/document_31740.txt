The average person walks between 3,000 and 4,000 steps per day. To find out how many steps you take each day, buy a pedometer similar to the one in the video at the bottom of this page.
While walking for one hour at a rate of 5 mph, or 10,000 steps, is recommended to lose an average of one pound a week, it may be an overwhelming goal. Start slow and assess your exercise tolerance. At the end of the day, if you only took 3,000 steps, aim to increase the amount to 3,500 the next day.
About 10,000 steps is the equivalent of exercising strenuously for 30 minutes, or walking five miles per day. By following this routine, you'll expend an additional 2,000 to 3,500 calories per week. One pound of fat equals 3,500 calories. The average American takes 2,300 to 3,000 steps per day.
But walking 10,000 steps a day is one healthy-living habit that’s easier than you think. Start your commitment by setting a goal. Use the pedometer to figure out how many steps you take in a normal day, and then add about 1,000 to 2,000 steps every week until you reach 10,000.

10,000 steps per day. How far is 10,000 steps anyway? The average person's stride length is approximately 2.5 feet long. That means it takes just over 2,000 steps to walk one mile, and 10,000 steps is close to 5 miles.
If you are reasonably healthy, 10,000 steps a day is a good goal for you. It is the equivalent of walking about five miles per day. (I say about because the actual distance depends on your stride.) You certainly don't have to take all those steps at once, but accumulate them over the course of the day.
10,000 steps a day is recommended for most days, however there are other exercises that can bring this number down. If you are riding a bike for 30 minutes your steps can be reduced by up to 5000 steps.
