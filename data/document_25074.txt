The rise of Deathwing destroyed the goblin starting area, as a lvl 1 goblin your task was to escape, so there is nothing to which a higher level goblin can return.
Iâ€™ve had a chance to play through the goblin starting area three times now and my opinion of it has changed quite a bit. At first I thought that the zone was interesting but nothing special.
1 Skip goblin and Worgen starting areas. 
Not sure about leaving the goblin area early but I do know that the Blood Elf starting area is it's own zone and that may be why you can fly there. If you recall you have to use a orb outside undercity to get there or go through a gate to the south and anytime you enter the area you zone in.
1. You mean the Pandaren starting area, not the Monk starting area. Monks, as a non-Hero class, do not have a starting area of their own. 2. Like the Worgen and Goblin starting areas, the Pandaren starting area is wholly sequestered from the rest of Azeroth. The only way in is to create a Pandaren, and the only way out is when you pick a faction at the end of the questline.
The only way to get off the Lost Isles is to complete the quest line. Any attempt to leave either through summoning, join battle ground or joining a dungeon will result in a message saying you need to complete the Goblin starting
15475. The Goblin starting zone can only be accessed when you first create a level 1 Goblin. If you did a race change to Goblin later on, you can't go there. Likewise, if you make a level 55 Goblin Death Knight, you will start at Acherus and you won't be able to do the Goblin starting zone.
