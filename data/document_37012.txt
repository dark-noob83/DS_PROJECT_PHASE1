Rabbits may eat a small amount of pasta, cereal or even bread. Do not give it alcohol. Rabbits shouldn't eat iceberg lettuce either. To fatten him up, give him a diet of high (18%+) protein pellet, banana slices, yogurt treats or sunflower treats and alfalfa hay. They also will enjoy papya, strawberries and apple slices. Make sure he has plenty of fresh water.

Advice will depend on the circumstances; if this is a young rabbit then a good quality feed, either pellets or rabbit mix, with timothy or alfalfa hay and a small amount of veg daily together with plenty of excercise should be all a bunny needs to fill out and grow healthily.
