nep·tu·ni·um. Symbol Np A silvery, radioactive metallic element of the actinide series. It occurs naturally in minute amounts in uranium ores and is produced artificially as a by-product of plutonium production. The most stable isotope of neptunium has a half-life of 2.1 million years.
Element Neptunium-Np. Comprehensive data on the chemical element Neptunium is provided on this page; including scores of properties, element names in many languages, most known nuclides of Neptunium. Common chemical compounds are also provided for many elements.
Excluding 237 Np, the half-life of these isotopes ranges from 3 milliseconds (225 Np) to 154,000 years (236 Np). Neptunium has the atomic symbol Np, atomic number 93, and atomic weight 237. It is a Block F, Group 3, Period 7 element. The number of electrons in each of Neptunium's shells is 2, 8, 18, 32, 22, 9, 2 and its electron configuration is [Rn] 5f 4 6d 1 7s 2. The neptunium atom has a Van der Waals radius of 221.pm.
neptunium. neptunium (nĕptōˈnēəm) [ key ], radioactive chemical element; symbol Np; at. no. 93; mass number of most stable isotope 237; m.p. about 640°C; b.p. 3,902°C (estimated); sp. gr. 20.25 at 20°C; valence +3, +4, +5, or +6. Neptunium is a ductile, silvery radioactive metal.
A silvery, metallic, naturally radioactive element, atomic number 93, the first of the transuranium elements. Its longest-lived isotope is Np-237 with a half-life of 2.1 million years. Found in trace quantities in uranium ores, it is produced synthetically by nuclear reactions. See Periodic Table.
