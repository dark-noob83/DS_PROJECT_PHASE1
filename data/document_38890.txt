Agar comes from Red Algae (primarily the Gracilaria genus). It mainly is produed from the red algae Gracilaria lichenoides. This algae is harvested along the western coast of the United States and in parts of Asia. To extract the agar the Algae is boiled, cooled, purified and then dried. The agar is then make into blocks, flakes, or granules.
Agar may be made out of varieties of red algae; the most popular one is the Ceylon moss. Agar is a gelatinous substance made out of the pigment and subunits of the polymeric red algae. Agar is also water soluble-it can absorb water at certain amount and form a solid film.
Red algae come from salt water. The salinity of the red algae allows the agar to have lower acid. On the other hand, the water soluble of sodium chloride used in melting down agar has lower acidity due t salt content. Substances with lower acidity will eventually produce alkaline results.
With its distinctive smell, one can easily distinguish agar from the other materials commonly found in a laboratory. Chemically, agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar galactose, and is a component of the cell walls of several species of red algae that are usually harvested in eastern Asia and California.
Seaweed is a loose colloquial term encompassing macroscopic, multicellular, benthic marine algae. The term includes some members of the red, brown and green algae. They are photosynthetic, like plants, and simple because they lack the many distinct organs found in land plants.
The algae are simple photosynthetic plants that live in water. Most species are small to very tiny; many can only be seen with a microscope and often float or swim as plankton in the water column. But some algae--what we often call pond scum or seaweed--are conspicuous plants that can form dense mats of vegetation.
