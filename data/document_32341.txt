An increase in body temperature is one of the first signs of an infection or an illness in humans. The average body temperature for infants range from 97 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius, and anything above that is generally considered a fever. Children and infants with a fever need to be watched and comforted with lukewarm baths or sponge baths.
Babies under 12 weeks old who have a fever higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit taken rectally, and children with a fever of 105 degrees Fahrenheit or higher when taken by any method, or 104 degrees Fahrenheit if the temperature is taken in the armpit, should be taken to see the doctor immediately.
Although it may be scary when your child's temperature goes up, fever is not harmful. The average normal body temperature is about 98.6°F (37°C) . It usually rises during the day from a low of 97.4°F (36.3°C) in the morning to a high of 99.6°F (37.6°C) in the late afternoon.
Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6°F (37°C). Some studies have shown that the normal body temperature can have a wide range, from 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).
A normal temperature is considered to be 99 degrees Fahrenheit or less when taken in your child's mouth, and 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or less if you take it in your child's bottom, according to HealthyChildren.org.
A normal temperature measured by mouth is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) and can be between 97 degrees Fahrenheit to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 degrees Celsius to 37.2 degrees Celsius). This is because different people have different normal body temperatures.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below
The normal body temperatures for children are the same as an adult human and are considered to be between 36 to 36.8 degrees Celsius or 96.8 to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit. In a child, any temperature that exceeds 36 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is considered to be high and is medically classed as a fever.
