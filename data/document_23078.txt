Respiratory System. Respiratory system is the system of respiratory passages, lungs and respiratory muscles of human body. Respiratory system is responsible for exchange of gases between the human body and the surroundings. In the process of exchange of gases, human body gains oxygen and gets rid of carbon dioxide.
The human respiratory system. The respiratory system. It is very important to know that we can not live without the air, It contains oxygen gas which burns the small particles of the digested food to produce the energy, carbon dioxide gas and the water vapour and this process is called the respiration process.
The respiratory system is crucially important to us, it allows to exchange gas. meaning carbon dioxide and oxygen. These gas exchanges occur in the alveoli's and the capillary by diffusion. Two things happen external and internal respiration. External, is the action of bringing in air literally.. by just breathing.
The respiratory system provides oxygen to the bodyâ€™s cells while removing carbon dioxide, a waste product that can be lethal if allowed to accumulate. There are 3 major parts of the respiratory system: the airway, the lungs, and the muscles of respiration.
The human respiratory system is a series of organs responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. The primary organs of the respiratory system are lungs, which carry out this exchange of gases as we breathe.
The respiratory system does two very important things: it brings oxygen into our bodies, which we need for our cells to live and function properly; and it helps us get rid of carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular function.
