To get your blood into the artificial kidney, the doctor needs to make an access (entrance) into your blood vessels. This is done by minor surgery to your arm or leg. Sometimes, an access is made by joining an artery to a vein under your skin to make a bigger blood vessel called a fistula.
Here are some ways to care for your fistula and graft. 1  Keep your access arm clean, and watch for signs of infection such as tenderness, swelling, redness, fever or flu-like symptoms. 2  If an infection is caught early, it can often be easily treated with antibiotics. 1 Watch for signs of infection: redness, swelling, pain, pus or fever. 2  Call your dialysis center right away if you notice any of these. 3  During dialysis, be sure the staff person who will connect your catheter to the dialysis tubing washes his or her hands first and wears gloves and a mask.

When chronic kidney disease progresses to end stage renal disease (stage 5 kidney disease), patients will need dialysis to help clear the blood of toxins and fluid usually processed by the kidneys. The two main dialysis modalities are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves using a machine that circulates your blood through a filter to help remove fluid and waste. Hemodialysis is most frequently done in a dialysis unit three times a week for three to four hours each time. Dialysis staff will monitor your dialysis while you are on the machine.
