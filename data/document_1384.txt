Implantation is the process by which a fertilized ovum (egg) implants into the uterine wall to obtain oxygen and nutrients from the mother. This usually occurs between 6 and 8 days after conception. Conception itself can occur anywhere between a few hours and 5 days after intercourse. This is because sperm can live inside your uterus and fallopian tubes for up to 5 days.
