Mufflers cancel out most of an engine's noise. ­. ­If you've ever heard a car engine running without a muffler, you know what a huge difference a muffler can make to the noise level. Inside a muffler, you'll find a deceptively simple set of tubes with some holes in them. These tubes and chambers are actuall­y as finely tuned as a musical instrument.
You see them on every single vehicle on the road. You know they affect a vehicle's sound. You've also been told countless times that upgrading them is an essental way to boost your power and performance.
A slip-on exhaust is actually just part of the exhaust system. When they are used, the exhaust pipes from the cylinder heads to the muffler are reused, with new slip-on mufflers added to replace the stock ones. These aftermarket mufflers look and sound different from the stock ones, making them a very attractive modification.
A muffler is an important component of an engine's exhaust system. The muffler is found near the back of a vehicle, and its purpose is to reduce the noise produced from the exhaust process.
The faster your engine can get rid of exhaust gases, the faster it can take in fresh oxygen and generate more power. Therefore, efficient exhaust flow is essential to power output. Performance enthusiasts generally don't love mufflers, because by design they create some degree of restriction in the exhaust system. But alas, you can't just go out on the highway without a muffler-state and local laws govern sound levels, and mufflers are necessary in order to stay street legal.
Muffler Styles. There are many different types of mufflers out there, each suited to different performance and sound tastes. If you want a blazing hot sound with a straight-through design that minimizes backpressure, go with a glasspack muffler like the Cherry Bomb Glass Pack.
