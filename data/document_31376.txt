Some people confuse the terms compound and molecule. Both of these are the result of chemically joining together atoms of different elements. A molecule is the smallest unit (particle) of a compound that has the physical and chemical properties of that compound.
1 Simple molecules [molecule: A molecule is a collection of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. 2  It is the smallest part of a substance that displays the properties of the substance.
: Some people confuse the terms  compound  and  molecule . Both of these are the result of chemically joining together atoms of different elements. A molecule is the smallest unit (particle) of a compound that has the physical and chemical properties.
A molecule is a particle containing two or more atoms. If it contains only one type of atom it is called an element. An exception to this is diatomic gases (for example: Oxygen, O 2, where the molecule contains two atoms of the same element, bonded covalently. If it contains two or more different types of element which are bonded it is called a compound.
