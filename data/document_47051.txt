Osmium is the most dense metal! Many people are familiar with lead (11.3 kg/mL), but osmium is twice as dense (22.6 kg/L)! Each liter (about 1/4 gallon) of osmium weighs 22.6 kg (50 lbs). For comparison, each liter of water weighs only 1 kg (~2.2 lbs).
1 Osmium. The densest naturally occurring element on the planet is osmium, a metal in the platinum family with a density of 22.6 grams per cubic centimeter. If that means nothing to you, then you’re normal. By comparison, lead is 11.3 grams per cm cubed.
The densest known material is the Element Osmium, at about 22 tonnes per cubic meter. The densest theorized material would be white dwarf/neutron star matter, which could be m … illions of times denser.
5 Mercury. The densest “liquid” on earth is actually a metal: mercury. Mercury is not only awesome to look at and incredibly poisonous to ingest, but it is also more than 12 times more dense than water. It rates at 13.5 grams per cubic cm on the ol’ density scale, making it denser than many solid metals, including lead.
Best Answer: Densest Naturally Occuring Mineral The mineral Chengdeite-Ir3 Fe Specific Gravity - 19.3 g/cm3 (Gold is 17.65, Platinum is 18.00) Densest Element-Iridium - 22.65 g/cm3 Closely followed by Osmium - 22.61 g/cm3.
Answer: Density is mass per unit volume. Either of two elements can be considered the element with the highest density: osmium or iridium. The density of the element depends on many factors, so there isn't a single number for density that would allow us to identify one element or the other as the most dense.
