In the United States, the average cost of an IUI cycle using your partner's sperm is about $865. Keep in mind that treatment costs vary depending on how much medicine you need, where you live, and whether your state mandates insurance coverage for infertility.

Infertility and IVF insurance coverage is not common and a lot of variation is seen in what is covered and what is left for the patient to pay. The average cost of in vitro fertilization in the U.S. is currently about $11,000 to $12,000. General infertility treatments such as ovarian stimulation plus intrauterine insemination, IUI are significantly less expensive than in vitro fertilization. However they are also significantly less effective. 
There's no standard guide to what the average cost of IUI is because each clinic incorporates much different techniques. Price estimates range from around $400-$2,000. The cost range depends on several factors: 1  Basic costs: The low end of IUI costs covers just the basic in-clinic procedure. 2  Having the sperm washed and prepared in the lab, then inseminated into the woman costs only a few hundred dollar
1 High cost of living does not equate to high treatment costs. 2  IUI prices ranged from $275 to $2,457—a huge differential. 3  Some prices quoted include medications, blood work and sonograms; others do not—hence the huge price differential. 4  ICSI prices across the country are within $500 of each other—$1,000 to $1,500. 1 In areas with few infertility clinics, prices, on average, are higher. 2  High cost of living does not equate to high treatment costs. 3
Ask for a rate sheet, if available, and also ask what your cycle is likely to entail. The IUI procedure and sperm washing average $200-300, but the cost of medications, ultrasounds and bloodwork can make a considerable difference. Someone doing a natural IUI cycle may spend only $200, while someone on injectable medications with monitoring may spend $5,000-6,000.

1 Sperm washing, which is always necessary for IUI, can cost about $100. 2  IUI is the more commonly used type of artificial insemination, because it has a higher success rate than placing sperm in the cervix. 3  Ultrasounds, which are almost always used to monitor progress, cost up to $300 each. $1100 for 1 medicated cycle of IUI. $20 for Clomid, I can't recall how much the HCG trigger shot was, the ultrasound to monitor my ovaries midcycle cost $500, the sperm washing cost $200 and the actual IUI cost $245. I did a second cycle which required an additional ultrasound and cost around $1500 total
