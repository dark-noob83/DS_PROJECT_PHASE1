Asker's rating. Report Abuse. The regulator rectifier does what it says. When the engine is running the alternator (generator) produces about 16V to keep the bikes accumulator (Battery) charged; however the battery needs a stable DC voltage at about 13.2V.
What is a Regulator/Rectifier. The regulator rectifier is a combined unit. It does the rectifying part as well the regulation part. It is part of a battery charging system. It usuallty gets an AC power feed from the stator coil of the generator (alternator).
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The rectifier rectifies, or converts, AC current coming from the AC dynamo (alternator) into DC current that the battery and and electrical accessories can use.
A regulator regulates the voltage, preventing overcharging of the electrical system. A rectifier converts the AC current form the alternator, into DC current for use on a battery system. strech Â· 9 years ago. Thumbs up. 2. Thumbs down. 1.
A rectifier usually means a (set of) electronic components that turns AC into DC, which you need to charge a battery for instance. A regulator-well, it regulates something. Considering the category the question is posted in I'd say it regulates the charging of the battery and/or the output voltage of the rectifier.
