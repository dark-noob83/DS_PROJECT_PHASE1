It’s not fair to the dog or the new owner to get a puppy that more than likely will have health problems. A good quality Siberian husky puppy with cost way more than 100 bucks.

Because dogs can eat slightly less when eating premium dog food, a husky would eat about 1 1/2 cups per day. That would equal about 23 pounds of food per month. Using the average premium price of $65 per bag, your cost would be approximately $50 per month. The feeding recommendation for an adult Siberian husky is 1 ½ - 2 cans of wet food per day, based on a 12-oz can. Mid-range name brand dog food costs about $1.25 per can.
