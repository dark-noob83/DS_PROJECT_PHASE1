Bento (弁当, bentō) is a single-portion takeout or home-packed meal common in Japanese cuisine. A traditional bento holds rice, fish or meat, with pickled or cooked vegetables, usually in a box-shaped container. Containers range from disposable mass produced to hand crafted lacquerware. 1 This bento is often eaten at a gathering like a funeral or a party. 2  It is usually packed with traditional Japanese foods like tempura, rice and pickled vegetables. 3  A shidashi bento packed with European-style food is also available.
Bentos can be elaborately arranged in a style called  kyaraben  (character bento). Kyaraben are typically decorated to look like popular characters from Japanese cartoons (anime), comic books (manga), or video games.
