Tank Needs. Because silver dollar fish mature between 5 and 8 inches in length, they require a fairly large tank. Minimum tank size is 75 gallons, with a length about 4 feet. Keep the water temperature between 75 to 82 degrees, with pH under 7.
2 weeks ago, I purchased 6, 1 tetras and put them in my 55 gallon tank with 6 silver dollars fish and 1 angel fish, all 5. The angel is 9 years old. The silver dollrs are 1 year old. Within 24 hours, tetras were dead and old fish had cloud eye and some had white, wounded lips.
Other fish that live longer include loaches, such as the Clown Loach and Weather Loach, which often life 10 to 15 years. Silver Dollar s and Pacus also live 10 years or more, and the ever popular Convict cichlid can live 20 years. Reference List. Here is a reference with the expected lifespan of popular aquarium fish. These figures are simply an average. Keep in mind that with good care fish can live much longer.
1. Silver Dollars do grow large and fast so you will probably need a big tank to accommodate them. Because they grow to the size of a dinner plate (8 inches in diameter), a VERY large tank will be needed to house a shoal of 4-6 adult fish. A 300 gallon (1,135.6 L) or larger tank would be appropriate for these fish.
Yes silver dollars and neon tetras can live together peacefully. The neons may be timid becuase of the size difference, but the silvers will not intentionally harm your neons. A) Neons are good for a 30, but not silver dollars. B) Silver dollars grow too large and are too skittish.
