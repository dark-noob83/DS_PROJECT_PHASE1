Baked potatoes are traditionally baked in the oven. Prick them with a fork so air doesn't build up in the potato and explode it during cooking. Some cooks prefer to oil the skins or wrap them in aluminum foil so they stay soft. Cook them with the rest of the meal at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes to 1 hour. For quick weeknight meals, place clean potatoes in a slow cooker in the morning. Cook them on low all day for baked potatoes at dinnertime.
Preparation. Preheat oven to 400°. Pierce potatoes with a fork; bake at 400° for 1 hour or until tender. Cool slightly. Cut each potato in half lengthwise; scoop out pulp into a large bowl, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Mash pulp with a potato masher. Add milk and cream cheese to mashed potato; stir with a whisk.
• Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. • Scrub the potato clean under water, dry it with a towel, then poke a few holes through to the center of it with a fork. • Bake the potato for one hour or until tender. • Slice into it, fluff it up inside with a fork, then add butter, salt, and pepper.
1 Your potato shell should be about 1/4-inch thick. 2  Mash the potato pulp and add the milk, sour cream, butter, salt and pepper and stir together with a whisk. 3  Carefully add 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese, the black beans and the corn.
Set the potatoes directly on the rack in the center of the oven and bake until easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and turn the heat down to 400 degrees F. Cut a slit in the top of the potatoes and carefully scoop out the flesh into a bowl, leaving the shells intact. Mash the potato lightly with a fork. Add the butter, sour cream, and 1/3 cup of the cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Refill the shells with the potato mixture mounding it slightly. Set the potatoes on a baking sheet, and bake until heated through, about 15 to 20 minutes.
