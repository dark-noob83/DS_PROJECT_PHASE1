Three Parts: Setting up a furnace Following safe practices Melting the brass. Brass has a relatively low melting point compared to iron, steel, or gold, but it still requires a special furnace. Many beginning metalworking hobbyists start out with aluminum, which is easier to melt, but brass is often the next step.
Not all brass is made the same way. The melting point of red brass  is 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit. The melting point of yellow brass is  1,660-1,710 degrees Fahrenheit, and th … e melting point of admiralty  brass is 1,650-1,720
Most brass will melt at temperatures as low as 1,650ºF (900ºC), but a higher maximum temperature will give you a margin of error, and make the brass easier to pour. 1  Select a furnace large enough to hold the crucible and brass you intend to melt.
Melting temperature of some common metals and alloys. Melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from solid to liquid state. Melting points for some metals and alloys are indicated below.
