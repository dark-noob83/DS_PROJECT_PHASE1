Best Answer: A half sister is your sister who shares your blood, a step-sister doesn't share blood. My father was married to a woman and had two boys before he married my mom and had my brother and me. So, I have 2 half brothers because we have the same dad.
Step siblings are the children of your step parent. So, if your mom married a man, and that man had a daughter from a previous relationship, she would be your step sister. A half sibling is biologically related to you through only one of your parents.
Hence you share a biological and social relationship with your half sibling. Step-brother/Step-sister: You are not related to your Step-Sibling in a biological way. Your mother/father is married to one of the Step-Sibling's parents and this is the basis of this social relationship.
Lets say you have a half-sister. She will have the same mom but her dad is not the same dad as yours... A step-sister is someone who comes with their parent to your family when one of your parents gets married. Lets say that your parents get divorced and your dad decides to get remarried.
Step Siblings vs Half Siblings. Step siblings and half siblings are two kinds of relationships that show differences between them. Half siblings have one biological parent in common. On the other hand, step siblings are related by the parents marrying. There are people who consider that there is no difference between a step sibling and a half sibling. However, that is not true. As we have already shown, the difference between step siblings and half siblings lies in the way the siblings are related.
A half sibling is a brother or sister who has one parent in common with you (eg: you both have the same mother, but different fathers). A step-sibling is a sibling who is rel â€¦ ated to you only by marriage of parents. In other words, your mother or father marries somebody else who already has children.
