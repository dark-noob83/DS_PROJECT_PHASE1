Toss the potatoes and remaining unpeeled garlic in a bowl with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place in the bottom of a large roasting pan. Place the lamb on top of the potatoes and roast for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature of the lamb is 135 degrees (rare) or 145 degrees (medium). Remove from the oven and put the lamb on a platter; cover tightly with aluminum foil. Allow the lamb to rest for about 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Using your hands, rub the lamb all over with the lemon juice. Pat the garlic and rosemary evenly all over the surface of the meat. Season the meat with the salt and pepper and place the lamb in a roasting pan. Place the lamb in the oven and roast for 30 minutes.
1 Turn off broiler, remove lamb from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. 2  Heat oven to 325 degrees. 3  Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest portion of the lamb; return it to the oven. 4  Roast for a total of 50 minutes to 1 hour, until thermometer registers a rosy-pink 140 degrees. 5  Check lamb several times after 30 minutes.
Put an onion or two in the pan and 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary. Place the roasting pan in the oven set at 350F(190C) for 15-20 minutes per pound (you don't want to cook lamb well done, but more medium to medium rare) a 6 pound leg should take about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the cover(or foil) for the last 15 minutes of roasting time.
