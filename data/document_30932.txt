Fair Isaac Corporation developed the FICO score 27 years ago (1987). Since that time, it has definitely been the gold standard for credit scoring, as it is the score most commonly used by lenders. You can get your FICO score for free with these cards.
The highest possible credit score is 850- anything above around 700 is really good. Below 620 you are considered a serious credit risk and will pay high interest rates on any … loans, credit cards, etc. you can get It depends on the Credit Reporting Agency because they all use varying models.
The FICO score ranges from 300 to 850, with a FICO score of 850 being the highest score you can obtain. Your FICO score is calculated from the information contained within your credit report and analyzes five key categories to determine your score: • Your Payment History — 35% of your score.
Of course, that would mean a 900 credit score would be the highest credit score possible, and beyond the range of most consumer Fico scores. So even though a 900 Fico score is technically possible, there’s a very good chance you don’t have one, and never will.
Of course we all want the best, but the highest possible credit score — the 850 FICO — is almost unattainable. In fact, there are many loan officers that have been in the business for years who have said they’ve never seen a perfect 850 credit score before.
FICO scores range from 300 to 850, where 850 is considered to be the best score achievable. According to myFICO.com, a division of the Fair Issac Corporation, only 13% of the U.S. population has a FICO score greater then 800, while only 2% has a FICO score lower then 500.
The minimum FICO-based credit score is 300 while the maximum is 850. However, some scoring models utilized by credit bureaus may be tweaked so that a different formula is used … as well as a somewhat different range in scores may be used.
Most websites also get the average seriously wrong, too. A FICO score can range from 300 to 850. There is a lot of misinformation on the internet as to what the average score is (many sources cite numbers in the 670’s).
The VantageScore credit score ranges from 501-990, so 990 is the highest credit score you can achieve if a bank or lender uses that scoring model. Again, the higher the credit score the better. Anything above 900 would land you in their “A” bucket, which as we know all from grade school is the best you can do.
