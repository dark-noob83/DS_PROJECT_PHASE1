According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, foreign aid to China totals $2.6 billion a year; $65 million of it is from US aid.

Indeed, while foreign aid is well under 1 percent of the total U.S. federal budget, it's still counted in the multiple tens of billions of dollars – around $23 billion this year, or a total of $37 billion if you include assistance to foreign militaries. And that, of course, is a lot of money. In addition, the U.S. will spend around $14 billion in fiscal 2013 for foreign military assistance – that's money spent on training foreign armies and providing them with weapons.
1 Illegal households create a net fiscal deficit at the federal level of more than $10 billion a year. 2  If given amnesty, this number could grow to more than $29 billion. 3  $1.9 billion dollars a year is spent on food-assistance programs such as food stamps, WIC and free school lunches for illegal aliens. 1 Illegal households only pay about one-third the amount of federal taxes that non-illegal households pay. 2  Illegal households create a net fiscal deficit at the federal level of more than $10 billion a year. 3

The U.S. typically gives less than $1 million in economic support per year to Brazil. Brazil owns $255 billion in American debt.

Given that U.S. military aid to Israel was $2.775 billion in 2010, $3 billion in 2011, $3.07 billion in 2012 (and $3.15 billion per year from 2013-2018) while Israel's defense budget is around $15 billion, it made us wonder how much Israeli taxpayers contribute and where the other $12 billion non-U.S. aid comes from. That would put the Israeli taxpayer contribution at $10.5 billion, compared to $3.15 billion from the U.S. (Even added that the U.S. aid in 2011 was $3.1 billion and that most of the aid comes in weapons as opposed to cash.).
The U.S., by far, gives more foreign aid than any other country. For the fiscal year 2013, President Obama asked for $55 billion to be distributed to more than 180 countries — that’s 1.5 percent of the federal budget.
