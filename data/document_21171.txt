$60 per night would probably be a fair rate at a minimum. I charge $78 per 24 hours, and that can include spending the night or visiting the pets as often as needed.

A lot depends on whether this person is a professional or just doing this as a side thing. For the pet sitter – Getting repeat business is obviously a goal.
