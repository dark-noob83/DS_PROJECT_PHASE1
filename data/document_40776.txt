For example, if you are earning 4% interest per year on the savings in your bank account, and inflation is currently 3% per year, then the real interest rate you are receiving is 1% (4% - 3% = 1%). The real value of your savings will only increase by 1% per year, when purchasing power is taken into consideration.
Calculating the Present Value of a 9% Bond in a 10% Market. Let's assume that a 9% $100,000 bond is prepared in December 2013. By the time the bond is offered to investors on January 1, 2014 the market interest rate has increased to 10%. The date of the bond is January 1, 2014 and it matures on December 31, 2018.
1 Suppose we buy a 1 year bond for face value that pays 6% at the end of the year. 2  We pay $100 at the beginning of the year and get $106 at the end of the year. 3  Thus the bond pays an interest rate of 6%. 4  This 6% is the nominal interest rate, as we have not accounted for inflation.
DEFINITION of 'Nominal Interest Rate'. The interest rate before taking inflation into account. The nominal interest rate is the rate quoted in loan and deposit agreements. The equation that links nominal and real interest rates is: (1 + nominal rate) = (1 + real interest rate) (1 + inflation rate).
Real Risk-Free Rate of Interest: The rate of interest that would exist on default-free or inflation is expected to be zero. Inflation Premium: A premium for expected inflation that investors add to the real risk-free rate of return.
