Pipe longevity also depends on the thickness of zinc in the original galvanization, which ranges on a scale from G40 to G210, and whether the pipe was galvanized on both the inside and outside, or just the outside. The earliest known example of galvanizing of iron, encountered by Europeans is found on 17th century Indian armor in the Royal Armouries Museum collection. It was named in English via French from the name of Italian scientist Luigi Galvani.
Galvanization, or galvanisation, is the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent rusting. The most common method is hot-dip galvanization, in which parts are submerged in a bath of molten zinc. The earliest known example of galvanizing of iron, encountered by Europeans is found on 17th century Indian armor in the Royal Armouries Museum collection. It was named in English via French from the name of Italian scientist Luigi Galvani.
Galvanizing protects in two ways: 1  It forms a coating of corrosion-resistant zinc which prevents corrosive substances from reaching the more delicate part of the metal. 2  The zinc serves as a sacrificial anode so that even if the coating is scratched, the exposed steel will still be protected by the remaining zinc.

Most assume that means to dip, but that is not galvanized. Galvanized is when something is coated with zinc using electrolysis, an electrical way of coating. You can go to a home depot and look at dipped nails and electrocoated nails and see the difference in appearance. It does not make much difference in the purpose. Polyhistor · 8 years ago. This silver-gray coating does not rust and prevents steel from rusting. A galvanized iron pipe is rust resistant whereas its iron (not galvanized pipe) will rust for instance. Many steel items are galvanized
Hot-dip galvanization is a form of galvanization. It is the process of coating iron and steel with a layer of zinc by immersing the metal in a bath of molten zinc at a temperature of around 840 °F (449 °C). The process of hot-dip galvanizing results in a metallurgical bond between zinc and steel with a series of distinct iron-zinc alloys. The resulting coated steel can be used in much the same way as uncoated.
Confidence votes 5.8K. Galvanized is an adjective used to describe steel which has been coated with zinc metal. Galvanized steel is quite well protected from corrosion by the zinc coating which provides the steel with both physical and chemical protection. There are currently 3 processes which are used for galvanizing steel: (1) hot dip galvanizing, (2) electrogalvanizing, and (3) thermal diffusion galvanizing. The zinc coating preferentially undergoing corrosion to protect steel and after the corrosion of zinc it forms a mixture of zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide. This is white in color.

Galvanization, a general term, is either the work of covering with metal by the use of a galvanic current or the coating of iron or steel with zinc to protect it from rusting. …   Galvanizing:Galvanizing is often though ot as the process of hot dip coating steel or iron with zinc. Galvanizing is a process of coating iron with zinc to protect against rusting. The process may be electrochemical, (the origin of the name) nowadays the term is most often app … led to a hot dip porcess, simply dunking a clean iron/steel piece into molten zinc pulling it out and letting it cool.
Best Answer: Galvanizing is the chemical process where iron and iron alloys (steel) are dipped into molten zinc. The zinc adheres to the steel through a spontaieous electrochemical process resulting in a tightly adhering layer of zinc on top of the steel. This silver-gray coating does not rust and prevents steel from rusting. A galvanized iron pipe is rust resistant whereas its iron (not galvanized pipe) will rust for instance. Many steel items are galvanized
Mr. Crowley: Thanks for your interest, maybe I've used the wrong words: With pre-galvanized. I mean steel galvanized in continuous process (so, galvanized before bending or cutting). With post-galvanized, on the other hand, I mean the classical galvanizing process, where the Zinc is layed onto the finished pieces. I hope I've clarified the question. Best regards, A. Pre-galvanized usually is in sheet form, though sometimes pipe.
