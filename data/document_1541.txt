The first layover was in Atlanta, Georgia (will not answer their phone either) and the second would have been Detroit, MI to Flint, MI. Greyhound is totally unprofessional and has no info to give. Most of their stations do not answer the phones. The only call that was answered was to the 800 number and they could not help. The bus station in Flint tried to help, but could only give me the route of the bus in question. This missing person is very sick and has heart problems. I will never travel on a greyhound and neither will any of our family or friends after this fiasco.
