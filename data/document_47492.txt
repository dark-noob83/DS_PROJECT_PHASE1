Thankfully, that's changing now.. Frighteningly, type 2 diabetes is spreading. The CDC found that from 1990 to 1998, the number of people with type 2 diabetes jumped 33 percent. That number is expected to increase a whopping 165 percent by 2050.
Keeping blood sugar close to normal reduces your chances of having heart, eye, kidney and nerve problems that can be caused by diabetes. To control your diabetes, you need to know your blood glucose numbers and your target goals. There are two different tests to measure your blood glucose. 1  The A1C (pronounced A-one-C) test. 2  The blood glucose test you do yourself â€“ also called self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG).
You and your doctor or health care provider should discuss an A1C goal that is right for you. For most people with diabetes, the A1C goal is less than 7. An A1C higher than 7 means that you have a greater chance of eye disease, kidney disease, heart disease, or nerve damage. Lowering your A1C by any amount can improve your chances of staying healthy.
2 Tests to Measure Blood Sugar Control. To control your diabetes, you must know your blood sugar numbers. Testing your blood sugar is the only way to know whether your blood sugar is too high, too low, or just right.
For those who do not have diabetes, a score of less than 5.7% is considered normal, while 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes and 6.5% or higher means you have diabetes. If you already have diabetes, a score of 7% or lower is desired. You and your doctor can decide what score is best for you.
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people with type 2 diabetes should aim for blood sugar levels that are as close to normal as possible; this is referred to as tight control.. The better your blood glucose control is, the less likely you are to have diabetes-related health complications.
