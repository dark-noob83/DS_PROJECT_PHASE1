The data reveals that India s population in the 0-14 age group has remained close to 38-39 percent from 1881-1951. There was a sudden increase in 1961, when the percentage of population in 0-14 age group crossed the mark of forty one percent (41%) and in 1971; it reached its peak by crossing forty two percent (42%). The trend in age-structure is further revealed through the analysis of detailed age-cohorts from 1881 to 2001. In the first two age-cohorts i.e., of 0-4 and 5-9 years, there is a decline in their proportion in the total population of India after 1961. This trend is maintained even in the 2001 census.
India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. It is expected that, in 2020, the average age of an Indian will be 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan; and, by 2030, India's dependency ratio should be just over 0.4. 
The median age (which means that one half of the population is younger and the other one is older) of India’s population has been increasing constantly after a slump in the 1970s, and is expected to increase further over the next few years. In 2014, about 28.75 percent of the Indian population fell into the 0-14 year category, 65.9 percent into the 15-64 age group and 5.36 percent were over 65 years of age. Age distribution in India. India is one of the largest countries in the world and its population is constantly increasing
This statistic depicts the age distribution of India from 2004 to 2014. In 2014, about 28.75 percent of the Indian population fell into the 0-14 year category, 65.9 percent into the 15-64 age group and 5.36 percent were over 65 years of age. Age distribution in India.

Data is available for India and all states. The Transition State takes a look at how India and its states have been ageing. The median age of India in 2011 was a young 24 years, with the median age ranging from 19 years in Meghalaya, 20 in Bihar and UP to 31 years in Kerala. This is good news for India as even it’s most aged state is still younger than China or the United States. Below is a map of median ages of individual states. Median Age in India, 2011.

Abstract. Age structure of any region is the consequence of birth rate, death rate, migration and the expectation of life at birth. This study examines the spatial and temporal changes in the age-sex structure of India s population by studying in detail the shift in each age-cohort from 1881 to 2001. The trend in age-structure is further revealed through the analysis of detailed age-cohorts from 1881 to 2001. In the first two age-cohorts i.e., of 0-4 and 5-9 years, there is a decline in their proportion in the total population of India after 1961. This trend is maintained even in the 2001 census.
The median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population. The median age of the population in India in 2014 is estimated to be 27 years. 
1 : The distribution of the population according to age. 2  Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). 3  The age structure of a population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. 1 : The number of males for each female one of five age groups-at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and for the total population. 2  Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries.
The median age (the age at which half the population is older and half is younger) of the Australian population has increased by 4.0 years over the last two decades, from 33.4 years at 30 June 1994 to 37.3 years at 30 June 2014. Between 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014 the median age remained steady at 37.3 years. In 2010, the age structure of Australia's population was similar to that of New Zealand and the United States of America. Generally, the European countries and Japan had smaller proportions of children and higher proportions of older people than Australia.
