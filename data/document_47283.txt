CoolSculpting is an FDA approved technology that uses cold therapy to freeze and destroy fat cells, with no surgery required. It is also called cryolipolysis and is a pain free method to rid yourself of fat in specific areas. Coolsculpting by Zeltiq received FDA clearance for the non-invasive reduction of fat in September of 2010. The results appear to be long lasting and testing has shown no increase in blood lipids or blood cholesterol. It takes several weeks for the fat to be expelled.
Thus, the typical charge for performing a neurosuspension (i.e., up-front costs, including perfusion and cooling to liquid nitrogen temperature) was in the $6,000 to $7,000 range, while for whole body patients it was in the $10,000 to $12,000 range; well within budget. The doubling allows for uncertain and contingent costs such as the need to relocate, legal problems, etc. Consider that after 100 years of interest on a whole body patient's reserve of $83,464, the fund would only be $338,017 (in constant dollars).
Prices vary. The cost to put a freeze in place ranges from free (for ID theft victims or senior citizens) in some states to $20 per freeze in Delaware, while the cost of unfreezing runs from free to $18. The most-common price is $10, but in 44 states, no fee is charged to identity theft victims. Twenty states require victims to provide a police report to qualify for a free freeze. The cost of unfreezing runs from free to $12.
The rate at which most labor is billed is $15.00 per hour. Exceptions to this are the $2,000 fee to our physician, who comes from San Diego, two hours away, day or night, and stays, usually for 24 hours straight (a real bargain at $2K), and our perfusionist/surgeon, who averages $20.00 per hour for his services.

Cryonics isn't cheap -- it can cost up to $150,000 to have your whole body preserved. But for the more frugal futurists, a mere $50,000 will preserve your brain for perpetuity -- an option known as neurosuspension. 
Answers. Best Answer: A: Good news: you heard wrong! With CI, the minimum fee for cryopreservation at CI (which includes vitrification perfusion and long term storage) is $28,000 — a one-time fee, due at time of death. And though it can be paid in cash, usually a member has a life insurance policy made that pays the amount to CI upon death. But many CI Members simply take the $28,000 option, without Standby, which can cost around $30 a month for someone starting his insurance when middle aged and in good health.
1 The cost of harvesting and freezing eggs is about $7,000 to $12,000. 2  When the woman is ready to use the eggs in the future, the cost of thawing, fertilizing and transferring the resulting embryo to the uterus will run an additional $4,000 to $5,000 -- bringing the total cost possibly as high as $17,000. 1 When the woman is ready to use the eggs in the future, the cost of thawing, fertilizing and transferring the resulting embryo to the uterus will run an additional $4,000 to $5,000 -- bringing the total cost possibly as high as $17,000. 2  However, as this experimental technology is refined, costs could change.
When Steve Bridge and I wrote The High Cost of Cryonics in 1981, the recommended minimum for cryonic suspension with Alcor was $60,000 for whole body and $25,000 for neurosuspension. The rates were raised to $100,000 for whole body and $35,000 for neurosuspension in 1982, where they have remained until now [1990]. The doubling allows for uncertain and contingent costs such as the need to relocate, legal problems, etc. Consider that after 100 years of interest on a whole body patient's reserve of $83,464, the fund would only be $338,017 (in constant dollars).
We’ve had a standalone deep freezer for years. As I calculated before, the cost of maintaining and using a deep freezer is about $130 a year. On average, we freeze an item for six months and it takes up about 1/2% of the freezer, so our cost for that individual item in the freezer is $0.32. We use freezer containers over and over again to freeze items, so the cost for the container is $0.01 or $0.02. This gives us a total cost of roughly $0.34 to freeze a quart of vegetables ourselves if we use it in six months. Simply put, the raw cost of freezing or canning is cheaper if you do it yourself, but only if you have a source of free or extremely inexpensive vegetables and fruits.
