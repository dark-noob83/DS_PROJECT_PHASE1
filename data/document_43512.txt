Crime scene investigators often work long hours, even though their normal work schedules might be from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., five days a week. Crimes happen anytime without notice -- during the day, at night and on the weekends. This is why CSIs typically rotate on-call responsibilities every other week.
Salary Range. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the average annual income of police detectives in the U.S. was $75,720 in 2011, or $36.41 an hour. Detectives in the top 10 percent of the income scale earned more than $122,290 a year, while those in the bottom 10 percent made less than $39,660.
According to BLS data, the average annual salary for detectives and criminal investigators was $79,030 as of May 2013, with individuals in the highest 10% bracket earning $125,320 or more. Recent graduates of bachelorâ€™s degree programs will typically start out toward the lower end of the scale.
The typical workweek for a detective is 40 hours with paid overtime if necessary. Since protection must be provided around the clock, many detectives and criminal investigators will work varying shifts. With this said, detectives may be required to work long hours during investigations or whenever they are needed.
Median of all compensation (including tips, bonus, and overtime) by years of experience. Detective or Criminal Investigators with a lot of experience do not necessarily enjoy more money. Someone who has worked for fewer than five years earns around $47K on average. Individuals with five to 10 years of experience don't get much more, though; the average income in this group is $52K. Detective or Criminal Investigators bring in $59K after working for 10 to 20 years.
