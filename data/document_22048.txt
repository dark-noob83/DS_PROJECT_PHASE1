How to Make Your Manicure Last. Keeping your nails looking their polished best is simple. Good manicure habits will also protect the health of your nails. Follow these seven steps and your manicure should last seven to 10 days.
Although gel manicures are generally only done in salons, OPI and CND are both pushing at-home versions. The polishes are expensive (think $20 a bottle) and the U.V. lights used in salons can cost $600. (The at-home versions start at around $40.) A gel manicure can last up to 20 days.
A basic manicure or pedicure will last one to two weeks, depending on your lifestyle and the type of service you've had. If, for example, you work in the garden without gloves, your manicure probably won't last long.
There are many variables that affect the durability of a manicure. The polish formula, for example, the age of the polish, and the color. Dallas finds at the salon that matte colors generally don't last as long as colors with a glossy finish.

I get a gel manicure; my own nails with special polish that gets baked under a light. Mine last at least 2 weeks; could easily last 3 weeks but I don't like the grow-out by your cuticle. My hands are in water a lot since I don't have a dishwasher and they still last.
3. Prep Before Polish. If you have vertical ridges on your nails, create a smooth surface by applying a ridge-filling strengthener. Or, buff away the ridges with the fine side of a four-sided buffer. Use restraint. If you buff too aggressively, you'll make the problem worse by thinning out the nail plate.
