There are really only two qualifications for judges. They must be very well informed about the law, and they must be of good moral character. Actually, they need to be able to READ the plain language of the law (Codes) and APPLY/ENFORCE them as written-not re-interpret or twist them.
Qualifications of a Judge. The qualifications of a judge fall into two quite distinct categories: (1) legal and (2) professional and personal. The Constitution of Maryland specifies those in the first category (Art. I, ยง 12; Art. IV, ยง 2).
All judges must have a bachelor's degree, and most judges also hold a juris doctorate (J.D.) law degree from an accredited law school. Many judges start their careers as lawyers, gaining experience working in courtrooms and learning the ins and outs of the legal system.
A bachelor s degree and work experience usually constitute the minimum requirements for a judgeship or magistrate position. A number of lawyers become judges, and most judges have first been lawyers. In fact, Federal and State judges usually are required to be lawyers.
Depending on the type of judge you wish you become, you may have all the qualifications down on paper but you'd still need to be elected. The qualifications needed may vary for specific types of judges by state but this should provide a general overview of the qualifications required to become a judge.
