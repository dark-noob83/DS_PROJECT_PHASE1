The scam claims it will be handing out free tickets to Facebook users who join the Facebook event, invite 125 friends, comment, and more. This is entirely false. Facebook users who follow these instructions will not enter themselves into a drawing to win free Disney World Family Cruise tickets.
Currently, a scam is circulating on Facebook that promises a chance to win a free Walt Disney World vacation to any user who likes, shares and comments on a particular post.
They want to get your personal information, hack your emails or credit card accounts, or get access to your pages so they can advertise and spam. These sites are usually on Facebook and they want you to “SHARE” a picture or advertisement so you can be entered into the free Disney World trip giveaway. Don’t do it. One site from a few weeks ago was called “Diseeny” and this latest one comes from “ Delta Airlines. ” and was reportedly founded in 1924.
