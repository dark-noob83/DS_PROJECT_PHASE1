CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS. The Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836), the first Anglo-American constitution to govern Texas, was drafted by a convention of fifty-nine delegates who assembled at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1, 1836 (see CONVENTION OF 1836).
2. The first constitution for Texas was the Mexican Constitution of Coahuila y Tejas (1827). 3. The second was the Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836), which was written when Texas declared its independence from Mexico. It established an elected chief executive with considerable powers, a bicameral legislature, and a four-tiered judicial system composed of justice, county, district, and supreme courts. 4.
Between the years of 1824 and 1876, Texas was at times a part of the United States of Mexico, an independent republic, a state within the Confederate States of America, and a state within the United States of America.
The first Texas constitution, written at the time of the Texas Revolution was drafted in 1836 and designed for the Republic of Texas, not the state. It was put together quickly and contained laws from both the United States and Mexico.
