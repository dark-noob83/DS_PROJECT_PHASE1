Twenty-five percent of the world – one person in four is an introvert. Much of society seems to tell us that this is a bad thing, that there is something wrong with people who are quiet and leed rich internal lives. This simply isn’t true.
Introvert and extrovert are the names given to two of the basic personality types based upon their characteristics. No two people are the same, and people tend to have different physical and mental characteristics. In general, a person can be either outgoing or reserved, who could enjoy more when alone.
An introvert is someone who is usually reserved and prefers to be alone. Social events tends to drain them of energy giving them the need to have sessions of time being alone which tends to vary from person to person.
Introversion is usually thought of as the tendency to enjoy solitude rather than time with a group of people. Introverts are often described as “recharging” on their own rather than when socializing. Extroverts often gain energy from spending time with lots of other people while introverts expend energy.
Introvert. Opposite of extrovert. A person who is energized by spending time alone. Often found in their homes, libraries, quiet parks that not many people know about, or other secluded places, introverts like to think and be alone.
Basically, an introvert is a person who is reserved, quiet, and solitary. Introversion and its opposite, extroversion, also spelled extraversion, form the ends of a continuum that describes one aspect of every person's personality. The concept was popularized by the work of psychologist Carl Jung.
