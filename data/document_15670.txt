Price is what the hospital bills. A couple researchers looked at this (name forgotten, sorry) and wrote a good paper on it. My limited memory tells me that costs for the first two days in the icu average about 10k per day. After that it starts to decease,such that in most cases the last day in the icu is about 2k or so. If you do a search on google scholar you should be able to find the paper. # 1 9.
It cost significantly MORE for the pt to be in an ICU bed than a step down or floor bed. I have no problem taking care of the sick ICU pts that actually need to be in ICU, but when docs do this it is wasting money and wasting a bed. Sorry, just a rant Totally unrelated to the post, but $6000 bucks a day is A LOT! # 1 3. My ICU is about $6,000 per day as the basic charge. On top of that the patient will get billed for the intensivist's services and any other consulting physicians, any tests or procedures will also be billed separately.
Overall mortality rates in patients admitted to adult ICUs average 10% to 29%. Recent studies have shown that the pediatric mortality rate associated with sepsis is 13.5%, whereas the overall mortality rate for pediatric ICU patients ranges from 2% to 6%. Cost Savings. Between 2000 and 2005, annual critical care medicine costs increased from $56.6 to $81.7 billion, representing 13.4% of hospital costs, 4.1% of national health expenditures, and 0.66% of gross domestic product.
The median ICU cost per day of survivors was $1,357 for medical cases and $1,501 for surgical cases. Respective cost per day values for non-ICU (ward) care were $232 and $281. Differences in cost per day were $1,152 for medical survivors and $1,220 for surgical survivors. The mean ratios of ICU to non-ICU cost per day for survivors were 6.2 for surgical cases and 7.2 for medical cases. The 95% confidence intervals for the difference mean cost per day between ICU and non-ICU cost per day were $1,201 and $1,356 for surgical survivors, and $1,154 and $1,294 for medical survivors. Intervals for non-survivors were much larger (Table III).
Dividing that by 300 Million people we come up with $3,333 per person, per year or $277 a month. 20% of health care costs are for ICU care, which typically make up 1% of the beds in an average hospital. Daily ICU costs range from $2,000 - $3,000 per day in the US. (1996 figure). Conversations with Dr. K have revealed something I didn't quite get, but is probably obvious to medical professionals. It ain't the procedure, it's the bed.
-A total of 44.6% had at least one major co-morbid condition; the most common co-morbidities included diabetes (13.2 %) and pulmonary disease (13.2%). -Daily incremental cost of mechanical ventilation for ICU patients is estimated at between $600 and $1500 per day. -Mean hospital costs were $34,257 dollars (+/- $40,559 dollars) with lower average costs in rural and small hospitals. Discontinuing mechanical ventilation continues to be one of the most challenging events in ICU management, and a significant portion of time spent on the ventilator (40%) is dedicated to weaning..

The study population was similar to that of other studies of pediatric intensive care. The PICU was 86% efficient. The total cost for PICU care was $16,983,323. Average cost per admission was $12,342 +/- $22,313, and average cost per patient day was $2,264 +/- $868. The cost because of the PICU location (room cost) was 52.1% of all costs, and cost of laboratory studies was 18.3%.
The average cost of one day of futile treatment in the ICU was $4,004 per patient. The cost of caring for the 123 patients whose treatment was perceived as being futile, both in and out of the ICU, was $2.6 million, the researchers found.
