At an average cost of $12.75 per meal, you’d save yourself $8.75 for each of those meals. In other words, the average American would save $36.75 per person per week by moving all of their meals from restaurants to home-prepared meals. Let’s look at a more realistic picture. A couple summers ago, I did a food series where I prepared a wide variety of meals for my family at under $10 per meal. Those meals fed four (at the time) of us quite well and often left food for the following day’s lunch for some of us. Thus, the cost for these meals was well under $2 per person per meal.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The average cost of one meal per day per person is 7 dollars. However, the average price of a home cooked meal per day per person is just under 3 dollars. 
Our average cost per meal, per person, is around $1.50 (our actual spending per day probably would look low b/c the boy gets a lot of meals for free at work). In my opinion, we eat very very well for what we spend, but in terms of what in our budget is not hardcore mustachian, the grocery bill might be it. 
Six Per Diem Tiers. As of March 2013, the six meals and incidental expenses per diem tiers are $46, $51, $56, $61, $66 or $71 per day. Major U.S. cities such as Chicago, New York and Los Angeles fall within the maximum per diem tier of $71 per day. Meals Broken Down. The daily per diem is further broken down into each meal, plus the $5 incidental rate. Tier 1 per diems are $7 for breakfast, $11 for lunch and $23 for dinner. Tier 2 per diems are $8 for breakfast, $12 for lunch and $26 for dinner. Tier 3 provides $9 for breakfast, $13 for lunch and $29 for dinner
So, just $5 per day each. That’s $2 less per person per day than the average USDA food budget. For a family of 4 that is $600 per month, with some families coming in a lot lower. The average USDA monthly food budget for that same family is $840. I found a few thrifty’s, a lot of low-cost or moderates, and no one who admits to spending the liberal plan :-). So for the sake of argument I’ll assume that the moderate plan is pretty average. The moderate plan for a family of four with small children is $855 per month. That is $7 a day for each person.
These rates are based on two tables found in IRS Publication 1542, and were not increased from 2012 rates for fiscal year 2013. At publication date, the high-cost location daily per diem is $242 for lodging and meals and incidental expenses; the per diem for all other locations is $163 per day. Meals Broken Down. The daily per diem is further broken down into each meal, plus the $5 incidental rate. Tier 1 per diems are $7 for breakfast, $11 for lunch and $23 for dinner. Tier 2 per diems are $8 for breakfast, $12 for lunch and $26 for dinner. Tier 3 provides $9 for breakfast, $13 for lunch and $29 for dinner
According to the USDA the average family of four is spending somewhere between $544 to $1235 per month for food eaten at home. That’s a huge range! They break it down into 4 plans: Thrifty, low-cost, moderate, and liberal. I found a few thrifty’s, a lot of low-cost or moderates, and no one who admits to spending the liberal plan :-). So for the sake of argument I’ll assume that the moderate plan is pretty average. The moderate plan for a family of four with small children is $855 per month. That is $7 a day for each person.
The average daily travel cost estimates below are per-person, per day, for two people traveling together (that is, sharing a hotel room) and include lodging, three meals, and some transportation. (If you're traveling alone, expect to spend 35% more.). 
Per Diem Breakdown. The GSA breaks down business trip per diem rates into two categories: The first is lodging and the second is meals and incidental expenses.. The incidental part of the meals and incidental expenses per diem is $5 per day no matter where you travel. Meals Broken Down. The daily per diem is further broken down into each meal, plus the $5 incidental rate. Tier 1 per diems are $7 for breakfast, $11 for lunch and $23 for dinner. Tier 2 per diems are $8 for breakfast, $12 for lunch and $26 for dinner. Tier 3 provides $9 for breakfast, $13 for lunch and $29 for dinner
