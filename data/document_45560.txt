Iâ€™m wondering if manufacturers have taken such numbers into consideration and as a result take efforts to make sure your appliance does not last that long. Imagine no return customers for 10 to 15 years :/. The longest my major appliances have last with exception of my dishwasher and garbage disposal is 7-8 years.
While your particular model may last for a longer or shorter duration than the average expectancy, it is good to have an idea of the average time you can expect your appliance to last. This will give you an idea of when the dishwasher will need to be replaced and help you to budget accordingly.
Life Expectancy Numbers. The typical dishwasher can be expected to last between seven and 12 years, with the average working expectancy being nine to 10 years. Certain factors, such as cost, quality, brand, care, maintenance and frequency of usage, can affect the life expectancy of a dishwasher.
According to the results, the average lifespan for a modern dishwasher is just nine years. Although my Maytag was working well up until the accident, I purchased it back in 2001 and it appears to be bumping up against its expiration date.
The life expectancy of a typical appliance depends to a great extent on the use it receives. Moreover, appliances are often replaced long before they are worn out because changes in styling, technology and consumer preferences make newer products more desirable. Of the major appliances in a home, gas ranges have the longest life expectancy: 15 years. Dryers and refrigerators last about 13 years. Some of the appliances with the shortest lifespan are: compactors (6 years), dishwashers (9 years) and microwave ovens (9 years).
