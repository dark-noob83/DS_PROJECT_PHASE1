A theta is the latin word for a specific symbol used in mathematical equations. The theta means the angle. You use the theta symbol to say angle. The symbol is useful when y … ou don't know the degree of the angle is. * * * * * Theta is not Latin nor is it a word. from the list, you will find theta. Both upper-and lowercase are available. To insert into any other program, including Microsoft products that you can't do Insert-Symbol, create the symbol in Word, highlight it, then do Copy, followed by a Paste into the application you want.

It is used to stand for an unknown angle in the same way that the Roman letters x or y are used in algebra. In trigonometry, theta is a symbol commonly used to represent an unknown angle in the same way you might use x to label an unknown side or an unknown number in general.

The form ϑ was retained by Unicode as U+03D1 ϑ GREEK THETA SYMBOL (=script theta), separate from U+03B8 θ GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA. For the purpose of writing Greek text, the two can be font variants of a single character, but θ and ϑ are also used as distinct symbols in technical and mathematical contexts. The upper-case letter θ is used as a symbol for: 1  Quantity or temperature, by SI standard (in italics). 2  Dimensionless temperature in transport phenomena. 3  An asymptotically tight bound in the analysis of algorithms (big O notation). 4  A certain ordinal number in set theory.
The lower-case letter θ is used as a symbol for: 1  A plane angle in geometry. 2  A special function of several complex variables. 3  One of the Chebyshev functions in prime number theory. 4  The potential temperature in meteorology. 5  The score of a test taker in item response theory. The upper-case letter θ is used as a symbol for: 1  Quantity or temperature, by SI standard (in italics). 2  Dimensionless temperature in transport phenomena. 3  An asymptotically tight bound in the analysis of algorithms (big O notation). 4  A certain ordinal number in set theory.

Equivalent in classical Greek to t + h, as in right-hand, but in modern Greek to spirant th, as in thin. theta antigen. A cell membrane constituent which distinguishes T cells from other lymphocytes
Theta-Delta is the most widely used symbol in representing Therianthropy. It is featured in the favicon of this wiki. The symbol consists of two Greek letters layered on top of each other: the Delta and the Theta characters. Both characters are typically depicted in the same colour against a contrasting single colour background, and may be styled further by intertwining the letters. Non-Use of the Theta-Delta Edit. Although being common Theta Delta is not used by some therians for various reasons. Some may not wish to use visual symbols to represent their Therianthropy. Some, including the Therian Temple protest the use of the symbol due to it's historical usage in branding criminals.
1. In statistics, θ, the lowercase Greek letter 'theta', is the usual name for a (vector of) parameter(s) of some general probability distribution. A common problem is to find the value(s) of theta. Notice that there isn't any meaning in naming a parameter this way. We might as well call it anything else
In has a value of 9 in the Greek numeric system. In classical Athens Theta was used as an abbreviation for the Greek θάνατος (thanatos, death), as it vaguely resembled a human skull. Theta was also used as a warning symbol of death just like the universal skull and crossbones symbol is used today. Non-Use of the Theta-Delta Edit. Although being common Theta Delta is not used by some therians for various reasons. Some may not wish to use visual symbols to represent their Therianthropy. Some, including the Therian Temple protest the use of the symbol due to it's historical usage in branding criminals.
