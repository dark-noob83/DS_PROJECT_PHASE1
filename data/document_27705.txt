5. SeaWorld’s breeding program results in a high number of stillbirths. Orcas are notoriously difficult breeders -- even more so in captivity. In fact, until the whale Kalina was born in September 1985, no captive-born orca was able to survive more than a few days.

Orcas at SeaWorld spend most of their time floating listlessly at the surface of the water with little to no shade from the hot blistering sun. In the wild, orcas spend up to 95 percent of their time submerged and would find shade in the depths of the ocean, but at SeaWorld their tanks are far too shallow. Their deepest tank is 40 feet deep —not nearly deep enough to give them a reprieve from the harsh elements.
John Hargrove, a trainer who spent 14 years working with orcas, mostly at SeaWorld, eventually became disillusioned with the company's treatment of its killer whales.

And the reason for whales' aggression, he says, is that they're held captive. Hargrove eventually became disillusioned with SeaWorld's treatment of orcas and left the company
A veteran animal trainer was killed Wednesday at SeaWorld Florida when one of the show's killer whales dragged her underwater. SeaWorld said that 29-year-old male Tilikum pulled Dawn Brancheau, 40, into the orca's tank about 2pm. When I was narrating a Killer Whale show with Skana at the Vancouver Aquarium in summer 1978, Skana closed her jaws on the trainer's head during a part of the show called the Kiss. Skana held his head in her mouth for a few seconds and then released her jaws.
Something about SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau's ponytail may have triggered the attack. That's what an official at the Orlando marine park told reporters the day after the 16-year veteran at SeaWorld was killed by Tilikum, a 12,000-lb. (5,500 kg) killer whale. Tilikum, a killer whale at the SeaWorld amusement park in Orlando, Fla., performs during the show Believe on Sept. 3, 2009. The whale killed a trainer on Feb. 24, 2010, according to police and company executives. 1  Email. 2  Print
John Hargrove, author of Beneath the Surface: Killer Whales, SeaWorld, and the Truth Beyond Blackfish, was the senior trainer at the time and one of the most experienced orca handlers in the world. In February 2010, Tilikum, a killer whale at SeaWorld amusement park in Orlando, Florida, pulled his trainer Dawn Brancheau underwater, killing her.
Following a 2006 attack by an orca on a trainer at SeaWorld in San Diego, the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health concluded that it was “only a matter of time” before someone was killed while interacting with the orcas. In the wild, orcas spend up to 95 percent of their time submerged and would find shade in the depths of the ocean, but at SeaWorld their tanks are far too shallow. Their deepest tank is 40 feet deep —not nearly deep enough to give them a reprieve from the harsh elements.
For years, activists have charged that keeping orcas in captivity is harmful to the animals and risky for the trainers who work with them, a case that gained urgency in 2010 when Dawn Brancheau, a veteran orca trainer, was dragged into the water and killed by a whale at the SeaWorld Park in Orlando, Fla. John Hargrove, who spent 14 years as an orca trainer, mostly at SeaWorld, says there was no doubt that the whale was aggressive.
