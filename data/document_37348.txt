1 Installing a standard boiler (80%-85% annual fuel utilization efficiency) typically costs about $2,500-$5,000 for a gas-fired model and $3,000-$6,500 for an oil-fired unit (generally used in areas without municipal gas lines). Counting the $80 per hour plumber fee to the specially trained Laars boiler person $1200 to install this UNIT, plus the repair labor cost what a piece of engineering work this boiler was. Good riddance.
1 You may need a new chimney liner if you’re upgrading to higher efficiency boiler. 2  Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 3  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
1 Replacing an old oil-fired boiler with a gas model can cost thousands of dollars more than replacing one oil-fired unit with another, because of the need to install new gas lines and to update the existing fittings, valves, piping system and other parts to work with the new boiler. Counting the $80 per hour plumber fee to the specially trained Laars boiler person $1200 to install this UNIT, plus the repair labor cost what a piece of engineering work this boiler was. Good riddance.
The cost for replacing a standard gas boiler is about $4,000. A high-efficiency model costs about $7,500. This cost estimate usually includes removal and disposal of the old unit, as well as all necessary lines, ducts and wiring needed for the new system to run properly. If you have a boiler installed or replaced, you might pay anywhere between $3,111 and $7,204. On average, homeowners tend to pay $5,100. These prices are highly dependent on the type of boiler you choose.
However, there are other factors that could swing boiler installation costs higher or lower. 1  You may need a new chimney liner if you’re upgrading to higher efficiency boiler. 2  Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 3  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
BOILER INSTALLATION COSTS. If you’re replacing an old boiler, expect boiler installation costs for mid-efficiency system to cost about $2,500 to $4,000 (80 percent efficiency), and boiler installation costs for a high-efficiency system to cost between $5,000 to $9,000 (90 to 97 percent efficiency). 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
Depending on your home, the boiler can pay for itself in savings in the first few years. A condensing boiler will cost even more, often in excess of $5,000, but is also efficient in excess of 90% and more effectively provides heat to larger areas. If you plan to install a boiler in your home, it is important to factor in the costs of labor as well. A licensed plumber must be used for this job and will generally take a day's worth of work. Expect to pay in the area of a few hundred dollars for the easiest job and above a thousand for more complex jobs. For the boiler itself, expect to pay a significant amount of money — costs start near $2,000. The increase in cost is proportionate to the space they are being used to heat. For a boiler of maximum efficiency, you may pay over $4,000; however, it should be looked at as a short-term cost for a long-term investment.
Boilers are more expensive than furnaces. Mid-efficiency boilers cost anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000, while high-efficiency boilers run $5,000 to $10,000. Those prices include installation, but keep in mind that installing a boiler is more expensive than installing a furnace because the process is more complex. Removal and haul away of the old furnace usually costs $300 to $1,000, depending on size and difficulty. As with boilers, a new chimney liner for a high efficiency unit will cost anywhere from $500 to $1,500, with liners for gas units priced on the lower end of that range and liners for oil units on the higher end.
