Probiotic-rich foods are common, but prebiotic foods are just as important. Add these top prebiotic foods to your list and don’t forget to pair them with probiotic foods for the best results. Your healthy gut awaits! 
Prebiotics vs. Probiotics. While probiotic-foods have live bacteria, prebiotic foods feed the good bacteria already living in your gut. You can find prebiotics in items such as asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, bananas, oatmeal, red wine, honey, maple syrup, and legumes.
Asparagus is a common food rich in prebiotics. Prebiotics are nondigestible or partially digestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria in the colon and thus promote better overall health.
Yogurt is one of the most familiar sources of probiotics -- good bacteria that keep a healthy balance in your gut. Studies suggest that probiotics can help ease lactose intolerance. They also may help tame gas, diarrhea, and other digestive problems.
Or think of it as gram/100 grams. So if bananas have 1% prebiotics by weight and you eat 100 grams of banana, you get 1 gram of prebiotics. We can also use these to get real-world examples of how much food you must eat to get your daily
Many foods contain probiotics (the good bacteria that help your body maintain health) and prebiotics (fiber that good bacteria eat but that isn’t digestible by humans). However, it’s difficult to get enough probiotics strictly through food.
You don't necessarily need probiotics — a type of good bacteria — to be healthy. However, these microorganisms may help with digestion and offer protection from harmful bacteria, just as the existing good bacteria in your body already do. Prebiotics are nondigestible carbohydrates that act as food for probiotics.
Both bananas and berries provide you with prebiotics. These fruits are good sources of fiber and also contain other essential nutrients, such as the high amounts of potassium in bananas and vitamin C in berries.
