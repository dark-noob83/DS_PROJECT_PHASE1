Egypt On December 13, a cold snap led to snow in Cairo, Alexandria and Madinaty in Egypt for the first time in 112 years. Figure 13. 
1 This indicates that the continentality type is hyperoceanic, subtype barely hyperoceanic. 2  Total annual Precipitation averages 370 mm (14.6 inches) which is equivalent to 370 Litres/m (9.08 Gallons/ft). 3  On average there are 3605 hours of sunshine per year. Windhoek Climate & Temperature. 1  Windhoek, Namibia is at 22 34'S, 17 6'E, 1728 m (5669 ft). 2  See map. 3  Windhoek has a subtropical steppe/ low-latitude semi-arid hot climate (K ppen-Geiger classification: BSh).
Except for the temperature, the climate of Namibia's parks is similar to Windhoek. Windhoek is located on the semi-arid central plateau at 1700m/5577ft and most parks are located around 1000m/3280ft and lower. Temperatures increase by about 6°C for every 1000m you descend (or 3.5°F per 1000ft). As a result Namibia's parks are hotter, especially those located in the desert. Rainfall is higher in the far north, including Etosha and the Caprivi Strip. Further south the climate is hotter and drier

Namibia – one of the sunniest countries in the world. 300 days of sunshine, blue sky and warm weather makes Namibia a unique travel destination. With an average of 300 days of sunshine annually Namibia is one of the sunniest countries in worldwide. The climate is generally arid which means that the potential evaporation is higher than the precipitation, which again results in a very low humidity. Central highlands around Windhoek. Between the Kalahari in the east and the Namib Desert in the west lies the Namibian central highland with the capital Windhoek in its centre. Due to its altitude of 1700 metres on average (at Windhoek even up to 2000m) this highland has moderate temperatures and average rainfalls.
Since 2010, rainfall has been above average in many parts of sub-Saharan African—including Angola, Namibia, Tanzania, Cameroon, Congo, and Madagascar—according to the Climate Prediction Center of the U.S. National Weather Service.
