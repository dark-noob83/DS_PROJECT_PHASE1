Confidence votes 26. well lets see. on a 400m track every lane out is an extra 40m. 4 laps on a 400m track is a mile. so 6m times 40m is 240m. so one lap around a 400m track in lane 7 would be 640m. a mile is 1609m. 640m goes into 1609 meters 2.5640625 times. 2 and a half laps is a mile in lane 7. 
Step 1. ENTER THE TRACK SIZE (i.e., the distance covered when completing one lap-normally in Lane 1) and select the unit of measure. most outdoor tracks are either 400 meters or 440 yards (4 laps to a mile) most indoor tracks are either 200 meters or 220 yards (8 laps to a mile) See NOTE 3 for determining track size. 
But not all lanes are created equal, so knowing how to calculate the distance around a track by lane is helpful. For example, if you run in the outside lane of a standard 400-meter track, you add over 53 meters to the distance of each lap, or about 13 percent. Step 1. Find out the length of the running track. Most outdoor tracks are 400 meters around the innermost lane. However, some tracks are different lengths. Indoor tracks may be one-tenth of a mile or even less. If you aren't sure, ask the facility staff for information about the length of the track.
Since the IAAF has standardized track lane widths at 1.22 meters the above formula calculates the distance around the track in lane 2 as 407.67 meters, lane 3 as 415.33 meters, lane 4 as 423 meters, lane 5 as 430.66 meters, lane 6 as 433.38 meters, lane 7 as 446 meters and lane 8 as 453.66 meters. The Distances Around Each Lane. Since the distance around the track in lane one, the inside lane, is 400 meters the distance around the track for the other lanes can be calculated by knowing the lane width and a few other measurements. The formula, L = 2S + 2pi(R + (n-1)w) can be used to calculate the distances around the track for the various lane
Significance. Since it is common practice that amateur runners are allowed to run in lanes four through eight it can be seen that they are running a greater distance than 400 meters per lap. Four times around the track in lane four is almost 1700 meters, 100 meters more than the distance in lane one. The Distances Around Each Lane. Since the distance around the track in lane one, the inside lane, is 400 meters the distance around the track for the other lanes can be calculated by knowing the lane width and a few other measurements. The formula, L = 2S + 2pi(R + (n-1)w) can be used to calculate the distances around the track for the various lanes
If the track is 400 meters in the first lane then you travel and additional 7 meters per lane, per lap. If the track is marked you will see the starting stagger for the 400 meter race in each lane. If you are in lane 7 then 3 1/2 laps will equal 1 mile. Add 7 meters for lane 8 per lap. So if you are keeping track of your miles you can get a close guess to your distance. Most tracks now are 400 meters, not 1/4 of a mile. The difference is the 400 meter track is about 2 1/2 yards shorter than the 440 yard track. 
Most tracks are 400 meters around, as measured in Lane 1; that’s just a bit less than one-quarter of a mile. Here are some other measurements that it’s helpful to know: 1  100 meters: the length of one straightaway. 2  800 meters: roughly ½ mile or 2 laps around the track. 3  1600 meters: roughly 1 mile or 4 laps around the track. 
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Yea one mile on the track is 4 laps. So you'll have to run 12 times around the track to get 3 miles in. I wouldn't if i were you, its going to be really boring. Either run on a trail or bring in mp3 player with you so you don't get discouraged of all the boredom around you. 
Confidence votes 449. 4 laps around a regular track=1 mile. Since the standard for tracks built in the last 20+ years is 400M, then you must go 9.344 meters further than 4 laps. Over 90% of the outdoor tracks in existence are only 400M and will thus require the extra 9.344 meters to equal a true mile. If you are using a standard 400M track, and running exclusiv … ely in lane 1, then you will need to complete 105.4875 laps in order to complete a marathon or essentially 105 and 1/2 laps. If you use an outer lane, then you will not need to run as many laps.
