(this multiple choice question has been scrambled). The fiber type that gives connective tissue great tensile strength is ________. A) collagen. B) reticular. C) muscle. D) elastic. A) collagen. (this multiple choice question has been scrambled). Organized groups of cells (plus their intercellular substances) that have a common purpose form a(n) ________.
They function to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells and store minerals. Bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue. Because bones come in a variety of shapes and have a complex internal and external structure they are lightweight... vertebrates.

The human body is composed of just four basic kinds of tissue: nervous, muscular, epithelial, and connective tissue. Connective tissue is the most abundant, widely distributed, and varied type. It includes fibrous tissues, fat, cartilage, bone, bone marrow, and blood. The hard consistency of bone results mainly from calcium phosphate salts in the ground substance. Some of the cells of connective tissue are fibroblasts (which produce collagen fibers and are the only cell type in tendons and ligaments); adipocytes (fat cells); leukocytes (white blood cells, also found outside the.
A) connective B) epithelial C) muscle D) connective and muscle Ans: B 2. Epithelial tissue A) prevents drying. B) secretes mucus. C) absorbs molecules. D) accomplishes all of these. Ans: D 3. Glands secreting products into ducts are called A) exocrine. B) endocrine. C) hormonal. D) endocrine and hormonal. Ans: A 4. 
D) The type of tissue injured is not an important factor. B) The age of the person is a factor in the repair process. (this multiple choice question has been scrambled). In adults, new surface epithelial cells and the epithelial cells lining the intestine are derived from _________. The fiber type that gives connective tissue great tensile strength is ________. A) collagen. B) reticular. C) muscle. D) elastic. A) collagen. (this multiple choice question has been scrambled). Organized groups of cells (plus their intercellular substances) that have a common purpose form a(n) ________.
Can be loaded with calcium salts. Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. 1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense). 2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage). Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper; chondoroblasts form cartilage; asdasdasdasdasdasdads osteoblasts form bone; and blood is formed from various sources.
