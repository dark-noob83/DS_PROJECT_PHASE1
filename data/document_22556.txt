To receive a Private Pilot license, the FAA requires student pilots have a minimum of 40 hours of flight time, of which 20 must be dual (flying with an instructor). However, these are MINIMUMS. No one I know completed their training in 40 hours. I took 66 hours.
How old do I need to be to get a pilot’s license? You can begin flight training at any age; however, to fly solo in the aircraft you need to be at least 16 years old. To be eligible for a private pilot certificate, you must be at least 17 years old. There is no upper age limit to beginning your flight training.
• You must be 16 years old to obtain your student pilot license and to solo. • You must to be 17 years old to obtain your private pilot license. •Your total flying time must be at least 40 hours. • Of the 40 hours at least 10 hours must be solo flight time. • Of the 10 hours solo at least 5 hours must be cross-country (flying from one airport to another at least 50 nautical miles away).
Best Answer: You can have a private pilot's license at age 17. You can do your solo flights, at age 16... the minimum for a student pilot certificate. You could fly with an instructor and accumulate hours even before the age of 16. The rules are Federal, so it doesn't matter where you live in the US.
dancing on fire is wrong. To get a license VFR in a piston plane as a private pilot is 17. You have to have at LEAST 20 of instruction with an instructor. You have to at LEAST 20 of solo flight plus ground training and 3 hours of night flight.
