Overview. The ventricles of the brain are a communicating network of cavities filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and located within the brain parenchyma. The ventricular system is composed of 2 lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct, and the fourth ventricle (see the following images).
The third and fourth ventricles are located in the center of the brain. The lateral ventricles communicate with the third ventricle through an opening called the interventricular foramen. Both lateral ventricles are filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
Fourth ventricle. Inside the brain, there are four cavities, called ventricles. The right and left lateral ventricles and the third and fourth ventricles compose the ventricular system. The fourth ventricle contains cerebrospinal fluid. It has a diamond shape and is located in the upper portion of the medulla.
The largest cavities of the ventricular system are the lateral ventricles. Each lateral ventricle is divided into a central portion, formed by the body and atrium (or trigone), and 3 lateral extensions or horns of the ventricles. The central portion or the body of the ventricle is located within the parietal lobe.
The lateral ventricles (one and two) are located in the cerebrum, the third ventricle separates the right and left diencephalic structures, while the fourth ventricle is associated with the pons and medulla.
Brain ventricle: One of the communicating cavities within the brain. There are four ventricles: two lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ventricle. The lateral ventricles are in the cerebral hemispheres. Each lateral ventricle consists of a triangular central body and four horns.
