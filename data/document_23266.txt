Nationwide, a gallon of gas is still more than $1 cheaper than it was a year ago, and that, plus cheaper financing, drove ownership costs for the average sedan down to $8,698. That's $178, or about 2%, less than it was a year ago, AAA says.
1 Keeping a car for eight years, rather than five, can reduce median ownership costs significantly to just $7,800 a year on average. 2  This is partially due to lower depreciation costs, and partly a result of keeping the car for a few years after the loan has been paid off.
AAA has released its 62nd annual Your Driving Costs study, which shows a 1.9-percent year-over-year increase in the cost of auto ownership. That's an average of $8,946 per year per car, with costs including monthly payment, fuel, maintenance and insurance.
A new AAA reports shows, on average, the cost of driving 15,000 miles a year rose 1.17 cents to 60.8 cents per mile, or $9,122 per year. Overall, that's a roughly 2% increase on the cost of operating a car last year.
As well, two-thirds of Canadians think their annual grocery bill is bigger than their car ownership costs, which is not true. Yearly ownership costs for an average compact car are about $9,500, while the average Canadian spends $5,400 on groceries a year (figure provided by Statistics Canada).
Today, the average 48-month new car loan comes at a rate of 4.33 percent, while a 36-month used car loan clocks in around 5.2 percent. The average annual finance charge for an auto loan in the U.S. is now $669, or $178 below last year. 3. Maintenance costs are either flat or declining.
