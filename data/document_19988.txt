How quickly you recover depends on how serious your shoulder injury is. Separated shoulders may heal over a period of 6 weeks. Dislocated shoulders may take longer -- more like 3 to 12 weeks. But these lengths of time are just approximations. Everyone heals at a different rate.
1 Ice your shoulder to reduce pain and swelling. 2  Do it for 20-30 minutes every three to four hours, for 2 to 3 days or longer. 3  Use a sling or shoulder immobilizer to prevent further injury until you get medical treatment. 4  Then follow the doctor's advice about whether or not to use a sling.
A diagnosis of frozen shoulder can be distressing, especially given the length of time it may take for resolution of the pain and stiffness. Whether treated or not, the majority of frozen shoulders improve on their own over the course of 6 to 12 months, but sometimes it can be up to 18 months.
The same treatment would also be used for a separated shoulder. To treat either injury, you should: 1  Ice your shoulder to reduce pain and swelling. 2  Do it for 20-30 minutes every three to four hours, for 2 to 3 days or longer.

Total recovery from rotator cuff surgery can take up to about six months, but it will take about 12 months for you to feel completely happy with your outcome. While pain relief during recovery is predictable, function and range are not always as predictable.
Most shoulder fractures heal in about six weeks. About 20 percent of shoulder fractures are displaced and may require some type of manipulation to restore normal anatomy. Occasionally the rotator cuff muscles are injured or torn at the same time as the fracture.
