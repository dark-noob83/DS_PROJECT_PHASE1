Best Answer: Each phone on your FamilyTalk account has its own contract. Customers who cancel their service with AT&T before the end of the contract term will pay an Early Termination Fee (ETF) of $175 for each wireless telephone number associated with the service. Report Abuse. it will be $175 early termination fee to cancel service. if you have a friend or family member that may want to take over the line of serivce you can do a Transfer of Service.

If you want to end your contract at AT&T, you’ll be forking over $325 minus $10 per month that you’ve completed on your contract. Pretty much all the major carriers subtract a given amount for each month you’ve completed on your contract, but that number tends to change. Sprint and Verizon will charge you up to $350, unless you cancel within the first two weeks (a policy that was extended to 30 days beginning June 27 for Sprint users).

If you’re searching for a way out of your two-year cellphone contract without paying hundreds of dollars in fees, the contract itself is not a great place to look. It’s long, it’s complicated and the few loopholes it mentions aren’t useful to most people. The idea that the ETF covers the cost of the phone is kind of a joke. I signed in July with Verizon and the retail value of my phone was $550. I'd be lucky to get $100 for it on Ebay 6 months later (Verizon still sells it new). I'll be happy when my contract is up and can go back to T-Mobile.
T-Mobile's highest is $200 and AT&T's is $325. The ETFs are much lower for feature phones. All of the carriers prorate their fee based on the amount of time actually left in a one-or two-year contract; it goes down by $5 or $10 a month for each month of completed service commitment (as AT&T puts it). This doesn't technically get you out of your contract, but by using a familial phone upgrade before you've finished your own two years, you can skip the ETF and go right to a new phone—as long as you are willing to pay the subsidized price of the device and sign on for another two years.
For example, AT&T’s early termination fee for a smartphone starts at $325 and goes down by $10 every month. If you want to avoid that cost, here are some ways out: Transfer your contract. One of the easier ways to walk away from a contract is to find someone else to take on the commitment. The idea that the ETF covers the cost of the phone is kind of a joke.
