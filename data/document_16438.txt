Loren’s multiplication abilities were within the Average Rage, and ranked at the 19 th percentile with a standard score of 87 (Math Fluency—Multiplication). Discussion of Results: Loren’s overall performance as measured by the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Third Edition (WIAT-III) was within the Average Range.
One of the most common tests used is the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test: Third Edition (WIAT-III). Subject abilities are depicted using standard scores and percentile ranks. Average scores are those that range from 85 to 115. Scores above and below the typical range show academic strengths and weaknesses.
Most tests use a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. In this case, average performance typically falls between standard scores of 90 and 110. The farther away from that range, the more different a student s score is from the middle performance. Another statistically derived score is Percentile Ranks.
Version 1.0.0 of the WIAT-III Scoring Assistant was released to accommodate ages 4:00 - 19:11 years of age. WIAT-III Adult Norms is available now, with an expanded age range of 20:00 - 50:11. This is a free update for users whom already own the kit and are using the WIAT-III Scoring Assistant.
Last updated: 17 Sep, 2010. The primary reason that the range for average was changed for WIAT-III was to align with other tests of achievement. These kinds of tests typically use one SD from the mean as the definition of average which incorporates around 68% of the normal curve. Ability tests, on the other hand, typically use the standard score range of 90-110 which incorporates around 50% of the normal curve. Neither is incorrect, and use is a matter of convention. Practitioners are free to use whichever definition of average they find most useful.
