Having a midwife is an EXCELLENT idea! Read this book: Gentle Birthing Techniques. So midwives cost $2000-$3000 dollars. Doulas cost $400-$1000, unless you can find one who is just finishing her certification...in that case she might do it for free. I think midwives have a reasonable cost. If you went to the hospital and had all sorts of drungs and interventions and a c-section, you'd probably end up paying way more than $3000. Many midwives also have payment plans so you can pay as you go. The avg range here in Houston is $3000. Doula's cost around $600. I would definately go the home birth route if you are wanting a birth that is natural.
