Serotonin, a small-molecule neurotransmitter found in many areas throughout the brain, is involved in a wide range of behaviors, including sleep, appetite, memory, sexual behavior, neuroendocrine function, and mood. Not all neurotransmitters are recycled by the presynaptic cell. These transporter proteins carry the neurotransmitter back into the pre-synaptic cell, where it is either re-packaged into a vesicle and stored until it is once again needed to transmit a chemical message, or broken down by enzymes.
Dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine are a group of neurotransmitters called catecholamines. Norepinephrine is also called noradrenalin and epinephrine is also called adrenalin. Each of these neurotransmitters is produced in a step-by-step fashion by a different enzyme. 2. Enzymatic degradation (deactivation): a specific enzyme changes the structure of the neurotransmitter so it is not recognized by the receptor. For example, acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that breaks acetylcholine into choline and acetate.
B. After a neurotransmitter molecule has been recognized by a post-synaptic receptor, it is released back into the synaptic cleft. Once in the synapse, it must be quickly removed or chemically inactivated in order to prevent constant stimulation of the post-synaptic cell and an excessive firing of action potentials. Some neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by special transporter proteins on the pre-synaptic membrane. These transporter proteins carry the neurotransmitter back into the pre-synaptic cell, where it is either re-packaged into a vesicle and stored until it is once again needed to transmit a chemical message, or broken down by enzymes.
After a chemical is released, it must be inactivated. Inactivation can be through a reuptake mechanism or by an enzyme that stops the action of the chemical. If the chemical is applied on the post-synaptic membrane, it should have the same effect as when it is released by a neuron. 2. Enzymatic degradation (deactivation): a specific enzyme changes the structure of the neurotransmitter so it is not recognized by the receptor. For example, acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that breaks acetylcholine into choline and acetate.
A B After a neurotransmitter molecule has been recognized by a post-synaptic receptor, it is released back into the synaptic cleft. Once in the synapse, it must be quickly removed or chemically inactivated in order to prevent constant stimulation of the post-synaptic cell and an excessive firing of action potentials. Some neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by special transporter proteins on the pre-synaptic membrane. Neuropeptide neurotransmitters merely quickly diffuse away from the receptors into the surrounding medium. One important neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, has a specialized enzyme for inactivation right in the synaptic cleft called acetylcholinesterase (AChE.

4. Reuptake: the whole neurotransmitter molecule is taken back into the axon terminal that released it. This is a common way the action of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin is stopped...these neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft so they cannot bind to receptors. 2. Enzymatic degradation (deactivation): a specific enzyme changes the structure of the neurotransmitter so it is not recognized by the receptor. For example, acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that breaks acetylcholine into choline and acetate.
Neurotransmitter inactivation. After the neurotransmitter molecule has been acknowledged by a post-synaptic receptor, and it is released back into the synaptic cleft. The Serotonin is one neurotransmitter which gets recycled in this way. The Serotonin, a small-molecule neurotransmitter found in many regions throughout the brain, is included in a wide variety of behaviors, neuroendocrine function, involving appetite, sleep, memory, sexual behavior, and mood.
Communication of information between neurons is accomplished by movement of chemicals across a small gap called the synapse. Chemicals, called neurotransmitters, are released from one neuron at the presynaptic nerve terminal. 2. Enzymatic degradation (deactivation): a specific enzyme changes the structure of the neurotransmitter so it is not recognized by the receptor. For example, acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that breaks acetylcholine into choline and acetate.
