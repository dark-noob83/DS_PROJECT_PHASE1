The cost of sales attributed to a company's products or services are expensed as the company sells these goods. As the cost of sales does not include overhead costs, it has a higher proportion of variable cost than the operating costs. Some fixed costs, such as labor costs, might be included in the cost of sales.
(Average fixed cost + Average variable cost) x Number of units = Total cost. For example, a company is incurring $10,000 of fixed costs to produce 1,000 units (for an average fixed cost per unit of $10), and its variable cost per unit is $3. At the 1,000-unit production level, the total cost of the production is:
4. Calculate the average variable cost (AVC) by dividing the total variable costs by the number of units produced. For example, if the total variable cost is $400 when 200 units are produced, then the AVC would be $2.
Variable costs can include direct material costs or direct labor costs necessary to complete a certain project. For example, a company may have variable costs associated with the packaging of one of its products. As the company moves more of this product, the costs for packaging will increase.
This last point can be made clear with a very simple illustration. Assume that a company produces 10,000 units of a product, and per unit costs are $2 for direct material, $3 for direct labor, and $4 for variable factory overhead. In addition, fixed factory overhead amounts to $10,000.
A periodic cost that varies in step with the output or the sales revenue of a company. Variable costs include raw material, energy usage, labor, distribution costs, etc. Companies with high variable costs are significantly different from those with high fixed costs. This difference affects the financial structure of the company as well as its pricing and profits.
