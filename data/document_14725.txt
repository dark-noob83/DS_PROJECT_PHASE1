The total value of world income is closing in on $70 trillion (£43.9tn) per year, and there are seven billion people in the world, so the average income is heading towards $10,000 (£6,273) per person per year. Easy. But not everyone has a job and some of those seven billion are children.
Let's put the world's average salary-in PPP dollars-of $1,480 a month, or almost $18,000 a year, in context: 1  It is less than half the average salary of the UK and the United States, where average monthly earnings are just over $3,000 a month, or around $37,000 a year.
That gives you the answer-the world's average salary is $1,480 (£928) a month, which is just less than $18,000 (£11,291) a year. But these dollars are not normal US dollars. The economists use specially adjusted exchange rates-the average salary is calculated in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) dollars.

The average salary in China has more influence on the world average than the average salary in New Zealand, where many fewer people live. Once they have the total wage bill for each country, they add them all together and divide by the total number of earners in the world. That gives you the answer-the world's average salary is $1,480 (£928) a month, which is just less than $18,000 (£11,291) a year.
A study by MailSport found that (spoiler alert) it pays to be in the Premier League.
