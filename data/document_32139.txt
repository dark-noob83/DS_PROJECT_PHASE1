While other religions from Arabic countries also use the expression, it is more closely tied to Islam because of the use of Allah, the term for God used by Muslims. The term insha’Allah is used when speaking about something that is being planned, or will occur in the future. This is based on the belief that everything that happens is dependent on God’s will.
Clarification of the meaning of insha' Allah (انشاء الله): When in is written jointly with sha', it becomes insha' which is a root word in the category of actions and its meaning is 'to create', 'to invent'. Its past and present continuous tense forms are insha' (انشأ and yunshi' ینشیٔ) respectively.
It's about time someone set the record straight. Inshallah is a good phrase and sadly many people use it negatively. When you say Inshallah, it means you will do your absolute best and unless there is some form of divine intervention that stops you. God wants you to do your best, not use the phrase as an excuse!
Definition: God willing -- this phrase is used when discussing events which are planned for the future, in recognition that they will only happen by God's will. Pronunciation: in-shah-Allah. Also Known As: God-willing.
Definition: Inshallah is an Arabic expression that means God willing, or if God wills it.. It is a conjunction of the Arabic word for God (Allah) and the Arabic words for his will. Inshallah is one of the most common expressions, or verbal appendages, in the Arab world and beyond it: Persian, Turkish and Urdu speakers, among others, use the expression liberally.
