Varicoceles are a relatively common condition (affecting approximately 10 percent of men) that tends to occur in young men, usually during the second or third decade of life. Sometimes, these varicoceles cause no symptoms and are harmless.
The scrotum is the sac covered with skin that holds the testicles, and it also contains the arteries and veins that deliver blood to these reproductive glands. An abnormality of the veins servicing the testicles may result in a varicocele. A varicocele can result in a decrease sperm production and quality.
Introduction. Varicoceles are abnormally dilated testicular veins (pampiniform plexus) of in the scrotum, which is normally secondary to internal spermatic vein reflux. Varicocele is found in approximately 15% of the general population, 35% of men with primary infertility and in 75-81% of men with secondary infertility.
A varicocele is like varicose veins of the small veins (blood vessels) next to one testicle (testis) or both testicles (testes). It usually causes no symptoms. It may cause discomfort in a small number of cases.
A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is an enlargement of the veins within the loose bag of skin that holds your testicles (scrotum). A varicocele is similar to a varicose vein that can occur in your leg. Varicoceles are a common cause of low sperm production and decreased sperm quality, which can cause infertility.
Varicoceles are enlarged varicose veins that occur in the scrotum. They are fairly common, affecting 15 out of 100 men overall and 40 out of 100 men with known infertility. Varicoceles occur most often in the left testicle. Varicocele repair is done to improve male fertility.
Varicocele occurs when the network of veins that leave the testis (pampiniform plexus) become elongated and enlarged. The valves within the pampiniform plexus when they work properly only allow the blood to flow away from the testicle-if there is something wrong with them, blood builds up.
