Complications. The most common complication of sigmoid diverticulosis is diverticulitis, which occurs when the diverticula become infected and inflamed. This causes a fever, intense pain in the lower left abdomen, a fever, nausea, and increased urination if the infection is near the bladder.
Diverticula are most common in the lower portion of the large intestine, called the sigmoid colon. When the pouches become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis. Ten to 25 percent of people with diverticulosis get diverticulitis. Diverticulosis and diverticulitis together are called diverticular disease..
Diverticulosis is a condition that develops when pouches (diverticula) form in the wall of the colon (large intestine). These pouches are usually very small (5 to 10 millimeters) in diameter but can be larger. In diverticulosis, the pouches in the colon wall do not cause symptoms.
Diverticula can form while straining during a bowel movement, such as with constipation. They are most common in the lower portion of the large intestine (called the sigmoid colon). Diverticulosis is very common and occurs in 10% of people over age 40 and in 50% of people over age 60.
Sigmoid diverticulosis is a condition in which small pouches called diverticula form on the wall of the sigmoid colon, which is the part of the large intestine that connects to the rectum. It's typically associated with certain risk factors, including age and a poor diet.
