song. In the town where I was born, Lived a man who sailed the sea. And he told us of his life, In the land of submarines. So we sailed on to the sun, Till we found the sea of green, And we lived beneath the waves, In our yellow submarine. We all live in a yellow submarine, Yellow submarine, yellow submarine, We all live in a yellow submarine, Yellow submarine, yellow submarine, And our friends are all aboard, Many more of them live next door, And the band begins to play. We all live in a yellow submarine, Yellow submarine, yellow submarine, We all live in a yellow submarine, Yellow submarine, yellow submarine, As we live a life of ease, Ev'ryone of us has all we need, Sky of blue and sea of green, In our yellow submarine.
(The rest of the album was filled out with Yellow Submarine, All You Need Is Love, and a George Martin score.) What's more, two of the four new tracks were little more than pleasant throwaways that had been recorded during 1967 and early 1968. The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four-song EP (an idea the Beatles even considered at one point, with the addition of a bonus track in Across the Universe but ultimately discarded).
