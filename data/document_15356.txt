Duck and especially goose fat have been used for frying the world's tastiest potatoes for hundreds of years. Indeed in the depths of France, where people are not wholly terrified of animal fats, some people still do it.
I vaguely remember as a kid being covered in goose grease and wrapped in a pair of brown paper 'pyjamas'. Lord only knows what I was suffering from (don't remeber any camphorated oil in it). We also used to put soap and sugar on plasters to cure infected cuts and scrapes and butter dipped in sugar for a sore throat.
When people say that something cooked with goose fat was greasy, it's because too much was used, and it tends to stay more on the surface of food items than be soaked in the way oil is. Goose fat can be used as a spread on bread. Many people swear by goose fat for making roast potatoes with. To render blonde goose fat: Remove loose fat from the raw goose. Put the fat in a small pot with an equal amount of water, and render over low heat.
In France, goose fat is sold in tins or jars (jars are more flexible for daily use as they can be re-sealed.) In some parts of France, everyday cooking is still based on goose fat in the way that other parts of Europe rely on butter or oil.
1 Duck and goose confit: the French way of preserving food in fat, so goose fat is perfect for this. 2  See recipe for Duck confit. 3  Use goose fat for duck, goose or pork rillettes, which is a homemade coarse pate, made from confit.
I don't know what the goose grease did, but it added a bit of the smell of good food, and that was comforting. When Vicks Vaporub came out, it acted a lot like goose grease and camphor oil, but it was a lot easier to use. Some people used a mustard plaster, instead of goose grease, or maybe a poultice. Those two remedies were before my time. I'm not even sure what a poultice is. If a cold would hang on or if more than one person in a family had one, there were two surefire treatments for it.
