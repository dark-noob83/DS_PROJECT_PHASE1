Scoria is a red, brown or black extrusive igneous rock that has a vesicular texture, which means that it has holes throughout the rock. This rock is often called lava rock and is popular as a landscape mulch. An information card with details on the rocks formation, mineral content, characteristics and uses is included. 
Rhyolite is a rock type that is categorized by mineral composition. Scoria is a textural rock type. Like, Rhyolite can be smooth, or it can be scoria (sharper, bumpier, lots o … f vesicles). Think of it as a rock adjective. Pyroclastic rocks form from lava that is ejected from the volcano. Scoria (which is also known as cinder) is the primary component of cinder cones. A cinder cone is a small but very common volcano type. Cinder cones have also been called scoria cones.
Scoria is a textural rock type and not a rock that is classified by mineralogy or chemistry. It forms from lava that is rich in volatiles or gases but is less viscous than a pumice forming lava. When the molten rock is rising in the volcanic pipe, gases begin to form and collect and those gases form large bubbles in the lava. The resulting solidified rock is scoria. Pyroclastic rocks form from lava that is ejected from the volcano. Scoria (which is also known as cinder) is the primary component of cinder cones. A cinder cone is a small but very common volcano type. Cinder cones have also been called scoria cones.
Some scoria forms from lavas that flow out of a volcano and some scoria can be pyroclastic. Pyroclastic rocks form from lava that is ejected from the volcano. Scoria (which is also known as cinder) is the primary component of cinder cones. A cinder cone is a small but very common volcano type. Cinder cones have also been called scoria cones.
Scoria. Scoria is a highly vesicular, dark colored volcanic rock that may or may not contain crystals (phenocrysts). It is typically dark in color (generally dark brown, black or purplish red), and basaltic or andesitic in composition. 
Beryl is the gem mineral of emerald, aquamarine, morganite, red beryl, heliodor and more. Scoria: A piece of scoria about 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter. A specimen with a rounded shape like this was most likely blown from a volcanic vent and would be appropriately called lapilli. This color difference is a result of their composition. Scoria forms from basaltic magmas while pumice forms from rhyolitic magmas-which usually contain a more gas. Pumice has a much higher concentration of trapped bubbles-so many that the walls between them are very thin.
Scoria Scoria is the vesicular ejecta of basaltic and andesitic magmas. Generally a dark brownish black or red, scoria is generally thought of as the mafic version of pumice, forming when magma rich in dissolved gases is vented. Scoria is composed of volcanic glass fragments, and has few mineral crystals. Its specific gravity ranges from 0.8 to 2.1, making it a relatively light form of rock-sometimes light enough to float (at less than 1.0 specific gravity).

Scoria is an extrusive igneous rock with a mafic color index and an abundance of adjacent vesicles that make the texture resemble that of a sponge. The texture of scoria is ve … sicular. This means that there are many  cavities in the surface that cause it to be pitted. Both Basalt and Scoria are made of mafic minerals, mainly Ca rich Plagioclase Feldspar, Pyroxene, and Olivine, and both have extrusive origins, meaning they formed above the Earth's surface.
