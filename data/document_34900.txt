1. Prepare a marinade the day before you plan to bake your chicken breasts or thighs. The marinating process adds flavor and moisture to baked chicken. 1  Place 2 tbsp. ( 2 26 ml) of balsamic or red wine vinegar in a resealable plastic bag. 3  Add 2 to 3 tsp. ( 4 1.4 to 2.1 g) of dried herbs.
Remove the chicken from the oven and rest the meat, covered, for 10 minutes. Cover the baking dish with foil and let the chicken rest. This will help it be more tender. Eat and enjoy! (Image credits: Faith Durand). Pin it. Open Slideshow. I am a huge, huge fan of boneless, skinless chicken thighs.
Place the chicken underneath a piece of plastic wrap. Use a small mallet (metal or wood) and gently pound the chicken thighs. Make sure that each of the thighs is of equal thickness, around 1/2 inch-3/4 inch. This will not only make your chicken more tender, but will allow you to cook the chicken evenly.
When the chicken is done in the brine, place the chicken in a plastic bag. Pour the marinade in with the chicken and close the bag. 1  Press down against the bag with your fingers to get the marinade up close and personal with the marinade. 2  Place the marinade bags into the fridge and let them sit for four hours.
Toss the chicken with the baking sauce. Spread the chicken in the baking dish. No need to grease the dish. Just lay the chicken inside. Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165Â°F. Boneless, skinless thighs cook quickly. Check after 20 minutes, and if they are not quite up to temperature, put back in the oven and continue cooking and checking the temperature in 5-minute increments.
