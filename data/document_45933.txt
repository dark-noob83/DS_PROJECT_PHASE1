One parietal bone is located on each side of the skull just behind the frontal bone. It is shaped like a curved plate and has four borders. Together, the parietal bones form the bulging sides and roof of the cranium. They are fused in the middle along the sagittal suture, and they meet the frontal bone along the coronal suture.

Occipital, bone forming the back and back part of the base of the cranium, the part of the skull that encloses the brain. It has a large oval opening, the foramen magnum, through which the medulla oblongata passes, linking the spinal cord and brain.
Enlarged parietal foramina is an inherited condition of impaired skull development. It is characterized by enlarged openings (foramina) in the two bones (parietal bones) that form the top and sides of the skull. This condition is due to problems with bone formation (ossification) within the parietal bones.
