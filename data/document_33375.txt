Cost of Concrete Leveling. In general, concrete leveling costs about half the price of concrete replacement. The cost of concrete leveling is broken down into two components: fixed costs and variable costs. This post is about the cost of concrete leveling for exterior jobs such as sidewalk repair and driveway repair. Running a business isn’t cheap. Production concrete leveling trucks can cost more than $100,000. Generally, the cost of concrete leveling is a few dollars a square foot. For very small jobs, the square footage price will be much higher than that, because the fixed costs are allocated to just a few square feet

The concrete leveling machine is cumbersome and bulky. Therefore, it is difficult to get it close to a confined area. It will cost $5 to $8 per square foot of concrete to level a typical job. It can cost as much as $15 per square foot if you need extra slurry and it takes extra labor to get the machine into position, or you need to resod a part of your lawn after the job is completed. Concrete leveling, or mudjacking, as it is sometimes called, is a very cost-efficient way to fix concrete problems. It is a fraction of the cost of breaking up, removing and replacing concrete. Therefore, it can offer an economical fix to a potentially large repair cost
