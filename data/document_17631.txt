Modern acrylic gesso is a combination of calcium carbonate (chalk) with an acrylic polymer medium (binder), a pigment (titanium white) and other chemicals that ensure flexibility, and ensure long archival life.
Gesso is an important art supply to get your canvas ready for painting. You can buy gesso readymade from any art supply shop. Gesso is very similar to white acrylic paint, only thinner. It dries hard, making the surface more stiff. Gesso prepares (or primes) the surface for painting, making the surface slightly textured and ready to accept acrylic paint. Without gesso, the paint would soak into the weave of the canvas.
The word gesso is a noun, but many artists also use it as a verb. For example: You need to gesso your canvas before you paint.. The beauty of gesso is that you can apply it to nearly any surface, and then you can paint on that surface with acrylic paint.
Gesso is the same as a primer, as in ‘pre-primed canvas’. It is made from a combination of paint pigment, chalk and binder. Traditional Oil ‘ glue gesso ’ was made with an animal glue binder, usually rabbit-skin glue, chalk, and white pigment, usually Titanium white.
Traditional gesso [edit].  Gesso , also known glue gesso or Italian gesso is a traditional mix of an animal glue binder (usually rabbit-skin glue), chalk, and white pigment, used to coat rigid surfaces such as wooden painting panels as an absorbent primer coat substrate for painting.
Gesso (jeh-so) is actually the Greek word for “ground chalk.” (gypsum). Acrylic gesso is a mixture of different materials (latex/calcium carbonate/pigment/etc) usually sold in a premixed form and is used to prime/prep surfaces for acrylic and oil painting. (However, please keep in mind that it is NOT a sealant.
