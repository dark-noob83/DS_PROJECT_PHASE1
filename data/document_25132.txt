Qualifying Relative. For qualifying relatives, there is a strict limit on how much income they could make during the year. A qualifying relative cannot make more than $3,700 of gross income during the year. If he makes more than $3,700, then he cannot be a dependent. 
Claiming an earner as a dependent can also affect that person's own tax filing. She can only claim her earned income plus $300 as a standard deduction on her return if this amounts to less than the standard deduction for that year, $5,950 as of 2012. Your dependent cannot claim anyone else as a dependent on her own return.
If you had $12,000 in income, for example, and $800 in eligible child care expenses, then, your credit would be 35 percent of $800, or $280. For taxpayers with incomes of more than $43,000, the percentage was 20 percent, with no upper income limit. So whether you had income of $44,000 or $440,000, your credit would be 20 percent. If you had $2,000 in care expenses, that translates to $400.

Dependent rules also apply to other benefits, such as tax credits. Many of these credits are available only if you have qualified dependents. For example, both the child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit rely on these rules. In addition, the rules help you determine if you can write off dependent daycare expenses, medical expenses, various itemized deductions and most tax credits that involve children or family issues.
Gross income is the total of your unearned and earned income. If your gross income was $3,950 or more, you usually cannot be claimed as a dependent unless you are a qualifying child. For details, see Exemptions for Dependents on page 11 of IRS Publication 501.
Gross Income Test. The gross income test is tied to the personal exemption amount. For 2013, the personal exemption amount is $3,900. A taxpayer cannot claim a dependent as a qualifying relative if that person's gross income is $3,900 or more (for 2013). Gross income is all income in the form of money, property, and services that is not exempt from tax (from Publication 501). 
The maximum credit you can qualify for is $6,044 with three or more qualifying children, $5,372 with two qualifying children, $3,250 with one qualifying child and $487 with no qualifying children depending on your income. The credit is phased out the closer your income gets to the maximum income limits. It’s also possible to claim the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which allows you a credit of up to $2,100 for qualified dependent care cost for two or more children. And, if you adopted, there is a generous tax credit for those expenses as well.
• This is a tax credit, rather than a tax deduction. A deduction simply reduces the amount of income that you must pay tax on. A $1,000 deduction, for example, might reduce your tax bill by only $150 or $200. A tax credit, however, directly reduces your taxes, dollar for dollar.. A $1,000 tax credit cuts your tax bill by $1,000. • You can claim the credit regardless of your income. A lot of tax breaks have income limits and are not available at all to people with incomes above those limits. The child and dependent care credit does get smaller at higher incomes, but it doesn't disappear.
