Choose a location with full sunlight for growing peppers, as jalapenos LOVE the sun. Mix in some mushroom compost or other organic compost to make the soil fertile and moist. Space the jalapeno pepper plants 14 - 16 inches apart with about 2 -3 feet between rows. The plants will eventually grow to nearly 3 feet high.
If your preference runs to long, fiery peppers, grow Long Red Slim Cayenne (72 days) or Inferno (65 days). Hot peppers can be direct-seeded into the garden or transplanted as seedlings at least two weeks after the last frost date, when air temperatures are at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
Varieties. Most hot pepper cultivars require long growing seasons. Red chili peppers require 85 days to reach maturity, while jalapenos need 70 days and cayenne peppers require between 70 and 73 days from the time of planting to the date of ripeness. Hot peppers are warm-season plants that won't grow in cold soil.
How to Grow Jalapeno Peppers. Peppers, including jalapenos, do best in loamy, well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter. Full sun and warm temperatures are also important when growing jalapeno peppers.
Peppers are very slow to germinate, much slower than other plants like tomatoes or cucumbers. But, if they aren't sprouting within 2 weeks, then you should replant them. Buy new seeds and replant them in the house in cel paks or peat pellets, not directly outside in the ground.
6. Place your plants 12–16 inches (30.5–40.6 cm) apart with at least 2 foot (0.6 m) in between rows. 7. Never forget, water is as important to a pepper as sun, water once a day or once every 3 days, as long as they are getting at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water a week.
