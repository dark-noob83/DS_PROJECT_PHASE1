When treatment does begin, the average monthly cost is about $2,100. The cost of drugs is nearly three-fourths of the lifetime expense. Unfortunately, one in four people with HIV don't know they're infected. They find out only when their immune system collapses. Nov. 2, 2006 - People with HIV can get 24 extra years of life from modern treatments -- at a total cost of $618,900 in 2004 dollars. That finding comes from a Cornell/Johns Hopkins/Harvard/Boston University research team that analyzed the costs and benefits of modern HIV treatment
Future costs, Schackman and colleagues estimate, will be $12.1 billion per year. Drugs will make up 70% of the cost. Access to HIV care may become increasingly difficult unless more government funds become available or the cost of HIV care is reduced, Johns Hopkins researcher Richard D. Moore says in a news release. Nov. 2, 2006 - People with HIV can get 24 extra years of life from modern treatments -- at a total cost of $618,900 in 2004 dollars.

Epidemiology. The cost of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) amounts to only one third of the costs incurred in treating HIV-positive people with antiretroviral therapy in South Africa, researchers reported last week at the 2006 Implementers Meeting of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Durban, South Africa. The average monthly cost of the programme at this facility was $91,500 a month and the average antiretroviral costs was $102 per month.
The average annual per patient cost of HIV treatment and care in the US was $19,912, investigators report in the online edition of AIDS. The analysis was based on 2006 figures. Costs were highest for those with a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mm 3. This was due to the high cost of inpatient care. Costs varied according to risk group, and were lower for gay men ($18,990) than injecting drug users ($20,143). Costs also increased with age, and were only $11,854 for each patient aged under 29, compared to an average cost of $21,474 for every patient aged 50 and above.
The average total cost of HIV care was $19,912 per patient per year. Costs were highest for patients with advanced disease. The cost for providing care to each patient who died was $44,000. Total annual per patient cost for an individual with a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mm 3 averaged $40,678. Costs varied according to risk group, and were lower for gay men ($18,990) than injecting drug users ($20,143). Costs also increased with age, and were only $11,854 for each patient aged under 29, compared to an average cost of $21,474 for every patient aged 50 and above.
Antiretroviral drugs comprised an average of one third of the cost of treatment in South Africa and one half to three quarters of the cost in other countries. Conclusions: There is very little empirical information available about the cost of providing antiretroviral therapy in non-research settings in Africa. Empirical information on the cost of delivering antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV/AIDS is needed for program planning and budgeting. Methods: We searched published and gray sources for estimates of the cost of providing ART in service delivery (non-research) settings in sub-Saharan Africa.
Over 1 million Americans live with HIV. While treatable, medical costs are often exorbitant. The CDC reports that the estimated lifetime cost of treating HIV is $379,000 (in 2010 dollars), and that nearly 30 percent of those living with the virus are uninsured. Justin Terry-Smith was diagnosed with HIV in 2006.
“The average cost of HIV treatment is $14,000 to $20,000 a year,” says Michael Kolber, MD, a professor of medicine and director of the Comprehensive AIDS Program and Adult HIV Services at University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida. “If you’re paying $1,000 a month, you’re doing really well.”. Modern HIV drugs can keep people healthy for decades, but if you take them you could be facing well over $400,000 or more in lifetime costs for HIV treatment.
Cost of antiretroviral therapy in Africa HDDP9 5Cost estimates from the studies are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. From each study, we extracted or calculated an average annual cost per patient for the first year of treatment. Empirical information on the cost of delivering antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV/AIDS is needed for program planning and budgeting. Methods: We searched published and gray sources for estimates of the cost of providing ART in service delivery (non-research) settings in sub-Saharan Africa.
