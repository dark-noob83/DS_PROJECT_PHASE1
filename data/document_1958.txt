Overview of Blood in Dog's Stool. Hematochezia is the presence of bright red, fresh blood in the feces. Hematochezia can occur in dogs and usually occurs with bleeding in the lower intestines (colon, rectum). Hematochezia should not be confused with melena, which is the passage of dark, tarry, black feces.
Hematochezia is the medical term when there is a fresh blood found in the stool or just a passage of fresh blood in the anus. Sometimes when a person defecates, they will not notice the bloody streaks in their stool but when wiping the anus, they will see the fresh blood.
