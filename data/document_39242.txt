To be more precise, the square of the wave function gives the probability of finding the location of the electron in the given area, since the normal answer for the wave function is usually a complex number. The wave function concept was first introduced in the legendary Schroedinger schrödinger. equation
Definition: A wavefunction is a function describing the probability of a particle's quantum state as a function of position, momentum, time, and/or spin. Wavefunctions are commonly denoted by the variable ψ. Also Known As: wave function.
At the heart of quantum mechanics is a mysterious equation known as the wave function. It helps explain the behavior of elementary particles, but also challenges the notion that there's only one reality. Scientific American editor Michael Moyer explains.
Check this out: The values of the wave function are probability amplitudes; complex numbers whose square gives the probability distribution that the system will be any of the possible states.  [See source.] The above is a wave function applied to quantum mechanics.
Definition of WAVE FUNCTION. 1. : a solution of the wave equation. 2. : a quantum-mechanical function whose square represents the relative probability of finding a given elementary particle within a specified volume of space.
The square of the wave function for the electron, it is related to the probability of finding an electron at a particular point in space. electron wave function. A mathematical expression to describe the magnitude, or height of an electron standing wave at every
wave function. n. 1. (General Physics) physics a mathematical function of position and generally time, used in wave mechanics to describe the state of a physical system. Symbol: ψ.
