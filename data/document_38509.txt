The cost for replacing a standard gas boiler is about $4,000. A high-efficiency model costs about $7,500. This cost estimate usually includes removal and disposal of the old unit, as well as all necessary lines, ducts and wiring needed for the new system to run properly. Compare the cost of the repair to the cost of replacing. A repair averages between $300 and $500 for most common issues. A replacement can cost between $3,000 and $5,000 for the new equipment installation, inspections and removing the old system.
1 You may need a new chimney liner if you’re upgrading to higher efficiency boiler. 2  Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 3  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
What should be included: 1  Installing a standard boiler (80%-85% annual fuel utilization efficiency) typically costs about $2,500-$5,000 for a gas-fired model and $3,000-$6,500 for an oil-fired unit (generally used in areas without municipal gas lines). Counting the $80 per hour plumber fee to the specially trained Laars boiler person $1200 to install this UNIT, plus the repair labor cost what a piece of engineering work this boiler was. Good riddance.
1 High-efficiency gas boiler installation may require the addition of a chimney liner at a cost of $500 to $2,000. 2  If removing and disposing of the old oil tank is required—and not included in the initial estimate—this could cost $500 to $2,500 or more. 3  Annual boiler maintenance and inspection costs $100 to $300. 1 Lower output and/or mid-efficiency gas boilers cost $2,500 to $5,000 installed; higher output and/or high-efficiency gas boiler replacement cost is $5,000 to $10,000 or more. 2  This price should include removal and disposal of the old boiler

BOILER INSTALLATION COSTS. If you’re replacing an old boiler, expect boiler installation costs for mid-efficiency system to cost about $2,500 to $4,000 (80 percent efficiency), and boiler installation costs for a high-efficiency system to cost between $5,000 to $9,000 (90 to 97 percent efficiency). 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
