Average adjunct faculty instructor pay varies by community college. A 2006 report by the Modern Language Association noted that community college average adjunct faculty instructor pay ranged from about $1,397 to about $3,000 per course.
According to a 2008 article at the Small Steps for Big Change website, adjunct faculty pay at community colleges also depends on the education of the instructor. Generally, the article notes, community college adjunct faculty instructors are paid $2,200 to $3,500 per course. Related Reading: Math Adjunct Jobs.
Most adjunct faculty are paid four times during Terms I and II (fall and spring) and twice during Term III (summer). However, if an adjunct instructor is teaching a class that does not meet for the traditional number of weeks, that pay schedule is adjusted accordingly.
Not surprisingly, at community colleges, adjuncts said they are paid much less. At Houston Community College, adjuncts reported earning between $1,200 and $2,200 for a three-credit English course. In some departments, adjuncts said anecdotally that pay depends on the degree held.
A community college generally offers both academic and vocational education programs. Many community college instructors are adjunct faculty paid for teaching specific courses. Adjunct faculty pay at community colleges is usually on a per-class or per-semester-hour basis.
The overall average pay reported by adjuncts is $2,987 per three-credit course. Adjuncts at 16 colleges reported earning less than $1,000. The highest pay reported is $12,575, in the anthropology department at Harvard University.
Some Faculty Get $100,000, Others Get $20,000. Adjuncts typically earn between $20,000 and $25,000 annually, NPR reports. Compare that to the average salary of $84,303 for full-time instructors and professors, according to the American Association of University Professors.
In California, where faculty at two-and four-year public institutions are unionized, the average pay is $3,888 per course, according to data reported to the Adjunct Project as of last month. In Texas, by contrast, a state where unions are rare, the reported pay is lower: $2,805 per course.
