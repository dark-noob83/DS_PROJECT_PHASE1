AJ poll: 40% of architects working more than 10 hours overtime a week. 20 November, 2014 | By Jim Dunton. Nearly two-fifths (38.4 per cent) of architects work at least 10 hours of overtime every week, most of it unpaid, according to the results of a major new survey.
There are 24 hours in a day; barring any physical or legal hurdles you can work all 24 of them. In many countries there are laws that stop children from working more than a … certain number of hours a day (typically 4 to 8 hours depending on age). How many hours per year does someone who works 6 days on 2 day off followed by 6 days on 3 days off work?   I calculate that in a year with 365 days, you would through the 17-day rotation a total of 21 times with 8 days remaining.
From experience, an architect working in an office can spend anywhere from the minimum of 40 hours a week (when very lucky) to twice that amount or more in a crunch. Answer   depends on how many hours they ask for in a day!   Most full-time firefighters work a 24 on 48 off … schedule. That means that you are at work for 24 hours and then your off for 48 hours. 3 people found this useful.
I consider myself a full-time homemaker and part time architect. I know lots of architects in this position although most of them are women. Maybe 25 hours per week focused on work (billable or not) I don’t seem to be able to do the night owl thing anymore. I’m in the +10-20 hours/week category. The crippling aspect for me transcends that “working for the man” perception that architects are expected, by their employers, to devote overtime. If I have an interview next week and spend 60 hours on models, renderings, rehearsal and preparation, that’s 60 hours spent working that a client does not pay for. There is a similar argument for general overhead – tasks that are work related but not marketing time or billable time….
Intern architects typically earn between $35,000 and $58,000 depending on experience prior to licensure. Architects that have completed the internship period can expect an average starting salary of between $51,709 and $64,519.

Dec 17, 09 3:07 pm. I get paid in full based on working 2080 hours a year. Thats 52 weeks of 40 hours per week. Taking away about 6 weeks including vacation/ personal/ holiday/ sick days, really I'm get paid my salary for working about 46 weeks out of the year, 40 hours a week. betamax. (History | Contact). Dec 14, 09 2:31 pm. that all depends on the individual...a passionate individual will work as many hours as it takes for his/her fingers to bleed both in school and in practice...then the will sleep for 2.5 hours then start over. everyone else probably averages between 60-70 hours per week.
According to a Harvard research an architect works about 8 hours a day 40 hours a week and 120 a year. How many hours per year does someone who works 6 days on 2 day off followed by 6 days on 3 days off work?   I calculate that in a year with 365 days, you would through the 17-day rotation a total of 21 times with 8 days remaining.
Architects work about an average of 45 hours a week. So if you do the math architects work about 9 hour days. If they work around 45 hours a week, then mathematically speaking they will be working around 6-7 hours per day. How many hours per year does someone who works 6 days on 2 day off followed by 6 days on 3 days off work?   I calculate that in a year with 365 days, you would through the 17-day rotation a total of 21 times with 8 days remaining.
