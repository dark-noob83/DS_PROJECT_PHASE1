Normal weight ranges: Body mass index (BMI). Body mass index, or BMI, is a way to help you figure out if you are at a healthy weight for your height. BMI is a number based on your weight and height. In general, the higher the number, the more body fat a person has. Divide that by your height in inches, squared: BMI = (your weight in pounds x 703) ÷ (your height in inches x your height in inches). For example, if you weigh 120 pounds and are 5 ft. 3 in. (63 in.) tall: BMI = (120 x 703) ÷ (63 x 63) or 84,360 ÷ 3969 = 21.3. This is well within the healthy weight range.
