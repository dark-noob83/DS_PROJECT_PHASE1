“Your gross salary is the TOTAL amount of compensation that you receive from your employer. Depending on the type of job that you have, this can include any bonuses, commissions, profit sharing plans, retirement plans and overtime pay. It is not uncommon for employees to make the majority of their compensation from non-base pay” (http://www.ehow.com/info_8165672_base-gross-salary-same.html). 
Remember, gross pay includes everything you earn for your work and subtracts nothing. 1  For simplicity’s sake, let’s say you’re an amazingly consistent salesperson and have earned a $120 commission each week for the past year. 2  For the year, $739 x 52 = $38,428. 3. Divide your target net pay by that percentage. If you need to bring home $2,100 monthly, and you know you currently bring home 75% of your gross pay (because of taxes and other deductions), you can determine your gross pay target. 1  The calculation: $2,100 / .75 = $2,800.
1 Added to your weekly base salary plus overtime of $619, your weekly total is now $739. 2  This is your weekly gross pay. 3  For the year, $739 x 52 = $38,428. 4  This is your annual gross pay. 3. Divide your target net pay by that percentage. If you need to bring home $2,100 monthly, and you know you currently bring home 75% of your gross pay (because of taxes and other deductions), you can determine your gross pay target. 1  The calculation: $2,100 / .75 = $2,800.
Ex. if you get 10% of a $10,000 sale (gross), you would take home $1000. if you get 10% of your employer's cut (net) on the same sale, you would take home $250. obviously, it is much better to be paid on gross sales than net sales-always negotiate in YOUR best interest.

Total gross compensation is the amount an employee receives before any deductions or adjustments. Unlike gross salary, which is the earned hourly or annual wages before deductions, total gross compensation includes tips, bonuses and other benefits employers give employees during the period being reported. This information gives government agencies an accurate picture of the employee's taxable income
Therefore, you have a profit of $40 per hour. Version 1: Using this example, you can offer a commission on the gross sales ($100 per hour) and provide your salesperson let's say a 10 percent commission so it works out to be $10 per hour in commissions.
Base Salary. Base salary is what you see on your paycheck. It is the amount per hour or per year that you are paid for performing your job. Base salary does not include any bonuses, benefits or perks associated with the job. It increases with raises or adjustments, but remains the yearly or hourly wage paid. Base salary is typically the number you say when people ask you how much you make -- what you are paid.
Calculation. To arrive at gross payroll for the pay period, add all cash payments and non-cash wages made to the each employee during that time frame. Do not include any deductions taken from employees’ paychecks. Deductions take two forms: mandatory and voluntary.
