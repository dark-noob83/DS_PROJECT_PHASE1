The general formula for speed is distance divided by time. We write. speed = distance/time, v = d/t. For the sake of convenience we use the abbreviations d = distance, t = time, and v = speed. If you cover a distance of 80 miles in two hours, then your average speed is. v = (80 miles)/(2 hours) = 40 miles/hour. You probably go slower than average during some periods of time, and faster during other periods.
Best Answer: C. m/s^s is meters per second per second or meters per second squared. Group to see the relationship: (meters/second) per second which is (velocity) per second. Measuring the change in velocity as a function of time. That's acceleration.
The abbreviation for speed is S= d/t which is Speed = Distance/ Time.
For example Ave. stands for Avenue and Apt. stands for apartment. An abbreviation (from Latin brevis sho â€¦ rt) is a shorter form of a word. More particularly, an abbreviation is a letter or group of letters, taken from a word or words, and employed to represent them for the sake of.
Velocity is a vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion or, in other terms, the rate and direction of the change in the position of an object. The scalar (absolute value) magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed of the motion.
