Matakana Island Click for Map of Matakana Island is located in Tauranga Harbour in the Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand. The Island is New Zealands only “raised sand barrier island” and is also classed as a nationally significant geological site.
The decision on a Western Bay of Plenty District Plan Change regarding the future development of Matakana Island was made in response to three large forestry landowners seeking to undertake substantial housing development on the forested sand barrier of the island.
Lawyer Paul Cooney, who acted for Council, supported Council's conservative stand on the protection of the island's values. The decision recognises Matakana Island and, in particular, the forested barrier as a unique place due to its significant ecological, landscape, cultural and archaeological values.
Matakana Island is a blend of different landscapes-white sand surf beach, pine forest, farmland and tranquil harbour. A long, flat island mostly covered with pine forest, Matakana has one of New Zealand's best beach breaks for surfing. A powerful north-easterly swell on a high tide produces great sand barrels. Matakana's surf side is a nesting site for a large number of sea birds, including the endangered New Zealand dotterel.
