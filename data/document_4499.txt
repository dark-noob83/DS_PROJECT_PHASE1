For centuries, rattles have been one of the first toys that babies play with. Rattles can be made of wood, plastic or cloth. Many of the rattles are brightly colored, have animal or flower shapes and typically make sounds when shaken.
The best age for a baby to play with a rattle is about 5-6 months as per my experience.
From two to three months, however, when your baby's hands open up and she first discovers them-and all the things she can do with them-toys become much more valuable as learning tools. Noisy toys are great at this age.
Another reason why rattles are good for babies is that they encourage babies to explore more. Babies have a sense of discovering something as they try to grab and hold the rattle. Some rattles have pieces that move, some rattles have smiling faces and some are soft and cuddly.
Her baby rattle teaches her that her hand belongs to her! As you give her the baby rattle she waves her arms and makes a noise with it, she looks and sees it shaking and her sensors tell her that her limbs are moving and, when she feels her arm stop, so too does the noise and the movement.
Rattles are good for babies because they provide a source of stimulation. Babies like the sounds they are hearing and, with their eyes, try to follow the path of the rattle as it is shaken back and forth. Rattles certainly are a sensory treat for baby!
Place a toy in front of her or in her lap and show her how it works. Babies at this age love toys they can pound (like baby pianos) or anything that lights up and makes noise. She'll find a whole new love for all those noisy rattles. 5 months is also the age when babies start to learn cause and effect. They quickly figure out that if they drop something it falls.
