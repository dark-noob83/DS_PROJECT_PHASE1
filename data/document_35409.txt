For example, if a company projected that a new product would sell for $25 per unit, but found that the per-unit cost ended up being $25.75, they would be looking at a negative earning potential or loss of $.75, which is generally represented parenthetically in as ($.75) in incremental earnings.
For example, it can be of interest to determine the incremental change in cost when: 1  A person's employment is terminated. 2  A production line is shut down. 3  A distribution center is closed. 4  A subsidiary is sold off.
Example. A very simple example of incremental cost would be a factory producing widgets where it takes one employee an hour to produce one widget. As a simple figure, the incremental cost of a widget would include the wages for an hour in addition to the cost of materials used in production of a widget.
Unit Costs. Another way that incremental earnings can be broken down and simplified is in terms of the per-unit costs. If the technology sold in the previous example sold for $10, then the company would be expecting 36,000 units to sell over the course of a year for a total of $360,000 in revenue. The per-unit cost of the product would be $2.78 per unit, or $100,000 in costs divided by 36,000 units sold.
Definition: Incremental cost is the extra cost associated with manufacturing one additional unit of production. It can be useful when formulating the price to charge a customer as part of a one-time deal to sell additional units.
Incremental cost is the cost associated with increasing production by one unit. Because some costs are fixed and other variable, the incremental cost will not be the same as the overall average cost per unit.
