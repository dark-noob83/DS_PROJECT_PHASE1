Taiga: Animals The cold climate of the taiga prevents many animals from living there year-round. Some of the large animals found in the taiga include moose, deer, and bears. Examples of smaller animals that live in the taiga are bobcats, squirrels, chipmunks, ermine, and moles. Photo 2000-www.arttoday.com.

LOCATION: Taiga, also known as coniferous or boreal forest, is the largest terrestrial biome on earth. It extends in a broad band across North America, Europe, and Asia to the southern border of the arctic tundra. Due to these factors, plants in the taiga have different adaptations than the plants we find around Santa Barbara. The. ANIMALS: The cold climate of the taiga makes it a difficult place for many animals to live. Many have thick coats of fur to insulate against the cold, and some hibernate.
Natural resources found in the Taiga biome are coal, trees, and  oil. Some common trees found in this biome are the black spruce,  Douglas-fir, balsam fir, and paper birch. A natural resource is not man made and is a â€¦ lready on the Earth. Some examples of natural resources would be oil, timber, and water, as well as a variety of minerals, metals and ores like salt, coal, and metals like gold, iron, aluminum.
Coniferous trees are very common in the taiga biome. This is why it is often referred to as the boreal forest. These types of trees include Douglas Fir, White Spruce, and Hemlock. There are also lots of lichen and moss that grow in the taiga biome. The taiga biome is one that has very long and cold winters. They summers are short and they are cool in temperature. The cool air masses from the arctic can move in rapidly. The average temperature in the summer is from 64 degrees to 72 degrees.

The taiga is the largest biome. It covers much or Russia, Northern Europe, and Canada. It also is found in the higher elevations in the northern and western part of the United States. It is found in areas with high latitudes, generally between 50 degrees latitude and the Arctic Circle. Needles are the leaves in the taiga biome. Conifers are adapted to the taiga environment because they lose less water and shed snow more easily because of their conical shape. Some types of adaptations in the animals are migration, heavier coats of fur, and some change color, such as the snow-shoe rabbit.
Human Influence. Humans have a very large influence on the Taiga biome. The biome is rich in trees that are used for many different reasons, such as agri-business, industrial logging, Mining for metals, road building, and hydroelectric dams.
