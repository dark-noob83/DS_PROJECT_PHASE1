1. You usually need a university degree in mechanical engineering or in a related field of engineering. 2. You may also need a master's degree or doctorate in a related engineering field. 3. You need a licence from a provincial/territorial association of professional engineers to approve engineering drawings/reports and to practise as a professional engineer (P. Eng.). As an engineer, you are eligible for registration following graduation from an accredited educational program, after three or four years of supervised work experience in engineering, and after passing a professional practice examination. 5. With experience, you can move up the ranks to become a supervisor.
Learn about the education and preparation needed to become a mechanical engineer. Get a quick view of the requirements as well as details about degree programs, job duties and licensure to find out if this is the career for you. Licensure. Mechanical engineers working in all states must earn licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE). Requirements for PE licensure include a bachelor's degree from a four-year institution accredited by ABET and work experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer.
Aspiring mechanical engineers must earn a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at minimum, and many pursue graduate degrees in the field. Every state requires that mechanical engineers earn licensure, which calls for education, supervised work experience and several examinations. Licensure. Mechanical engineers working in all states must earn licensure as a Professional Engineer (PE). Requirements for PE licensure include a bachelor's degree from a four-year institution accredited by ABET and work experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer.
The BLS reports that a bachelorâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering is necessary for most entry-level positions in the field. Students may also choose to complete a two-year pre-engineering degree and find related work as a mechanical drafter. Anything that involves force, energy or motion involves mechanical engineering. Because mechanical engineers design and work with all types of mechanical systems, careers in this field span across many industries.
Bachelor's Degree. Simply put, you need a Bachelor of Science in Engineering to become an engineer. Most people involved in this type of degree program can choose which specialty they would like, and will need to take classes specific to that field. Licensing. Once you get at least a bachelor's degree in engineering, you should look into the licensing requirements. In the US, if you are going to be offering your services to the public, you need to pass a licensing test that consists of two written exams and an internship.
Education Requirements. If you're new to the field, a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering is usually suitable to qualify you for an entry-level job. Many schools offer majors specifically in mechanical engineering, though some relevant alternatives include mathematics, chemistry, or physics. Career Overview. As a mechanical engineer, you're in charge of creating, designing, testing, and researching mechanized devices, like tools, machines, and engines. This broad field allows you to specialize in different areas, such as power-using machines or power-producing machines.

Engineering is a career that involves using math and science in order to solve a problem. There are several types of engineers, with chemical, civil, electrical, mechanical, and industrial engineers making up the bulk of the professionals in this large field. Licensing. Once you get at least a bachelor's degree in engineering, you should look into the licensing requirements. In the US, if you are going to be offering your services to the public, you need to pass a licensing test that consists of two written exams and an internship.
In the mechanical engineering field, associate's degree programs are offered in the topic of mechanical engineering technology. This program can prepare to you assist engineers or transfer to a bachelor's degree program. An associate's degree program in mechanical engineering technology can train you in mechanical engineering concepts, as well as industry-current engineering equipment and software.
