auditory ossicles. the malleus, incus and stapes, the three small bones of the tympanic cavity of the ear. They form a connecting bony system from the tympanic membrane to the oval window that is the opening to the internal ear. auditory tube. the narrow channel connecting the nasopharynx to the middle ear. See also pharyngotympanic tube.
The bones of the ear, also known as the auditory ossicles, are the three smallest bones in the human body. These bones play an important role in the sense of hearing by transmitting sounds to the inner ear. Anatomy The three auditory ossicles – the malleus, incus, and stapes – are tiny bones found in the middle ear.
The auditory ossicles consist of three small bones found within a space (the tympanic cavity) in the temporal bone of the skull. The bones (which are named for their shape) are connected by synovial joints.
2. Incus (anvil). 3. Malleus (hammer). The auditory ossicles consist of three small bones found within a space (the tympanic cavity) in the temporal bone of the skull. The bones (which are named for their shape) are connected by synovial joints.
The Ossicles. The three tiniest bones in the body form the coupling between the vibration of the eardrum and the forces exerted on the oval window of the inner ear. Formally named the malleus, incus, and stapes, they are commonly referred to in English as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup.
The stapes (aka stirrup) is the smallest of the three auditory  ossicles of the middle ear. These little bones amplify and  transmit sound vibrations from the tympanic mem … brane (eardrum) to  the oval window. The stapes is in direct contact with the oval  window.
