Wellesbourne is a large village and civil parish in the county of Warwickshire, in the West Midlands region of the UK.
It was later referred to as Walesborne in the Domesday Book. In May 1140 Wellesbourne was hit by a tornado-one of the earliest recorded in the British Isles. It damaged several buildings and killed a woman.
With the rapid increase in new housing and industrial developments since the 1990s, Wellesbourne is increasingly referred to as a small commuter town servicing its larger neighbours such as Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwick and Leamington Spa, and a little further afield, the cities of Coventry, Banbury and Birmingham.
