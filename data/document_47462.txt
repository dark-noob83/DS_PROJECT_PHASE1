The range for a normal test result depends on your age and gender. For adults younger than 40, normal levels are typically in the range of: 107 to 139 mL/min or 1.78 to 2.32 mL/s (SI units) for men. 87 to 107 mL/min or 1.45 to 1.78 mL/s (SI units) for women. Creatinine clearance rates go down as you age. For newborns, the normal range is 40 to 65 mL/min. An abnormal creatinine clearance rate may mean you have a problem with your kidneys. Or it may mean a problem somewhere else in your body is affecting blood flow to the kidneys.
This first said my BUN was supposed to be between 6-17, however mine was a 22. My creatinine levels were normal. At this point, I had already been off creatine for 2 weeks but still had a very high protein diet (roughly 350 grams per day). I decreased my protein intake drastically and got another test one month later. The BUN had dropped to a 20, while the goal was still to be between 6-17. 
Normal creatinine levels. 1  In adult males, the normal levels of creatinine in the blood are in the range of 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dl. 2  In adult females, the normal levels of creatinine in the blood are in the range of 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dl. 1 In adult females, the normal levels of creatinine in the blood are in the range of 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dl. 2  Depending on the level of muscle development, the normal creatinine levels in infants are 0.2mg/dl or more.
Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. Creatinine levels that reach 2.0 or more in babies and 10.0 or more in adults may indicate severe kidney impairment and the need for a dialysis machine to remove wastes from the blood.

When there is kidney damage or kidney disease, and the kidneys are not able to filter waste efficiently, there will likely be a rise in creatinine levels in the blood. For adults with kidney disease, dialysis is recommended when creatinine levels reach 10.0 mg/dL. A creatinine clearance test is usually ordered if the serum creatinine level is higher than normal or when a person is starting dialysis. Normal creatinine clearance for men is between 97 to 137 milliliters per minute, and women have a normal clearance of 88 to 128 milliliters per minute.
The creatinine levels in both urine and blood are determined and compared. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy women is 88-128 mL/min. and 97 to 137 mL/min. in males (normal levels may vary slightly between labs). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is another indicator of kidney function. Urea is also a metabolic byproduct which can build up if kidney function is impaired. The kidneys maintain the blood creatinine in a normal range. Creatinine has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. Elevated creatinine level signifies impaired kidney function or kidney disease.
One mg/dL of creatinine is 88.4 μmol/L. The typical human reference ranges for serum creatinine are 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL (about 45-90 μmol/L) for women and 0.7 to 1.2 mg/dL (60-110 μmol/L) for men. The significance of a single creatinine value must be interpreted in light of the patient's muscle mass.
