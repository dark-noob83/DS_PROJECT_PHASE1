August 15, 1914, marks the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Panama Canal, the American-built waterway across the Isthmus of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In the years after the canal opened, tensions increased between America and Panama over control of the canal and the surrounding Canal Zone. In 1964, Panamanians rioted after being prevented from flying their nation’s flag next to a U.S. flag in the
The Panama Canal was opened to traffic on 15 August 1914, when the steamship SS Ancon crossed it. Some people say it opened at 7:00am … when the Ancon left the port of Cristobal. Others say that it was sometime around 12 noon, when the steamship reached the middle of the Canal path. It left port of Cristobal at around 7:00am, and arriving at the port of Balboa around 4:00pm.
However: US President Woodrow Wilson officially opened the Panama Canal on 12 July 1920, despite the fact that traffic had been using the canal since its unofficial opening on 15 August 1914, when Canal cement boat Ancon, piloted by Captain John A Constantine, the Canal's first pilot, made the first official transit. What year did the Panama Canal open for shipping traffic?   The first ship to complete the transit fo the canal was the cargo ship Ancon, on August 15, 1914.

On August 15, 1914, the Panama Canal, a man-made waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, officially opened to traffic. This day marked the culmination of one of the largest construction projects ever undertaken by the United States. 
France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States took over the project in 1904, and took a decade to complete the canal, which was officially opened on August 15, 1914. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 metres (85 ft) above sea level. The current locks are 33.5 metres (110 ft) wide.
This was of use to the United States, which completed the present Panama Canal in 1913 and officially opened it in 1914. Along the way, the state of Panama was created through its separation from Colombia in 1903, due to a US backed revolt, so the US could then get control of the Canal project area. The victorious Panamanians returned the favor to Roosevelt by allowing the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone on February 23, 1904, for US$ 10 million (as provided in the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, signed on November 18, 1903).
