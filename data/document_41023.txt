Report Abuse. Our first ultrasound (dating scan) cost $150 because we we're less than 12 weeks along. I think half was claimed back on medicare. Our down's scan (which I didn't know you didn't have to get!) cost $200 - we claimed back $59.50. The anomaly scan (20 weeks) cost I think $300 (not yet claimed so I'm not sure how much you get back). We also had a scan early on as I had bleeding, which was free. You can get those space age scans for about $150 - I'm pretty sure they aren't claimable

Answers. Best Answer: Cost depends on many factors but in general, if you don't have health insurance (which pays the entire cost) than a CT could cost around $1000 to $3000. An ultrasound, again depending on many factors can cost over $700. There is no blood test to confirm cancer. The only real way to confirm if you have cancer is by having a biopsy taken of the tumor or the area of concern. Two VERY different tests! An ultrasound is under $1000. A CT can be between $10000 and $5000. . . The CT would be HIGHLY effective at detecting it. . . an MRI would be better. An ultrasound would show lumps/bumps but can't prove anything is cancer
Most single area, routine exams cost $900. The price of your scan will be dependent on the time needed for your scan, complexity and whether or not an injection of contrast is required.
