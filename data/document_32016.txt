In human anatomy, the infraorbital foramen (IOF) is an opening in the maxillary bone of the skull located below the infraorbital margin (IOM) of the orbit (eye socket). It allows passage for the infraorbital artery, vein, and nerve which are branches of the maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).
The ramifications of the three principal branches of the trigeminal nerve — at the supraorbital, infraorbital, and mental foramina — are distributed on a vertical line (in anterior view) passing through the middle of the pupil.
incisive foramen. one of the openings of the incisive canals into the incisive fossa of the hard palate. infraorbital foramen. the facial opening of the infraorbital canal, a prominent feature of the lateral aspect of the face; provides a point of emergence for the infraorbital nerve. interventricular foramen. a passage from the third to the lateral ventricle of the brain.
infraorbital nerve n. The continuation of the maxillary nerve into the eye socket, traversing the infraorbital canal to supply the upper incisors, canines, premolars, upper gums, lower eyelid and conjunctiva, and part of the nose and upper lip.
: an opening in the maxillary bone just below the lower rim of the orbit that gives passage to the infraorbital artery, nerve, and vein.
one of the foraminae ventral to the orbit; leads to the infraorbital canal. mental foramen. foramina on the lateral aspect of the mandible from which the inferior alveolar nerve and blood vessels emerge to supply the chin. mastoid foramen. an opening in the temporal bone behind the mastoid process.
After the maxillary nerve enters the infraorbital canal, the nerve is frequently called the infraorbital nerve. This nerve innervates (sensory) the lower eyelid, upper lip, and part of the nasal vestibule and exits the infraorbital foramen of the maxilla.
