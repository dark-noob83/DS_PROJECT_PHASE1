If you have one of our kits you will have a pre cut length of ~10 feet and you should use this amount to insure that you will not run out as you are braiding your paracord bracelet.

I did the same thing for the 2nd piece of jewelry I might have made with the left over beads from the 1st piece. The necklace was $5 in material + Packaging x 3 + $18 and I had enough to make matching bracelet and sell $8. Your way makes much more sense and I would be more accurate with all my pricing.

I sell mine depending on how many strings I have, how fancy the pattern is, how long it took me, and how hard the pattern is. I would sell a Wave bracelet for ABOUT 3 dollars, depending on the amount of strings, since there isn't THAT much work in it. have a lot of bracelets that I don't wear anymore that I'm going to be selling for 2-3 dollars. I also have plenty of macrame/b racelets that have very simple patterns that I'm going to be selling for less than 2 dollars.
