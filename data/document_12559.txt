Three different kinds of lice live on humans: 1  Head lice are usually found in hair, most often on the back of the neck and behind the ears. 2  Pubic lice, also called crabs, are usually found in the pubic area. 3  Body lice live and lay eggs (nits) in the seams of clothing.
Three types of lice live, feed, and reproduce on humans: the body louse, the head louse, and the pubic louse. As the common names imply, each type typically infests a specific area of a human (see below). Scientists who study lice differ in their opinion regarding the body louse and the head louse.
Types of Lice. The three main types of lice that infect peep are: head lice, body lice, and pubic lice (crabs). Each type of lice bites your skin, causing extreme itching. If you scratch the bite, you can break the skin and get other skin infections.
An infestation of body lice occurs when a certain type of lice invade the body and clothing. Lice are parasitic insects that feed on human blood and can infest the head, body, and pubic area. There are three types of lice that infest humans: 1  head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis). 2  body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis).
The body louse is larger than other types of lice. They lay their eggs and leave waste on skin and in clothing. Lice can crawl, but they cannot fly, hop, or jump. Infestations occur worldwide and are spread via close person-to-person contact or through used bed linens, towels and clothing.
