Physical exertion requires a large amount of energy, which means that athletes need to consume more calories than the average person. For example, a 160-lb. individual running at 8 mph would burn 986 calories in an hour. This amount needs to be matched in the diet. The body also requires 500 calories a day just to add muscles.
According to exercise physiologists William McArdle and Frank Katch, the average daily calorie expenditure for a man is between 2,700 and 2,900 calories; for a woman it's 2,000 to 2,100 calories. An athlete would need to add to this total all the additional calories expended from workouts. For example, a 160-lb. individual running at 8 mph would burn 986 calories in an hour. This amount needs to be matched in the diet. The body also requires 500 calories a day just to add muscles.
Since women athletes usually weigh less than male athletes, they generally require fewer calories as well. According to the University of Missouri, female athletes need about 20 to 23 calories per pound of body weight each day. This is equivalent to 2,600 to 2,990 calories a day for a 130-pound woman.
Generally, you need to consume foods that replenish the high amount of energy you burn each day. The amount of energy provided by a food is measured in calories. Most people need between 1,500 and 2,000 calories a day. However, for many athletes, this number can increase by as much as 1,000 to 1,500 calories or more. Teen athletes, who need enough fuel for both intense training and rapid growth and development, may need as many as 5,000 calories daily.
Athletes should decrease their total caloric intake by 500 calories per day to lose 1 pound in 1 week. The caloric deficit can be created from additional exercise, diet, or a combination of both. Remember to consider activity level when calculating caloric intake. Athletes should increase their total caloric intake by 250-500 calories per day to gain weight. Some experts even recommend a 1,000 caloric increase per day. Remember to consider activity level when calculating caloric intake. Athletes should aim to consume the proper ratios of nutrients
Endurance athletes as well as all people should consume less than 30% of total calories from fat and less than 10% from saturated fat. If, as an athlete, you eat 3000 calories per day, less than 1000 of those calories should be from fat. High-fat foods include chocolate, fried foods, ice cream, bacon, hot dogs, and cookies. Food labels tell you grams of fat and percentage of calories from fat per serving. As with carbohydrates, food labels tell you how many grams of protein are in a serving. An endurance athlete should consume 3-5 servings per day. One serving of lean meat, fish or poultry is 3 ounces, roughly the size of a deck of playing cards.
A typical female student athlete child between the ages of 9 and 13 should consume 1,800 to 2,200 calories a day, and if they are between the ages of 14 and 18 they should be consuming 2,400 calories. For a male student athlete child between the ages of four and eight they should be consuming between 1,600 and 2,000 calories. The student athlete child between the ages of 9 and 13 should consume between 2,000 and 2,600 calories, and if they are between 14 and 18 they should consume between 2,800 and 3,200 calories. It is also important that the types of calories the athlete consumes are balanced between carbohydrates, proteins, and fat
Calorie Composition. According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, most athletes should eat 60 to 70 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 12 to 15 percent from protein and 20 to 30 percent of their calories from fat. According to the University of Missouri, female athletes need about 20 to 23 calories per pound of body weight each day. This is equivalent to 2,600 to 2,990 calories a day for a 130-pound woman.
