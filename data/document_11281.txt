SUMMARY. This step-by-step article describes how to use the change user command to switch a Terminal Services server to Install mode. You must put a Terminal Services server in Install mode to install or remove programs on the server.

MORE INFORMATION. Do not run the system in install mode (except to install applications). This disables user registry and .INI file mappings, which means each user running an application would share the same .INI file or registry entry, instead of having them on a per-user basis. The Terminal Server computer should always be run in execute mode. If you have an application that runs only in install mode, the application is probably looking for a file in the SystemRoot directory rather than the user's Windows directory.
When installing applications on multiuser environment such as a Terminal/Citrix server, you must put the server into install mode, either via the command prompt or using Add/Remove programs in Control Panel. When you install the application in Install mode, and information normally written to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key will be written to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal Server\Install.
