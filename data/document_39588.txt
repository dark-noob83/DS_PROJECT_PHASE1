But remember, the top salary level is reached only after many years of service and only at a few of the major airlines. Most airline pilots start out as first officer (co-pilot) with a regional carrier; initially they earn about $15,000 to $20,000 a year. And when they join a major airline, their first position may not be as a pilot, but as a flight engineer. Position Description. For many professional pilots, the ultimate job is to be an airline captain. The pay can be very good; top salary at some of the higher paying major airlines is around $200,000 a year, for about 80 to 85 hours of flying per month. And benefits for pilots, as well as many other airline employees, include travel passes
