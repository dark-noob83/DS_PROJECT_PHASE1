methods we searched medline embase and cinahl to april 2009 and reference lists to identify studies which had measured heart rate and or respiratory rate in normal children between birth and 18 years of age the aim of the present study is to develop new age specific centiles for heart rate and respiratory rate in children derived from a systematic review of all studies which measured these vital signs
dogs at rest have a normal respiration rate of 10 to 35 breaths per minute the average dog at rest takes 24 breaths per minute to check your dog s respiration rate count his chest movements for 15 seconds and multiply by four to get the total number of breaths per minute thinkstock dogs at rest have a normal respiration rate of 10 to 35 breaths per minute practice checking your dog s respiration rate at home when you and your dog are both relaxed so you ll recognize quickly when something is wrong i always tell folks to watch and listen to their pets every day
for children from the age of one to five years old normal respiration is 20 to 30 breaths per minute while children who are from six to twelve years old should have a normal respiratory rate that ranges from 12 to 20 breaths per minute 
definition respiratory rate also known as ventilation rate respiration rate breathing rate pulmonary ventilation rate breathing frequency and respiratory frequency or rf the number of breaths a person takes during one minute it is usually measured at rest while sitting 
from 6 months through 1 year old infants inhale and exhale 25 to 40 times a minute toddlers between 1 and 3 breathe 20 to 30 times a minute the normal respiratory rate for 6 to 12 year olds is 14 to 22 from 12 years of age onward the normal respiration rate runs 12 to 18 times a minute according to medline plus
for example his normal respiration rate is only 8 breaths min here are his numbers for normal breathing normal minute ventilation 4 l min normal tidal volume air volume breathed in during a single breath 500 ml normal rf respiratory frequency or respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute inspiration about 1 5 2 seconds normal exhalation is 1 5 2 seconds followed by an automatic pause no breathing for 1 2 seconds
the dog respiratory rate may be influenced by a number of factors but the average respiratory rate of the pet is considered to be 24 breaths every minute knowing your dog s normal range of breaths per minute is important so that you can detect if he is ill normal dog respiratory rate the average respiratory rate for canines is 24 breaths per minute but typically a dog s respiratory rate will be between 10 and 30 breaths per minute this number may be affected by a few factors such as
the typical respiratory rate for a healthy adult at rest is 12 20 breaths per minute average resting respiratory rates by age are birth to 6 weeks 30 60 breaths per minute 6 months 25 40 breaths per minute 
the 1st to 99th centiles of respiratory rate in normal children from birth to 18 years of age are displayed in figure 2 these demonstrate the decline in respiratory rate from birth to early adolescence with the steepest decline apparent in infants during the first two years of life the aim of the present study is to develop new age specific centiles for heart rate and respiratory rate in children derived from a systematic review of all studies which measured these vital signs
