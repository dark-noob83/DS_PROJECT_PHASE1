Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas of most immediate concern, because it is the most concentrated in the atmosphere and because it can persist for over 100 years in the atmosphere once emitted. On a per molecule basis, other gases can trap even more heat than carbon dioxide.
The harmful effects of presence of greenhouse gasses in atmosphere are global warming, climate change, ozone depletion, sea level rise, adverse effects on biodiversity etc. One way or another these adverse impacts are all directly or indirectly related to the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Although commonly labeled the worst greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide is not the most effective greenhouse gas. However, because it has the highest concentration in the atmosphere compared to all the other greenhouse gases that human emit (except water vapor), it is the one that has the biggest impact.
The gases that contributes the most to the greenhouse effect in the  Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane,  nitrous oxide, and ozone. 16 people found this useful. 1  A Brief Definition and Description of Greenhouse Gases Greenhouse gases are not any one specific type of gas.
Methane is the next on our top 5 list of greenhouse gases. This gas is probably the most damaging of all. When it comes to global warming, methane is 20 times more harmful than carbon dioxide. Methane is often trapped inside the earth and it is released by mining.
Greenhouse Gases-The Dangers. Greenhouse gases are dangerous to the environment. The most prevalent greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere by agricultural practices and by the burning of fossil fuels.
All of these gases are harmful to the environment. One of the dangers of greenhouse gases is global warming. Polar ice caps are melting as a result of the greenhouse effect and this increases the sea level and cause floods to the coastal areas.
