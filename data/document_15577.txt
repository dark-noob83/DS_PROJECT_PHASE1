Adult roundworms can grow up to 4 inches long. The worm may enter a dog, for instance, in the post-larval stage at less than an inch long and grow to 2 inches long in as few as 10 days. A roundworm will grow in the animal's digestive tract, feeding on nutrients.
Eggs are passed in the host's stools. The eggs hatch into larvae in 1 to 2 days under warm, moist conditions out of direct sunlight. The larvae grow in the stools and/or soil for 5 to 10 days until they become filariform (fi-LARE-i-form), or threadlike. It is during this stage that hookworm can cause infection.
Introduction. Roundworms, or nematodes, are parasites that can infect people. They usually live in the intestines. There are different kinds of worms that can cause infection, and they can range in length from 1 millimeter to 1 meter. Most often, eggs, or larvae, live in the soil and get into the body when you get them on your hands and then touch your mouth.
The worms are about as thick as a pencil and can grow to be about 13 inches long. They reproduce very quickly. Female roundworms may lay more than 200,000 eggs every day; these eggs leave the body through bowel movements.
