Uranus orbits the sun every 84 years at an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km) and spins on its own axis every 17 hours compared to 24 hours on Earth. Uranus has the coldest atmospheric temperature of any planet in the solar system, around -224C (-371F). Temperatures in its interior are lower than those found in the other outer planets, possibly less than 4500C (8132F) .
1 Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and the third largest in the solar system. 2  Its diameter is 31,763 miles (51,118 km) which is four times larger than Earth. 3  The planet is categorized as an ice giant due to the high levels of icy elements in its composition. Uranus has the coldest atmospheric temperature of any planet in the solar system, around -224C (-371F). Temperatures in its interior are lower than those found in the other outer planets, possibly less than 4500C (8132F) .
Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of any planet: With minimum atmospheric temperature of -224°C Uranus is nearly coldest planet in the solar system. While Neptune doesn’t get as cold as Uranus it is on average colder. Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It’s not visible to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope. Uranus is tipped over on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees.
Uranus Temperature. Taken in 1986 by Voyager 2 (notice Uranus's continuous darkness in coldness). The effective temperature of Uranus is -216°C or -357°F. At 1 bar of pressure in the planet the temperature is -197°C or -322.6°F and at .1 bar of pressure in the planet the temperature is -220°C or -364°F. Although Uranus is not the furthest planet from the Sun it is definitely the coldest planet in our solar system. It also has the least warm core at 4,727°C or 8,540.6°F than any of the other gas planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune)
Weather.gov Sioux Falls, SD. Uranus is the third gas giant planet of four in proximity to the Sun. Overall, Uranus is the seventh planet in our solar system, residing at an average distance of 1.8 billion miles from the Sun (twice as far as Saturn). Its rotation is quick, at about 18 hours, enough to flatten the planet at its poles (a characteristic of all gas giants). The coldest temperature found in Uranus' lower atmosphere so far is -371 degrees F., which rivals Neptune's frigid temperatures. Findings from Hubble reveal that clouds circle Uranus at over 300 mph.
The seventh planet from the sun, Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any of the planets in the solar system, even though it is not the most distant. Despite the fact that its equator faces away from the sun, the temperature distribution on Uranus is much like other planets, with a warmer equator and cooler poles. But weather on Uranus functions much as it does on other gas giants. Like Jupiter and Saturn, the planet has bands of zones and belts that orbit parallel to the equator, which is warmer than the poles. The warm temperatures that drive the planet's weather come from the interior of the planet, rather than from the sun.
It has been recently found that wind speeds on Uranus range from 90 to 360 mph and the planet's average temperature is a frigid -353 degrees F. The coldest temperature found in Uranus' lower atmosphere so far is -371 degrees F., which rivals Neptune's frigid temperatures. Findings from Hubble reveal that clouds circle Uranus at over 300 mph.
The average temperature on Uranus is about 60 Kelvin (- 350 degrees Fahrenheit). The minimum near the tropopause is 52 K (-366 F) at the 0.1-bar pressure level. 
The atmosphere of Uranus is composed of 83% helium, 15% methane and 2% methane plus trace amounts of other gases such as ethane. The average temperature of the surface of Uranus is 49° Kelvin or -224° Celsius. What makes the planet so cold is that it has a low internal temperature. Uranus is 14.5 times bigger than Earth, making it the third largest planet in the Solar System after Jupiter and Saturn; Uranus’s core alone is as large as our planet.
How’s the temperature on Uranus? Cold. In fact, the temperature of Uranus makes it the coldest planet in the Solar System. The average temperature of the cloud tops on Uranus is 49 K (?224 °C).
