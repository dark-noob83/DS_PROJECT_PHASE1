The detailed requirements of Building regulations in England and Wales are scheduled within 14 separate headings, each designated by a letter (Part A to Part Q), and covering aspects such as structure, fire safety, access, electrical, protection from falling, drainage, and so on. The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 made provision for microgeneration to be brought within the Building Regulations, and increased to two years the time limit for prosecuting contraventions of the regulations relating to energy use, energy conservation or carbon emissions.
The Regulations came into force in April 2012 and updated earlier asbestos regulations to take account of the fact that in the European Commission’s view, the UK had not completely implemented the EU Directive on exposure to asbestos as set out in EU Directive 2009/148/EC). HSE's new cost recovery scheme known as Fee for Intervention (FFI) came into force on 1 October 2012. FFI is administered under the Health and Safety (Fees) Regulations 2012 and is used to recover HSE's costs against those who contravene health and safety laws.
New nationwide regulations have come into force as of 1st October 2010 which legislate that anyone completing re-roofing work, including replacement of flat roofs, must apply for Building Regulations approval. 
So requirements could vary from one authority to another. Scotland was the first country in the United Kingdom to adopt national regulations. The Building (Scotland) Act in 1959 created the power to do so. The first set of Building Regulations was published in 1963 and came into force in 1964. England and Wales followed suit. The Public Health Act of 1961 was the statutory instrument and the first regulations were published in 1965. 
The Regulations also specify, that some types of work must be undertaken by an appropriate qualified professional (such as works on gas or certain electrical matters), or must be notified to the relevant local authority 's Building Control department (LABC) for certification or approval. The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 made provision for microgeneration to be brought within the Building Regulations, and increased to two years the time limit for prosecuting contraventions of the regulations relating to energy use, energy conservation or carbon emissions.
3 Commencement of Acts of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish instruments: time (1) Subsection (2) applies where an Act of the Scottish Parliament or a Scottish instrument provides for the Act or instrument to come into force on a particular day. (1) Every enactment which is not expressed to come into force or operation on a particular day shall come into operation immediately on the expiration of the day before the date of the passing thereof, or, where the enactment is a statutory instrument, of the making thereof.
Legislation Regulations etc. 1.1 The main regulations are made under the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974. The current regulations are the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 (referred to as the Gas Safety Regulations) which came into force on the 31st October 1998. 
Building regulations approval is required for most building work in the UK. Building regulations that apply across England and Wales are set out in the Building Act 1984 while those that apply across Scotland are set out in the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 made provision for microgeneration to be brought within the Building Regulations, and increased to two years the time limit for prosecuting contraventions of the regulations relating to energy use, energy conservation or carbon emissions.
Building Control took on the greater role of Health and Safety through the first Public Health Act in 1875. This Act had two major revisions in 1936 and 1961, leading to the first set of national building standards, The Building Regulations 1965. On 11 November 1985, the Building Act 1984 came into force, which introduced Approved Documents with their non-prescriptive requirements. Today’s Building Regulations came into operation in October 2010. The Regulations are constantly reviewed to meet the growing demand for better, safer and more accessible buildings. Any changes necessary are brought into operation after consultation with all interested parties.
