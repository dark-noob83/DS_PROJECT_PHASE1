Say you know the start speed of a car and you know the ending speed when it crossed the finish line and you know it accellerated at a constant rate. Then by calculating average speed you actually calculate the slope of the distance time graph. that allows you to figure out distance travelled in a certain time. This only works when the accelleration is constant. then the average speed has the same value as
Average Speed. The average speed of an object tells you the (average) rate at which it covers distance. If a car's average speed is 65 miles per hour, this means that the car's position will change (on the average) by 65 miles each hour. Average speed is a rate.
One way to calculate the average speed is to use math formula for speed. Speed formula is also known as average speed formula or speed distance formula or the formula for time distance and speed. Before we calculate the speed at which the lady below is running, let's define what speed is.
Confidence votes 121. The average speed is the distance traveled divided by the time spent traveling. A car that travels 180 miles in 4 hours did so with an average speed of 180/4 = 45 miles per hour.
In order to calculate the speed of an object we must know how far it's gone and how long it took to get there. Farther and sooner correspond to faster. Let's say you drove a car from New York to Boston. The distance by road is roughly 300 km (200 miles).
