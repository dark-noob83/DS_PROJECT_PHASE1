RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a linear polymer of adenine, thymine, cytosine, and uracil that is created in the cell by a process called transcription, and it differs from DNA in several ways. First, the ribose sugars on DNA nucleotides are short one hydroxyl group compared to RNA, hence the name deoxyribonucleic acid.
mRNA. mRNA, or messenger RNA, is the link between a gene and a protein. The gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase, and the resulting mRNA travels to the cytoplasm, where it is translated by ribosomes into a protein with the help of tRNA.
Transfer Ribonucleic Acid tRNA is a nucleic acid that is involved in protein synthesis-specifically translation. When mRNA arrives in the cytoplasm, the large and small subunits of the ribosome come together and attach to the mRNA.
tRNA. tRNA, or transfer RNA, is the decoder of the mRNA message during protein translation. After transcription, tRNA is extensively modified to include nonstandard bases such as pseudouridine, inosine, and methylguanosine. By themselves, ribosomes cannot form a protein when the mRNA makes contact.
When a tRNA recognizes and binds to its corresponding codon in the ribosome, the tRNA transfers the appropriate amino acid to the end of the growing amino acid chain. Then the tRNAs and ribosome continue to decode the mRNA molecule until the entire sequence is translated into a protein. Further Exploration.
transfer RNA / tRNA. Transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) is a type of RNA molecule that helps decode a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a protein. tRNAs function at specific sites in the ribosome during translation, which is a process that synthesizes a protein from an mRNA molecule.
