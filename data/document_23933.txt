OVEN TEMPERATURES Found a recipe you want to try but, unfortunately, it only gives oven temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and you cook by gas-what is the gas mark equivalent? 
A moderate oven has a range of 180–190°C (350–375°F), and a hot oven has temperature set to 200–230°C (400–450°F). A fast oven has a range of 230–260°C (450–500°F) for the typical temperature. The various standard phrases to describe oven temperatures include words such as cool to hot or very slow to fast. For example, a cool oven has temperature set to 90°C (200°F), and a slow oven has a temperature range from 150–160°C (300–325°F).
177 degrees Celsius x 9 = 1593 1593 / 5 = 318.6 318.6 +32 = 350.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which can be rounded to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll often come across a recipe that we would love to make, but find the oven temperature listed in the recipe is not what we are used to. Here, in the United States we use Fahrenheit. How to Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. To convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, you will need to subtract 32 to the Fahrenheit temperature, multiply by 5, then divide by 9. For example, to convert 350 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius you would complete the following equation: 350 degrees Fahrenheit – 32 = 318. 318 x 5 = 1590
Oven temperatures may be quoted in degrees in Celsius (International), Fahrenheit (in Canada and USA) or by gas mark (sometimes in the UK and France). This table allows you to convert between the scales. Bold gas mark numbers are the most well-accepted matches. 
Equivalents in Fahrenheit and Celsius [edit]. Gas mark 1 is 275 ° Fahrenheit (135 ° Celsius). Oven temperatures increase by 25 °F (13.9 °C) each time the gas mark increases by 1. Below Gas Mark 1 the scale markings halve at each step, each representing a decrease of 25 °F. To convert gas mark to degrees Celsius (D), multiply the gas mark number (G) by 14, then add 121. (G × 14) + 121 = D.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Common oven temperatures (such as terms: cool oven, very slow oven, slow oven, moderate oven, hot oven, fast oven, etc.) are set to control the effects of baking in an oven, for various lengths of time. The various standard phrases to describe oven temperatures include words such as cool to hot or very slow to fast. For example, a cool oven has temperature set to 90°C (200°F), and a slow oven has a temperature range from 150–160°C (300–325°F).
If a recipe calls for a low oven, you need to set the temperature around 125 degrees Celsius. This temperature is perfect for long slow cooking, especially for tenderising tough cuts of meat. A medium oven means a temperature of around 180 degrees Celsius. This is a good temperature to choose if you are not sure of the temperature you need. This temperature will work well for everything from pies to cakes and even pasta bakes. A high oven means a temperature of around 230 degrees Celsius
For this reason, they reach around the same maximum temperatures. The maximum temperature of a home gas oven is 537.7 degrees Celsius (which the heat reached by self-cleaning ovens during the self-cleaning process). For ordinary cooking, the maximum temperature used is 287.7 degrees Celsius. For example, if a turkey were to be roasted, the temperature of the oven would range from 422 K to 450 K, whereas, for cookies, the oven temperature would need to be preheated to 464 K. Baking or broiling in an oven is considered to be dry-heat cooking. Cooking heats are generally known as dry or moist.
