50 x 24 hours/day = 1200 watts 1200 divided by 1000 = 1.2 Kwh 1.2 x 0.12 = $0.144/day $0.144/day x 30 = $4.32/month. Pretty cool...and maybe pretty scary.

The average price people in the U.S. pay for electricity is about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. (Context: A typical U.S. household uses about 908 kWh a month of electricity.). But there's huge variation from state to state. Here's a map of residential electricity prices, according to the Energy Information Administration. People in Hawaii pay the most for electricity, about 33 cents per kWh. A Hawaiian household whose electricity use was around the national average would have a monthly electric bill over $300.

So the typical US household would pay about $73 for electricity each month in Idaho
