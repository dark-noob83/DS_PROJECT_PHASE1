Unlike conventional boilers, combi-boilers don’t need a tank to store hot water, instead they heat on demand and come in gas, electric, and oil-fired versions. The cost of a new combi-boiler will vary depending upon how large your system needs to be and where you purchase it from. For instance: 1  A Vaillant combi boiler purchased straight from the producer prices between GBP725 and GBP910. This guide is going to cover the costs involved when installing various types of boilers, including combi, gas, oil and electric boilers. We’ll also give you tips for finding a boiler engineer and we will also supply you with all the information on related installation grants.
Approximate starting prices are discussed below: 1  If you are keeping the same type of boiler (e.g. if you have a existing combi boiler you are replacing it with a new combi), the price to buy and install it will start at about £1300 provided there are no real plumbing adjustments required. In addition it depends on what type of boiler you had originally and what type of boiler you are swapping to. On the whole there are two types of boiler – a regular boiler (with the hot water tank) and a combi boiler that makes hot water on demand (without a hot water tank).
Combi boiler prices, installation costs and extras. One of the common mistakes people make when considering a new boiler is to simply google ‘combi boiler prices’ – the search results would have you think a new boiler can be installed for less than £1,000. Sadly, this just isn’t the case. Add a ‘power flush’ if there happened to be sludge in the system, and you're quickly up to £1,950 – still, not bad. At the other end of the spectrum, however, let’s say you have a large home and are switching to a combi boiler in a new position. The boiler will cost £1,500, and the install £1,100.
This might cost £700 for the boiler, £600 for the installation, and another £150 for a magnetic filter, bringing the total to £1,450 – about as cheap an install as you're likely to get. Add a ‘power flush’ if there happened to be sludge in the system, and you're quickly up to £1,950 – still, not bad. At the other end of the spectrum, however, let’s say you have a large home and are switching to a combi boiler in a new position. The boiler will cost £1,500, and the install £1,100. A power flush with lots of radiators might be £700, extra pipe work £300, a new thermostat £200, and a magnetic filter £150
The cost for replacing a standard gas boiler is about $4,000. A high-efficiency model costs about $7,500. This cost estimate usually includes removal and disposal of the old unit, as well as all necessary lines, ducts and wiring needed for the new system to run properly. If you have a boiler installed or replaced, you might pay anywhere between $3,111 and $7,204. On average, homeowners tend to pay $5,100. These prices are highly dependent on the type of boiler you choose.
Replacing an existing gas condensing combi boiler in the same position as the previous one. This job involves removing and disposing of the old boiler before installing the new one. Expect to pay Around £540 - £660. If your heating system is very old, it may need a mechanical flush-which costs around £510. This may need to be removed or replaced to fit the new boiler. Expect to pay Around £640 to £770. Moving pipes will add around £200 to £300 to the cost. Very old systems may require a mechanical flush before installation-this
1 Replacing an old oil-fired boiler with a gas model can cost thousands of dollars more than replacing one oil-fired unit with another, because of the need to install new gas lines and to update the existing fittings, valves, piping system and other parts to work with the new boiler. 1 Installing a standard boiler (80%-85% annual fuel utilization efficiency) typically costs about $2,500-$5,000 for a gas-fired model and $3,000-$6,500 for an oil-fired unit (generally used in areas without municipal gas lines).

Compare the cost of the repair to the cost of replacing. A repair averages between $300 and $500 for most common issues. A replacement can cost between $3,000 and $5,000 for the new equipment installation, inspections and removing the old system. If you have a boiler installed or replaced, you might pay anywhere between $3,111 and $7,204. On average, homeowners tend to pay $5,100.
