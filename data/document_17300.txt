Deutsche Bank sees substantial room for improvement over the longer term in cost per watt terms – from $0.50/w to $0.20/w – as solar gains mainstream acceptance, is recognized as a cost competitive source of electricity, and companies develop new/improved methods to interact with customers. The cost of production today. Deutsche notes that total module costs of leading Chinese solar companies have decreased from around $1.31 a watt in 2011 to around $0.50/W in 2014. It says this was primarily due to the reduction in processing costs, the fall in polysilicon costs and improvement in conversion efficiencies.
The U.S. DOE SunShot Initiative, which has the aim of reducing the all-in cost of solar power to less than $1 per watt, counts on module costs of less than 50 cents per watt. Prof. Mike McGehee of Stanford University doesn't hold the view that silicon can achieve these costs. 
An $18,000 system ($12,600 after the tax credit) that produces 3800 kWh a year in a windy place with 12mph avg. windspeed will produce 76,000 kWh over its 20-year life, for a cost of $0.17 per kWh. That's much more than grid energy, and way more than solar. Then multiply that by the peak output of your panel, then by the number of days per month. For example, for a panel rated at 150 watts in New York, we'd have: 4 hours peak sun x 150 watts panel x 30.5 days per month 1000 kWh/watt-hour = 18.3 kWh/mo.
Sources: Naked solar panels (2014) are about 82 per watt ($820 per kWp). (EcoBusiness and PV Insights). Installation costs (labor, inverter, wiring, permitting) are about $4 per watt. (TechnologyReview and SolarPower.org) Total installed cost from Dovetail Solar ($3.66), LBL ($5.30). Then multiply that by the peak output of your panel, then by the number of days per month. For example, for a panel rated at 150 watts in New York, we'd have: 4 hours peak sun x 150 watts panel x 30.5 days per month 1000 kWh/watt-hour = 18.3 kWh/mo.
When comparing price per watt, capacity factor should be considered in the overall cost comparison. For instance; if the cost of solar is $1 per watt, when including an average capacity factor of approximately 20%, this cost rises to $5 per watt when compared to a hypothetical source that produces energy consistently. Installation costs [edit]. Coal power plants are generally one of the least expensive sources of electricity by this measure, at a construction cost around $2.10 a watt.
Production costs for industry-leading Chinese crystalline-silicon (c-Si) PV module manufacturers -- such as Jinko Solar, Renesola, Trina Solar and Yingli Green Energy -- will fall from 50 cents per watt in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 36 cents per watt by the end of 2017, according to a new report from GTM Research. 
The chart at the left shows the average cost of electricity for 2014 by consumer group per the EIA (the US Energy Information Administration). For 2014 the average residential cost was 12.50 cents per kilo-watt hour up 3.1% from 2013. Commercial was 10.75 cents and industrial 7.01 cents. At $2 per watt, it is cheaper after year 40. At $3.00 per watt, it is cheaper about year 80. It is expected that PV solar costs will reach conventional coal parity by 2017. As a result, no new coal plants are expected to be initiated, although some current coal plants will likely be upgraded.
In addition, costs for fossil fuels may creep up due to raw material costs, shipping costs, and possibly carbon dioxide taxes. At an installed price of $1.25 per watt, the cost of PV solar is always cheaper than coal. At $2 per watt, it is cheaper after year 40. At $3.00 per watt, it is cheaper about year 80. It is expected that PV solar costs will reach conventional coal parity by 2017. As a result, no new coal plants are expected to be initiated, although some current coal plants will likely be upgraded.
