Setting Limits. The American Heart Association recommends limiting your sodium intake to less than 2,000 milligrams per day. And this may be easier said than done, due to the amount of sodium found in processed and canned foods. Frozen foods can even contain high amounts of sodium in an effort to keep them fresh longer. 
It's clear that Americans have a taste for salt. But salt plays a role in the development of high blood pressure. Everyone, including kids, should maintain a sodium intake of less than 2300 mg, or about 1 teaspoon, of sodium a day. Adults aged 51 and older, African-Americans, and individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease should reduce their sodium intake to no more than 1500 mg a day. 
Amount. The recommended amount of sodium that you should consume in a day depends on your age. Children ages 2 to 3 need 1,000 mg of sodium a day. That amount increases to 1,200 mg a day from ages 4 to 8 and 1,500 mg from 9 to 18. Adults need 2,300 mg of sodium a day, which is equal to about a teaspoon of salt.
If you are a healthy adult, your daily recommended sodium intake should be 2,300 milligrams per day, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. However, if you have a chronic condition, such as hypertension, kidney disease or diabetes, you should consume less sodium per day -- 1,500 milligrams per day. This is the recommended intake for those at higher risk of high blood pressure, including African-Americans and those older than age 50. This is the reason why your weight can fluctuate on a daily basis -- you are flushing sodium out, which can help you to lose “water” weight. For example, if you reduced your sodium intake to a low amount -- between 1,000 and 1,500 milligrams per day -- you would lose about 1.25 pounds. Consuming the recommended sodium levels each day ensures you do not retain excess water
Aim for 2,300 milligrams of sodium or less per day. Evidence shows that consuming too much sodium can raise blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can also lead to heart disease, kidney disease and congestive heart failure. If you are African American, age 51 or older or have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic disease, that recommendation is lowered to 1,500 milligrams per day. Average American consumption of sodium is close to 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day.
Recommended intake of sodium. It is recommended that people over the age of one year eat between 1000-1500 mg sodium per day. This is referred to as the Adequate Intake (AI) . People aged 14 and over should not eat more than 2300 mg sodium per day. This is referred to the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). A sodium intake above 2300 mg per day is likely to pose a health risk. 
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 [PDF-2.9M] recommend that everyone age 2 and up should consume less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium each day. Some groups of people should further limit sodium intake to 1,500 mg per day, including: 1  Adults age 51 or older. 2  All African Americans. 
Most Americans will benefit from a lower sodium diet. Look for foods that have fewer than 200 milligrams of sodium per serving. Look for low sodium on the food label; this means the food has fewer than 140 milligrams of sodium per serving. Eat more fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium. If you are African American, age 51 or older or have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic disease, that recommendation is lowered to 1,500 milligrams per day. Average American consumption of sodium is close to 3,400 milligrams of sodium per day.
Most Canadians consume far more sodium than is needed. The recommended amount per day is between 1500 mg (considered adequate intake) and 2300 mg (upper amount) for people 9 -50 years of age. For people over 50 years of age, an adequate intake drops to 1300 mg per day until 70 and then 1200 mg over 70 years of age.
