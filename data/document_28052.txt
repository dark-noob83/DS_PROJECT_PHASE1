Male urinary system. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra. Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than men are.
Bacteria growing in the bladder or urethra cause bladder infections. The urethra is the tube that takes urine out of your body. Anyone can get a bladder infection, but they’re more common in women than men or children. Bladder infections are also called urinary tract infections (UTIs).
A bladder infection is also known as cystitis, and is commonly referred to as a urinary tract infection (UTI) . When bacteria enters the urinary tract via the urethra, sometimes it moves up into the bladder, where it can multiply and cause an infection.
Bladder infections are known as cystitis or inflammation of the bladder. They are common in women, but very rare in men. More than half of all women get at least one bladder infection at some time in their lives.
Bladder infections are a type of infection of the urinary tract. Typically, bacteria cause infections in the urinary tract. You develop a bladder infection when bacteria or other minute organisms latch onto the walls of the urethra and begin to grow, flourish and reproduce.
Symptoms of bladder infections may include: 1  A burning sensation when urinating; this is the most common sign of a bladder infection. 2  Frequent urge to urinate. 3  Passing only small amounts of urine at a time despite the urge to urinate. 4  Urine that is cloudy or bloody with a strong, foul odor. 5  Bladder spasm.
