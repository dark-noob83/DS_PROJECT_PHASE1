The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. This protein functions as a channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes.
Cystic fibrosis occurs when someone inherits a mutant form of a key gene present in the lungs and in many other tissues—the gene CFTR, which is an acronym for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a protein that was discovered in the late 1980s.
CFTR is an enormous integral membrane protein with about 1,500 amino acids and a complicated structure that spans the cell membrane multiple times in specialized epithelial cells. These form in the lining of the lungs, kidneys, and other tissues that produce mucous, sweat, tears, saliva, and other bodily secretions.
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) affects the exocrine glands, which are organs that secrete mucus. Exocrine glands normally produce thin, slippery secretions such as mucus, sweat, tears and digestive juices. With cystic fibrosis, the mucus is thick and sticky.
Causes. In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat. Many different defects can occur in the gene.
Cystic fibrosis is one the most common genetic childhood disease in the United States, says Balch, who is a member of the Department of Cell Biology and the Institute for Childhood and Neglected Diseases at Scripps Research.
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder which affects the lungs and pancreas. It causes the lungs to get clogged with mucus, which in turn makes the lungs a breeding ground for … bacteria. In the pancreas, it blocks the pancreas from absorbing enzymes, which makes its victims prone to malnutrition.
