Simple sugars, which are medically referred to as monosaccharides, are basic units of carbohydrates and the simplest form of sugar. Simple sugars are normally water-soluble, colorless, crystalline, and at times have a sweet taste.
Picture 1. Monosaccharide examples: glucose, fructose and galactose. Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates. They can join together and form complex carbohydrates, for example: 2 monosaccharides form disaccharides, 3-10 of them form oligosaccharides and 11 or more of them form polysaccharides.
Simple Sugars. Simple sugars as the name suggest are the simplest form of carbohydrates that acts as the primary source of energy for the human body. This also indicates that the metabolism is fast and does not require a lot of enzymes, hormones or neurotransmitters.
Examples of Simple sugars. Simple sugars. Simple sugars, also called simple carbohydrates, are found in refined sugars like table sugar. Sweets like cookies, cakes and candy are high in simple sugars. These types of simple sugars do not provide vitamins, minerals or fiber and the calories that they provide are considered empty calories.
Processed foods often have simple or refined sugars added to improve flavor. Examples of refined-sugar foods include candy, cakes, syrups, fruit juices, regular carbonated beverages, ready-to-eat cereals and various condiments.
Once digested, simple sugars are broken down by enzymes into glucose, the form of sugar that your body can convert directly into energy. Simple sugars -- as opposed to complex carbohydrates such as whole-grain foods, vegetables and fruit â€“ are quickly converted into blood glucose.
Human body has a remarkable capacity to convert all complex carbohydrates and other simple carbohydrates into glucose with the action of enzymes. Human body can also convert amino-acids and lipids into glucose that can be used as the cellular fuel to generate energy.
