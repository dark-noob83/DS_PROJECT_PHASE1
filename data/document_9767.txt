On the higher heat, cook the steaks for three to four minutes, flipping once. Move them to a low-heat section of the grill and cook for five to eight minutes more, flipping once, depending on how well done you prefer your steak. This will give you a medium steak. Grill less on low heat for a rarer steak and longer on the high heat for a more well-done steak.
