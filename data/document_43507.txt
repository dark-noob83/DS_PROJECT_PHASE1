If the previous solutions listed here on our website are not for you, use the following dishwasher soap recipe to make dishwashing detergent with enough phosphorous to clean your dishes properly. What you’re doing here is adding phosphate to soap so that it’s more effective.
Not being able to find any phosphate containing dishwasher detergent at any grocery store, I decided to make my own. Heres how: 1. Buy a large 7.5 pound bottle of gel type dishwasher detergent. 2. Dump in a bucket and add one-half of a one pound box of TSP.
