Passionate about all things Australian. Galahs are prey. They are not predators of any other creature. Galahs are herbivorous and eat seeds of both native plants and cultivated crops. They often feed on seed that has fallen to the ground. However, they also like to nibble on sweet native flowers such as callistemons (bottlebrush) and grevilleas, and on gumnuts. A typical toucan's diet consists mainly of fruit. However, toucans are known to eat small snakes and … lizards, insects, and the eggs and nestlings of other small birds as part of their diet. Toucans are the prey of larger predatory birds such as hawks as well as predator cats such as the jaguar.

Eye colour-Young birds have a dark brown iris, similar to the males mature eye colour. Adult eye colour is attained at about 2-3 years of age although female galahs irises start to lighten up as young as 6 months of age. The iris is dark brown to black in most males, pinkish red to reddish-brown in females. Note: eye colour is usually correct in galahs for determining sex. The nest hollows are anywhere from 2 meters-20 meters (6.5 feet- 65.5 feet) above the ground. Nesting holes are usually at least 10 meters apart. Unfortunately there is now a decline of available nest hollows and this could threaten most species, even the common galah, as new pairs search for hollows.
