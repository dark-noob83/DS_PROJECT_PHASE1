Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is a congenital or acquired disorder that results in the improper closing of the soft palate muscle in the mouth (the velopharyngeal sphincter) during speech. Because this sphincter does not close properly, air escapes through the nose instead of the mouth.
Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) can be caused by a variety of disorders (structural, genetic, functional or acquired) and is very often associated with a cleft palate. Abnormal physiological separation of the oropharynx from the nasopharynx can lead to VPI and hypernasality.
Velopharyngeal insufficiency or VPI is the inability of the velum (the soft palate) and related anatomy to close the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx separates the oral and nasal cavities and is used to make the sounds of consonants during speech.
velopharyngeal insufficiency inadequate velopharyngeal closure, due to a condition such as cleft palate or muscular dysfunction, resulting in defective speech.
Commonly referred to as hypernasality, velopharyngeal insufficiency or VPI is a resonance disorder (how the cavities of the mouth and nose effect the way speech sounds) that results from too much air moving through the nose during speech. This is caused by insufficient structure or function of the soft palate.
Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) is a term used to describe disorders characterized by the abnormal function of the velopharyngeal valve, including velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The velopharyngeal valve includes the soft palate as well as the pharynx and the side and back walls of the throat.
Velopharyngeal insufficiency is the improper closing of the velopharyngeal sphincter (soft palate muscle) during speech characterized by an acute nasal quality of the voice.
