The prostaglandins (PG) are a group of physiologically active lipid compounds having diverse hormone-like effects in animals. Prostaglandins have been found in almost every tissue in humans and other animals. They are derived enzymatically from fatty acids. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are a subclass of eicosanoids and form the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives.
Specific prostaglandins are named with a letter (which indicates the type of ring structure) followed by a number (which indicates the number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon structure). For example, prostaglandin E1 is abbreviated PGE1 or PGE 1, and prostaglandin I2 is abbreviated PGI2 or PGI 2. Prostaglandins have been found in almost every tissue in humans and other animals. They are derived enzymatically from fatty acids. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are a subclass of eicosanoids and form the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives.
Prostaglandins are produced by cell membranes of many tissues and are found in the vasculature. However, the metabolic degradation of prostaglandins is rapid and their significance as circulatory hormones has not been clarified. Yet it is clear that prostaglandins have important physiological activity and it is possible that the effects of prostaglandins are mediated by paracrine or autocrine mechanisms.
Prostaglandins. Prostaglandins, are a group of lipid mediators, found and isolated from human semen in the 1930s by Ulf von Euler of Sweden, responsible for inflammation features, such as swelling, pain, stiffness, redness and warmth. Sunderland, Mass: Sinauer Associates , hormone prostaglandins play an important role in numbers of physiological effects, including the function of regulating the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue, by ligating a sub-family of cell surface seven-transmembrane receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors.
They control processes such as inflammation, blood flow, the formation of blood clots and the induction of labour. Alternative names for prostaglandins Prostaglandin D2; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2; prostaglandin I2 (which is also known as prostacyclin); a closely related lipid called thromboxane. Prostaglandins are known to regulate the female reproductive system, and are involved in the control of ovulation, the menstrual cycle and the induction of labour. Indeed, manufactured forms of prostaglandins-prostaglandin E 2 and F 2 can be used to induce (kick-start) labour.
The prostaglandins (PGs), a group of local hormones that are synthesized and released immediately by most cells in the body, influence a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological actions. This article looks at points at which they participate in stress and contribute to the pathology of the response as a whole. Prostaglandins (PGs). A family of hormones whose chemical structure is identical, except for small changes in the pentane ring; these differences provide the distinguishing nomenclature (prostaglandin D, E, F, and I and thromboxane A).
Prostaglandin D 2; prostaglandin E 2; prostaglandin F 2; prostaglandin I 2 (which is also known as prostacyclin); a closely related lipid called thromboxane. Unlike most hormones, the prostaglandins are not secreted from a gland to be carried in the bloodstream and work on specific areas around the body. Prostaglandins are known to regulate the female reproductive system, and are involved in the control of ovulation, the menstrual cycle and the induction of labour. Indeed, manufactured forms of prostaglandins-prostaglandin E 2 and F 2 can be used to induce (kick-start) labour.
Prostaglandins as hormones. Shimizu N, Nakamura T. In recent years, the concept of a hormone has been greatly changed, and the term 'cybernin' is used to describe a substance which possesses not only endocrine activity but also has autocrine and paracrine effects. However, the metabolic degradation of prostaglandins is rapid and their significance as circulatory hormones has not been clarified. Yet it is clear that prostaglandins have important physiological activity and it is possible that the effects of prostaglandins are mediated by paracrine or autocrine mechanisms.
Prostaglandins differ from endocrine hormones in that they are not produced at a specific site but in many places throughout the human body. Prostaglandins have two derivatives: prostacyclins and thromboxanes. Prostacyclins are powerful locally acting vasodilators and inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets. Prostaglandins have been found in almost every tissue in humans and other animals. They are derived enzymatically from fatty acids. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are a subclass of eicosanoids and form the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives.
Prostaglandin: One of a number of hormone-like substances that participate in a wide range of body functions such as the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle, the dilation and constriction of blood vessels, control of blood pressure, and modulation of inflammation.
