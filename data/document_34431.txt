StorageTek Virtual Storage Manager. InfiniBand is a type of communications link for data flow between processors and I/O devices that offers throughput of up to 2.5 gigabytes per second and support for up to 64,000 addressable devices.
InfiniBand is widely deployed in High Performance Computing (HPC) environment. I have written this article by referring to few sites, published research papers and white papers. This post is just a collation of information. Links to referenced websites and papers are at the end of this post.
Figure 1. InfiniBand System Fabric InfiniBand is backed by top companies in the industry, including the steering committee mem-bers: Compaq, Dell, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun. In total, there are more than 220 members of the InfiniBa nd Trade Association.

Cisco Storage Area Network (SAN) Fundamentals. InfiniBand is a high-performance, multi-purpose network architecture based on a switch design often called a switched fabric.. InfiniBand (IB for short) was designed for use in I/O networks such as storage area networks (SAN) or in cluster networks. It has become a leading standard in high-performance computing. Over 200 of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers use InfiniBand, more than are using Gigabit Ethernet.
With InfiniBand, data is transmitted in packet s that together form a communication called a message. A message can be a remote direct memory access (RDMA) read or write operation, a channel send or receive message, a reversible transaction-based operation or a multicast transmission.
