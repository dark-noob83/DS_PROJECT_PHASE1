BUT (and this is a very important but) because it is capable of parsing so much more, it quite often fails to parse Node.js dependencies, as they (probably) conflict with some other syntax it is capable of parsing.
IntelliJ IDEA vs WebStorm features. IntelliJ IDEA remains JetBrains' flagship product and IntelliJ IDEA provides full JavaScript support along with *all* other features of WebStorm via bundled or downloadable plugins. The only thing missing is the simplified project setup.
WebStorm & PhpStorm are IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) built on top of JetBrains IntelliJ platform and narrowed for web development.

JetBrains WebStorm is a commercial IDE for JavaScript, CSS & HTML built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA platform. WebStorm is a specialized version of PhpStorm, offering a subset of its features. WebStorm ships with pre-installed JavaScript plugins (such as for Node.js), which are available for PhpStorm as well at no cost.
WebStormâ€™s smart code editor provides first-class support for JavaScript, Node.js, HTML and CSS, as well as their modern successors. Take advantage of code completion, error detection, refactoring and more! Use a powerful debugger for JavaScript and Node.js. Efficiently trace and profile your code with spy-js. Run unit tests with Karma or Mocha. All of that right in the IDE! Thanks to integration with tools like Grunt task runner, Bower and npm, you can minimize the use of the command line. But any time you need Terminal, it's also available as an IDE tool window. A unified UI for working with Git, SVN, Mercurial or other VCS is a real timesaver.
