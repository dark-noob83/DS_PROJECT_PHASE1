An insulator is a material or method that restricts the transfer of either heat or electricity. Insulators are used to protect us from the dangerous effects of electricity flowing through conductors. Insulators are materials that have just the opposite effect on the flow of electrons.
Metal is a good thermal conductor, while plastic is a poor thermal conductor. An insulator is a material that does not allow a transfer of electricity or energy. Materials that are poor thermal conductors can also be described as being good thermal insulators.
Thermal insulation provides a region of insulation in which thermal conduction is reduced or thermal radiation is reflected rather than absorbed by the lower-temperature body. The insulating capability of a material is measured with thermal conductivity (k) .
A thermal insulator functions by reducing the rate heat that can move through an area. The rate of conductive heat transfer is proportional to the thermal conductivity. For example, copper transfers heat quickly because of its high-thermal conductivity. A good insulator, therefore, has low
A thermal conductor is a material that allows energy in the form of heat, to be transferred within the material, without any movement of the material itself. An easy way to understand this concept is through a simple demonstration. Which material is the better insulator.
A thermal insulator is something that prevents heat from moving from one place to another. There are 3 main ways that heat can travel: convection, conduction, and radiation. Typically the phrase 'thermal insulator' refers to a material that blocks conduction.

In other words, thermal insulation can keep an enclosed area such as a building warm, or it can keep the inside of a container cold. Heat is transferred by from one material to another by conduction, convection and/or radiation. Insulators are used to minimize that transfer of heat energy. In home insulation, the R-value is an indication of how well a material insulates.
