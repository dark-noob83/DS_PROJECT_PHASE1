The ophthalmopathy tends to worsen with smoking. The dermopathy of Graves' disease is a rare, painless, reddish lumpy skin rash that of Graves' disease is an autoimmune process. It is caused by thyroid-stimulating antibodies which bind to and activate the thyrotropin receptor on thyroid cells. Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. There are three components to Graves' disease: 1  Hyperthyroidism (the presence of too much thyroid hormone), 2  Ophthalmopathy specifically involving exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs),
Graves' disease: Generalized diffuse overactivity (toxicity) of the entire thyroid gland which becomes enlarged into a goiter. Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. There are three components to Graves' disease: 1  Hyperthyroidism (the presence of too much thyroid hormone), 2  Ophthalmopathy specifically involving exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs), 3  Dermopathy with skin lesions

The thyroid autoimmune condition Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is associated with other autoimmune diseases, including vitiligo (white patches of skin) and alopecia areata (hair loss in which there are round bald patches). With thyroid hormone replacement, the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism gradually return to normal. Some patients may continue to have mildly dry skin even when blood tests indicate their thyroid hormone levels are optimal.
Hashimoto's thyroiditis, atrophic thyroiditis, and postpartum thyroiditis are all autoimmune diseases of the thyroid. An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own healthy cells. Side Effects of Overdosing. Overdosing can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism. A patient with too much thyroid hormone in the blood is at an increased risk for abnormal heart rhythms, rapid heartbeat, heart failure, and possibly a heart attack if the patient has underlying heart disease.
You might not notice signs or symptoms of Hashimoto's disease at first, or you may notice a swelling at the front of your throat (goiter). Hashimoto's disease typically progresses slowly over years and causes chronic thyroid damage, leading to a drop in thyroid hormone levels in your blood. The signs and symptoms are mainly those of an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include: 1  Fatigue and sluggishness. 2  Increased sensitivity to cold. 3  Constipation. 4  Pale, dry skin. 5  A puffy face. 6  Hoarse voice.
Chronic hives are defined as hives that last more than six weeks or hives that go away, but recur frequently. In most cases of chronic hives, a cause is never clearly identified. In some cases, chronic hives may be related to an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as thyroid disease or lupus. While the underlying cause of chronic hives is usually not identified, treatment can help with symptoms. 
Hypothyroidism. Whatever its cause— iodine deficiency, autoimmune disease, treatment of hyperthyroidism or medications—the skin signs of inadequate thyroid hormone are similar. The signs are rather non-specific, often subtle, and easily confused with other conditions or normality. With thyroid hormone replacement, the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism gradually return to normal. Some patients may continue to have mildly dry skin even when blood tests indicate their thyroid hormone levels are optimal.
Thyroid and hives are closely related in about 10% of all hives cases. Some people with chronic hives have a high level of anti-thyroid antibodies in their system, which can cause a hives rash. Remember that hives are caused by the body’s immune system thinking there is an allergen present.
