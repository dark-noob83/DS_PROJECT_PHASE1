There is no animal alive today that truly fits the description of cold-blooded. Reptiles, insects, fish and all other so called cold-blooded animals (basically anything that is not a bird or mammal) are actually quite capable of controling their body temperatures. They do it through a process known as thermoregulation.
Reptiles do not maintain their own body temperature within a narrow range like mammals and birds, so controlling their environmental temperature is critical for normal activity and good health. Reptiles are poikilothermic-which means that their body temperature alters with the surrounding environmental temperature. The reason for this is that they do not generate and maintain body heat internally, but rely on external heat sources-ie they are ectothermic creatures-hence the common description cold-blooded.
Animals are either cold-or warm-blooded. Cold-blooded animals' bodies are the same temperature as the air around them; warm-blooded animals' bodies maintain a regular temperature despite the air temperature. Mammals and birds are warm-blooded; snakes, lizards, other reptiles, fish and insects are cold-blooded.
Thermoregulation is the act of regulating one's body temperature. This term is usually reserved for animals, such as reptiles, that maintain their body temperatures through external means. Reptiles and other cold-bloods accomplish this by moving to different areas of their environment to warm up or cool down.
Snakes, being cold-blooded, do not shiver or put on more fat or fur to remain warm and alive during colder temperatures like warm-blooded creatures do. The sun's warmth plays a large part in keeping their bodies at the ideal temperature, as does their ability to slow down their metabolism and other body systems.
