The temperature on the moon varies from -387 Fahrenheit (-233 Celsius), at night, to 253 Fahrenheit (123 Celsius) during the day. Because the moon has no atmosphere to block some of the sun's rays or to help trap heat at night, its temperature varies greatly between day and night.

The average daytime temperature on the Moon is around 107°C (225°F), but can be as high as 123°C (253°F).
View full size image. Temperatures on the moon are very hot in the daytime, about 100 degrees C. At night, the lunar surface gets very cold, as cold as minus 173 degrees C. This wide variation is because Earth’s moon has no atmosphere to hold in heat at night or prevent the surface from getting so hot during the day.

There is no significant atmosphere on the moon, so it cannot trap heat or insulate the surface. The moon rotates on its axis in about 27 days. Daytime on one side of the moon lasts about 13 and a half days, followed by 13 and a half nights of darkness. When sunlight hits the moon's surface, the temperature can reach 253 degrees F (123 C). The dark side of the moon can have temperatures dipping to minus 243 F (minus 153 C). LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment surface temperature map of the south polar region of the Moon.
