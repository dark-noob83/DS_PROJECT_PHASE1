Each lung is divided into lobes; the right lung consists of the superior, middle, and inferior lobes, while the left lung consists of only the superior and inferior lobes. Note that both lungs contain an inferior lobe, and it is roughly a similar size to the superior lobe within each lung.
The right lung has three lung lobes: These are separated from each other by the interlobular fissures. One of these fissures, the oblique fissure, separates the inferior lobe of the lung from the middle and superior lobes. This fissure corresponds closely with the fissure in the left lung.
Lobes of the Lungs. Right Lung There are three lobes in the right lung: 1) right upper lobe, (2) right middle lobe, and (3) right lower lobe. The right upper lobe occupies the upper 1/3 of the right lung. The right middle lobe is typically the smallest of the three, and appears triangular in shape, being narrowest near the hilum. The right lower lobe is the largest of all three lobes, separated from the others by the major fissure.
The right upper lobe is one of the largest lobes of the lungs and is located on the anterior surface of the chest, taking up most of the space here. On the other hand, the inferior right lobe is primarily located towards the posterior surface of the chest and very little is projected onto the anterior chest.
Lobes of the Lungs. Lungs are divided into right lung and left lung. Right lung has three lobes whereas left lung has only two lobes. However, all the lobes help in the exchange of gases and aid breathing. Get detailed information in the following article.
