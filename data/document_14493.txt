The importance and many functions of the gut and gut flora. Your body is the host to over 100 trillion bacteria, most of them in your gut and you have way, way more bacteria in your body than human cells. In this sense, we could say that we are more bacteria than human.
The GI tract is also known as the gut. Trillions of bacteria and tiny organisms, called flora, live there. In fact, the flora make up about 60% of our feces. Three main types of flora live in the gut: 1  beneficial flora. 2  opportunistic flora. 3  transitional flora.
Beneficial flora is made up of beneficial or good bacteria also called probiotic. They are the housekeepers of the gut, without them your gut cannot be healthy. These bacteria fulfil a myriad of vital functions in the body.
Like other complex ecosystems, the intestinal microflora is relatively stable over time, maintaining roughly constant numbers and types of bacteria in each area of the bowel. The stability of normal flora both discourages infection by exogenous pathogens and prevents overgrowth of potentially pathogenic members.
1 Research shows that your gut flora can affect numerous processes in your body, including your metabolism, energy production, nutrition, and genetic expression. 2  Your intestinal microflora is unique, although you will likely have one of three general “communities” of bacteria.
The digestive system is home to trillions of micro organisms colonising the gut making an amazing ecosystem all living together in harmony called the gut flora. A healthy adult has about 2kg of these bacteria in the gut.
