Seeds of different species are stratified at different temperatures and for different periods of time. Some need periods of cold temperatures, between 34 and 41 degrees Fahrenheit, while some need warm stratification at 68 to 84 degrees. The ginkgo is a deciduous gymnosperm, more closely related to the pine than an oak tree. The ginkgo or maidenhair tree (Ginkgo biloba) is a living fossil. The earliest known fossil leaves of the ginkgo are 270 million years old.
In the wild, seed dormancy is usually overcome by the seed spending time in the ground through a winter period and having its hard seed coat softened up by frost and weathering action. By doing so the seed is undergoing a natural form of stratification or pretreatment. Typically, temperatures must be between 1°C and 5°C (34°F and 41°F). The term can be traced to at least 1664 in Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber, Vol. II. where seeds were layered (stratified) between layers of moist soil and exposing these strata to winter conditions.
Remove the seeds that have started to sprout. Plant those seeds either in the ground or in pots. After eight weeks, plant any seeds that remain in the bag. There is some disagreement about the exact timing and necessity of the cold treatment, but 12 weeks of cold treatment seems to delay germination rather than help it.

Definition: Stratification is a means of simulating the chilling and warming that seeds would endure if left outdoors in their native climate, for the winter. Some seeds will stay dormant until triggered by a certain amount of time in cold temperature or warm, damp conditions.
Stratifying Ginseng Seed is necessary to insure the highest germination rates. Ginseng seed will lie dormant for 19-21 months before they will sprout for the first time. This means that they will need to be stored for a year before they are ready to be planted the fall after stratification. Now many experienced growers will say that it is best to stratify your ginseng seeds in the same locations that they will be planted. The soil content and moisture levels that are ideal for ginseng growth also tend to produce the best germination rates from
Seed packets usually list if seeds need to be cold-stratified and for how long, and if seeds need moisture. For example, some native prairie flowers can be dry-stratified. If you’ve saved seeds from your own plants, in general, most perennials need eight weeks below 40 degrees Fahrenheit to break seed dormancy. Some tree seeds require one to four months to cold stratify
Any seeds that are indicated as needing a period of warm stratification followed by cold stratification should be subjected to the same measures, but the seeds should additionally be stratified in a warm area first, followed by the cold period in a refrigerator later. Typically, temperatures must be between 1°C and 5°C (34°F and 41°F). The term can be traced to at least 1664 in Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber, Vol. II. where seeds were layered (stratified) between layers of moist soil and exposing these strata to winter conditions.
In horticulture, stratification is the process of treating stored or collected seed prior to sowing to simulate natural winter conditions that a seed must endure before germination. Some seed species undergo an embryonic dormancy phase, and generally will not sprout until this dormancy is broken. Typically, temperatures must be between 1°C and 5°C (34°F and 41°F). The term can be traced to at least 1664 in Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber, Vol. II. where seeds were layered (stratified) between layers of moist soil and exposing these strata to winter conditions.
Or, you may have no germination at all. The term stratification, is derived from the age old practice of stimulating seed to germinate by placing alternate layers of a moist media and seed. This media may be sand, vermiculite, perlite, peat, composted bark, sawdust, or potting media. If you have purchased seeds from us, the proper type of stratification is listed on the seed package with brief details of that process. Reading through the following text should give you a better understanding of the required process. Warm-moist. Seeds from trees and shrubs that ripen their seeds in the early fall, as a rule, require a warm moist treatment to induce germination. Cool-moist. Seeds that ripen in the late fall or early winter, as a rule, require a cool moist treatment.
