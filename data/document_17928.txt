and Disney did a great job of entertaining and feeding resort guests while waiting it out, and keeping us informed of what would re-open when.[/quote]. Master Yoda said: ↑. The longest that the parks have ever been closed due to a hurricane was 2 days. This was in 1999 for Floyd if memory serves me correctly. I also believe they closed for Charley, Francis and Ivan. Charley was the worst hit to the parks.
Best day at Disney world was when we evacuated from Tampa to Orlando for Hurricane Charlie. Of course the storm came to Disney instead of Tampa, and the parks closed early. But the morning before they closed early, the MK was practically deserted.
Last year, the Disney theme parks at Walt Disney World closed for several days through the hurricane season when major hurricanes such as Hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne created major devastation across parts of Florida.
The theme parks of the Walt Disney World Resort were closed today, Monday, October 24, in preparation for the arrival of Hurricane Wilma. Although Hurricane Wilma is expected to pass about 100 miles south of Walt Disney World, it has strengthened as it approached Southeast Florida.
The closure today of Walt Disney World’s parks for Hurricane Wilma is the first for the resort this year. Guests will remain in their hotel rooms, and as with last year, extra entertainment will be provided in the hotel gathering areas, with characters, movies, and other activities.
