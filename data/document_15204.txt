Inflammation of the pancreas (or pancreatitis) often progresses rapidly in dogs, but can often be treated without any permanent damage to the organ. However, if pancreatitis goes long-term without treatment, severe organ, and even brain damage can occur. Pancreatitis can affect both dogs and cats. Pancreatitis in Dogs. The pancreas is part of the endocrine and digestive system, which is integral for the digestion of foods, producing the enzymes that digest food, and producing insulin.
The pancreas is a vital organ that lies on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the stomach. The pancreas produces enzymes to assist in food digestion and hormones such as insulin, which regulates blood sugar or glucose metabolism. When the pancreas becomes inflamed, the condition is called pancreatitis. Pancreatitis occurs commonly in the dog. There is no age, sex, or breed predisposition. Acute pancreatitis may either take a mild, edematous form or a more severe, hemorrhagic form. The associated inflammation allows digestive enzymes from the pancreas to spill into the abdominal cavity resulting in secondary damage to the liver, bile ducts, gall bladder, and intestines
Canine Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that can occur in two very different forms. Acute pancreatitis is sudden while chronic pancreatitis is characterized by recurring or persistent form of pancreatic inflammation. Cases of both can be considered mild or severe. Pancreatitis is caused by autodigestion of the pancreas thought to begin with an increase in secretion of pancreatic enzymes in response to a stimulus, which can be anything from table scraps to getting into the garbage to drugs, toxins, and trauma.
Acute Pancreatitis in Dogs. Acute pancreatitis is a more severe form of the ailment, which can cause excessive pain in the dog’s abdomen, vomiting and even shock. One type of acute pancreatitis in dogs that is especially severe is fulminant necrotizing pancreatitis, which can be fatal if not treated immediately.
The pancreas is an essential part of a dog’s digestive system. It produces hormones like insulin that process sugars and proteins, as well as enzymes that help with digestion. The pancreas nestles by the stomach and has a duct that empties out where the stomach transitions into the start of the small intestine. The causes of canine pancreatitis are unclear and the symptoms are also somewhat vague and imprecise. The symptoms most frequently ascribed to pancreatitis in dogs include vomiting, abdominal pain, lack of appetite, loss of energy, dehydration, diarrhea, depression, fever, and shock.

Essentially, the dog’s digestive enzymes begin breaking down the dog’s own tissues. Pancreatitis in dogs is classified as either acute and chronic, and both kinds can be mild or severe. Acute canine pancreatitis has a sudden onset, meaning that an otherwise healthy dog can manifest signs of pancreatitis rapidly. The causes of canine pancreatitis are unclear and the symptoms are also somewhat vague and imprecise. The symptoms most frequently ascribed to pancreatitis in dogs include vomiting, abdominal pain, lack of appetite, loss of energy, dehydration, diarrhea, depression, fever, and shock.
