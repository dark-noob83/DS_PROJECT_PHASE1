Best Answer: There's a place outside my town which is a rescue that does it for $60 males and $70 females. They fixed their rescues and anyone who wants to bring their dog there just to get fixed. I would do some research through google for around your area. Type in Cheap spay/neuture and something may pop up for you. Vets are expensive but if you can't find a cheap place that does it to help prevent dogs or cats from mating then you're looking at about $200- $400 depending on your location. Also it she is in heat it is another $20. If you want her to have a pain shot, which you should, its another $15. They do have low cost spay.neuter clinics just have to look for them. So about $100 is a good guess. Source(s): dog owner for 40+yrs.
The cost depends a lot on where you go. Some shelters and low cost clinics will spay and neuter for as low as $50 or less. Other veterinary hospitals will likely charge you around $200 (give or take) for a canine neuter, and $50-100 more for a spay (as it's a more complicated procedure than a neuter). If you go to a vet it'll be around 300 dollars. Try looking into your local humane society. They usually do it for around 50-70 dollars. The spay/neuter procedure is cheaper than having to care for a whole litter of puppies. Please get it spayed/neutered.
A: Shelter euthanasia is the number one killer of companion animals. Spaying and neutering is the only way to reduce or eliminate that. It’s also better for your pet’s health. And it’s better for you because it will make your life easier if your pet is spayed or neutered. Animals can be miserable -- and make you miserable -- when they are in heat. And then there’s always the problem of what to do with the puppies. There’s also the financial side.
