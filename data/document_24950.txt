Sheriff Logo Design Tips. Keep your design simple. Many candidates for sheriff or any law enforcement position tend to use a serif font. Script lettering is more difficult read and it may not translate well to print or to signage.
Sheriff Campaign Websites. The election of a county sheriff is often decided by only a handful of votes. Even a single vote can make the difference between victory and defeat. Election campaigns for sheriff often have low voter turnout because it often occurs on dates that do not match the general election.
Keep the look consistent. Once you have a logo and you have put it to use, don’t change it later! Much of your voter branding is tied into in your logo design and colors. If you change it midway through your campaign, you’ll a lot of that branded connection.
Creating Your Sheriff Campaign Logo. Once it is designed, your sheriff campaign logo becomes the lynchpin of your campaign’s overall branding. Your logo will appear on yard signs, brochures, direct mailings, palm cards and all of your other campaign advertising. A poorly-designed logo will keep voters from taking a political candidate seriously.
Document. Start off by first creating a new document, then add in a background that will suit the badge. Here I used a small document size of 400 x 400 pixels and I also used an old wood texture I found on deviantART. Please feel free to download the texture used above, but take note that I didn’t make it.
