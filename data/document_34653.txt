Egg laying usually begins in March or April. Eggs are usually laid 30-48 hours apart. Incubation period: 28-30 days for each egg, but since incubation usually begins with the first egg, an additional one or two days is needed for each additional egg. A two-egg clutch may be incubated 30-32 days and nests with 3 eggs may be incubated for 32-34 days. 
Number of Eggs Laid: Average 2 per nest. The average for the west coast eagle populations is almost exactly 2 eggs per clutch. Eagles can lay only one egg but can also lay three eggs and there are some rare records of 4 eggs being laid. Incubation Period: 35 days. Most eagles only lay a single clutch of eggs. Each egg is laid about 3 days apart and incubation, the process of the eagles sitting on the egg to bring up the eggs' temperature, starts with the laying of the first egg. The eggs take almost precisely 35 days to hatch.

The length of a gestation period varies from bird to bird. Oftentimes, larger birds require longer gestation periods than smaller birds. For example, muscovy ducks -- one of North America's largest ducks -- require approximately 35 days for gestation, while smaller ducks have gestation periods of less than 30 days. Smaller perching birds, such as northern mockingbirds, have a gestation period of only 13 to 15 days. A smaller bird of prey, the red-tailed hawk, has a gestation period of 28 to 32 days, while the California condor needs at least 56 days for the gestating period
