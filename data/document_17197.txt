Remarks. The Route class enables you to specify how routing is processed in an ASP.NET application. You create a Route object for each URL pattern that you want to map to a class that can handle requests that correspond to that pattern. You then add the route to the Routes collection. When the application receives a request, ASP.NET routing iterates through the routes in the Routes collection to find the first route that matches the pattern of the URL. Set the Url property to a URL pattern.

ASP.NET routing enables you to use URLs that do not have to map to specific files in a Web site. Because the URL does not have to map to a file, you can use URLs that are descriptive of the user's action and therefore are more easily understood by users. In addition to matching a URL request to a route definition by the number of parameters in the URL, you can specify that values in the parameters meet certain constraints. If a URL contains values that are outside the constraints for a route, that route is not used to handle the request.
