Original Medicare also covers medical insurance, under Medicare Part B. Most Oregon Medicare beneficiaries have to pay a Medicare Part B monthly premium. Under Medicare Part B, Oregon residents receive the following services and supplies: 1  Clinical research. 2  Ambulance services. 3  Durable medical equipment.
Medicare Advantage plan members pay a premium for Part B, plus usually a premium for the Medicare Advantage plan, and co-pays or co-insurance for services. Medicare Advantage plans are not the same as Medicare supplements (Medigaps), which work only with Original Medicare.
Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, like nursing home care and personal care services.
Dual eligibility. Some people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid are called “dual eligibles.” If you have Medicare and full Medicaid coverage, most of your health care costs are likely covered. You can get your Medicare coverage through Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) . If you have Medicare and full Medicaid, you'll get your Part D prescription drugs through Medicare, and you'll automatically qualify for Extra Help paying for your Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) .
1 If you join a Medicare Advantage plan, you will pay the Part B premium, a premium (although $0 plans exist) for the Medicare Advantage plan, which can include your Part D coverage, plus co-pays when you use services or get prescription drugs.
