Strips. Tri-tip strips cook to rare in about 8 to 10 minutes, and to medium in 12 to 14 minutes. This is the total cooking time, so turn the strips over at the halfway point -- 4 to 5 minutes on each side for rare, and 6 to 7 minutes on each side for medium.
4 Cover the grill and cook until the temperature of the interior of the tri-tip reaches 120°F for a rare roast, 130°F for medium-rare and 140°F for medium. At this point the meat will take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to cook, depending on how hot your grill is, how well done you want it, and the size of the cut.
3. Slow-grill the steak. Place the tri-tip on the cool side of the grill, with the thickest part of the steak facing the hot side of the grill, and cook with the lid closed. Turn the steak occasionally, about every 20 minutes, until it reaches 110° (43°C) in the center of the thickest part.
3) Light the grill and bring to medium heat (between 350 – 375 degrees). Preheat for 7-8 minutes. This is the ideal heat to cook the tri tip fully in 35-40 minutes, depending on the size of the roast. 4) Place the meat fat side up in between the burners.
Roasts. How long to cook a tri-tip roast depends on its weight and shape. For an average-sized, 2-lb. roast that is about 2 inches thick, cook the roast on one side for 20 to 30 minutes. Turn the roast over and continue cooking to an internal temperature of 140 degrees F as measured with a meat thermometer.
The real answer is it depends, but a total time of 25 - 30 minutes for a smaller tri-tip is usually a good starting guess. Each tri-tip roast and grill is different though, so you really need to use a meat thermometer to make sure the roast is cooked to perfection.
