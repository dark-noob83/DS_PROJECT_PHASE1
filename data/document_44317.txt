To turn bauxite into alumina, we grind the ore and mix it with lime and caustic soda, pump this mix into high-pressure containers, and heat it. The aluminum oxide is dissolved by the caustic soda, then precipitated out of this solution, washed, and heated to drive off water.
The homeopathic remedy alumina is derived from aluminum, one of the most common metals that most of us are familiar with. Aluminum is present in an assortment of things and, hence, this mineral is very popular. It has numerous uses-industrial, domestic as well as medicinal.
Australia produces the largest amount of alumina because she has a large body of bauxite. Jamica, South Africa and some other countries also have a good reserve. Alcan is an international company in Canada, that produces aluminum products, including aluminum foils. You might have used it to wrap your burgers.
The result is a white powder like that shown below: pure alumina. The caustic soda is returned to the beginning of the process and used again. At this point, the alumina is ready for conversion into aluminum at a smelter. Alumina is also used in making chemical and ceramics.
Alcoa is the world's leading producer of alumina, with global refinery capacity of 14 million metric tons per year, nearly a third of the international market. We operate refineries in Australia, Brazil, Jamaica, Spain, Suriname and the United States.

It is a white powder produced by the refining of bauxite. Some two tonnes of alumina are needed to produce one tonne of aluminium through an electrolytic process. Alumina is also used for a number of other purposes, such as water purification and as an additive in various applications.
