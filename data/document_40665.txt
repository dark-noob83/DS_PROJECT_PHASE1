1 Although the word mammoth has come to mean 'huge,' woolly mammoths were probably about the size of African elephants. 2  Males were 9 to 11 feet (2.7 to 3.4 meters) tall at their shoulders. 3  They weighed about five to six tons (4,536 to 5,443 kilograms).
The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is a species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, and was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in eastern Asia.
The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between 2.7 and 3.4 m (9 and 11 ft) and weighed up to 6 tonnes (6.6 short tons). Females averaged 2.6–2.9 metres (8.5–9.5 ft) in height and weighed up to 4 tonnes (4.4 short tons). A newborn calf weighed about 90 kilograms (200 lb). The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age.
The largest known species, the Imperial Mammoth of California, reached heights of around 13 feet at the shoulder. Mammoths weighed approximately 6-8 tons. Most species of mammoth were about as large as a modern Asian Elephant.
The woolly mammoth was medium sized, and was 9 to 12 ft tall, about the same height as an Asiatic elephant, although they weighed 8 tons (3 tons more than the Asiatic elephant).
1 They were roughly about the size of modern African elephants. 2  A male woolly mammoth’s shoulder height was 9 to 11 feet tall and weighed around 6 tons. 3  Its cousin the Steppe mammoth (M. trogontherii) was perhaps the largest one in the family — growing up to 13 to 15 feet tall.
1 Contrary to common belief, the woolly mammoth was hardly mammoth in size. 2  They were roughly about the size of modern African elephants. 3  A male woolly mammoth’s shoulder height was 9 to 11 feet tall and weighed around 6 tons.
