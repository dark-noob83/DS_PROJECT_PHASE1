a scalene triangle is a triangle that has 3 unequal sides if all the angles of any triangle are different then the triangle is scalene and all the sides are different measure c scalene triangle all the sides different lengths in this page we are going to discuss about scalene triangles a scalene triangle is a very commonly used triangle in geometry it is one of the special types of triangles
in acute scalene triangles the three angles are acute angles and the three sides are of different lengths in an obtuse scalene triangle one of the triangle is obtuse angle and all the sides are of different measures in a right scalene triangle one of the angle is right angle and all the three sides are of different measures in a special scalene right triangle all the three angles are of 30 60 90 degrees c scalene triangle all the sides different lengths in this page we are going to discuss about scalene triangles a scalene triangle is a very commonly used triangle in geometry it is one of the special types of triangles
of course acute means that all angles are less than 90 degrees and scalene means that none of its sides or angles match draw an equilaterial triangle and then nud ge one point slightly on a path which is parallel to the opposite sideacute scalene triangleis a triangle in which all the sides of the triangle will be unequal the angles of triangle will be unequal in the above triangle the sides of the triangle are 8 cm 10 cm and 16 cmcute means that all angles are less than 90 degrees and scalene means that none of its sides or angles match draw an equilaterial triangle and then nud ge one point slightly on a path which is parallel to the opposite side acute scalene triangle 6 people found this useful
an isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal these two angles are called the base angles classify triangles by length of sides equilateral triangles isosceles triangles scalene triangles solve some problems involving angles and sides of triangles
