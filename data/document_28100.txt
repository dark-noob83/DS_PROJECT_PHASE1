Thompson and Sprinkle 2013 Council on Forest Engineering Annual Meeting Page 1 of 5 Production, Cost and Chip Characteristics of In-Woods Microchipping Jason Thompson 1, Wesley Sprinkle 1 Abstract Emerging markets for biomass have increased the interest in producing microchips in the field.
These two trials showed that microchipping production was 12.8% and 11.1% less on average than producing conventional chips with the same chipper. Table 1: Productivity data for a disc chipper producing whole tree conventional and microchips.
As a component of a large United States Department of Energy (DOE) funded project, microchipping has been trialed on a limited scale. The goal of the research was to evaluate the production, cost and chip characteristics of a mobile disc chipper configured to produce microchips.
Microchip supports a wide range of Real-Time Clocks from basic low cost devices to a variety of mid-range devices that are highly integrated with a usable amount of non-volatile memory and a combination of features that are very effective when operating within a single battery backed clock device.
Using the chipping production rates measured during the study, a ton of conventional chips made from whole trees would cost $3.08/SMH ($0.08/ton) to produce at road side. The cost of. Thompson and Sprinkle 2013 Council on Forest Engineering Annual Meeting Page 5 of 5 producing microchips was $3.82/SMH ($0.11/ton).
The cost of manufacturing one pressure sensor is less than DKK 100, whereas traditional pressure sensors cost between DKK 250 and 1500, depending on the application. Grundfos therefore expects a lot from the production that has now begun. Actual mass production is expected to begin at the end of the year.
A new process for cutting silicon wafers could streamline the production of smaller and more powerful microchips for electronic devices. Electronic chips are built on small pieces of silicon that are cut from silicon sheets, called wafers, in a process known as dicing.
According to the research team, the new dicing technology will advance the production of microchips for electronic devices. It will enable the production of chips that are thinner and capable of supporting higher processing speeds, making for smaller and more powerful devices.
Coolants or protective coatings are then required, adding to the production cost. A team of researchers at the A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology has developed a new technique that uses laser-induced thermal cracking technology.
