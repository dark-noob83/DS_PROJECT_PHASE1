A Consumer’s Guide to a Quality Brake Job. I’m often asked how much a brake job should cost. The answer depends on where you get it done. If you go to a muffler-type chain repair shop that advertises $99 brake jobs, I guarantee you that the brake job will wind up costing you over $600. That’s because NOBODY can make money by charging only $99 for a brake job. It’s 2013 and the going rate for an average brake job is around $275. That price includes installing a quality brake pad, machining the rotors (if needed), and lubricating the caliper slide pins with a high temperature grease. That’s the simple answer.

I just got new rear brake pads and rotors for $325, parts and labor included, for a 98 Pontiac Grand Prix in St. Paul. posted by undertone at 12:11 PM on June 8, 2006. Replacing the front rotors and black pads on a Ford Focus is a half-hour job at worst. I need new front pads and rotors. I just went to a national chain in the Boston area and was quoted $450.
Most shops on this part of this planet charge around $60 an hour for labor. If the flat rate manual time for a front brake job is around 2.5 hours that adds up to $256. It is hard these days to have a garage wash your windshield for under $100. 
The average cost of master cylinder repair is usually between $200 and $300, but it can be more, again, depending on the scope of the fix. If individual wheel cylinders need to be replaced, the cost will go up. The repair price for an entire brake job—rotors, calipers, drums, pads, cylinders—can run you $750 or more. Therefore, it's best to stay on top of brake repair and get the pads replaced when you hear squeaking. Components like master cylinders wear down after time, so eventually it will have to be replaced
Parts: $145 - $213. The average cost for a brake pad and rotor replacement is between $297 to $406. Labor costs are estimated between $152 to $193 while parts are priced between $145 to $213.

Hi Austin. I enjoy your emails and info very much. My soon to be 88 year old mother had a brake job done (front and back) on. her 1994 Ford Escort. The total bill was $602.97. Thanks Patti. I think the prices that you were given are fair, you could have saved a few bucks on some of the parts but for the most part it sounds legit to me. My labor rate is $75 an hour and would expect this job to take about 2 1/2 hours but the actual “book time” is closer to 3 1/2 hours. The thing is, one of my faster guys could do the whole job in 1 hour. This car is small and the parts are easy to replace, but shops can’t make money that way
Brake rotors should be measured at every brake pad replacement. If found to be at or below the manufacturer's minimum thickness specification, they will require replacement. These measurements should always be noted on your repair order. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads. The average cost for a brake pad and rotor replacement is between $297 to $406. Labor costs are estimated between $152 to $193 while parts are priced between $145 to $213.
