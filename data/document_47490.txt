Inhalation Dangers. The major danger of food grade diatomaceous earth arises from the fact that it is a powder and is made from silica. A person can inhale powder into the lungs and become ill. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that inhaled silica can cause a range of diseases such as silicosis.
Diatomaceous Earth Risks. First, the type of diatomaceous earth you take is very important. The only type of DE you can safely take is food grade DE. Food grade DE is the purest type of DE available, and is what is available at most food or health stores.
The “dangerous” part of DE is the amount of crystalline silica that is in it. Filter grade is 65% crystalline silica while food grade is less than 1/10 of 1%! The world health org. has said that diatomaceous earth is safe to breathe as long as the crystalline content is under 2%.
Ingestion. Diatomaceous Earth has a long and safe history of use as a filter aid in food processing. particularly in the manufacturing of high-fructose corn syrup and maltodextrin. More than 170,000 tons of diatomaceous earth are used in the filtration of food products annually.
Diatomaceous earth is a chalky natural sediment. It is available in food-grade forms and approved for use in the manufacturing and processing of many common food products. The International Programme on Chemical Safety reports no toxic effects from ingestion.
People use food grade diatomaceous earth as a dietary source of silica -- its main component. Proponents claim silica helps lower cholesterol, promote healthy blood pressure and help keep bones strong. Data supports the role of silica for bone health. However, evidence for other benefits is lacking.
