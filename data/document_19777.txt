The university hospital as such was founded in 1708 as the first clinic with the specific intention of facilitating the practical education of medical students. Known as the Nosocomium Academicum, it was located in the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget, beside the cathedral (see illustration). The university hospital has its origins in two older hospitals: one was founded in 1302 and is older than the university, the other one was founded for the Faculty of Medicine in 1708. These were merged in 1850. The earliest hospital in Uppsala was founded in 1302.
