The most easily understood method of ecological interdependence is a brutish one: living things eat other living things to survive. The predator and prey relationship was one of the first feeding relationships that scientists understood.
The interdependence of organisms in an ecosystem often results in approximate stability over hundreds or thousands of years. As one species proliferates, it is held in check by one or more environmental factors: depletion of food or nesting sites, increased loss to predators, or invasion by parasites.
Instructions. Analyze the habitats of livings organisms. Animals use plants as a form of shelter within their environment. You can describe the interdependence of living organisms by stating how an organism builds its form of shelter. For example, many birds reside within nests on the trees.
It is important to understand the interdependence of living organisms within an ecosystem in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the succession of biological life and symbiotic relationships. Such relationships are also necessary to understand the importance of preserving wildlife.
A rainforest is an ecosystem. An ecosystem is a complex balance of plants and animals (see image 1). The ecosystem of a rainforest relies on interdependence. Interdependence means that the plants and animals of a specific environmental system depend on each other for survival. This means that if a plant or animal dies then another plant or animal that depended on it may also die. If the web of interdependence is broken, the rainforest will never grow back.
