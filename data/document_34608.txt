GLOBAL WARMING BENIFITS. Global warming is a misnomer because the entire earth is not heating up. Instead, certain areas of the earth are seeing rises in temperature, while other areas may not see many effects for some years or even centuries.For every downside to global warming there is usually an upside as well. 2) Even if global warming is (or was) happening, and even if it continues (or resumes), it is not caused by humans. Besides the current warm period, there have been three warm periods in the last 4,000 years, following a fairly regular cycle of 1,000-1,500 years.
Maktub is an alchemist term (arabic word) which literally means it is written. From mystical point of view, it points to the fact that whatever happens is already known to the One. It signifies that Destiny exists. Now there is a big problem here.
