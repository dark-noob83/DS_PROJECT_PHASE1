If you need a walkway through your garden or yard, a stepping stone path can be a practical solution as well as a compliment to the landscape. You can lay it out as a straight walkway or as a winding path that meanders around trees and flowerbeds. A landscape contractor will charge $1479 to lay a 3-foot wide, 40-foot long stone path. This includes labor and material. You can buy the material, including stone, sand and landscape cloth, for $625 and do it yourself, saving58 percent.
1 Hiring a handyman, gardener or landscape designer to install a gravel walkway can cost $300 -$2,000 or more, depending on materials, local rates and the complexity of the layout. 1 To estimate the cubic yards required for a specific project, multiply length by width by depth and then divide by 27. 2  For example, to lay a 3 bed of gravel on a path 3' wide and 100' long, convert the 3 to 0.25'; multiply 0.25 x 3 x 100 and divide by 27, which equals 2.78 cubic yards.
Measure out the walkway’s dimensions with a tape measure. It is up to you to decide how long or wide you want your walkway. A good rule of thumb for a path width is at least 3'. Using garden hoses, lay out the shape of your walkway with this measured width. Be sure that your path’s width remains consistent. Measure it again and again as you lay down the hoses. 
1 Do-it-yourself materials to install a gravel path can cost $100 -$1,000 or more depending on the gravel chosen (for example, pea gravel is much less expensive than crushed granite); the length, width and depth of the path; and whether edging is done with plastic, metal, wood, natural stone, brick, concrete or pavers. 1 To estimate the cubic yards required for a specific project, multiply length by width by depth and then divide by 27. 2  For example, to lay a 3 bed of gravel on a path 3' wide and 100' long, convert the 3 to 0.25'; multiply 0.25 x 3 x 100 and divide by 27, which equals 2.78 cubic yards.
A pea gravel walkway or patio costs about $5 per square foot, installed, including a layer of base rock. If you'd like to install it yourself, it will cost half as much. Add in the cost of a header or Bender Board. A wood header is about $5 per linear foot; a metal header is $6 (black metal disappears well). You won't need a header if you're installing gravel against a house, fence, or raised bed. 
The raw material costs from $40 to $50 per cubic yard and is available from landscape suppliers (and at stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot). The cost to have a contractor install a path or patio is approximately $4-$6 per square foot, depending on conditions and whether stabilizers are added. If you do it yourself, the cost will be about half that amount. 
Green Basalt This distinctive gravel type, made from small (10 – 20mm) chips of basalt works very well for garden paths, although it can be quite expensive to buy. Firm edging will be required to stop these small chips spreading across your whole garden. Should be laid to a depth of around 40 – 50mm at the least.
