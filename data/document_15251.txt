Causes. There is no known single cause for autism spectrum disorder, but it is generally accepted that it is caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function. Brain scans show differences in the shape and structure of the brain in children with autism compared to in neurotypical children.
In fact, autism is actually a whole-body medical disorder linked to impairments to the immune system, the gastrointestinal system, detoxification and cellular repair mechanisms among other system-wide physiological imbalances.
Autism is a term used to describe a spectrum of disorders that are characterized by abnormalities in communication, socialization and behavior.
By 1981, children received 135 micrograms of mercury in vaccines. The incidence of autism increased to 1 in 2600 children. Children in 1996 received 246 micrograms of mercury in vaccines and the incidence of autism was about 1 in every 35
The Alleged Autism Epidemic. It is without controversy that the number of autism diagnoses being made is on the rise. In 1991 there were about 6 cases per 10,000 births, and in 2001 there were about 42. This number continues to rise at about the same rate. The cause of this rise, however, is very controversial.
However, many media sources are pushing through causes of autism epidemics ranging from vaccines, environmental toxins and isolated genetic populations. However, many of the sources do not look at the actual facts of what could be behind this increase in prevalence.
Autism is a serious behavioral disorder among young children that now occurs at epidemic rates. According to a recent article, autism is diagnosed in America about 1 of every 120 girls and 1 in every 70 boys. In some areas, it is far more prevalent.
The symptoms of autism are very similar to the symptoms of mercury poisoning. Sadly, and disgustingly, by the age of six months, children in the Western world, in particular, today receive over 100 times the safe dose of mercury for their age due to vaccines.
