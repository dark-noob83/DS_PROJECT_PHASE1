MS is a chronic disease where demyelination occurs in the white matter of the brain and in the spinal cord. In areas where myelin is under attack by the immune system, lesions or “plaques” form. These plaques are scar tissue. The name “sclerosis” means scar.
Guillain-Barre and CIDP. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory disease of the peripheral nerves. An autoimmune attack on the myelin (insulation around individual nerve fibers, called axons) results in demyelination.
[ mi´ĕ-lin ]. the lipid substance forming a sheath (the myelin sheath) around the axons of certain nerve fibers; it is an electrical insulator that serves to speed the conduction of nerve impulses in these nerve fibers, which are called myelinated or medullated fibers. adj., adj myelin´ic.
Myelinated nerve fibers occur predominantly in the cranial and spinal nerves and compose the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. It is the myelin sheath that gives the whitish color to the areas of white matter. Unmyelinated fibers are abundant in the autonomic nervous system.
myelin. the lipid substance forming a sheath (the myelin sheath) around the axons of certain nerve fibers; it is an electrical insulator that serves to speed the conduction of nerve impulses in these nerve fibers, which are called myelinated or medullated fibers. adj., adj myelin´ic.
A demyelinating disease is any condition that results in damage to the protective covering (myelin sheath) that surrounds nerve fibers in your brain and spinal cord.
Myelin is a fatty white substance that surrounds the axon dielectric (electrically insulating) material that forms a layer, the myelin sheath, usually around only the axon of a neuron. It is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. It is an outgrowth of a type of glial cell.
