I have to say approximately, because even without a heater, with lights and a hood, the water temperature might be a little warmer than the room. And it might make a difference where in the room your tank was. Example: If the room is 76F will room Temperature water in the room be 76F. Also can platys and Molly&#39;s live in an unheated tank for 4 weeks in a room the is 73F to 76F. Source(s): room temperature water temperature air room: https://shortly.im/1kIfJ.
Room temperature water is the same as room temperature which ranges from 14C-25C (59F-77F). At 4oC the density is approximately 1000 kg/m3 (or 1 g/cm3) - more acurately though the density would be 999.97 kg/m3 (or … 0.9997 g/cm3). Values for the density of pure water (H2O) have been calculated over a wide range of temperatures. At room temperature (22oC) The density of water is 997.77 kg/m3 (or 0.99777 g/cm3).
This depends greatly upon the temperature the water. At 4oC the density is approximately 1000 kg/m3 (or 1 g/cm3) - more acurately though the density would be 999.97 kg/m3 (or … 0.9997 g/cm3). Values for the density of pure water (H2O) have been calculated over a wide range of temperatures. At room temperature (22oC) The density of water is 997.77 kg/m3 (or 0.99777 g/cm3).
Some doctors suggest that room temperature or body temperature water is better than cold water, because the body has to expend energy to heat cold water to body temperature, resulting in some water loss. 
They observe that the hot water floats on the room-temperature water and the cold water sinks. Students will combine the concepts of temperature, molecular motion, and density to learn that hot water is less dense than room-temperature water and that cold water is more dense. 
Room temperature may be 20 degrees Celsius that is equal to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.   There is no fixed room temperature. I feel a bit chilly at 68 F (20 C) in the winter ti … me and warm at 75 F (22 C) in the summer. Most people are comfortable at temperatures in this range. Values for the density of pure water (H2O) have been calculated over a wide range of temperatures. At room temperature (22oC) The density of water is 997.77 kg/m3 (or 0.99777 g/cm3).
18143.7 = water boils at 69 Fahrenheit. 759,993.4 = atmospheric pressure = water boils at 212) if you had the water in a room that was warmer then 69 and a vacuum of 18000 microns the water would boil and evaporate, there would be no air in the container. At 4oC the density is approximately 1000 kg/m3 (or 1 g/cm3) - more acurately though the density would be 999.97 kg/m3 (or … 0.9997 g/cm3). Values for the density of pure water (H2O) have been calculated over a wide range of temperatures. At room temperature (22oC) The density of water is 997.77 kg/m3 (or 0.99777 g/cm3).
The specific heat of water is 1 calorie/gram °C = 4.186 joule/gram °C which is higher than any other common substance. As a result, water plays a very important role in temperature regulation. The specific heat per gram for water is much higher than that for a metal, as described in the water-metal example. For most purposes, it is more meaningful to compare the molar specific heats of substances. The molar specific heats of most solids at room temperature and above are nearly constant, in agreement with the Law of Dulong and Petit.
Hydrogen Bonding   Water is a liquid at room temperature due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The state of a molecule is determined by intermo … lecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces (also called London dispersion forces), and hydrogen bonds. At 4oC the density is approximately 1000 kg/m3 (or 1 g/cm3) - more acurately though the density would be 999.97 kg/m3 (or … 0.9997 g/cm3). Values for the density of pure water (H2O) have been calculated over a wide range of temperatures. At room temperature (22oC) The density of water is 997.77 kg/m3 (or 0.99777 g/cm3).
The rate of chemical reactions generally increases at higher temperature. Water, particularly groundwater, with higher temperatures can dissolve more minerals from the rocks it is in and will therefore have a higher electrical conductivity.
