4 Cover the grill and cook until the temperature of the interior of the tri-tip reaches 120°F for a rare roast, 130°F for medium-rare and 140°F for medium.

Put the roast in the center of the oven for 18 to 30 minutes per pound of roast. For a rare roast, internal temperature should be 125 degrees, medium ranges from 130 to 130 degrees, and well-done registers 145 degrees.
