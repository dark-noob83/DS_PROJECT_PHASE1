Medical Conditions. If your eyelids are drooping, it could be a sign of an underlying medical condition, especially if the issue affects both eyelids. If just one of your eyelids droops, it may be a result of a nerve injury or a temporary sty (inflammation and swelling of the eyelid that is usually harmless). Routine LASIK or cataract surgery is sometimes to blame for the development of ptosis, as a result of the muscle or tendon being stretched.
Causes. Drooping eyelids may be due to a variety of conditions include aging, diabetes, stroke, Horner syndrome, myasthenia gravis, or a brain tumor or other cancer that affects nerve or muscle reactions. Below are some common causes. Both eyelids drooping: 1  Medical problem, such as myasthenia gravis. 2  Migraine headaches.
Serious Conditions. In some cases, eyelid drooping is caused by more serious conditions, such as a stroke, brain tumor, or cancer of the nerves or muscles. Neurological disorders that affect the nerves or muscles of the eyes such as myasthenia gravis can also lead to ptosis.
Eyelid drooping is excess sagging of the upper eylid. The edge of the upper eyelid may be lower than it should be (ptosis) or there may be excess baggy skin in the upper eyelid (dermatochalasis). Eyelid drooping is often a combination of both conditions. The problem is also called ptosis.
Drooping is the result of reduced muscle tone in the muscles that control the eyelids. If your lower eyelids droop outward, away from the eye (ectropion), they may no longer be able to protect your eyes, and your eyes may become dry and irritated.
A drooping or sagging of the eyelid is medically known as ptosis or blepharoptosis. Drooping eyelids may occur on both sides (bilateral) or on one side only (unilateral), in which case it is more easily noticed.
