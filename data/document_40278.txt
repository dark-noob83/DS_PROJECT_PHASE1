KB and kB refer to kilobyte-a unit of information or computer storage equal to either 1,024 bytes (2 10) or 1,000 bytes (10 3), depending on context. MB refers to megabyte-a unit of information or computer storage equal to either 1,048,576 bytes (2 20) or 1,000,000 bytes (10 6), depending on context. A megabyte has approximately 1,000 (or 1,024 to be precise) kilobytes. 
1 Kb is 1,024 bytes 1 MB (megabyte) is 1,024 kilobytes 1 GB (gigabyte) is 1,024 megabytes 1 Terabyte is 1,024 Gigabytes 1 Petabyte is 1,024 terabytes 1 Exabyte is 1,024 petabytes 1 Zettabyte is 1,024 petabytes 1 Yottabyte is 1,024 zettabytes And there may be others bigger. That's as far as my knowledge goes. On your list, GB is the biggest. Byte = 8 bits KB (kilobyte) = 1024 bytes MB (megabyte) = 1024 kilobytes GB (gigabyte) = 1024 megabytes TB (terabyte) = 1024 gigabytes (not positive, but I think the next step is PB (picobytes) which is 1024 terabytes). serogers1970 Â· 8 years ago.

MB vs GB. MB and GB are terms that are nowadays even used by common man without knowing the real meaning of it. If you feel baffled by the words KB, MB and GB, there is no need to be as they are merely numbers that show the amount of data or the capacity of a computer to store data.
Kilobyte (KB): The smallest file stored on a smartphone, tablet or PC is typically four kilobytes (4KB) in size. A kilobyte is 1024 bytes, a. Therefore 1KB is the same as 1024 x 8 = 8192 binary digits. Megabyte (MB): 1024KB equals one megabyte (MB), Gigabyte (GB): There are 1024MB in one gigabyte. 
1 PB. A kilobyte (KB) is 1024 bytes, a megabyte (MB) is 1024 kilobytes and so on as these tables demonstrate. Companies tend to use bytes to calculate the size of the files that they are storing and transferring. Transferring 1 Gigabyte (GB) of data transfer would be over 1 billion bytes of data or over 8 billion bits. 
Then 1024 kilobytes make up one megabyte. 1024 megabytes make up one gigabyte, and 1024 gigabytes make up one terabyte. A JPG file used to store a photo would be a few megabytes. The capacity of a DVD is a couple of gigabytes and an HD video can have a file size of few gigabytes. Megabyte vs Gigabyte vs Terabyte. Difference between megabyte gigabyte and terabyte is a basic computer knowledge. Bit is the most basic and smallest storage unit in computing. A bit can store only whether it is 1 or 0. 8 bits make up one byte. 1024 bytes are called a kilobyte
Best Answer: KB, MB, GB are all units of measurement for saying how many bits there are that can be allocated towards some piece of hardware. There are at first bits, sets of binary coding, then bytes, a byte is a set of 8 bits, then kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,terabytes, etc.. 1KB is 1024 bytes, 1MB is 1024 kilobytes, 1GB is 1024 megabytes, 1TB is 1024 gigabytes, etc.. All of those values are in true binary though, most people just say 1000k of each though.
