Buying a UPC Barcode for your product can vary in cost depending on where you purchase them from. All genuine barcodes originate from the GS-1 which is the governing organization of UPC Barcodes. Purchasing a UPC prefix from the GS-1 makes sense for larger manufactures or product distributors. These days, purchasing and maintaining a UPC prefix from the GS-1 can be quite expensive. The cost can range $250 up to $10,500 for Barcodes depending on how many you need. There is also an Annual Renewal Fee that can range from $50 to $2,100. This means that if you purchase your barcodes directly from the GS-1, the barcodes will always cost you money to maintain.
