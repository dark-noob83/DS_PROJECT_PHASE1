Annuity Basics. An annuity is a type of investment that pays you over time. Annuity products usually are offered through insurance providers, but they also might be available through an employer's retirement plan, according to the investment website Personal Dividends.
Roth IRA. An annuity is an investment vehicle with tax-deferred growth -- you only pay taxes on the growth when you remove the funds. A Roth IRA is a retirement plan that uses various investments for funding. The money grows tax-free, and you never pay taxes on the growth if you leave it in past the age of 59 1/2.
Annuity earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal and have tax penalties for withdrawal before age 59-1/2. Regular IRA deposits can be tax-deductible, and the earnings grow tax-deferred. The point is that putting away IRA money means putting tax-deferred savings into an already tax-advantaged vehicle.

Probably not a good idea. Since one of the main advantages of an annuity is that your money grows tax-deferred, it makes little sense to hold one in an account like an IRA, which is already tax-deferred. It's a little like wearing a raincoat indoors.
