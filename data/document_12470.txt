While the allure of 3D printing appeals to nearly everyone, sometimes the thought of having to build your own model can be daunting. If you’re not familiar with using 3D modeling or mechanical CAD software, the goal of turning your idea into a tangible object can seem like an impossibility. Well, have no fear. Jonathan Williamson of BlenderCookie has just posted a video that can get you past that boundary.
You only need to use any 3D modeling or CAD program to be precise, then most of these softwares can save or export your data into .stl file format which is the native file format for 3D printers. If you want to get started with a 3D modeling program you can pick up Blender which is a free and open source modeling program, http://www.blender.org/ . Be sure to check out the education section to find tutorials on how to use it.
This answer will respond to this first Question. The answer is none; you don't need to be able to program at all to create 3D models that can be printed on 3D printers. You just need a 3D modeling program, to know how to use it, and to know what format the printer you are printing on requires. Generally you create a model in a 3D modeling program, export it to the proper format then import in software supplied with the 3D printer. That software then communicates with the printer and instructs it on how to build the model.

To get started, navigate to tinkercad.com and create a free user account. I was presented with a blank slate—or, in the parlance of 3D modeling, an open work plane. Building in Tinkercad is conceptually simple: In the Add mode, you select a shape—a box, a pyramid, a cone, or a cylinder—along with a size. Using a PC program called 3ds Max, he created a complete 3D model of a labeled, ordered case, custom-fitted for his old tools. More From Popular Mechanics. When he was finished, he sent the file to his desktop prototyper, or 3D printer. About an hour later his tool case materialized in white ABS plastic.
Designing an Idea. It all starts with a concept. The first stage of 3D printing is laying out an original idea with digital modeling — that is, with computer aided design (CAD) or animation modeling software. Whichever program you choose, you're able to create a virtual blueprint of the object you want to print. Once you have a completed design, you send it to the 3D printer with the standard file extension .STL (for stereolithography or Standard Tessellation Language). STL files contain three-dimensional polygons that are sliced up so the printer can easily digest its information.
Below is the list of popular 3D software, free or paid 3D software. Most of 3D printers require that you use 3D computer graphics software that saves objects in the STL(stereolithography) format.

Once you're comfortable in a program like Tinkercad, you can find your way in 123D. There's room to grow with Shapeways as well. Once you're satisfied with your design, you can list it for sale on the site. You choose the material options and markup, and they handle the ordering, printing, and shipping.

It's versatile—there's really nothing you can't do in Blender—but it has a steep learning curve. The app 123D, new from Autodesk, the company that makes the industry-standard professional CAD software, is a well-balanced tool kit for intermediate 3D-modelers and connects natively with Shapeways for easy 3D printing.
