A combination of disconnect switches and breakers used to isolate equipment in substations. Switchgear refers to electrical equipment that regulates the flow of electricity within an electrical system. It is used by utility providers and private facilities alike for two reasons: to prevent overloads and short circuits, and to de-energize circuits for testing and maintenance. GIS: is no things but ,it is switchgear with gas sf6 to get good insulated between the busbar inside the GIS and the chamber of GIS. it uses for high voltage for 132KV or we c … an use it for mor.
When switchgear malfunctions, the consequences are often catastrophic. Damage to the switchgear itself can be extremely expensive, but that pales in comparison to corollary damage and the potential hazards to people. Thus, implementing an effective switchgear testing, inspection, and maintenance program is essential. 
A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially MAC bridge) is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network, by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device. A switch is a device in a computer network that electrically and logically connects together other devices. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices.
In an electric power system, switchgear is the combination of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switchgear is used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done and to clear faults downstream. This type of equipment is directly linked to the reliability of the electricity supply. The very earliest central power stations used simple open knife switch, mounted on insulating panels of marble or asbestos. A switchgear may be a simple open-air isolator switch or it may be insulated by some other substance. An effective although more costly form of switchgear is the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), where the conductors and contacts are insulated by pressurized sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF 6).
The term switchgear, used in association with the electric power system, or grid, refers to the combination of electrical disconnects, fuses and/or circuit breakers used to isolate electrical equipment.

Answers. Relevance. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: The term switchgear can be used to describe different electrical devices and does not have an exact meaning. High voltage also has the same problem because it is used to describe most any voltage over 240V which is used to supply most residential housing services. 
Switchgear. In an electric power system, switchgear is the combination of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipment. Switchgear is used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done and to clear faults downstream. Wiktionary (0.00 / 0 votes) Rate this definition: switchgear (Noun). A switching/ interrupting device used in connection with generation, transmission, distribution and conversion of electric power for controling, metering protecting and regulating devices. 52G breaker is the unit main power output breaker.
The switchgear on the low-voltage side of the transformers may be located in a building, with medium-voltage circuit breakers for distribution circuits, along with metering, control, and protection equipment. A switchgear may be a simple open-air isolator switch or it may be insulated by some other substance. An effective although more costly form of switchgear is the gas-insulated switchgear (GIS), where the conductors and contacts are insulated by pressurized sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF 6).
