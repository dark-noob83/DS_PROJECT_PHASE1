Germans lost Battle of Stalingrad because they decided to engage the Soviet in urban warfare in the first place. German commanders wanted to bypass the city and cross Volga at a crossing north of the Stalingrad.
Nowhere is the Volga River more hallowed than in the city named after it: Volgograd, better known to history as Stalingrad. During World War II, perhaps the bloodiest battle in history took place there. A total of 2 million people were lost on both sides in the fighting from the summer of 1942 to February 1943.
The Battle for Stalingrad was fought during the winter of 1942 to 1943. In September 1942, the German commander of the Sixth Army, General Paulus, assisted by the Fourth Panzer Army, advanced on the city of Stalingrad.

Germany at the start of Ope … ration Barbarossa had roughly 3 million troops compared to the Soviet Union who had about 7 million troops ready.

The capture of Stalingrad was important to Hitler for two primary reasons.

It is 70 years since the Battle of Stalingrad, a battle that turned the course of the war, and even history. The defeat at Stalingrad was a shattering blow to German forces and morale, from which they did not really recover.
