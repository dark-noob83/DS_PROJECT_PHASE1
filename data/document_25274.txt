Related to Incline Village, I actually ran average cost per square foot for newer construction (2000-2007) and came up with $659 per SF. This is due to custom nature of many new homes, engineering for snow loads, permitting/TRPA, etc.
1 A great deal depends on location plus the complexity of the project and the quality of the materials chosen. 2  It's possible to custom-build an 800-square-foot dome house for $1 million or a 12,000-square-foot rural ranch house for $400,000. 3  However, the $400,000 custom-built house is the exception rather than the rule.
There are so many custom features that control the cost of building a home. The bottom pricing is down at $150 per foot and can go to approx $275 per foot depending on footage of house and exactly the kind of finishes you are wanting.
The average cost per square foot to build a home in Indiana is  about $132 per square foot. This means a 2500 square foot home  would cost around $330,000 to build. Edit.
The average custom home building costs for custom homes built in the United States is right around $83 per square foot. The median price however was $78
Cost per square foot depends on the size and style of home you want to build, as well as the materials and features you put into your house. As a general estimate, costs would start at about $85/sq. ft, but could exceed $200/ sq ft., depending on which of the three basic home styles you choose.
That’s a start, but for a 2,500-square-foot custom home, even a range of $20 per square foot is a lot of money. You most definitely don’t want your cost estimate on a $250,000 house to be off by $50,000! With a little research, square-foot pricing can be a useful tool to get you “in the ballpark” — but that’s all.
In the majority of states the average cost is below $85 per square foot. In the northeastern states and California the average price of construction can be between $100 and $120 dollars per square foot. In reality there are many factors that impact the average custom home costs. Let’s walk through a few.
