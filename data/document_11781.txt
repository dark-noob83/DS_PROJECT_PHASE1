Uber explains the pre-authorization policy further, on its website : When you sign up for Uber or occasionally thereafter, a small pre-authorization charge is made on your credit or debit card for a specific amount used to ensure your card is valid before you ride. We void that charge immediately when it's made so you are never actually charged.
Don’t pay in cash. All fare payments are handled automatically by the Uber service and your credit card on file. If using the TAXI service, you can select the amount to be tipped through your Uber Payment Settings-the default is 20%.
