Just the one screen is damaged the LCD screen. The touch screen is fine. Apple will charge you about $200.

Getting Apple to replace or repair an iPhone 6 screen costs $109. For the iPhone 6 Plus the price increases to $129. If you have AppleCare+ then you get two incidents of accidental care covered, however, there’s still a $79 service fee to pay. However, if the battery gives up outside of warranty or you damaged it somehow, Apple requires you pay $79 + $6.95 shipping to get a new one, and you won’t have your handset for 3-5 business days while they replace it.
