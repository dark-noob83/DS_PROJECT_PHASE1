1 A Maryland or resin-bonded bridge (with a false tooth and metal side wings that are bonded to the back of the adjacent/anchor teeth) can cost $1,000-$1,200 for one false tooth with two metal wings or $1,700-$3,500 with two false teeth.
1 These life-like dentures can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 for a full set (upper and lower jaw). 2  Mid-range dentures employ many of the same features as their high-end counterparts, with perhaps a lower degree of artistry and a more limited warranty.
1 A permanently fixed replacement for one or more teeth is known as a dental bridge. 2  A Maryland or resin-bonded bridge (with a false tooth and metal side wings that are bonded to the back of the adjacent/anchor teeth) can cost $1,000-$1,200 for one false tooth with two metal wings or $1,700-$3,500 with two false teeth.
1 Dentures may crack or break, and the fit will change over time. 2  Repairs can cost $50-$200 and professional relining to adjust the fit is typically $250-$450. 3  Do-it-yourself repair or reline kits (available from drug stores or online) cost $10-$50.
Insurance coverage is usually minimal, and patients often are surprised by high out-of-pocket costs. An implant to replace a single tooth can cost $3,000 to $4,500, depending on where you live. Implants to replace a full or partial set of teeth can run from $20,000 to as much as $45,000.
1 Two to six dental implants that support a removable denture plate can cost $3,500-$30,000 or more depending on the number and type of implants (mini-implants are less expensive), denture materials (in some cases an existing denture plate can be adapted for use with implants) and any other procedures needed.
1 A mid-range denture typically costs $500-$1,500 per plate or $1,000-$3,000 for a set. 2  These offer a fairly personalized fit and usually come with a 1- or 2-year warranty. 3  Premium dentures can cost $2,000-$4,000 per plate, or $4,000-$8,000 or more
1 Tooth extraction typically costs $75-$450 per tooth for a simple extraction and $150-$650 or more per tooth for a surgical extraction. 2  Depending on the number of teeth to be pulled, the total cost of getting dentures can be $1,500-$20,000 or more for a full set (uppers and lowers).
1 If dentures are medically necessary, insurance might pay 15%-50% of the costs (up to the plan's annual limit, if there is one). 2  A basic denture starts at about $300-$500 per plate, or $600-$1,000 for a full set of upper and lower teeth.
