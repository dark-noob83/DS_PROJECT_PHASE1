The 2007 White Paper: “Meeting the Energy Challenge” sets out the Government ’s international and domestic energy strategy to address the long term energy challenges faced by the UK, and to deliver four key policy goals: Though energy policy is an area reserved to the UK government under the Scotland Act 1998 that established devolved government for Scotland, the Scottish Government has an energy policy for Scotland at variance with UK policy, and has planning powers to enable it to put some aspects of its policy priorities into effect.
Three Energy Policy Acts have been passed, in 1992, 2005, and 2007, which include many provisions for conservation, such as the Energy Star program, and energy development, with grants and tax incentives for both renewable energy and non-renewable energy. The administration of Barack Obama has proposed an aggressive energy policy reform, including the need for a reduction of CO 2 emissions, with a cap and trade program, which could help encourage more clean renewable, sustainable energy development.
The UK Government's goal for renewable energy production is to produce 20% of electricity in the UK by the year 2020. The 2002 Energy Review set a target of 10% to be in place by 2010/2011. The target was increased to 15% by 2015 and most recently the 2006 Energy Review further set a target of 20% by 2020. Though energy policy is an area reserved to the UK government under the Scotland Act 1998 that established devolved government for Scotland, the Scottish Government has an energy policy for Scotland at variance with UK policy, and has planning powers to enable it to put some aspects of its policy priorities into effect.
If the US is to succeed in replacing oil with renewable sources of energy, government policies must provide incentives. _________________________________________________________.

The latest Monthly Energy Review released by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that renewable energy sources provided roughly 11 percent of primary energy production for the first nine months of 2010.
The current energy policy of the United Kingdom is set out in the Energy White Paper of May 2007 and Low Carbon Transition Plan of July 2009, building on previous work including the 2003 Energy White Paper and the Energy Review Report in 2006. Though energy policy is an area reserved to the UK government under the Scotland Act 1998 that established devolved government for Scotland, the Scottish Government has an energy policy for Scotland at variance with UK policy, and has planning powers to enable it to put some aspects of its policy priorities into effect.
The development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marks a new era of energy exploration in the United States, according to President Barack Obama. In a joint address to the Congress on February 24, 2009, President Obama called for doubling renewable energy within the next three years. The administration of Barack Obama has proposed an aggressive energy policy reform, including the need for a reduction of CO 2 emissions, with a cap and trade program, which could help encourage more clean renewable, sustainable energy development.
The energy policy of the United States is determined by federal, state and local entities in the United States, which address issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and gas mileage standards. The administration of Barack Obama has proposed an aggressive energy policy reform, including the need for a reduction of CO 2 emissions, with a cap and trade program, which could help encourage more clean renewable, sustainable energy development.
Renewables are energy forms which are essentially inexhaustible, unlike fossil fuel sources, which are finite. Renewable energy sources include wind (onshore and offshore), hydro, wave, tidal, biomass, solar, and geothermal. Renewable energy can be used for heating and transport as well as electricity generation. 
In the Colonial era the energy policy of the United States was for free use of standing timber for heating and industry. In the 19th century, new emphasis was placed on access to coal and its use for transport, heating and industry. The administration of Barack Obama has proposed an aggressive energy policy reform, including the need for a reduction of CO 2 emissions, with a cap and trade program, which could help encourage more clean renewable, sustainable energy development.
