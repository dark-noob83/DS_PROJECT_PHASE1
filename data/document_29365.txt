They also used explosives to demolish underwater obstacles planted by the enemy. As the U.S. Navy's elite combat swimmers, they were employed to breach the cables and nets protecting enemy harbors, plant limpet mines on enemy ships, and locate and mark mines for clearing by minesweepers. Naval Demolition Units landed as part of the Allied invasion of Sicily; they were divided in three groups that landed on the beaches near Licata, Gela and Scoglitti. In 1943, the Navy decided to create a large dedicated force for such tasks: the Naval Combat Demolition Units (NCDU).
