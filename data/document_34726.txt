Today almost all IQ tests adhere to the assignment of 15 IQ points to each standard deviation (SD) but this has not been the case historically. Approximately 95% of the population have scores within two standard deviations of the mean. If one SD is 15 points, then 95% of the population are within a range of 70 to 130.

An average person's IQ is around 120 130+ is for smart people 160+ are geniuses Just heard it from my friend. So in terms of 'evidence based research' this is not a very high grade. I am only pretty sure that a person's IQ is around 120. The average IQ is by definition 100; scores above 100 indicate a higher than average IQ and scores below 100 indicate a lower that average IQ. Theoretically, scores can range any amount below or above 100, but in practice they do not meaningfully go much below 50 or above 150.
I.Q. (intelligence quotient) in general, is an assessment of your ability to think and reason. IQ score is a standardized way of comparing this ability with the majority of people the same age as you are. A score of 100 means that compared to these people in your general age group that you have basically an average intelligence. Additionally, IQ is not the be all end all of a person's abilities in life. IQ score fails to measure things such as manual dexterity (obviously), musical talent, and a slew of other abilities that may lead one to many different success
IQ is a number meant to measure people cognitive abilities (intelligence) in relation to their age group. An I.Q between 90 and 110 is considered average; over 120, superior. Roughly 68% of the population has an IQ between 85 and 115. The average range between 70 and 130, and represents about 95% of the population. A score below 70 may indicate problems in understanding the iQ questions or soem type or retardation, and a score above 130 may indicate intellectual giftedness. 1% of the population has an IQ of 136 or highe
2. In the last several years, the average IQ of a person with Down syndrome has increased. In people with Down syndrome, 39.4% are in the mild intellectual disability range of 50-70, and 1% in the borderline intellectual function range of 70-80 (average IQ in the general population is 70-130). 3. 1 As recently as 1983, the average lifespan of a person with Down syndrome was 25 years. 2  The dramatic increase to 60 years is largely due to the end of the inhumane practice of institutionalizing people with Down syndrome.
Based on statistics, about half of the population are said to have “Average IQ”. 17% of people are classified either above or below the average level. 2.2% are considered very superior and intelligent and another 2.2% comprises those with possible mental problems. Above 100 will indicate that a person may be above average or has better or superior intelligence, while below 100 scores are classified as below average. Even further below may indicate some form of mental problem or retardation. In this context, an average IQ refers to intelligence scores of about 100.

IQ in the U.S. is 100. In the early days of IQ measurement, this was computed for children by dividing the mental age of an individual (as estim … ated by performance on a test) by the person's chronological age, and then multiplying that ratio by 100. No, a person with an average IQ cannot be diagnosed with mental retardation. Mental retardation is a generalized disorder, characterized by significantly impaired cognitive f … unctioning and deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors with onset before the age of 18.
