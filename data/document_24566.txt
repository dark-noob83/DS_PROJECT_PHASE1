Vertical Jump By Age. When it comes to age, vertical leaping ability increases as during the teenage years and peaks during the decade of 20 to 30 years old. 1  During their 20’s, the average vertical jump for men is at 19.5” to 20”. 2  At the same age, the average vertical leap for women is at 13” to 14”. 
Introduction. The standing vertical jump is a popular test of leg power and it is routinely used to monitor the effectiveness of an athlete's conditioning program. In most tests the athlete is asked to perform a 'countermovement jump' (with armswing) for maximum height. 
Above-average vertical jump score is the 60th to 70th percentile, which ranges from 18 to 19 inches. An excellent rating is 20 to 21 inches, which is the 80 to 90th percentile. The average, or 50th-percentile, jump for 13- to 14-year-old boys is about 17 inches, fitness expert Jay Hoffman writes in “Norms for Fitness, Performance and Health.” The 10th to 20th percentiles run from 12.3 to 13.8 inches; 30th to 40th percentile is 15 to 16 inches.
Top Scores. The world record vertical jump has been reported as up to 61 (155 cm) by Kadour Ziani (other reports for top leaps for Kadour range from 56/142cm upwards). He is the highest Vertical Leaper from Slamnation, and stands 5'10 tall. 1 The best vertical jump (no step) result from the 2012 NBA pre-draft combine camp was 38 inches (96.5 cm) by Justin Anderson (see more 2015 NBA combine results).
So if you have five people, and four have 20-inch vertical leap and one has a 40-inch vertical, the median is 20 (half jump as high or higher, half jump as high or lower) and the mean is 24, thrown off by the one jumper in the group. Average is not a word with a precise meaning. It can refer to the mean or the median. The median is the point at which half the people jump the same or higher and half jump the same or lower. You get the mean by adding up all the vertical leap heights and dividing by the number of jumpers.
Measure the distance between the standing reach height and the maximum jump height, and that is your result. You can assist in recording your score by holding a piece of chalk in your had and using it to mark the wall. Practice your technique, as the jump height can be affected by how much you bend your knees before jumping, and the effective use of the arms. For a demonstration, there is a video example of using the wall technique in the Vertical Jump Videos.
Splitting them up gives a better way to compare. The average vertical jump for men falls between 16 to 20 inches while it is around 12 to 16 inches for women. A good vertical jump is one that’s over 2 feet for males and over 20 inches for females. To excel however, men need to get over 28”, while women over 2 feet high. M
His other claim to fame is that he is the only person ever to do a double windmill slam dunk. His reported best vertical jump is more than twice the average NBA vertical leap of 28 (71 cm).
