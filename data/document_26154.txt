Anthophytes with showy flowers attract pollinating insects and animals. The genus Anthophyta is a vast group in the plant kingdom, comprised of all plants that reproduce through flowers.
The anthophyta phylum is divided into two further groups called monocots and dicots. Monocots have one cotyledon, which is a part of the plant embryo within the seed of the plant where food is stored until the plant produces its leaves. Dicots have two cotyledons.
The difference is that the anthophyte produces seeds and a conifer doesnt really produce seeds-b.bonbon Both are vascular plants and BOTH produce seeds, Anthophyta within a f … ruit (and usually with flowers to attract pollinators, coniferophytes (gymnosperms) produce seeds within their cones (pine nuts are seeds).
The plant kingdom is divided into different groups called phyla. One of these phyla is the anthophyta phylum. Anthophyta plants all have certain characteristics in common with one another. The anthophyta phylum is the largest division of photosynthetic organisms.
• ANTHOPHYTA (noun). The noun ANTHOPHYTA has 1 sense: 1. comprising flowering plants that produce seeds enclosed in an ovary; in some systems considered a class (Angiospermae) and in others a division (Magnoliophyta or Anthophyta). Familiarity information: ANTHOPHYTA used as a noun is very rare. Dictionary entry details.
Flowering Plants. The Division name Anthophyta simply means flowering plant; the other term, angiosperm, refers to the seeds being borne in a vessel called a fruit. The plant that you see is the diploid sporophyte. As in conifers the seed contains a sporophyte embryo and tissues from the mother plant; it is the fruit surrounding the seed that is unique to this group of plants. The life cycle is two-part with diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte stages.
