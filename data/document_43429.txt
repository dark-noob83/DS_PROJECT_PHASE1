Under HRRP, hospitals with high rates of readmissions for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia will see a one percent reduction in Medicare payment in 2013. Penalties will continue to incrementally increase over the next two years—two percent in 2014 and three percent in 2015.
■ For Medicare patients, the three conditions with the largest number of 30-day all-cause readmissions were congestive heart failure (134,500 readmissions), septicemia (92,900 readmissions), and pneumonia (88,800 readmissions). These conditions resulted in about $4.3 billion in hospital costs.
1. Congestive heart failure (Statistical Brief #142, 2009 data) — The mean cost per CHF readmission is $13,000, with a 25.1 percent readmission rate. This is 118 percent the cost of an initial admission for CHF, which costs $11,000 on average. 2.
Medicare accounted for the majority of readmissions and cost, at 55.9 percent and 58.2 percent, respectively. Congestive heart failure was the most common condition for a Medicare readmission, with 134,500 beneficiaries rehospitalized for a total cost of more than $1.7 billion.
The average COPD readmission costs 118 percent of an initial COPD admission, which averages $7,100. 6. Joint Replacement (Statistical Brief 142, 2009 data) — The cost of a total hip replacement readmission averages $12,300, with an 8.2 percent readmission rate.
In fiscal year (FY) 2013, the Hospital Readmissions Reductions Program withheld up to 1% of regular reimbursements for hospitals that had too many patient readmissions within 30 days of discharge because of three medical conditions: heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia.
Costs vary with cause, ranging from an average of $7,600 (heart failure or shock, 13.4 percent) to $23,400 (scheduled angioplasty or bypass surgery, 11.8 percent). The average cost of a heart attack readmission is 64 percent the cost of an initial heart attack admission, which is $20,800 on average. 4. Pneumonia (Statistical Brief #142, 2009 data) —The average cost of a pneumonia readmission is $13,000, with a 15.3 percent readmission rate.
