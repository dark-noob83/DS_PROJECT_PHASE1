This is exactly the same principle. Usually, for a water wheel electric generator you need at least 3 feet of fall and at least 20 gallons per minute of flow. The more fall and flow you have, the more potential power you can generate. You can measure flow by building a weir in the creek and measuring how fast it will fill up a 5 gallon bucket. For the overshot wheel the optimal diameter of the wheel is the largest possible (the drop) and the optimal rotational speed of is approximately: 21/ âˆšD where D is the diameter of the wheel (meters). You can build it from any material but the lighter, the better. Most water wheels are built from wood.
email me at: Spencer@WaterWheelPlace.com. Water wheel pictures say it all. Look at the pictures of my water wheels, get some ideas about what type of water wheel will work best for you. Drop me a line when you are ready to discuss your water wheel project and what type of water wheel I can build for you. To the left is a 7' Flared Spoke water wheel on a single side mount that the customer mounted beautifully. All of my water wheels look great but like the correct frame for a painting how you mount your water wheel can really add impact to your water feature. Pick a size (up to 12' tall) and I'll build it for you.

Large and small water wheels built to match your location and needs. Some of my water wheels are designed as moving works of art as they slowly rotate and some of my water wheels are designed to make power so take a look, get ideas, and then contact me so we can design the perfect water wheel for your location.

1 (The axle is the shaft that the wheel rotates on.). 2  To make the stand for your water wheel, you may consider tracing this pattern. 3  Just click on the link to download and print it. 4  The size of this pattern works best for a water wheel with a 6 inch diameter (the size made with a 6 inch long protractor). Watch your water wheel at work by attaching a bucket to the axle. Punch holes into the top of the egg carton section with a skewer so that a piece of string can be looped through to make a handle. Attach a larger piece of string from the handle of the bucket to the axel of the water wheel.
4. Outline the water wheel's stand by tracing an A shape on the cardboard or foam board using a pen or a pencil. The A should be 4 inches (10.16 cm) tall by 4 inches (10.16 cm) wide. At the very top middle point of the A shape, mark a small v shape; this will be the inlet that the axle is placed in. 11. Pin or glue together the A shaped water wheel support system. Do so by attaching the rectangular support beams to the left side of one of the A shapes, directly under the horizontal line across the middle of the shape. Do the same for the second support beam on the right hand side.
Tips. 1  To make a miniature bucket, use the small piece of an egg carton that holds an egg. 2  If using hot glue, make sure your water wheel is completely dry before testing it with water. 3  If you want a more durable and long lasting water wheel, use a foam board and hot glue gun; both are waterproof. 11.
