Results. Creatinine and creatinine clearance tests measure creatinine levels in your blood and urine. These tests give information about how well your kidneys are working. The creatinine clearance value is found from the amounts of creatinine in the urine and blood and from the amount of urine you pass in 24 hours. 
Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. 
Creatinine levels tend to be higher in men and people with large muscles. Measuring creatinine is only the first step to finding your level of kidney function. The normal serum creatinine range for men is 0.5-1.5 mg/dL. The amount of creatinine in your urine is compared to the amount of creatinine in your blood. Your doctor may test your urine by asking you to collect your urine for 24 hours in a special container. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy men is 97-137 mL/min.

For this reason, BUN and creatinine are used together to measure kidney function. If kidney function begins to decline, BUN and creatinine rise. A normal creatinine depends on muscle mass and age. In general, a normal creatine is 0.5 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). A normal BUN is 7 to 20 mg/dL. Remember that different laboratories use different testing equipment, and may have slightly different ranges for normal. 
The range for a normal test result depends on your age and gender. For adults younger than 40, normal levels are typically in the range of: 107 to 139 mL/min or 1.78 to 2.32 mL/s (SI units) for men. 87 to 107 mL/min or 1.45 to 1.78 mL/s (SI units) for women. Creatinine clearance rates go down as you age. For newborns, the normal range is 40 to 65 mL/min. An abnormal creatinine clearance rate may mean you have a problem with your kidneys. Or it may mean a problem somewhere else in your body is affecting blood flow to the kidneys.
1. Women usually have lower results on the serum creatinine test because they have a lower muscle mass in their bodies. The average range for women is between 0.6 and 1.1 mg/dL and for men it increases to between 0.7 and 1.3 mg/dL. As with the urine creatinine test, the average results can vary depending on the lab and their specific tests and procedures. 1. The 24 hour sample of urine creatinine will usually range between 500 and 2000 mg/day. The specific results will vary based on a personâ€™s lean body mass and age. For men, the normal range should be between 14 and 26 mg per kilogram of body mass each day and for women these values should be between 11 and 20.
The creatinine levels in both urine and blood are determined and compared. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy women is 88-128 mL/min. and 97 to 137 mL/min. in males (normal levels may vary slightly between labs). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is another indicator of kidney function. Urea is also a metabolic byproduct which can build up if kidney function is impaired. The kidneys maintain the blood creatinine in a normal range. Creatinine has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. Elevated creatinine level signifies impaired kidney function or kidney disease.
