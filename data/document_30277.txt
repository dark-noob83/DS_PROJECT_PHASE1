Overview. The anatomy of the uterus consists of the following 3 tissue layers (see the following image): The inner layer, called the endometrium, is the most active layer and responds to cyclic ovarian hormone changes; the endometrium is highly specialized and is essential to menstrual and reproductive function.
The wall of the uterus is thick and has 3 layers: 1  endometrium – The inner layer that lines the uterus. 2  It is made up of glandular cells that produce secretions. 3  myometrium – The middle layer, which is made up mostly of smooth muscle.
The uterus is made up of an external layer of smooth muscle called the myometrium, and an internal layer called the endometrium.
The wall of the uterus is thick and has 3 layers: 1  endometrium – The inner layer that lines the uterus. 2  myometrium – The middle layer, which is made up mostly of smooth muscle. 3  perimetrium – The outer serous layer that covers the body of the uterus and part of the cervix.
The wall of the uterus is made up of three main layers. The inner most layer is the Endometrium. The middle layer is the Myometrium and the outer most layer is the Perimetrium … , or adventitia or serosa. 3 people found this useful.
Uterus. The uterus is made up of an external layer of smooth muscle called the myometrium, and an internal layer called the endometrium. The endometrium has three layers: stratum compactum, stratum spongiosum (which make up the stratum functionalis) and stratum basalis.
The middle layer, or myometrium, makes up most of the uterine volume and is the muscular layer, composed primarily of smooth muscle cells. The outer layer of the uterus, the serosa or perimetrium, is a thin layer of tissue made of epithelial cells that envelop the uterus. The female reproductive organs.
