The presence of EtG in urine is a definitive indicator that alcohol was ingested. Other types of alcohol, such a stearyl, acetyl and dodecanol, metabolizes differently and will not cause a positive result on an EtG test.
Alcohol is metabolized by the body at the rate of approximately 1 standard drink every hour (if you want to be safer, you can use 1 1/2 hour) If you were to drink 6 beers (12 ounce), the alcohol would be eliminated in approximately 6 - 9 hours.

EtG is a metabolite of Ethyl Alcohol, and can be detected for longer periods of time after ingestion than simply testing for Ethyl Alcohol. This test is not an under the influence test. The specimen will be screened, and if necessary will be tested by GC/MS.
