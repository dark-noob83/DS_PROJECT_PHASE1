Our test Element EX AWD wore a $24,595 base price and is currently on sale at Honda dealerships. The Dog Friendly package can be tacked onto any EX model at a cost of $995, or roughly 10 times what Grady cost in 2003. How Does It Drive? Aside from the dog accessory package, this is pretty much the same Element that Honda has been selling since 2003 and that we last tested in 2006, when it finished fourth in a four-way comparison test of boxy mini-haulers.
Vehicle: 2007 Honda Element EX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 5M). I had this car for three years and about 32,000 miles, drove it across the country and in Montana for a year. The drive is good, not remarkable. 
The 2016 Honda HR-V AWD LX, EX, and EX-L Navi have a wide range of luxury and technology features, and whichever trim you choose, Honda’s Real Time All-Wheel Drive with Intelligent Control has your back.

Well, my 2004 Honda Element EX (manual, and all-wheel drive) now had 143000 miles on it and counting. I have to say, I have owned or co-owned 20 vehicles in 25 years and the Element has quickly made its way to the top 3 overall. I love this vehicle! First of all the sobering news-how much has it cost me. Well, it is an SUV with 143K, so you're going to have to replace some wear items at some point.
Powering the Element is Honda's i-VTEC 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that also sees duty in the Accord and CR-V. For the Element's purposes, it produces 160 horsepower at 5500 rpm and 161 pound-feet of torque at 4500 rpm. It's mated to either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic, both of which come from the CR-V, along with its four-wheel disc brakes and automatic four-wheel-drive system. So how does all this work?

AWD System. The simplest way to identify an AWD Element is by the Real-Time 4WD badge on the rear liftgate. Also, through the 2008 model year, the all-wheel-drive version had the rear sunroof and the front-wheel-drive version did not. But the litmus test is to look underneath the chassis for a driveshaft and a rear differential. 
The Element followed a concept vehicle called Model X, developed by a core group of Honda R&D engineers in 1998 and debuted at the 2001 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. For 2009, the Honda Element got a navigation option and some cosmetic changes to the exterior. The hood and grill were redesigned, the front fenders were now all metal rather than painted composite material, and the wheel arches were squared off. The moonroof was no longer available for 2009-2011.
