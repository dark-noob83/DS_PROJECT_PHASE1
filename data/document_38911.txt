The Bible says: After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth. Genesis 5:32 That statement means that Noah was 500 years old when he began to have his three sons. Yet from Genesis 11 we have this: Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.
Shem, Ham & Japheth. The three sons of Noah, according to the Bible, were to be responsible for the re-populating of the world after the flood. Though Noah had three sons, it would be Shem through whom the promised seed of the woman would be transmitted.
Note concerning Noah’s sons. “And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. “ Genesis 9:18 and 19. “And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Noah had three sons according to the book of Genesis: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. After the Flood, these sons and their wives and their offspring repopulated the world. Bible scholars debate over oldest, middle, and youngest.
When Noah and his family stepped out of the Ark, they were the only people on Earth. It fell to Noah’s three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives, to repopulate the Earth through the children that were born to them after the Flood.
T he sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan. These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled. Noah was the first tiller of the soil. He planted a vineyard; and he drank of the wine, and became drunk, and lay uncovered in his tent.
The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth. Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard.
