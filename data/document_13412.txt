Report Abuse. Any lab can run a CBC within a few hours. Depending on what lab you had your blood drawn at they would probably sen out for the ANA. When a lab sends out a test is can take anywhere from 2 -3 days to a week. I have worked in hospital and outpatient labs for six years now and run many tests myself.
If your blood sample is being tested only for a complete blood count, you can eat and drink normally before the test. If your blood sample will be used for additional tests, you may need to fast for a certain amount of time before the test. Your doctor will give you specific instructions.

As most labs are not open on weekends, it could be as long as monday afternoon before they are completed and posted to your doctor. I could get all technical and tell you how these tests are done,but it would be a huge post.
In most cases, emergency CBCs are reported back in less than an hour. Results of routine CBCs for hospital in-patients are made available in three to six hours. Majority of specimens handled at RML are for outpatient services and are usually shipped to a central location.
It depends on the lab and processing time, but a CBC and a Chem 20 test takes less than 20-30 mins to process. If it is drawn at a lab and taken somewhere else to process, it may take a day or two.
