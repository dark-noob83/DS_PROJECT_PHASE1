Bikini Atoll is one of the 29 atolls and five islands that compose the Marshall Islands. These atolls of the Marshalls are scattered over 357,000 square miles of a lonely part of the world located north of the equator in the Pacific Ocean. They help define a geographic area referred to as Micronesia.
Bikini Atoll is the first World Heritage site for the Marshall Islands. The World Heritage Committee, on August 1, 2010 at its 34th session in Brazil, inscribed the Bikini Atoll Nuclear Test Site on the World Heritage List.
In 1954, Bikini Atoll was reactivated as a test site until the US terminated nuclear-weapon testing in the Marshall Islands in 1958. Prior to the first nuclear test in 1946, the 167 Bikinians living on Bikini Island were evacuated to neighbouring islands. By the time nuclear-weapon testing in the Marshall Islands was terminated in July 1958, twenty three nuclear-weapon tests had been conducted on Bikini Atoll over a 12-year period.
The Bikini Atoll is located in the Micronesian Islands in the Pacific Ocean. There are 23 islands surrounding a deep lagoon. The Bikini Atoll is significant due to its being â€¦ the site of nuclear bomb testing.
Bikini Bottom is located in the Pacific Ocean at the bottom of the sea, below its signature island, Bikini Atoll, found by Kevin Atalay and Jochem Pouw according to Stephen Hillenburg.
Bikini Atoll is located 850 kilometers northwest of Majuro on the northern fringe of the Marshall Islands and is composed of more than 23 islands and islets. Four islands (Bikini, Eneu, Nam and Enidrik) account for over 70% of the land area.
