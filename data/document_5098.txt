Cobalt(III) nitrate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Co(NO 3) 3. 
Cobalt nitrate is the inorganic cobalt (II) salt of nitric acid, often with various amounts of water. It is more commonly found as a hexahydrate, Co(NO 3) 2 ·6H 2 O, which is a red-brown deliquescent salt that is soluble in water and other polar solvents. Anhydrous cobalt(II) nitrate adopts a three-dimensional polymeric network structure, with each cobalt(II) atom approximately octahedrally coordinated by six oxygen atoms, each from a different nitrate ion. Each nitrate ion coordinates to three cobalts.
Procedure: 1. Carefully weigh approximately 2.0g of the cobalt(II) nitrate hexa-hydrate [Co(NO 3) 2 ł 6H 2 O)]crystal on a weighing paper on the balance. 2. Record the exact mass of the cobalt(II) nitrate hexa-hydrate in the data table and transfer it to a 100 mL beaker. 
Cobalt(II) nitrate is formed by the interaction of cobalt oxide, hydroxide or carbonate with nitric acid. As well as the anhydrous compound Co(NO 3) 2, there are several hydrates of cobalt(II) nitrate. Anhydrous cobalt(II) nitrate adopts a three-dimensional polymeric network structure, with each cobalt(II) atom approximately octahedrally coordinated by six oxygen atoms, each from a different nitrate ion. Each nitrate ion coordinates to three cobalts.
