it holds all of the cell organelles, or stuff in the cell, together The cytoplasm acts like the cell s skeleton. it is a jelly like substance around nucleus The cytoplasms function in a plant cell is to help gel the parts of the cell in place but it is also where many of the cells chemical reactions happen.
All animals and plants are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, and often have chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole.
The cytoplasm of the animal cell is a gel-like material made of water. It fills the cells and contains proteins and important molecules that are necessary for the cell. The cytoplasm is made of proteins, carbohydrates, salts, sugars, amino acids and nucleotides. Cytoplasm holds all the cellular organelles.
The cytoplasm is the cytosol and all the organelles (minus the nucleus) in the cell. Its main function is suspension of the organelles, their nutrients, and products. The cytoplasm function in a plant cell is almost similar to the cytoplasm function in an animal cell. it holds all of the cell organelles, or stuff in the cell, together.
