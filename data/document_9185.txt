Introduction. The respiratory system consists of the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchial tree, and the lungs. Its primary function is the basic exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. It filters the air that enters the body and exchanges gases within air sacs in the lungs called alveoli.

The Respiratory System: Anatomy Review 1. Fill in the missing organs of the respiratory system: ________________ (air enters) → nasal cavity → _________________ (both air and food move through) → trachea → ___________________ (large tubes leading to both lungs) → lungs.
Air enters the body through the nose or mouth, which are connected through the nasal and oral cavities to the pharynx, through which air passes to the larynx and food to the esophagus. Air passes through the larynx (the voicebox), and then to the trachea, the windpipe.
Share to: In the breathing system, the air enters at the nostrils (nares) , passes through the nasal cavity (where some smell detectors are located) , and enters the trachea. Sid … e branches of this system the Eustachian tubes communicate with the middle ear to allow for the balancing or air pressure across the eardrum.
