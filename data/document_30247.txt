trigone of bladder a triangular region of the wall of the urinary bladder, an area in which the muscle fibers are closely adherent to the mucosa; its three angles correspond with the orifices of the ureters and urethra. Called also vesical trigone. olfactory trigone the triangular area of gray matter between the roots of the olfactory tract. vesical trigone the smooth triangular portion of the mucosa at the base of the bladder, bounded behind by the interureteric fold, ending in front in the uvula of the bladder.
The area is very sensitive to expansion and once stretched to a certain degree, the urinary bladder signals the brain of its need to empty. The signals become stronger as the bladder continues to fill.

A triangular smooth area at the base of the bladder between the openings of the two ureters and that of the urethra. Synonym(s): trigonum vesicae [TA] , vesical triangle.n. A smooth triangular area at the base of the bladder between the openings of the two ureters and the opening of the urethra. Also called trigone of bladder.
Contraction of this muscle expels urine from the bladder. On the superior surface, the outer layer of the bladder wall is parietal peritoneum. In all other regions, the outer layer is fibrous connective tissue. There is a triangular area, called the trigone, formed by three openings in the floor of the urinary bladder. Two of the openings are from the ureters and form the base of the trigone. The urinary bladder is a temporary storage reservoir for urine. It is located in the pelvic cavity, posterior to the symphysis pubis, and below the parietal peritoneum. The size and shape of the urinary bladder varies with the amount of urine it contains and with the pressure it receives from surrounding organs.
