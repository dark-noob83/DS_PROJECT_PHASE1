PEAFOWL BASICS. Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) are beautiful birds that are native to Southeast Asia. The male peafowl is called a peacock; the female peafowl is called a peahen. In the wild, they live in deciduous tropical rainforests. Peacocks do not migrate. A group of peafowl is called a muster. Anatomy: The male peafowl, the peacock, is about 7 feet long with a full train. The female, the peahen, is about 3 feet long. Both have a fan-shaped crest on the head called the corona.
Peacocks are not migratory birds. The blue peacock lives year-round in India and Sri Lanka and the green peacock in Java and Myanmar. A third species, the Congo peacock, lives in Africa. If they aren’t inhabiting their native lands, they are in zoos all around the world.
