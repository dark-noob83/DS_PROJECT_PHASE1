Gran is short for granulocyte. The White Blood Count (WBC) in a blood test result is broken down into Granulocytes (GRAN) and Lymphocytes (LYM). White blood cells are part of … the immune system. An elevated level of granulocytes is indicative of a bacterial infection
For example, WBC is white blood cell count-yours is normal but if it was up it could indicate an infection. Basically your hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal so you are not anemic. The tests you should be asking your doctor about, for example, is what is your glucose (blood sugar). 
Answers. Best Answer: Granulocytes. It is part of your white blood cells and if it is high it indicates your body is fighting off something. If your blood sugar is high, this is probably kidney related.
Blood test result showed 38% gran. 1. Get help from a doctor now ›. Nope: The total WBC is important to know for sure, but this percentage is unlikey to be of any consequence. Blood test result shows a low 38 % in the granulocyte and a high 20 in the mono category. 5. Get help from a doctor now ›. Nope: Percentages not as important as the absolute numbers. 38% for gran and 20% mono not exciting at all.
I'm wondering how to read my lab results, GRAN% 81, LYMPH%12, LEUKOCYTE ESTER Moderate WBC/HPF 6 and SQUAMOUS EPITH 2 with APTT 36. I recieved these results on a printout from an ER visit for dizziness, weakness, and decreased sensation on the right side of my body which is still present. 
Granulocytosis occurs when there are too many granulocytes in the blood. Granulocytes are types of white blood cells that, under a microscope, appear to contain small granules or particles. These granules contain a number of proteins important for the function of the immune system. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are three types of granulocyte.
So, Ly  is an abbreviation for lymphocytes, one type of white blood cell. Gran is an abbreviation for granulocyte, a type of white cell that includes basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils. They all have granules in the cell plasma and cyte means cell, hence the name granulocyte. Also, what does it mean when your Gran % is high and you Ly % is low...same with gran # and ly #. (Yes I called my doctor, but he hasn&#39;t called me back yet.) =) I&#39;m pregnant, my rbc/hgb/hct is low, but that&#39;s normal for me during pregnancy.
And again, there is a normal range for this. All white blood cells are involved in fighting infection. So, Ly  is an abbreviation for lymphocytes, one type of white blood cell. Gran is an abbreviation for granulocyte, a type of white cell that includes basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils. They all have granules in the cell plasma ... more.
