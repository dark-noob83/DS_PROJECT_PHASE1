The overtime rate payable for non-workmen is capped at the salary level of $2,250, or an hourly rate of $11.80. For overtime work, your employer must pay you at least 1.5 times the hourly basic rate of pay. Payment must be made within 14 days after the last day of the salary period. A non-workman earns $2,400 a month and works 2 hours of overtime.
As an example, if the normal hourly rate is $12.50 per hour, and an employee receives a shift differential of $1.50 per hour, the regular rate of pay for that employee would be $14.00 per hour. 29 C.F.R. 778.110 covers the issue of the regular rate for employees who are paid a simple hourly rate.
The total would still be 12.5 hours, but there would be two regular rates involved. The overtime pay would consist of 10.5 hours at 1.5 times the regular rate for the office work, plus two hours at 1.5 times the regular rate for the phone work at home.
Thus a $6 hourly rate will bring, for an employee who works 46 hours, a total weekly wage of $294 (46 hours at $6 plus 6 at $3). In other words, the employee is entitled to be paid an amount equal to $6 an hour for 40 hours and $9 an hour for the 6 hours of overtime, or a total of $294. (b) Hourly rate and bonus. If the employee receives, in addition to his earnings at the hourly rate, a production bonus of $9.20, the regular hourly rate of pay is $6.20 an hour (46 hours at $6 yields $276; the addition of the $9.20 bonus makes a total of $285.20; this total divided by 46 hours yields a rate of $6.20).
Bunnings pay rates are actually pretty good. I, myself, work there, and as a 15 year old, I earned $11 an hour, and now, at 17, I earn $13 an hour (This is as a casual employee).
