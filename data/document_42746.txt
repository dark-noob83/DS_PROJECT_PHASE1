Endothermic (and exothermic) analysis only accounts for the enthalpy change (∆H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the Gibbs free energy (∆G), which includes an entropy (∆S) and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo- , derived from the word endon (ἔνδον) meaning within and the root therm (θερμ-) meaning hot.. The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed.
Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, without necessarily being in the form of heat. The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo- , derived from the word endon (ἔνδον) meaning within and the root therm (θερμ-) meaning hot.. The intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed.
In thermodynamics, the term exothermic process (exo- : outside) describes a process or reaction that releases energy from the system, usually in the form of heat, but also in a form of light (e.g. a spark, flame, or flash), electricity (e.g. a battery), or sound (e.g. explosion heard when burning hydrogen). In an adiabatic system (i.e. a system that does not exchange heat with the surroundings), an exothermic process results in an increase in temperature of the system. In exothermic chemical reactions, the heat that is released by the reaction takes the form of electromagnetic energy.
Thus in each term the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs. The term endothermic was coined by Marcellin Berthelot. The concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to, for example, chemical reactions, where thermal energy is converted to chemical bond energy. Endothermic. In thermodynamics, the word endothermic describes a process or reaction in which the system absorbs energy from its surroundings in the form of heat. It is a modern coinage from Greek roots.
A reaction in which energy is released to the surroundings is called an exothermic reaction. In this type of reaction the enthalpy, or stored chemical energy, is lower for the products than the reactants. The release of energy in chemical reactions occurs when the reactants have higher chemical energy than the products. The chemical energy in a substance is a type of potential energy stored within the substance. This stored chemical potential energy is the heat content or enthalpy of

Photos.com/AbleStock.com/Getty Images. A chemical reaction is the transformation of one or more chemical substances, called reactants, into another set of chemical substances, called products.. Chemical reactions involve the breakage and formation of chemical bonds, and this has an associated transfer of energy. Endothermic Reactions. Endothermic chemical reactions absorb energy from their surroundings. Usually these reactions cause the surroundings and the reaction mixture to decrease in temperature.
Its etymology stems from the Greek prefix έξω (exō, which means outwards) and the Greek word θερμικός (thermikόs, which means thermal). The term exothermic was first coined by Marcellin Berthelot. The opposite of an exothermic process is an endothermic process, one that absorbs energy in the form of heat. The concept is frequently applied in the physical sciences to chemical reactions, where as in chemical bond energy that will be converted to thermal energy (heat). In an adiabatic system (i.e. a system that does not exchange heat with the surroundings), an exothermic process results in an increase in temperature of the system. In exothermic chemical reactions, the heat that is released by the reaction takes the form of electromagnetic energy.
