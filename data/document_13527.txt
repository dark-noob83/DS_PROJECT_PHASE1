Some people prefer sodium chloride, while others prefer potassium chloride. Even though these two products compete for sales in the softening salt market, the fact is there’s plenty of room for both to thrive. In water softener salts – as in life – there’s no accounting for taste.

Sodium chloride solution. Since the inception of the modern water softener to soften water, salt (sodium chloride) has been the agent of choice to regenerate softener resin. The earliest work done by German scientist Gans in 1905 determined that the water softener resin could be regenerated with salt.
BRINE: A concentrated solution of salts (sodium chloride or potassium chloride) that help replaces calcium and magnesium ions during a water softener’s ion exchange process. BRINE TANK: One of two tanks that make up a water softener, this tank is filled with the salt solution. The other tank is filled with resin.
Sodium and Chloride and Water Softeners Introduction Salt or sodium chloride is commonly used in water softeners to remove thehardness from water in homes and businesses. Softening of water is done toreduce the deposit of minerals in pipes, as well as on fixtures.
It’s the most commonly used salt in water softener brine tanks. When the brine solution containing sodium chloride washes over the resin, the hard mineral ions in the water are replaced with sodium. Sodium chloride brands are commonly available in a variety of forms including blocks, crystals, pellets and cubes.
