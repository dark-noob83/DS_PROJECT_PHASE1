Songwriter earnings are unpredictable and notoriously difficult to estimate. Without a detailed record of all record sales, downloads, streams, radio spins, and licenses to TV, films, and advertisements, it's impossible to know how much a song has earned. That said, I can give you a framework. 
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: When you become a songwriter or write songs for others, you sign a paper giving them permission to you use it and if they make money, you have to settle on a percentage like 30% of all the sales. This way, if the song plays on the radio, it is $50 to $100 a pop everytime they play it. 
An average hit song on the radio today will earn the songwriter $600-800,000 in performance royalties. For example, The Black Eyed Peas song Boom Boom Pow has had 6.3 million single sales and 3.15 million album sales to date which equates to $860,000 in songwriting royalties. Artists can earn $300,000 if their song is used in a national commercial or film and $50,000 for a prime time television show. As we learned with Gary though, if you write the actual theme song, your royalty stream can be much more valuable. 4) Print rights – a rare royalty paid any time the printed sheet music is sold.
Singer-songwriters are hired to write commercial jingles for advertising, songs for other artists or original songs for their own performances. A 2011 survey by the Future of Music Coalition found that singer-songwriters in the U.S. reported making an average annual income of $34,455. For example, a unionized singer-songwriter hired after April 15, 2012, for a minimum three-hour studio session to record for a movie, would earn a minimum of $265.91.
RS has a list of ten big recent songs, and how much the songwriters likely made on them, and it's over here to look at. Did you know the dude that wrote Closing Time also helped write Someone Like You? You do now. And also, the fact that Will.i.am made so much money on Boom Boom Pow is the worst. 
With better royalties you would make even more-up to $12.5 million (£12.5 million) for a five year period, or $2.5 million (£2.5 million) a year.   So the secret is to strive to be an author that writes not just one best seller but several-and negotiates a decent royalty. 
Here are some facts: 1. Songwriters make some of their income from mechanical royalties. In the US, the royalty used to be 8.5 cents per song per unit (CD) sold. On January 1st, 2006 it became 9.10 cents. An album that sells 500,000 copies in 2006, would give the songwriter $45,500 per song. [This post was originally written in 2006. Seven years later, it is much, much more difficult for songwriters to make an income from their songs because record labels are going under in, well, record numbers!].
Nevertheless the average yearly salary of a songwriter was estimated at being around $40,000 in 2006. Of this group, the middle half made anywhere from $23,600 to $60,400, with the lowest 10% making less than $15,200. The highest 10% of this group made more than $110,900. 
A single song on a million selling CD could earn $69,000. for the songwriter. If it was the hit, getting lots of airplay, it could earn millions. CD sales are down by 20% in the quarter ending June 2007, and continuing to decrease. Downloads seem to be the way more folks want to buy these days, increasing by millions. A songwriter owns 100% of the songwriting royalties, and 100% of the publishing royalties. Royalties are the fees radio and tv and other income generating venues pay for the privilege of using the songwriter's intellectual property. Sometimes they let the artist have a percentage of the songwriting royalty.
