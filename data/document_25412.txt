Overview. The planet is overrun by robots and the desert surface is a wasteland that only changes when storms shift the sands. In ReCore, play a young woman named Joule/Jewel who is trying to survive the harsh landscape and enemy robots while searching for clues about what happened to the rest of the human race. Your initial companion is a robot in the form of a dog, Mack, who just showed up one day. Fight against increasingly larger foes using a wide range of tools, including a grappling hook and your robot friend.
