Balance With Photosynthesis. Respiration is the antithesis to the process of photosynthesis, in which carbon dioxide and water are taken in by autotrophs, along with sunlight, to make glucose and oxygen. Autotrophs include any photosynthesizing organisms, such as plants and algae, all of whom also undergo respiration.
Respiration is a metabolic process common to all living things. Here, you will learn the definition, location, processes, and formula for cellular respiration. At the end, you can test your knowledge with a short quiz.
When we examine the equation for cellular respiration, we see that the reactants are glucose and oxygen (for aerobic respiration), and the products are carbon dioxide, water, and ATP. Note the number of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water molecules involved in each 'turn' of the process.
Medical Definition of INORGANIC. 1. b: forming or belonging to the inanimate world. 2. : of, relating to, or dealt with by a branch of chemistry concerned with substances not usually classified as organic. — in·or·gan·i·cal·ly \-i-k(ə-)lē\ adverb.
Respiration In the most simple terms, respiration simply means breathing. But more formally, the term depends on what type of respiration you are referring to. Essentially … , respiration refers to gaseous exchange of unwanted carbon dioxide and much-needed oxygen for the body's use.
Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide. 1  Oxygen is needed in most organisms to release energy from organic molecules (via aerobic respiration). 2  Organic molecules are synthesised by plants from an inorganic stock of atmospheric carbon dioxide (via photosynthesis).
Respiration is the chemical process by which organic compounds release energy. The compounds change into different ones by exergonic reactions. There are two types of respiration: 1  aerobic, which requires oxygen and releases lots of energy.
Respiration is the antithesis to the process of photosynthesis, in which carbon dioxide and water are taken in by autotrophs, along with sunlight, to make glucose and oxygen.
Respiration is the biochemical process in which the cells of an organism obtain energy by combining oxygen and glucose, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide, water, and ATP, the currency of energy in cells.
