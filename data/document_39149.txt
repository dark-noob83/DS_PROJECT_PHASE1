WPA is a wireless encryption format and the passphrase is in the wireless security section of your router. Here is a link to one of the Sticky topics at the top of this forkum that should be of assistance.
A wireless network with WPA-PSK encryption requires a passphrase (the pre-shared key) to be entered to get access to the network. Most wireless drivers accept the passphrase as a string of at most 63 characters, and internally convert the passphrase to a 256-bit key.
WPA stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access. It is a standard security protocol implemented by Wi-Fi alliance to secure wireless computer networks. WPA standard is advancement over WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) standard that had several security issues.

Shares & Saves. Save. On a wireless network, the WPA key is a passphrase that protects the network from outside intruders. If a wireless router is set up with WPA encryption, you need the WPA key for network access and to make changes network settings.
