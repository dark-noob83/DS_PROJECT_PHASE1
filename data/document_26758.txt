In May of 2008, Stream Energy/Ignite was one of only two companies from the United States to receive the top awards from the annual Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories Award ceremonies held this year at the G-Force event in Berlin, Germany. (They don't hand these awards out to known pyramid schemes).
Currently their start-up kit is $329 versus our $429. (2) Ignite Energy does operate in the state of Georgia so if you live there or have a lot of contacts there, it could tip the scale for you. On this point though, it’s only a matter of time before Ambit expands to Georgia, so this one advantage won’t last long.
Ignite Energy is an MLM company with a focus in electricity and gas. Ignite Energy is available in only 5 deregulated states. These are Maryland, New York, Texas, New Jersey, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. Ignite was founded in 2004, and has reached an impressive level of sales at $861 Million in 2011 (down from $902 million in 2010).
Ignite Energy is located in McKinney, Tx and currently does business in Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Services are offered in states that have deregulated their electric and gas which make the power to choose services in the customers hands.
Stream Energy’s Power Up! One of the ways that the Stream Energy/Ignite team helps make a difference in our community is through our free Power Up! Program. This program is available for Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington, D.C. Residential/Commercial customer enrollments.
If you add up all the levels of leadership bonuses paid out in the Ambit compensation plan you will come to $240, which is $15 more than the total of $225 that Ignite Energy pays out through their similar leadership bonus structure. This one is pretty cut and dry… more states = more opportunity.
