The painkilling effects of ibuprofen start soon after the dose is taken. However, the anti-inflammatory effects take some time. It can take even 3 weeks to get you best results. The half-life of Ibuprofen is about 2 hours, meaning that after two hours, only ½ of the active dose will be present in the system. After 3 half-lives (or 6 hours) there is 1/8th remaining, which isn’t enough to make out any effects. After 12 half-lives (or 1 day), there is only 1/4096th remaining or almost none. 
A RealAge answered. When you have a toothache, an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help ease discomfort (but never put aspirin against the gums near the toothache, as this may burn the gum tissue). Rinsing your mouth with warm salt water can ease gum swelling. A topical anesthetic may also help. If there’s an infection, pain medication won’t make that go away and it could spread to cause more problems. That said, over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin can all reduce the pain, but none of these treats the cause.
