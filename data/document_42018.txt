Parent material is the geologic material from which soil horizons form. Many soils have more than one parent material, for example loess over till. Chapter I discussed parent materials, along with the four other soil forming factors.
Parent material, from which soil develops, comes from many different sources. This is due to the fact that parent material is not static. Soils form in parent material that is not just bedrock weathered in place. Parent material is classified based on its mode of transportation: ice, water, gravity, wind, lakes and oceans, or in place. Parent Material Deposited by Ice. Parent material transported by ice is known as glacial till. This parent material is found where glaciers have deposited material, such as in terminal moraines or lateral moraines. Ice itself is a poor sorter of soil particles. The force carrying particles is able to carry particles of all sizes the same distance.

The term parent material can be used in geology, chemistry or radioactivity for three of many examples. In Earth science and geology, it may refer to mineral composition that weathers easily can produce more soil, for example. In nuclear physics, it is the radioactive material that decays to produce daughter nuclei.
Parent material is a term for the general physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition of the unconsolidated material, mineral or organic, in which soil forms.
Description. Parent material is a term for the general physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition of the unconsolidated material, mineral or organic, in which soil forms. Mode of deposition and/or weathering may be implied by the name.
Parent material is the underlying geological material (generally bedrock or a superficial or drift deposit) in which soil horizons form.
