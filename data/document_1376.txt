Average Wattage. An average 21-cubic-foot side-by-side refrigerator-freezer demands about 780 watts when in operation. Once you know the wattage demanded by your refrigerator, you can figure out how much the refrigerator costs to run. Because refrigerators cycle on and off all day and night, the U.S. Department of Energy’s rule of thumb is to assume eight hours of operating time per day. If your refrigerator demands 780 watts, multiply 780 by eight hours to get 6,240 watts per day. Divide that amount by 1,000 to get 6.24 kilowatt-hours. If your utility charges 13 cents per kilowatt hour, for example, your refrigerator will cost you 81 cents per day or $24.30 per month for electricity
A typical large side-by-side refrigerator demands 780 watts. Knowing the wattage demanded by a refrigerator is important when considering whether to replace your current refrigerator with a more energy-efficient model or looking into different ways of reducing your overall electric consumption. Because refrigerators cycle on and off all day and night, the U.S. Department of Energy’s rule of thumb is to assume eight hours of operating time per day. If your refrigerator demands 780 watts, multiply 780 by eight hours to get 6,240 watts per day. Divide that amount by 1,000 to get 6.24 kilowatt-hours. If your utility charges 13 cents per kilowatt hour, for example, your refrigerator will cost you 81 cents per day or $24.30 per month for electricity
When the motor is running it uses the same power-number of watts-all the time. To find the energy used (in watt-hours) you multiply the watts used by the total time in hou … rs. So if it uses 500 watts and is on for 3 minutes each hour, it uses 500x3/60 watt hours each hour, or 600 watt-hours in one day. 6 people found this useful. Dave Woodruff. 28,643 Contributions. Passion, is the electrical trade. Downfall, is being a perfectionist. A 25 watt bulb uses 25 watts, a 40 watt uses 40 watts, a 60 watt bulb uses 60 watts, a 75 watt bulb uses 75 watts, a 100 watt bulb uses 100 watts, all … the way up to a 500 watt bulb. Incandescent bulbs are about to cease to exist, so this answer is only good through the fall.
1 For example, a 300-watt refrigerator will only run at 300 watts when the compressor's running (which is when it makes that humming sound, indicating that it's actually chilling the air inside). 2  Most of the time the fridge just sits there, using only 5 watts or so for its electronics. 1 The amount of electricity listed on the label is the maximum amount that the appliance will ever use. 2 
A fridge will use anywhere from 100 to 400 watts depending on size, an average modern fridge will use 180 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a refrigerator using 180 Watts for 24 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Cost Per Hour: 
Multiply the hours used on the average day by the wattage listed below. This will give you the watt-hours consumed per day. Remember that some items, such as garage door openers, are used only for a fraction of an hour or minute per day. A 300-watt item used for 5 minutes per day will only consume 25-watt hours per day. 
Your refrigerator's wattage is toward the higher end of the spectrum among the appliances in your home. Clothes dryers use a minimum of 1,800 watts but may use as much as 5,000 watts. Dishwashers use about 1,800 watts. DVD players, laptop computers and alarm radios all use 50 watts or less. Find the voltage and amperage of the refrigerator; for instance, you may see 115 V and 6.5 amps.. Multiplying these two numbers tells you how many watts your refrigerator uses -- in this case, 747.5 watts.
Generally, household wiring is 120 or 240 volts. To determine the amount of wattage a branch circuit can handle, multiply the circuit's amperage by the circuit's volts. A 20-amp, 120-volt circuit can handle 2,400 watts. The following list gives you the average wattage rating for common household equipment. First, you need to know how many amperes, or amps, for which a circuit is rated. An amp is the amount of electrical current that flows through a circuit. In most homes, lighting and small appliance circuits are 15 or 20 amps, and major appliances are on 20, 50 or even 60 amp circuits.
Calculating Wattage. Open your refrigerator and look for a sticker that lists technical specifications. Find the voltage and amperage of the refrigerator; for instance, you may see 115 V and 6.5 amps.. Multiplying these two numbers tells you how many watts your refrigerator uses -- in this case, 747.5 watts. Smaller refrigerators typically use about 350 watts, while larger models use as much as 780 watt
