• Tendon connects the end of a muscle to any place of the bone, whereas ligaments always connect bones at their joints. • There is only one tendon for a particular muscle at one end while there are few ligaments connecting two bones at a joint. • Tendons have more collagens than ligaments do.
ligaments connect bone to bone, tendons connect muscle to bone and cartilage is the semi solid bones that are present at the places where they required. For example: our exter … nal ears, nose, between 2 joints cartilage is present.
On one level, there is not much difference organically between a ligament and a tendon. Both are formed from chains of collagen cells produced by proteins stored in the body. This is where the similarity stops, however. A ligament acts much like a shock absorber and connects bone to bone.
A ligament is a fibrous structure that connects bone to bone. Tendons, on the other hand, hold bones to muscles. That is actually the main difference. Ligaments are actually fibrous structures which are strong and lengthy which in turn hold both of the bones together well.
Ligaments are strong rope like structures that connect the joints and hold organs in place. They hold the bones together and also allow limited movements of the bones across the joint. Ligaments are made up of type I (90%) and III (10%) collagen Tendons attach muscles to bones or to other body parts.

Yes, The difference between ligaments and tendons are ligaments are BONE TO BONE. And the tendons are BONE TO MUSCLE. Ligaments are the tough tissue that attaches bones at j … oints and tendons are tough tissue also but attach the bone to muscle (or muscle to bone, vice versa). Answered.
