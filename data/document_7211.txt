Generally, dentists must complete a bachelor's degree, pass the Dental Admissions Test (DAT), and complete four years of study to earn a Doctor of Dental Surgery or Doctor of Dental Medicine. Finally, they must obtain licensure from their state board of dentistry to practice in the profession.
It typically takes about 10 years to become an orthodontist. It takes 4 years to obtain a bachelor's degree, another 4 years of dental school, and then 2 more years in a post doctoral program devoted to the study of orthodontics.
Although general dental school usually includes some courses and clinical experience in pediatric dentistry, you'll want to complete additional education in the form of a certificate and/or master's degree program in pediatric dentistry, which can take from 18 months to three years to complete.
Dental School. Like all dentists, pediatric dentists must earn one of two degrees: Doctor of Dental Surgery or Doctor of Dental Medicine. The degrees are equivalent and require a minimum of four years of study at dental school. Admission to dental school is competitive.
Residency Program. The two-year pediatric dentistry residency program, started after graduation from dental school, immerses dentists in scientific study and clinical experience.
Dental School is 4 years. Yes, in the third year of dental school you would apply, but you still have to finish the fourth year to get your Doctoral degree then start your two year residency in ortho. So, 10 years after high school.
Dentists may choose to specialize in a particular field of dentistry, such as orthodontics or pediatric dentistry. To become a specialist, dentists must complete 2-4 years of postdoctoral education, and they might be required to complete a 2-year residency program in their field of choice.
