The 1972 MGB's horn is through the center of the steering wheel, with a center style steering wheel horn button. The Mountney boss/hub also has a center style steering wheel horn button. However there is no way that I can determine to utilize the original horn system. I figure this is what I get for a lower price wheel and boss/hub. But to the horn... I would have to drill holes in the base of the boss for screws to attach the original brass plate from my original wheel. Not sure if the plate would even make contact with the brass connector in the shroud.
Motion capture (Mo-cap for short) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. It is used in military, entertainment, sports, medical applications, and for validation of computer vision and robotics. In filmmaking and video game development, it refers to recording actions of human actors, and using that information to animate digital character models in 2D or 3D computer animation. This process may be contrasted to the older technique of rotoscope, such as the Ralph Bakshi 1978 The Lord of the Rings and 1981 American Pop animated films where the motion of an actor was filmed, then the film used as a guide for the frame-by-frame motion of a hand-drawn animated character.
Since the original hub is only 2-3 high and the Mountney hub is 5 high the steering wheel is now 2 closer to the driver, which wasn't something I planned for, as I'd like the wheel closer to the dash, not closer to the driver. I figure this is what I get for a lower price wheel and boss/hub. But to the horn... I would have to drill holes in the base of the boss for screws to attach the original brass plate from my original wheel. Not sure if the plate would even make contact with the brass connector in the shroud.
Poultry. Poultry is a category of domesticated birds kept by humans for the purpose of collecting their eggs, or killing for their meat or feathers. These most typically are members of the superorder Galloanserae, especially the order Galliformes and the family Anatidae, commonly known as waterfowl. Poultry also includes other birds which are killed for their meat, such as pigeons or doves or birds considered to be game, such as pheasants.
Then the wheel and boss connect to the steering shaft via the 1-1/16th nut. My original wheel & boss/hub fit down the steering shaft enough so that the nut was below the top of the shaft by at least the thickness of the nut. Meaning that there was a good 3/8 shaft exposed above nut. My new wheel results in the nut being flush with the top of the shaft. I figure this is what I get for a lower price wheel and boss/hub. But to the horn... I would have to drill holes in the base of the boss for screws to attach the original brass plate from my original wheel. Not sure if the plate would even make contact with the brass connector in the shroud.
The first award of the Distinguished Flying Cross was made by President Calvin Coolidge on May 2, 1927, to ten aviators of the Air Corps who had participated in the U.S. Army Pan American Flight, which took place from December 21, 1926 to May 2, 1927. The Distinguished Flying Cross was designed by Elizabeth Will and Arthur E. DuBois. The medal is a bronze cross pattee, on whose obverse is superimposed a four-bladed propeller, 1 11/16 inches in width.
And some part of the pay gap may also be due to gender discrimination – women are about twice as likely as men to say they had been discriminated against at work because of their gender (18% vs. 10%).

Facts please.
