Voice and Data Cabling Average Costs. You can expect to pay anywhere from $100 up to $500 per drop for voice and data cabling installation. Many companies will charge you a single price for the entire project (for example, $20,000 to install 75 drops).
The project parameters indicate that roughly $500 of cable is required, and the average electrician costs will be roughly $50 per point of connection-meaning that another $500 will be necessary for proper installation.
Universal cabling generally refers to the installation of one uniform type of wiring and one set number of terminations for every workstation. In a traditional (or non-universal) scenario, new cables must be pulled when a user moves, and one move can cost as much as $2500.
The cost of cabling is a significant part--from 5% to 20%--of the overall communications costs. Both new cabling installations and upgrades can run from $2 to $5 per square foot and, for technologically intensive applications, increase to $50 per square foot.
1 A California MIS operator paid around $14,000 for a new system with 150 drops using 5e wiring. 2  A Georgia telecom company paid roughly $7,000 for 58 new voice and 51 new data runs. 3  One Arizona programmer paid $75 per hour, in addition to travel and material costs, for a cable installation upgrade.
The cost of cabling to cat6 is $250 for every one thousand feet. For this discussion we will look at the costs of installing ten lines of Cat6 (with an average of 200 feet per line) the average home office to such service.
