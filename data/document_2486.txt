Energy from glucose is obtained from the oxidation reaction. where a mole of glucose (about 180 grams) reacts with six moles of O 2 with an energy yield δG = 2870 kJ. The six moles of oxygen at STP would occupy 6 x 22.4L = 134 liters. When oxidized in the body in the process called metabolism, glucose produces carbon dioxide, water, and some nitrogen compounds and in the process provides energy which can be used by the cells.
A molecule of glucose, which is broken down by an organism into carbon dioxide and water in a process called glucose oxidation. A strand of DNA, which is created by the energy that is produced through glucose oxidation. Mitochondria use the by-products of glucose oxidation to produce ATP. Water molecules are one product of glucose oxidation.
The oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide is the same as above.The Cl(V) in the chlorate ion is reduced to Cl(-I) in the chloride anion for a reduction of 6 electrons. Multiplying the reduction half reaction by 4, to use 24 electrons, and combining the oxidation and reduction half reactions gives us the net reaction. An aldehyde can be oxidized to a carboxylic acid group.

Redox reactions, or oxidation-reduction reactions, have a number of similarities to acid–base reactions. Like acid–base reactions, redox reactions are a matched set, that is, there cannot be an oxidation reaction without a reduction reaction happening simultaneously. Because there is no net change in charge during a redox reaction, the number of electrons in excess in the oxidation reaction must equal the number consumed by the reduction reaction (as shown above). Elements, even in molecular form, always have an oxidation state of zero.
Glucose oxidation is a chemical process that provides energy for an organism to carry out all of its required activities. During this process, glucose, a simple sugar molecule obtained from food, is broken down into carbon dioxide and water. A strand of DNA, which is created by the energy that is produced through glucose oxidation. Mitochondria use the by-products of glucose oxidation to produce ATP. Water molecules are one product of
Oxidation describes the loss of electrons by a molecule, atom or ion. Reduction describes the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom or ion. These reactions mutually occur of course. Whenever there is oxidation there is reduction, and whenever there is reduction there is oxidation. this is the oxidation of glucose which is the central (but not sole) mechanism whereby we derive our energy from in the form of energy storing molecules such as ATP and GTP, with electron carriers such as NAD+ and FAD+ helping the process.
Oxidation Reactions of Sugars The oxidation of sugars provides energy in cellular respiration. Sugars are also the precursors to the other organic molecules in organisms. Stepwise oxidation of an alcohol function group in a sugar produces an aldehyde or ketone. An aldehyde can be oxidized to a carboxylic acid group.

The carbon dioxide is the oxidized form of carbon while the water is the oxidized form of hydrogen, hence the oxidation of glucose which consists of carbon and hydrogen as well as oxygen. The presence of the latter, oxygen, indicates that glucose as a molecule is already more oxidized than the equivalent hydrocarbon. 
Redox reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed; in general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between species. Because there is no net change in charge during a redox reaction, the number of electrons in excess in the oxidation reaction must equal the number consumed by the reduction reaction (as shown above). Elements, even in molecular form, always have an oxidation state of zero.
Glucose oxidation is an aerobic process, a chemical reaction that requires oxygen. The term oxidation, in fact, refers to any reaction where oxygen is combined with another molecule, which is then said to be oxidized. A strand of DNA, which is created by the energy that is produced through glucose oxidation. Mitochondria use the by-products of glucose oxidation to produce ATP. Water molecules are one product of
