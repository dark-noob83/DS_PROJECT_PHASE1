Fuel combustion, also known as burning fuel, is the process by which a fuel is consumed in an exothermic chemical reaction that released a great deal of heat and light. Usually, the fuel that is combusted is a hydrocarbon that reacts with the oxygen in the air. Fuel is burned to create an energy source. The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide. Natural gas is one of the most common fossil fuels used in fuel combustion reactions.
Combustion takes place when fuel, most commonly a fossil fuel, reacts with the oxygen in air to produce heat. The heat created by the burning of a fossil fuel is used in the operation of equipment such as boilers, furnaces, kilns, and engines. Along with heat, CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and H 2 O (water) are created as byproducts of the exothermic reaction. In practice, in order to achieve complete combustion, it is necessary to increase the amounts of air to the combustion process to ensure the burning of all of the fuel. The amount of air that must be added to make certain all energy is retrieved is known as excess air.
Burning a fuel is called combustion, a chemical process that we study in middle or high school. Because combustion is so important for aircraft and rocket propulsion, we will review the fundamentals. Combustion is a chemical process in which a substance reacts rapidly with oxygen and gives off heat. The original substance is called the fuel, and the source of oxygen is called the oxidizer. The fuel can be a solid, liquid, or gas, although for airplane propulsion the fuel is usually a liquid. The oxidizer, likewise, could be a solid, liquid, or gas, but is usually a gas (air) for airplanes. As a result of combustion, exhausts are created and heat is released. You can control or stop the combustion process by controlling the amount of the fuel available, the amount of oxygen available, or the source of heat.

Combustion /kəmˈbʌs.tʃən/ or burning is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. Incomplete combustion will occur when there is not enough oxygen to allow the fuel to react completely to produce carbon dioxide and water. It also happens when the combustion is quenched by a heat sink, such as a solid surface or flame trap.
The primary use of fuel combustion is energy. The most common fuels used for the production of energy are fossil fuels, which are made up of ancient, decomposed organic matter. Oil, coal, and natural gas are three of the most common fossil fuels used in fuel combustion reactions. In a combustion reaction, a compound reacts with an oxidizing agent or oxidant, such as oxygen to release heat and energy. The chemical reaction is as given below. CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O + energy.
Main Image: Combustion or burning is the sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant (a chemical compound that readily transfers oxygen atoms) accompanied by the production of heat and conversion of chemical components. In a combustion reaction, a compound reacts with an oxidizing agent or oxidant, such as oxygen to release heat and energy. The chemical reaction is as given below. CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O + energy.
Oxy-fuel combustion is the process of burning a fuel using pure oxygen instead of air as the primary oxidant. Since the nitrogen component of air is not heated, fuel consumption is reduced, and higher flame temperatures are possible. 
Uncatalyzed combustion in air requires fairly high temperatures. Complete combustion is stoichiometric with respect to the fuel, where there is no remaining fuel, and ideally, no remaining oxidant. Thermodynamically, the chemical equilibrium of combustion in air is overwhelmingly on the side of the products. Incomplete combustion will occur when there is not enough oxygen to allow the fuel to react completely to produce carbon dioxide and water. It also happens when the combustion is quenched by a heat sink, such as a solid surface or flame trap.
