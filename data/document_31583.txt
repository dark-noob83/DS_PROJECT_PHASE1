In most cases, there are three numbers at the bottom of a check, and your account number is the one in the middle. However, occasionally you'll find checks that use a different format, so it's a good idea to confirm your account number before trying to use anything that you grab off of a check.
You will find these numbers on the cheques issued for your account. The branch transit number, financial institution number, and bank account number are located at the bottom edge of your cheque. Branch transit numbers are always 5 digits long and financial institution numbers are always 3 digits long. Bank account numbers may be up to 12 digits long. Below is an example of a cheque:
Your account number: You can find your account number on your checks (see below) or in the top right corner of your statement, directly below the date range. Your routing number: You can find your routing number on your checks (see below) or by identifying the state where you opened your checking account.
These numbers are all standardized in the United States for ease of processing. So no matter where you are, the bank can tell by the numbers on the check what bank the funds are drawn on, the account number and even your check number. Here's how to find those numbers for yourself.
