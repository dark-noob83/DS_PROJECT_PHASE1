1 Put tenderloin on rack in roasting pan and roast 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425°F and cook until thermometer inserted diagonally into center of meat registers 130°F, 20 to 25 minutes for medium-rare. 2  Let beef stand on rack in pan 10 minutes before serving.
The proper temperature to cook a medium-rare steak is 130° - 135° F. Although, according to foodsafety.gov, beef, lamb, and pork should be cooked to at least 145° (or above, if desired). Ground meat must be cooked to at least 160° F. Ground poultry must be cooked to at least 165°.
Cooking times vary, depending on the size of the tenderloin. Many recipes involving beef tenderloin call for a 2 1/2 to 3 lb. cut. Beef tenderloins retain their shape when tied with kitchen string. If you're unsure how to tie the tenderloin yourself, a butcher can do it for you.
Insert a meat thermometer into the center of the tenderloin. For a 2 1/2 to 3 lb. tenderloin, a meat thermometer should read 145 F for medium-well. For the same size tenderloin, medium-well should take roughly 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the beef tenderloin from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before eating.
Roasting the Tenderloin. We cooked the beef tenderloin at 350°F for about 60 min. until the temperature at the thickest part of the roast reached 135°F. After removing it from the oven and covering with tinfoil, we let it rest for approximately 15 minutes.
Roasting Beef Tenderloin 1. Remove the tenderloin roast from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to bring the meat to room temperature. 2. Trim and peel as much fat and skin as you can from the tenderloin if your butcher has not already done so.
