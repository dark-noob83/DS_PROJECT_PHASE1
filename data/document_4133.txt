Try to work the glaze into the scored lines. 5 Place ham in oven. Cook for about 1 1/2 hours (check after 1 hour, will take longer if the ham is not at room temp to begin with), or about 10 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature of the ham is 110°-120° (use a meat thermometer).
Once you get to your destination, keep the ham wrapped up until it is ready to serve.....but if you are able, if there is an oven there, put it on a high temp and just put your ham in the oven for a few minutes to reheat before serving. law4me01 · 8 years ago. Thumbs up. 0. 
1 Bake until internal temperature reaches 155°F. 2  Allow ham to rest for 15 minutes and the internal temperature should rise to 160°F during this time. 3  Remove skin and fat while the ham is still warm and carve as desired. 4  If glazing, leave a 1/4-inch layer of fat on the ham. 1 Do not cover the ham. 2  Place in a preheated oven and bake (see Time and Temperature Chart below). 3  Bake until internal temperature reaches 155°F. 4
You can preheat your oven on low (200-225), put the meat in a Pyrex 9 x13 pan, cover it with foil, and continue on with your recipe. Sometimes I will keep the meat on the top of the stove and not bother with that, if it won't be too long til I need to add the meat back in or plate it. There is often enough heat on top of the stove to keep it fairly warm.
1 Place the ham in an oven preheated to 325°F for 20 to 25 minutes per pound or until internal temperature reaches 155°F on a meat thermometer. 2  Be sure the cooking bag is not touching the sides or top of the oven, otherwise the bag might melt. 3  Remove the ham from the oven and discard the bag and drippings. 1 Do not cover the ham. 2  Place in a preheated oven and bake (see Time and Temperature Chart below). 3  Bake until internal temperature reaches 155°F. 4  Allow ham to rest for 15 minutes and the internal temperature should rise to 160°F during this time.
Reheat in a 325-degree oven until it reaches an internal temperature of 135 to 140 degrees. You can also place the ham in an oven bag. Figure no more than 10 minutes per pound for reheating. For hams that are fully cooked (again, check the label) and not spiral sliced, first cut off any skin. Place in a 325-to-350 degree oven, brush with some glaze if desired and bake until heated through and the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees. Again, figure no more than 10 minutes per pound. An 8-pounder will take 1 hour and 20 minutes.

1 Add water to keep ham covered. 2  Take ham from the pan and while warm, remove the skin and fat as desired. 3  If a sweet coating is desired, sprinkle the fat side with brown sugar and bread crumbs and bake in a 400 degree oven until brown (approximately 15 minutes). 1 Preheat oven to 300 degrees. 2  Once oven temperature reaches 300 degrees, bake approximately 3 hours or 20 minutes per pound. 3  Using a meat thermometer, check for a 163 degree internal temperature in the thickest part of the ham.
