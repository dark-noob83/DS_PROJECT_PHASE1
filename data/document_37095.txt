A person with type II diabetes will never need to take insulin. False. most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually need insulin to keep their diabetes in control. In general, the sooner insulin is started, the better off the patient will be in terms of preventing complications. Today's modern insulins and treatment regimens (basal-bolus programs) make insulin a user-friendly therapy. Starting insulin early is the key to improved control and a longer and healthier life for all patients with type 2 diabetes. Added 5/7/2012 7:34:27 PM
When an antigen enters the body, it stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. (The immune system is the body's natural defense system.) The antibodies attach, or bind, themselves to the antigen and inactivate it. Every healthy adult's body has small amounts of thousands of different antibodies. Each one is highly specialized to recognize just one kind of foreign substance. Immune response: The production of antibodies in response to foreign substances in the body. Immunity: The condition of being able to resist the effects of a particular disease. Immunization: The process of making a person able to resist the effects of specific foreign antigens.
In immunology, an antigen (Ag) is any structural substance that serves as a target for the receptors of an adaptive immune response, TCR or BCR or its secreted form antibody. Different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific epitopes present on the antigen surface. Hapten is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope. In order to induce an immune response, it has to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as a protein.
2. an antigen present on human erythrocytes that is exposed by treatment with neuraminidase or contact with certain bacteria. see CD a. T-dependent antigen one that requires the presence of helper T cells to stimulate antibody production by B cells; most antigens are T-dependent. T-independent antigen an antigen that can trigger B lymphocytes to produce antibodies without the participation of T lymphocytes. conjugated antigen antigen produced by coupling a hapten to a protein carrier molecule through covalent bonds; when it induces immunization, the resultant immune response is directed against both the hapten and the carrier.
Antigens are large molecules, usually proteins, on the surface of cells, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and some non-living substances such as toxins, chemicals, and foreign particles. Any substance capable of triggering an immune response is called an antigen. Skip to content. Antibodies, also called immunoglobulins, are large Y-shaped proteins which function to identify and help remove foreign antigens or targets such as viruses and bacteria. Every different antibody recognizes a specific foreig
Allergen: A foreign substance that causes an allergic reaction in the body. B cells: Cells produced in bone marrow that secrete antibodies. Immune response: The production of antibodies in response to foreign substances in the body. Immunity: The condition of being able to resist the effects of a particular disease. Immunization: The process of making a person able to resist the effects of specific foreign antigens.
antigen. Any substance that can stimulate an immune response in the body and can react with the products of that response, that is, with specific antibodies or specifically sensitized T lymphocytes, or both. Antigens include bacteria, foreign substance (e.g. dust mite, grass, pollen of trees), toxins and viruses. conjugated antigen antigen produced by coupling a hapten to a protein carrier molecule through covalent bonds; when it induces immunization, the resultant immune response is directed against both the hapten and the carrier.
In summary an antigen is a molecule that binds to Ag-specific receptors, but cannot induce an immune response in the body by itself. The term originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody. It expanded to refer to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment that can be recognized by highly variable antigen receptors (B-cell receptor or T-cell receptor) of the adaptive immune system. Different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific epitopes present on the antigen surface. Hapten is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope. In order to induce an immune response, it has to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as a protein.
