Physical. Salmonella bacteria are rod-shaped gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria do not retain the crystal violet dye used in the gram staining method due to the fact that they have cell walls that are thin. Gram-negative bacteria are often harmful to a host, which is the case for many of the Salmonella bacteria. Salmonella bacteria are between 2 and 5 micrometers long and 0.7 to 1.5 micrometers in diameter. They have flagella, which are tail-like projections made of proteins that help the bacteria to move
Name of the Organism: Salmonella spp. Salmonella is a rod-shaped, motile bacterium -- nonmotile exceptions S. gallinarum and S. pullorum --, nonsporeforming and Gram-negative. There is a widespread occurrence in animals, especially in poultry and swine.
Salmonella /ˌsaelməˈnɛlə/ ˌsælməˈnɛlə is a genus of-rod (shaped) bacillus bacteria of The enterobacteriaceae. Family there are two species Of, Salmonella salmonella bongori And salmonella. enterica There are two species of Salmonella, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica is further divided into six subspecies and over 2500 serovars.
Salmonella bacteria are rod-shaped, non spore-forming motile microbes that can be found in poultry, pigs, cows, pets, and many wild animals. There are more than 2,000 different serotypes of the bacteria, but it's Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium that cause more than 50% of human infections. Salmonella bacteria are the most common cause of food borne illnesses. Find out more about salmonella bacteria characteristics with our salmonella FAQ.
Infection and Immunity, 174-180. Salmonella typhimurium is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium (Figure 1). When grown on ordinary agar, the organism forms spherical smooth colonies about two to four millimeters in diameter. 
The thin peptidoglycan layer is characteristic of all Gram-negative bacteria. The bacterial cell Salmonella typhi is a motile bacteria and is able to move due to flagella. A flagella is a special organelle on the outside of the bacteria that looks like an eyelash or the tail of a sperm. However, this eyelash is able to whip around creating locomotion, propelling the Salmonella typhi around. Salmonella typhi is a serovar of Salmonella enterica. A serovar is a microbe that is very similar to other Salmonella enterica bacteria, but each serovar has distinct differences that cause our immune system to react differently to th
