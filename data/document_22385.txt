Keystone, Hulton Archive, Getty Images. George Harrison was the first member of the Beatles to release a solo album (the 1968 soundtrack ‘Wonderwall Music’). He was the first Beatle to score a No. 1 solo hit (‘My Sweet Lord,’ which hit the top spot in early 1971).
'Isn't It a Pity' shows up twice on Harrison's third solo album, and his first No. 1, 'All Things Must Pass.' It was also the B-side of his debut solo single, 'My Sweet Lord' (see No. 1 on our list of the Top 10 George Harrison Songs).
Harrison landed two songs on the last album the Beatles made together ('Let It Be' was recorded earlier than 'Abbey Road' but released later), and they're among his greatest tracks (check out No. 2 on our list of the Top 10 George Harrison Beatles Songs).
Harrison somehow managed to place three of his songs on 'Revolver': 'Taxman' (see No. 6 on our list of the Top George Harrison Beatles Songs), 'Love You To' and this one, a densely produced pop track featuring one of Harrison's most effortless vocals. It doesn't go too deep.
