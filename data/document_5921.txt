The lower most region of the ionosphere extending from about 50 km to 90 km is the D-region, which principally absorbs radio waves. Above the D layer is the E-region extending from 90 km to 150 km. The peak in the E region during day time is seen near 110 km.
Ozone in the Stratosphere. About 90% of the ozone in the Earth's atmosphere is found in the region called the stratosphere. This is the atmospheric layer between 16 and 48 kilometers (10 and 30 miles) above the Earth's surface. Ozone forms a kind of layer in the stratosphere, where it is more concentrated than anywhere else.
Ionosphere: The ionosphere overlaps the other atmospheric layers, from above the Earth. The air is ionized by the Suns ultraviolet light. These ionized layers affect the transmittance and reflectance of radio waves. Different ioniosphere layers are the D, E (Heaviside-Kennelly), and F (Appleton) regions.
The ionosphere is that region of the upper atmosphere of a planet where charged particles (electrons and ions) of thermal energy are present, which are the result of ionization of the neutral atmospheric constituents by electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation.
The atmosphere can be divided into layers based on its temperature, as shown in the figure below. These layers are the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere and the thermosphere. A further region, beginning about 500 km above the earth's surface, is called the exosphere.
Scientists call the ionosphere an extension of the thermosphere. So technically, the ionosphere is not another atmospheric layer. The ionosphere represents less than 0.1% of the total mass of the Earth's atmosphere.
The temperature decreases with altitude. Stratosphere: The stratosphere is found from about 7 to 30 miles (11-48 kilometers) above the Earths surface. In this region of the atmosphere is the ozone layer, which absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.
