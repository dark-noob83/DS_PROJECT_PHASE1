An Alternative Definition for IQR. In some texts, the interquartile range is defined differently. It is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values in the middle 50% of a set of data. To compute an interquartile range using this definition, first remove observations from the lower quartile.
= 12. Semi-Interquartile Range. The semi-interquartile range of a distribution is half the difference between the upper and lower quartiles, or half the interquartile range. Therefore, from the example above, it was determined that the interquartile range = 12.
Interquartile range. The interquartile range is another range used as a measure of the spread. The difference between upper and lower quartiles (Q 3 â€“Q 1), which is called the interquartile range, also indicates the dispersion of a data set. The interquartile range spans 50% of a data set, and eliminates the influence of outliers because, in effect, the highest and lowest quarters are removed.
Definition: Interquartile range is the measure of dispersion which is the difference in the values of two quartiles. The Lower Quartile is denoted as Q 1 and the Upper Quartile is denoted as Q 3. The interquartile range is Q 3 - Q 1.
Semi Interquartile range is the midpoint of the interquartile range. In other words, it is one-half of the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. Therefore, Semi-Interquartile range = $\frac{Q_{3}-Q_{1}}{2}$. Where Q 1 and Q 3 are the upper and lower quartiles respectively.
