The bronchi are the top part pf the lungs, made out of cartilage. They divide from the trachea, each lung having its separate bronchi. The bronchi further divide into bronchioles, which are smaller versions of the same thing, just branching off into different directions within the lung.
Print. Within your lungs, the main airways (bronchi) branch off into smaller and smaller passageways, the smallest of which are called bronchioles. At the end of the bronchioles are tiny air sacs (alveoli).
Glossary of Terms. Bronchus / Bronchi / Bronchioles. The airways of the lungs. When a person takes in a breath of air, the air travels through the nose or mouth, into the larynx, then into the trachea, which is the main passageway into the lungs. The trachea divides into a right and left main bronchus.
The trachea divides into a right and left main bronchus. Each major bronchus then subdivides into smaller airway passages referred to as bronchi. As the airway passages make their way out to the lung tissue, the passages become smaller and are referred to as bronchioles.
Air travels to and from the lungs though two branches of the trachea called bronchi (one branch equals bronchus; 2 is bronchi). The bronchi subdivide within the lobes of the l â€¦ ungs into smaller and smaller air vessels called bronchioles or bronchioli (singular), that terminate in alveoli.
