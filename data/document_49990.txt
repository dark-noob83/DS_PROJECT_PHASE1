2 The purpose of this paper is to provide a tool for ATA members to identify opportunities for collaboration and to better understand the interaction between telemedicine/telehealth services and health information technology (HIT) applications on local, regional and national levels. The Interrelationship between Health Information Technology and Telemedicine The goals and activities of telemedicine and health IT are complementary and synergistic. Telemedicine is a method of delivering health care that makes use of health information technologies to accomplish its goals. Conversely, health information technologies (HIT) are an enabling component to the delivery of health services over distances, providing fundamental tools and system
Telemedicine. It’s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words and that during an emergency, every second counts. With a telemedicine service in the rural hospital Emergency Departments at Mayo Clinic Health System in Barron, Bloomer and Osseo, pictures are improving emergency response. The benefit with telemedicine is the emergency medicine physicians in Eau Claire who are experienced in trauma and other critical situations are immediately involved in the care of patients,” he adds.
Telemedicine & Telehealth Initiatives Telemedicine is the use of electronic communications and information technologies to provide clinical services when participants are at different locations. Closely associated with telemedicine is the term Telehealth. This term is often used to encompass a broader application of technologies to distance education, consumer outreach, and other applications wherein electronic communications and information technologies are used to support healthcare services.
