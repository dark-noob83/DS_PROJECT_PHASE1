Jockeys generally get 10% of a purse if their mount wins a race and 5% of the purse for second through fifth. Trainers charge daily fees to cover food and other costs associated with race horses, and jockeys get paid fees (usually up to $100 per race) just for riding in a race even if their horse earns no money. Jockeys probably get something like $200 for riding in the Kentucky Derby if their horse finishes out of the money. Collectively, the prize money for the 2015 Kentucky Derby will be $2.204 million if 20 horses start the race which is almost guaranteed to happen this year. That is up 1.2% over the $2.178 million that was up for grabs in 2014.
The horses that run in the first five spots will all receive prize money in 2015. Collectively, the prize money for the 2015 Kentucky Derby will be $2.204 million if 20 horses start the race which is almost guaranteed to happen this year.

In horse racing, trainers generally get 10% of the winnings for their horses (some get a little more)
Jockeys are paid on a per mount (race) basis. The fees are between $30 per mount and $100 per mount depending on the purse structure at each particular track. Those are the fees jockeys receive if they do not finish first, second or third. The jockey of the winning horse receives an amount equal to 10% of the winning owner' s share of the total purse. So, in a race where the total purse is $50000, the winning horse receives 60% of that purse ($30000). The winning rider would then get 10% ($3000).

According to CNN Money, the top 100 jockeys received 57 percent of the purse money that went to riders in 2005, meaning the average pay pay for other 1,300-plus active jockeys was between $35,000 to $40,000. Given that jockeys average around 7 percent of the total winnings of their mounts plus a relatively small riding fee, that means that Dominguez earned around $2 million. The top 10 jockeys all earned more than $750,000 in 2012.
Purse money is paid out to the owners of the top 5 finishers in the Kentucky Derby.

It is typical/customary for a public trainer to get 10% of the purse monies won by the horses he trains. In a race with a purse of $1 million, the winner typically gets about $600,000, so the trainer will get $60,000. There may be other contractual arrangements between the owner and the trainer. Shug McGaughey, for example, is a private trainer for the Phipps, Claiborne Farm, and a few other selected patrons. So for a $1,000,000 race the winning horse might recieve $550,000-750,000, 10% of which would be $55,000-75,000. Many trainers split this amount with their stable help. Some give 1% of purse money to the groom & exercise rider, others bank all of their purse money and distribute percentages throughout the stable yard.
In return, the trainer gets the lion's share of the horse's earnings, usually 60% or higher, with the owner getting the remainder, but no bills each month, either. Sometimes trainers also make money by finding horses for their owners to buy.
