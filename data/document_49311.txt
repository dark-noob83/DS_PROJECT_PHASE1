Re: add a line cost of additional phone. Excellent response to these questions, mdram4x4 ! The only thing I want to add to this is as a possible additional cost is the one-time activation fee of $25.00 for a secondary line on a family share plan. Now we may need to add a line, and I was wondering how much it would cost for the additional phone? I know that when adding a line its an additional $10 to the plan, but are there any discounts on the phones for the new line, or will it need to be paid for at its full retail price?
The first phone number comes free, but you can also add an additional five at a cost of $2.99 per month for every additional number â€“ or at a yearly discounted premium of $29.99.
