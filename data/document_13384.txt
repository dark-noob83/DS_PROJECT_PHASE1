REBAR CHART. * Bar numbers are based on the number of 1/8 inches included in the nominal diameter of the bar. The nominal diameter of a deformed bar is equivalent to the diameter of a plain bar having the same weight per foot as the deformed bar.

The size designations up through size 8 are the number of eighths of an inch in the diameter of a plain round bar having the same weight per foot as the deformed bar. So, for example, a number 5 bar would have the same mass per foot as a plain bar 5/8 inch in diameter. The metric size is the same dimension expressed to the nearest millimeter. The sizes of the large bars are based on the square rebars formerly made. Size 9 has the same weight per foot and cross sectional area as a 1-inch square bar, size 10 as a 1 1/8-inch square bar, size 11 as a 1¼-inch square bar, size 14 as a 1½-inch square bar, and size 18 as a 2-inch square

Some rebar suppliers actually charge less per foot the longer the bar is. For example, a 10-foot stick of half-inch rebar is about $4.47. That same bar in a 2-foot length is about $1.90. However, a typical stick 1 foot long by ½ diameter weighs about .67 pounds or 2/3 pounds. At an average price of $0.75 per foot, that comes out to about $1.12 a pound in single sticks. However, quantity and size affect the end price. By the truckload, rebar costs between $0.60 and $0.80 per pound.
U.S. Sizes. Imperial bar designations represent the bar diameter in fractions of ⅛ inch, such that #8 = 8⁄8 inch = 1 inch diameter. Area = (bar size/9)2 such that area of #8 = (8/9)2 = 0.79 in2. This applies to #8 bars and smaller. Larger bars have a slightly larger diameter than the one computed using the ⅛ inch convention. 
Imperial bar sizes give the diameter in units of ⅛ inch, so that #8 = 8⁄8 inch = 1 inch diameter. The cross sectional area, as given by πr ², works out to (bar size/9.027)², which is approximated as (bar size/9)² square inches. Larger bar sizes are based on the cross-sectional area of square bars that were formerly used. The diameter of the equivalent round shapes is rounded to the nearest ⅛ inch to provide the bar size. For example, #9 bar has a cross section of 1.00 square inches, and therefore a diameter of 1.128 inches. #10, #11, #14, and #18 sizes correspond to 1 1⁄8 inch, 1 1⁄4, 1 1⁄2, and 2 inch square bars, respectively

The term units refers to the same units as the slab length. For example, if SL is 50 feet, RL = 50 feet - 0.5 feet = 49.5 feet. Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 for each slab to determine the RL associated with each slab. You will need 1 stick of rebar for every 8 inches of slab width. Instructions. Measure the entire length of the concrete slab. This is your slab length, or SL.. As an example, assume your SL is 50 feet. Calculate rebar length for the slab -- RL -- using the formula: RL = SL - 0.5 units. The 0.5 allows for sufficient clearance for fitting the rebar within the slab.
