69. My guess for the oven would be that low heat is 275, medium is 350 and high is 425. For a pan low would be a double-boiler (water boiling temp) medium would be sizzling oil, and high would be smoking. 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Common oven temperatures (such as terms: cool oven, very slow oven, slow oven, moderate oven, hot oven, fast oven, etc.) are set to control the effects of baking in an oven, for various lengths of time. A moderate oven has a range of 180–190°C (350–375°F), and a hot oven has temperature set to 200–230°C (400–450°F). A fast oven has a range of 230–260°C (450–500°F) for the typical temperature.
the temperature of a hot oven is 218-233 celcius 200 degrees celsius A domestic oven generally operates up to about 230 degrees Centigrade (450 F). 
If a recipe calls for a low oven, you need to set the temperature around 125 degrees Celsius. This temperature is perfect for long slow cooking, especially for tenderising tough cuts of meat. A medium oven means a temperature of around 180 degrees Celsius. This is a good temperature to choose if you are not sure of the temperature you need. This temperature will work well for everything from pies to cakes and even pasta bakes. A high oven means a temperature of around 230 degrees Celsius.
On the kitchen oven is a really cool dial. I turn it to 350 and trust that the oven will heat up to and remain at 350 degrees. I put in the food, set the timer, and go do something productive. When camp cooking in the outdoors, there's a bit more hit-or-miss. On my dutch oven, there's no dial, nothing to tell me how hot the oven is. So, a 12 inch oven would have 12+3=15 on top and 12-3=9 underneath. This works for any size dutch oven. Then you need to adjust briquette placement depending on the type of cooking. I feel this method puts too much heat under th
I have found that, using an IR thermometer to read pan bottom temperature after 5 minutes of heating (the temperature is no longer rising), that high corresponds to 375 degrees F, medium high to 330 degrees, medium to 300 degrees, and low to about 275 degrees. 
Place it in the centre of the oven and set the oven to 175 degrees Celsius. Check the temperature shown on the thermometer after 20 minutes and if it's not within five degrees of 175, you'll need to get the oven professionally calibrated. This is a good temperature to choose if you are not sure of the temperature you need. This temperature will work well for everything from pies to cakes and even pasta bakes. A high oven means a temperature of around 230
The various standard phrases to describe oven temperatures include words such as cool to hot or very slow to fast. For example, a cool oven has temperature set to 90°C (200°F), and a slow oven has a temperature range from 150–160°C (300–325°F). A moderate oven has a range of 180–190°C (350–375°F), and a hot oven has temperature set to 200–230°C (400–450°F). A fast oven has a range of 230–260°C (450–500°F) for the typical temperature.
1 Cook the steaks in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes. 2  The steak will still look fairly uncooked when you remove it from the oven. 3  A thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak will reveal a cooking temperature five to ten degrees lower than the desired doneness. To roast a steak: 1  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. 2  Season the steak. 3  Sear steak in a hot skillet for just a minute on each side. 4  Transfer steak to a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the preheated oven. 5  Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until desired doneness is achieved.
My new Miele oven has a temperature selection range from 400 to 575, and the factory set default temps on each of the three broiling options. My old oven had one temperature...550 and it worked fine. I assume if such a large range is given there must be a reason, and I have alot to learn about broiling in the oven.
