Frequency (the number of vibrations or waves per second) is measured in hertz (Hz). Low-pitched sounds have low frequencies; high-pitched sounds have high frequencies. There is an enormous variety of sounds in the animal world, and different types of animals make, and hear, sounds of different frequencies. Sound is made when something moves or vibrates. The movement sets up a sound wave in the surrounding air. Continuous sounds, such as drumming, are made when an object vibrates back and forth.
