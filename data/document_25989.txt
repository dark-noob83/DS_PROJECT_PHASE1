Please try again later. Here is how to fix a broken Petcock on a motorcycle. If your motorcycle's Petcock is leaky or doesn't flow fuel, you can either buy a Petcock rebuild kit, or replace the whole Petcock assembly with a new one. I chose to replace the whole Petcock. This works for Japanese motorcycles, but if you need to fix a Harley petcock, watch this video: http://youtu.be/U7W897jCFLs.
Rebuilt kits are available for the stock KLR petcock (K&L Supply Fuel Petcock Repair Kit 18-2723), however, it costs $30 and you still have to spend time reconditioning the old petcock. Also, chances are that the fuel filters are long gone, and I haven’t been able to source these separately.
Comments about K&S Fuel Petcock Repair Kit : This petcock rebuild kit matches perfectly to the stock petcock on my 1981Kawasaki 305 CSR. It took all of five minutes to pull apart the original, install the brand new gaskets, and replace the screws with the shiny new ones.
Just wanted to share with everyone that K&L makes a fuel petcock rebuild kit for XS11's. The part number for my 79SF is 185100 and comes with all the o-rings and gaskets plus the vacuum diaphram. The kit will rebuild both petcocks and it cost $32.00.
