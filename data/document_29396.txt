This height/weight chart is only suitable for adult men and women. It isn't suitable for children or young people under 18. If you want to check if your child is a healthy weight, or if you are under 18 yourself, use the BMI healthy weight calculator, which is suitable for both adults and children.

However, to stay in good health, it's still important to eat a balanced diet and include physical activity in your daily life. Adults should be active for at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) every week.
