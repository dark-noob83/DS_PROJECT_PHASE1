Brushes transfer electricity to the commutator which is connected to the winding on the armature. The brushes and commutator form a electrical connection that is good when the brushes are stationary and the commutator is spinning. The commutator on a DC motor is sectioned to power different windings at different times, creating moving field necessairy to pull the armature off a direct current.
For an electric motor or generator to function, the coils of the rotor must be connected to complete an electrical circuit. To accomplish this, a copper or brass commutator or ' slip rings ' are affixed to the shaft, and springs press braided copper wire 'brushes' onto the rings which conduct the current.
The brushes transfer the electricity from outside the motor to the spinning winding in the center of the motor. They undergo quite a lot of friction, and after a while wear out.
up vote 5 down vote. The purpose of carbon brushes is to reduce wear on the commutator, compared with what metal brushes would do. In many cases, carbon brushes can be made long enough that they will not wear out while a device would otherwise be usable; when they do wear out, they can be readily replaced.

Best Answer: commutator does not cause current to change direction. Neither do brushes. They both are a means of transferring electric power from the stationary surroundings to the rotating armature.
Armature, Commutator and Brushes. Consider the image on the previous page. The armature takes the place of the nail in an electric motor. The armature is an electromagnet made by coiling thin wire around two or more poles of a metal core. The armature has an axle, and the commutator is attached to the axle.
