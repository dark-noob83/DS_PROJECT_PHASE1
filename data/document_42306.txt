1 In general, a total cholesterol level of less than 200 mg/dL is considered desirable. 2  Depending on your health, you may need to aim for a level lower than this. 3  LDL cholesterol level. 4  LDL is short for low-density lipoprotein. 1 A low level of HDL is a major risk factor for heart disease. 2  A high level of HDL lowers your risk. 3  A level of 40 mg/dL or more is considered desirable. 4  A level of 60 mg/dL or more is considered a negative risk factor - that is, it helps to offset other risk factors for CHD.
To calculate your cholesterol ratio, divide your high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or good) cholesterol number into your total cholesterol number. An optimal ratio is less than 3.5-to-1. A higher ratio means a higher risk of heart disease. Non-HDL cholesterol, as its name implies, simply subtracts your HDL cholesterol number from your total cholesterol number. So it contains all the bad types of cholesterol. 
This ratio is determined by dividing the HDL cholesterol into the total cholesterol. If a person has a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL and an HDL cholesterol of 40 mg/dL, his or her total/HDL cholesterol ratio would be 5:1. The goal is to keep this ratio below 5:1, with the ideal being below 3.5:1. 
Total Cholesterol. A total cholesterol value below 200 mg/dL is considered optimal. A reading of 200 to 239 mg/dL is borderline high. And 240 mg/dL or above is considered high. Triglycerides. A triglyceride level below 150 mg/dL is normal. A reading from 150 to 199 mg/dL is borderline high. A reading of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, while 500 mg/dL or above is considered very high. A high triglyceride level combined with a low HDL or high LDL level increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
This test measures total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol, andtriglycerides. Your health care practitioner will be able to help you interpret the blood test results to determine if your cholesterol levels are normal or require treatment. 
LDL Bad Cholesterol. An LDL value below 100 mg/dL is considered optimal. A reading of 100 to 129 mg/dL is near or above optimal. A total of 130 to 159 mg/dL is borderline high. And 160 to 189 mg/dL is considered high, while 190 mg/dL or above is very high. Triglycerides. A triglyceride level below 150 mg/dL is normal. A reading from 150 to 199 mg/dL is borderline high. A reading of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, while 500 mg/dL or above is considered very high. A high triglyceride level combined with a low HDL or high LDL level increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
1 The higher your total blood cholesterol, the greater your risk for heart disease. 2  In general, a total cholesterol level of less than 200 mg/dL is considered desirable. 3  Depending on your health, you may need to aim for a level lower than this. 4  LDL cholesterol level. 1 A low level of HDL is a major risk factor for heart disease. 2  A high level of HDL lowers your risk. 3  A level of 40 mg/dL or more is considered desirable. 4  A level of 60 mg/dL or more is considered a negative risk factor - that is, it helps to offset other risk factors for CHD.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels less than 100 mg/dL are considered optimal, according to NCEP guidelines. As with total cholesterol, the higher the LDL number, the higher your risk for developing heart disease. The National Cholesterol Education Program defines a desirable total cholesterol level as less than 200 mg/dL, and levels for most women stay in the healthy or desirable range until middle-age. But between the ages of 45 and 55, women's average total cholesterol rises to almost 220 mg/dL.
