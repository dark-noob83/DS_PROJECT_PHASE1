It depends how deep they have to drill for the water. ANS 2 -In Canada it currently costs about $48 per foot plus a 'set up ' charge of approximately $3,500. - In my area an â€¦ average well is anywhere between 100 and 200 feet deep, so that cost would be $8,300 to $13,000.
The depth of the well drives the per-foot cost of drilling it. Even if the contractor fails to find water, the homeowner pays for every foot drilled. An average well depth in Indiana, for example, runs about 120 feet deep. At $15 per foot -- including drilling and casing -- a 120-foot well costs $1,800. A mid-range price of $22.50 per foot results in a $2,700 well, while a $30 per foot well costs $3,600 not including permit fees and equipment costs.
Professional well drillers in Nevada County, California charge $18 to $21 per foot to drill with a minimum drill of 100 feet. The drilling fee includes 20 feet of casing into bedrock and a seal and cap. 100 foot well = $1800 to $2100. 200 foot well = $3600 to $4200.
For example, two well drilling companies -- one in Pennsylvania and one that covers New Hampshire, Vermont and central Massachusetts -- state the cost for drilling a well and outfitting it with pump equipment averages between $5,000 and $7,000, at the time of publication.
1 This brings the typical total for drilling a well and setting up a private water delivery system to $3,500-$20,000 or more, but an especially deep and difficult well with a complex water system can cost $20,000-$50,000 or more, depending on depth, water yield and system complexity.
1 Drilling the well hole, installing the casing (a tubular lining that prevents the well hole from collapsing) and adding a well cap (a tight-fitting, vermin-proof top seal) typically costs $15-$30 per foot, or $1,500-$3,000 for a 100' deep well, and $6,000-$12,000 for a 400' well.
