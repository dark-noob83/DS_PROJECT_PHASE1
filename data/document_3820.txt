Making the world better, one answer at a time. The average annual distance driven per car in the USA is given as 17862 km (11099 miles).

EIA's latest STEO forecasts that Brent crude oil prices will average $68 per barrel (bbl) in 2015, with prices up to $5/bbl below that annual average early in the year. The forecast for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot prices averages $63/bbl in 2015. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook.

In 2014, about 136.78 billion gallons 1 (or 3.26 billion barrels) of gasoline were consumed 2 in the United States, a daily average of about 374.74 million gallons (or 8.92 million barrels). 3 This was about 4% less than the record high of about 142.35 billion gallons (or 3.39 billion barrels) consumed in 2007. 1 There are 42 U.S. gallons in a barrel. 2 EIA uses product supplied to represent approximate consumption of petroleum products.
The average efficiency is 21.5 miles per gallon. So the average gasoline used by each vehicle is 580 gallons annually. According to the US Bureau of Transit Statistics there were 250,844,644 registered passenger vehicles in 2006. The population of the USA is 300,000 people. Let's assume the 'average' person drives 20 miles round trip to work each week, and another 30 miles for errands, etc. 20 x 5 = 100 miles for work + 30 for all else = 130 miles (avg) per week. If we figure the 'average' car gets 24 MPG, then divide 24 into 130, which = 5.41 gallons of fuel each week. Multiply 5.41 x 52 (weeks) and that equals = 281.32 gallons
