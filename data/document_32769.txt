Now a blood pressure of 120/80 is considered normal, and blood pressure readings of 130–139 are considered pre-hypertension. Readings above 140/90 are considered high blood pressure, and the current thinking is that anyone falling into this category should be taking medication to lower blood pressure. Currently the textbook definition of normal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. But the definition of normal has changed over the years. At one time, it was believed that normal systolic blood pressure was 100 plus your age. In the 1970s, intervention wasn't even recommended until pressures exceeded 165/95.
The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, is the pressure when your heart fills with blood. The safest range, often called normal blood pressure, is a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80. This is stated as 120/80. The term “prehypertension” describes people whose blood pressure is slightly higher than normal—for example, the first number (systolic) is between 120 and 139, or the second number (diastolic) is between 80 and 89. Prehypertension can put you at risk for developing high blood pressure.
The bottom number, called the diastolic pressure, is the measurement as the heart relaxes between beats. Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension. A blood pressure level between normal and hypertension, is called prehypertension, meaning it is higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered hypertension.
The systolic blood pressure number is always said first, and then the diastolic blood pressure number is given. For example, your blood pressure may be read as 120 over 80 or written as 120/80. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). 
Ideally, we should all have a blood pressure below 120 over 80 (120/80). This is the ideal blood pressure for people wishing to have good health. At this level, we have a much lower risk of heart disease or stroke. If your blood pressure is optimal, this is great news. By following our healthy living advice, you will be able to keep it this way. If your blood pressure is above 120/80mmHg, you will need to lower it. Most adults in the UK have blood pressure readings in the range from 120 over 80 (120/80) to 140 over 90 (140/90). If your blood pressure is within this range, you should be taking steps to bring it down or to stop it rising any further. Our five top tips will show you how
Blood Pressure Ranges Chart. As you age, your blood vessels become more rigid, and it's not uncommon for your systolic pressure (the top number) to increase. Although a reading of 120/80 is considered textbook normal, someone over age 40 can have a 140/90 reading and it can be considered perfectly acceptable. Currently the textbook definition of normal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. But the definition of normal has changed over the years. At one time, it was believed that normal systolic blood pressure was 100 plus your age. In the 1970s, intervention wasn't even recommended until pressures exceeded 165/95.
