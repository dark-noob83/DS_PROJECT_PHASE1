And, food takes up less freezer space when it is vacuum-sealed. I'm not sure exactly how much less... maybe 50% less space for something like cooked meats, which is one of the main things I vacuum-seal. With a smaller freezer, the extra space is nice, though it may not matter quite so much if you have a large freezer. If you've watched those comercials on tv about how long the food lasts when vacuum sealed as compared to not being vacuum sealed in the fridge.....it really is that amazing. You really do get much longer storage life on your food. You can reseal oversized bags of chips.

I have kept meat frozen, properly wraped for up to two years. This is in a chest freezer. The freezer above your kitchen refridgerator is not cold enough to keep meat longer than a few months. The temp changes in a freezer compartment above your fridg will also effect the long term storage life of frozen foods. Re: Storing Meat in the Freezer.

I get fresh sliced lunchmeat and cheese, it keeps for about a week in a ziploc bag or butcher paper. Dry Salami lasts longer. Leftovers I keep in ziploc containers-how long depends on what it is: rice keeps for about 2 weeks, potatoes start getting funky after a few days. Some leftovers like stew and soup or full meals like lasagna I portion out and freeze for quick and easy lunches or dinner.
