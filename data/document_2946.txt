Mx = M M is the greek letter mu, by the way. Statistically speaking, an average of averages within a sample is said to very closely approximate the population average. However, where the sample size is under 30, there needs to be an adjustment for size. The mean is the average you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The median is the middle value in the list of numbers. To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order, so you may have to rewrite your list first.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In colloquial language, an average is the sum of a list of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the list. In mathematics and statistics, this would be called the arithmetic mean. However, the word average may also refer to the median, mode, or other central or typical value. In colloquial language, an average is the sum of a list of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the list. In mathematics and statistics, this would be called the arithmetic mean
In other words, your true average is the WEIGHTED average of the three averages. To weight them properly, you must think of the math average as not one data point but ten data points, the English average as not one data point but five, and the science average as not one but two data points. I'd love an ideal world, but I am realistic to know it can't happen. You can get the average of an average, but you would be averaging one number, so you would get the same result. You can get the average of a set of averages, though to make sense they will often need to be a weighted average of averages.
Yes, if you have the same number of items in each sample, then the average of the averages is the same as the overall average. The discrepancies arise where the samples are of different sizes as the average for each sample needs to be weighted appropriately. For example: the average of $ \{ 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\} $ is 2 and the average of $\{4\}$ is 4. The average of the averages is 3. But the average of all numbers is $30/14$. I hope this is enough to explain what goes wrong (you're giving equal weights to the first averages when you take their average, which isn't the correct thing to do if you want the average of all the numbers)
The average of the averages is: $$\frac{1}{3}a_1 + \frac{1}{3}a_2 + \frac{1}{3}a_3$$. These two values will be exactly the same if each school has exactly the same number of students, and will tend to be close if the schools are relatively close in size and/or the scores for the two schools are close. For example: the average of $ \{ 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\} $ is 2 and the average of $\{4\}$ is 4. The average of the averages is 3. But the average of all numbers is $30/14$.

Report Abuse. The correct way to average averages is to take a weighted average. I will explain below, but first an example to show why you cannot add two averages and then divide by 2. The average CEO salary in the United States is $2,000,000 per year. The average non-CEO salary in the United States is $50,000 per year.
