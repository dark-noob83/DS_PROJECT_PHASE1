The bottom number, called the diastolic pressure, is the measurement as the heart relaxes between beats. Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension. A blood pressure level between normal and hypertension, is called prehypertension, meaning it is higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered hypertension.

If your blood pressure is within this range, you should be taking steps to bring it down or to stop it rising any further. Our five top tips will show you how.

The heart normally beats about 60 to 80 times every minute when a person is at rest. This is called the heart rate. In some people, the heart rate may be even less than 60 beats per minute (bpm), and this is perfectly safe as long as they feel well, have normal blood pressure and their heart speeds up with exercise. Olympic athletes commonly have heart rates of 30 to 40 bpm. For adults, a normal resting rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Athletes may have a rate as low as 40 bpm because their hearts are trained to efficiently pump blood. If your heart rate is consistently below 60 or above 100, you may have a heart condition, such as arrhythmia
Blood pressure, body temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate are the routine vital signs measured in medicine. As infants and children grow and age, their normal values for vital signs change. Body temperature does not change with age, and normal body temperature is considered 98.6 F (37 C). 
Ideally, we should all have a blood pressure below 120 over 80 (120/80). This is the ideal blood pressure for people wishing to have good health. At this level, we have a much lower risk of heart disease or stroke. Most adults in the UK have blood pressure readings in the range from 120 over 80 (120/80) to 140 over 90 (140/90). If your blood pressure is within this range, you should be taking steps to bring it down or to stop it rising any further. Our five top tips will show you how.
