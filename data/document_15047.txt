MINIMUM PLAYER SALARY EXCEPTION -- Teams can offer players minimum salary contracts even if they are over the cap. Contracts can be up to two years in length. For two-year contracts, the second season salary is the minimum salary for that season. The contract may not contain a bonus of any kind.
The maximum player salary, per year, has been based on a player's years of service and a percentage of the salary cap. For players with fewer than seven years of experience, the maximum salary in the last year of the old CBA was $13,603,750. Between 7-10 years, it was $16,324,500. Ten or more years, $19,045,250.
NBA contracts are signed by players to play for a team for one to five years in length. Depending on the number of years a player has played in the NBA, contracts have minimum and maximum annual amounts. Contracts can include player or team options and the money owed can also be non-guaranteed or partially guaranteed, though most key players are on largely guaranteed deals.
