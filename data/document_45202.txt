Juror Pay. Federal jurors are paid $40 a day. While the majority of jury trials last less than a week, jurors can receive up to $50 a day after serving 10 days on a trial.
Grand Jury. Federal jurors are paid $40 a day. Jurors can receive up to $50 a day after serving 45 days on a grand jury. (Employees of the federal government are paid their regular salary in lieu of this fee.) Jurors also are reimbursed for reasonable transportation expenses and parking fees.
Petit Jury. Federal jurors are paid $40 a day. While the majority of jury trials last less than a week, jurors can receive up to $50 a day after serving 10 days on a trial.
Juror Pay California pays jurors $15 every day starting on the second day of service, except employees of governmental entities who receive full pay and benefits from their employers while on jury service. Because governmental employers already pay these jurors, the courts do not pay them an additional daily fee.
Texas law does not currently require that jury duty leave be paid, except for those who are salaried exempt employees (see below). A bill that would have required employers to pay $40 of jury duty pay for the first day of jury service did not pass during the 81st general session of the Texas Legislature in 2009. The general rule under both Texas and federal law is that an employer does not need to pay for time not worked.
11. Everyone who reports for jury duty will be paid, regardless of whether or not you are selected to serve on a trial. Jurors are paid $40 per day plus 56.5 cents per mile. Your employer may or not pay you for time spent on jury service.
Jurors' daily fee is set by statute at $5 per day for grand jurors and for petit jurors (N.J.S.A. 22A:1-1.1). In addition to that daily fee, the statute requires that petit jurors receive an additional $35 per day starting on their fourth consecutive day of service and each day thereafter.
