Harberger's triangle, generally attributed to Arnold Harberger, refers to the deadweight loss (as measured on a supply and demand graph) associated with government intervention in a perfect market. This can happen through price floors, caps, taxes, tariffs, or quotas. In a perfectly competitive market, producers would have to charge a price of 10 cents and every customer whose marginal benefit exceeds 10 cents would have a nail. However, if there is one producer who has a monopoly on the product, then they will charge whatever price will yield the greatest profit.

The deadweight loss that is associated with a monopolistically competitive market is a result of. a. price falling short of marginal cost in order to increase market share. b. price exceeding marginal cost. c. the firm operating in a regulated industry. d. excessive advertising costs. b. produce a total quantity of output that falls short of the Nash-equilibrium total quantity. c. produce a total quantity of output that exceeds the Nash-equilibrium total quantity. .d.

Causes of deadweight loss can include monopoly pricing (in the case of artificial scarcity), externalities, taxes or subsidies, and binding price ceilings or floors (including minimum wages). The term deadweight loss may also be referred to as the  excess burden  of monopoly or taxation. In a perfectly competitive market, producers would have to charge a price of 10 cents and every customer whose marginal benefit exceeds 10 cents would have a nail. However, if there is one producer who has a monopoly on the product, then they will charge whatever price will yield the greatest profit.
Price will equal marginal cost at the profit-maximizing level of output; profits will be positive in the long run. Price will always equal average variable cost in the short run and either profits or losses may result in the long run. Marginal revenue will equal marginal cost at the short run, profit-maximizing level of output; in the long run, economic profit will be zero. Marginal revenue will equal average total cost in the short run; long-run economic profits will be zero. If both answer honestly, each receives a payoff of $100. If one answers honestly and the other lies, the liar gains at the expense of the honest player. In the event, the liar receives a profit of $500 and the honest player gets nothing. If both lies, then each receives a payoff of $50.
Short-run equilibrium of the firm under monopolistic competition. The firm maximizes its profits and produces a quantity where the firm's marginal revenue (MR) is equal to its marginal cost (MC). The firm is able to collect a price based on the average revenue (AR) curve. . A monopolistically competitive firm might be said to be marginally inefficient because the firm produces at an output where average total cost is not a minimum. A monopolistically competitive market is productively inefficient market structure because marginal cost is less than price in the long run.
a. equals the output level that would prevail in a competitive market. b. equals the output level that would prevail in a monopoly. c. exceeds the monopoly level of output, but falls short of the competitive level of output. b. produce a total quantity of output that falls short of the Nash-equilibrium total quantity. c. produce a total quantity of output that exceeds the Nash-equilibrium total quantity. .d.

In economics, a deadweight loss (also known as excess burden or allocative inefficiency) is a loss of economic efficiency that can occur when equilibrium for a good or service is not achieved or is not achievable. In a perfectly competitive market, producers would have to charge a price of 10 cents and every customer whose marginal benefit exceeds 10 cents would have a nail. However, if there is one producer who has a monopoly on the product, then they will charge whatever price will yield the greatest profit.
