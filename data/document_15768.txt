Looking first at the installed cost per MW (megawatt, not megawatt-hour) for wind turbines, the report comes up with an average cost of $1,630 per kW (kilowatt, not kilowatt-hour). That’s an impressive $300 drop from the 2012 annual report, and a whopping $600 drop from the 2010 average. But, notsofast on that $1,630. 
The costs for a utility scale wind turbine range from about $1.3 million to $2.2 million per MW of nameplate capacity installed. Most of the commercial-scale turbines installed today are 2 MW in size and cost roughly $3-$4 million installed. Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.
The total installation cost can be expressed as a function of the wind system’s rated electrical capacity. A grid-connected residential-scale system (1-10 kW) generally costs between $2,400 and $3,000 per installed kilowatt. That’s $24,000-$30,000 for a 10 kW system. A medium-scale, commercial system (10-100 kW) is more cost-effective, costing between $1,500 and $2,500 per kilowatt. Large-scale systems of greater than l00 kW cost in the range of $1,000 to $2,000 per kilowatt, with the lowest costs achieved when multiple units are installed at one location.
1 The cost of electricity can be reported in dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh) or cents per kilowatt-hour (c/kWh) as commonly seen on residential electricity bills. 2  For example, $50 per MWh = 5 cents per kWh. 3  An average U.S. home uses 11,000 kWh or 11 MWh each year. 1 The Department of Energy finds that “ Among a large sample of wind projects installed in 2012, the capacity-weighted average installed cost stood at nearly $1,940/kW, down almost $200/kW from the reported average cost in 2011 and down almost $300/kW from the reported average cost in both 2009 and 2010 .” [3].
If a wind turbine costs $1,254/kW and has a 30% capacity factor, it will generate power for about 2.4¢/kWh–not counting future generation as less valuable. The only reason wind power seems expensive is because investors severely discount the value of future generation. 
Home or Farm Scale Wind Turbines. Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more). Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.
The return on the wind turbine investment, the payback period and the cost per kilowatt-hour of wind generated electricity are essential factors in determining whether a particular installation is worthwhile or not. The figure shows that the price per kilowatt falls as the turbine power output increases. For small turbines of just one or two kilowatts, the price is in the range from around 4500 to 6500 per kilowatt of installed power.
Economies of Scale. Because of economies of scale, comparing a 150 kW wind turbine with a 600 kW machine, the price of the larger turbine will be roughly triple, instead of quadruple the price of the smaller turbine. This is simply due to the fact that not everything scales up
The most common turbine erected at the moment would have a 1000 kW generator, a tower 60 to 80 metres high and a rotor with a diameter of 54 metres. £800 per Kilowatt Average. For a large, modern wind turbine (in the 1000 kW range) is approximately £800 per kW of electrical power to install. A 1000 kW turbine would be expected to produce 26,280,000 kWh in a year*, although this depends on the wind. Because of economies of scale, comparing a 150 kW wind turbine with a 600 kW machine, the price of the larger turbine will be roughly triple, instead of quadruple the price of the smaller turbine.
