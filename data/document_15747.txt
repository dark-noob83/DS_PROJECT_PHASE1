It occurs when iron comes into contact with oxygen. It is a slow chemical reaction, so iron needs to be exposed to oxygen for a period of time before it will rust. The rust is the new product that is formed from the chemical reaction between the atoms in the iron, the air, and the water. Here is an experiment you can do at home to observe rust
Colors and porous surface texture of rust. Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. When impure (cast) iron is in contact with water, oxygen, other strong oxidants, or acids, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of electrochemical reactions.
Other forms of rust exist, like the result of reactions between iron and chloride in an environment deprived of oxygen – rebar used in underwater concrete pillars is an example – which generates green rust. When impure (cast) iron is in contact with water, oxygen, other strong oxidants, or acids, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of electrochemical reactions.
The best known reaction of iron is rusting, in which iron reacts with oxygen and water to form red hydrated Fe2O3. Wrapping a thermometer bulb in wet steel wool results in a small but noticeable temperature rise; rusting is exothermic. The same pigment can be obtained from the reaction of iron(II) with ferricyanide: The product of the reaction is the blue color ingredient in many artist's pigments, printing inks, and dyes (including Berlin blue, Chinese blue, mineral blue, Paris blue, and Prussian blue).
Air-free water has little effect upon iron metal. However, iron metal reacts in moist air by oxidation to give a hydrated iron oxide. This does not protect the iron surface to further reaction since it flakes off, exposing more iron metal to oxidation. This process is called rusting and is familiar to any car owner. Reaction of iron with air. Iron metal reacts in moist air by oxidation to give a hydrated iron oxide. This does not protect the iron surface to further reaction since it flakes off, exposing more iron metal to oxidation.
It is not iron(IV) sulfide; the iron is in a +2 oxidation state, combined with an S 2 2- ion (the sulfur analog of the peroxide ion). Pyrite burns when heated to form sulfur dioxide and iron(III) oxide: The reaction is sometimes used in industry as a source of sulfur dioxide for the manufacture of sulfuric acid. The same pigment can be obtained from the reaction of iron(II) with ferricyanide: The product of the reaction is the blue color ingredient in many artist's pigments, printing inks, and dyes (including Berlin blue, Chinese blue, mineral blue, Paris blue, and Prussian blue).
