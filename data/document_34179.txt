Temperate montane soils are often podzols, as in the taiga; tropical montane soils are often latosols, as in the tropical rain forest. Alpine soils at all elevations may have similarities to those under arctic tundra. Climate. Montane climate is quite variable, depending on latitude and altitude. Climates are always cooler with increased elevation and usually wetter than lowland environments of the same region; there is increased cloud cover, especially up to the 1000-2000 meter range.
4. Montane Grasslands and Shrubland-Montane Grasslands and Shrublands are a Biome which are located above the tree line and are commonly known as Alpine Tundra, which occurs in mountain regions around the World. A Grassland is a is a type of Habitat or Biome which is dominated by Grasses and other Herbaceous (non-woody) Flowering Plants and a variety of scattered Trees and Bushes. Grasslands occur in areas where there is not enough regular rainfall to support the growth of a Forest, but not so little as to form a Desert.
Tropical Montane Forest. Tropical montane rainforests are found in mountainous regions in the tropics at altitudes of about 1000 meters or more. It is generally cooler in these regions than at lower elevations. There is more cloud cover in these areas.
A subalpine lake in the Goms district of the Swiss Alps. Montane ecology is the branch of ecology that studies life systems on mountains or other high elevation regions on the Earth. The ecosystems on mountains are strongly affected by climate, which gets colder as elevation increases. The climate of montane forests is colder than lowland climate at the same latitude, so the montane forests often have species typical of higher-latitude lowland forests. Humans can disturb montane forests through forestry and agriculture.
Annual rainfall can range from 500 to 10,000 mm/year and mean temperature between 8 to 20 Â°C. While cloud forest today is the most widely used term, in some regions, these ecosystems or special types of cloud forests are called mossy forest, elfin forest, montane thicket, and dwarf cloud forest. Cloud forests often exhibit an abundance of mosses covering the ground and vegetation, in which case they are also referred to as mossy forests. Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.
They are tropical, subtropical, and temperate.The plants and animals of tropical montane paramos display striking adaptations to cool, wet conditions and intense sunlight. Around the world, characteristic plants of these habitats display features such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and abundant pilosity. Montane grasslands and shrublands. This major habitat type includes high elevation (montane and alpine) grasslands and shrublands, including the puna and paramo in South America, subalpine heath in New Guinea and East Africa, steppes of the Tibetan plateaus, as well as other similar subalpine habitats around the world.

Around the world, characteristic plants of these habitats display features such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and abundant pilosity. The montane grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau still support relatively intact migrations of Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsoni) and kiang, or Tibetan wild ass (Equus hemionus).

A cloud forest, also called a fog forest, is a generally tropical or subtropical, evergreen, montane, moist forest characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level cloud cover, usually at the canopy level. Cloud forests often exhibit an abundance of mosses covering the ground and vegetation, in which case they are also referred to as mossy forests. Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.
