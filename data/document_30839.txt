The oldest Mauna Loa eruption in written history is said to have taken place in 1780. Testimony was taken from Keaweehu, a Hawaiian guide in the Wilkes party who occupied and mapped the summit from 1840 to 1841. It was said to have taken place not long after Captain Cook's visit to the islands. In 1868, and an eruption from Mauna Loa caused the largest earthquake in Hawaii, registering as a magnitude 8 by modern methods. The lava flow of 1855-1856 is said to be one of the greatest flows ever seen by modern observers.
Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March 24 to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century. Mauna Loa has probably been erupting for at least 700,000 years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000 years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000 years
The Mauna Loa Eruption of 1984. Friday, March 25, marked the tenth anniversary of the last eruption of Mauna Loa Volcano. The 1984 eruption followed a nine-year period of quiescence. Roughly three years of increasing frequency of shallow-and intermediate-depth earthquakes preceded the eruption. 
Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, Mauna Loa -- or Long Mountain in Hawaiian -- is the largest volcano in the world. Its last eruption occurred in spring 1984 -- a violent three-week event that produced fast-moving lava flows that came within 4 miles of the city of Hilo. 
1984 - Eruption of Mauna Loa. The 1984 Mauna Loa eruption began at about 1:30 a.m on March 25, with lava fountaining in the southwest corner of the summit crater. Within 2 to 3 hours, 80% of the crater was covered by lava and there was concern that lava might flow from the crater toward MLO. USGS scientists estimated that the 1984 Mauna Loa eruption produced 220 x 106 m3 of lava and covered an area of about 48 km2. The MLO staff was awarded a NOAA Special Act award for its service during the eruption.
On March 25, 1984, lava erupted from a fissure at Mauna Loa's summit, and, within hours, another fissure opened farther down. It is an eruption that many who live on the Island of Hawaii remember well. HILO, BIG ISLAND (HawaiiNewsNow) -. When Mauna Loa is erupting it's impossible to ignore. 
The 1950 eruption of Mauna Loa began on June 1 and continued until June 23. Fissures opened up along the Southwest Rift Zone for a distance of over 12 miles. First, floods of liquid lava poured out of the vents and a cloud of fume rose two miles into the air. That activity lasted about four hours. In 1868, and an eruption from Mauna Loa caused the largest earthquake in Hawaii, registering as a magnitude 8 by modern methods. The lava flow of 1855-1856 is said to be one of the greatest flows ever seen by modern observers.
Since then, there have been 33 recorded eruptions, making Mauna Loa a very active volcano. The last eruption happened in 1984, and some experts say that Mauna Loa is due for another. Between 2002 and 2005, the summit of Mauna Loa experienced some inflation, which is indicative of magma building up in the volcano. Activity. Volcanic activity began in Mauna Loa about 700,000 to 1,000,000 years ago and is still ongoing today. The first recorded eruption happened in 1843, but Mauna Loa probably had thousands of eruptions before that, including many that only native Hawaiians had witnessed.
