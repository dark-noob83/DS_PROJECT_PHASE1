See also intrinsic pathway of coagulation. final common pathway. 1. the motor neurons by which nerve impulses from many central sources pass to a muscle or gland in the periphery. 2. any mechanism by which several independent effects exert a common influence. intrinsic pathway of coagulation a sequence of reactions leading to fibrin formation, beginning with the contact activation of factor xii. This is followed by the sequential activation of factors xi and ix, which results in the activation of factor x.
Intrinsic pathway. Definition. noun. (1) (hematology) One of the two initial pathways for the conversion of the prothrombin to thrombin in the coagulation cascade of hemostasis. This pathway is initiated within the blood itself or the exposure of the blood to collagen of damaged vascular wall. (2) (cell biology) One of the two apoptotic pathways initiated by intracellular stress and involving the mitochondria.
Intrinsic pathway, intrinsic system-definition of intrinsic pathway, intrinsic system by The Free Dictionary.
intrinsic pathway of coagulation, a sequence of reactions leading to fibrin formation, beginning with the contact activation of factor XII, followed by the sequential activation of factors XI and IX and resulting in the activation of factor X, which in activated form initiates the common pathway of coagulation.
Both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation pathways proceed through a common pathway by forming activated factor X. Prothrombin is cleaved at two sites by factor Xa to yied thrombin (To see a structure of thrombin molecule click here).
The fibrin proteins stick together forming a clot. The clotting cascade occurs through two separate pathways that interact, the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway. Extrinsic Pathway The extrinsic pathway is activated by external trauma that causes blood to escape from the vascular system.
