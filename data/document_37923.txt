For example the median expected hourly pay for a typical Aerospace Engineer I in the United States is $33 an hour, so 50% of the people who perform the job of Aerospace Engineer I in the United States are expected to make less than $33 an hour.
For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Aerospace Engineer I in the United States is $69,297, so 50% of the people who perform the job of Aerospace Engineer I in the United States are expected to make less than $69,297.
The biggest employers of aerospace engineers were the manufacturers of aerospace products and parts. They contained more than a third of all positions and paid average salaries of $96,740 per year or $46.51 per hour.
The 79,400 aerospace engineers in the U.S. averaged $103,870 per year or $49.94 per hour, as of May 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The agency predicts jobs for the profession will increase by 5 percent from 2010 to 2020.
