Pixel Art is artwork designed to a high degree of pixel-level intent. or..., Pixel Art is typically crafted through the practice of placing pixels with the use of precision oriented tools. Thus, any tool with which an artist can predict exactly the outcome through its use is considered a pixel art tool. The most basic of the Pixel Artist's tools is the 1x1 pixel Pencil Tool. Non-isometric pixel art is any pixel art that does not fall in the isometric category, such as views from the top, side, front, bottom or perspective views.
A pixel is a computerized dot of color. Pixel art is a type of digital art that uses pixels to make up the work. With pixel art, the artist has to place each pixel properly to create a certain effect. One dot out of place could make the piece look strange. Pixel art may be separated into two groups: isometric and non-isometric. Generally, isometric means that the object in the art is shown in such a way as to create a 3-D effect. With this type of pixilated art, the object or room is depicted in such a way that all angles are foreshortened equally.

Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer, console, graphing calculator and mobile phone video games are mostly pixel art. The term pixel art was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982.
Pixel art is a type of digital art where artists specify the location of individual pixels, which are built up to create intricate scenes, game backgrounds, characters, and 3D effects – all with a limited colour pallet.
