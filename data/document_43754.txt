Although a urinary tract infection is the most common cause of leukocyte esterase in urinalysis some other and rarer causes for the positive result with a negative microorganism culture do exist. [2] These include: 1  Chlamydia. 2  Infection with a sexually transmitted microorganism called ureaplasma urealyticum.
A positive finding of the enzyme leukocyte esterase in urinalysis indicates the presence of white blood cells in the urine. This normally suggests inflammation of some sort, often from a urinary tract infection.
Leukocyte esterase is a screening test used to detect a substance that suggests there are white blood cells in the urine. This may mean you have a urinary tract infection. If this test is positive, the urine should be examined under a microscope for white blood cells and other signs that point to an

Leukocyte esterase is a urine test to look for white blood cells and other signs of infection.
White cells in the urine usually indicate a urinary tract infection. The leukocyte esterase (LE) test detects esterase, an enzyme released by white blood cells. Positive test results are clinically significant. The LE test is also used to screen for gonorrhea and for amniotic fluid infections.
You may have an infection. A positive finding of the enzyme leukocyte esterase in urinalysis indicates the presence of white blood cells in the urine. This normally suggests inflammation of some sort, often from a urinary tract infection. A simple dipstick test as part of a urinalysis can detect the presence of this enzyme.
