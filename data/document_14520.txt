A covalent bond is a strong bond between two non-metal atoms [atoms: An atom is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that element, comprising electrons surrounding a nucleus of protons and neutrons.
Atoms form covalent bonds as a result of the Octet Rule. The Octet Rule states that all atoms in a molecule need to have eight electrons in their valence shell. This rule can be satisfied by sharing, losing or gaining electrons. A covalent bond allows atoms to satisfy the Octet Rule via sharing.
the answer is: C) the sharing of electrons *A covalent bond is a form of chemical bond; formed by the sharing of one or more electrons, especially pairs of electrons, between atoms*.
A covalent bond forms when two non-metal atoms [atoms: An atom is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that element, comprising electrons surrounding a nucleus of protons and neutrons.
Covalent bonds form when two atoms have a very small (nearly insignificant) difference in electronegativity. The value of difference in electronegativity between two atoms in a covalent bond is less than 1.7. Covalent bonds often form between similar atoms, nonmetal to nonmetal or metal to metal. Covalent bonding signals a complete sharing of electrons.
Covalent bonds form when two nonmetals share an electron. Hi Covalent bonds occur when nonmetal elements have a unstable outermost shell know as the valence electrons. The two non-metal either give up of gain electrons and then live with the other element or elements outer shell. A common everday example is water also know as H20 it has 2 hydrogens and one oxygen.
