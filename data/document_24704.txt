The answer is 3.7854118. We assume you are converting between kilogram [water] and gallon [US, liquid] . You can view more details on each measurement unit: kilo gram or gallon [US, liquid]. The SI derived unit for volume is the cubic meter. 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 kilo gram, or 264.172051242 gallon [US, liquid]. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results. Use this page to learn how to convert between kilograms and gallons.
Kilogram (kg) is a unit of Weight used in Metric system. Please note this is volume to weight conversion, this conversion is valid only for pure water at temperature 4 °C. US oz = 28.349523125 g. US fl oz = 29.5735295625 ml (milliliters) = 29.5735295625 g (grams) of
1 kilogram (kg) = 0.2641720525 gallon (gal). Kilogram (kg) is a unit of Weight used in Metric system. Gallon (gal) is a unit of Volume used in Standard system. Please note this is weight to volume conversion, this conversion is valid only for pure water at temperature 4 °C. US oz = 28.349523125 g.

First unit: gallon (gal) is used for measuring volume. Second: kilogram (kg-kilo) is unit of mass. The kilograms amount 9.11 kg-kilo converts into 1 gal, one gallon. It is the EQUAL concrete volume value of 1 gallon but in the kilograms mass unit alternative.
Exchange reading in US gallons of water unit gal into kilograms of water unit kg wt. as in an equivalent measurement result (two different units but the same identical physical total value, which is also equal to their proportional parts when divided or multiplied).
