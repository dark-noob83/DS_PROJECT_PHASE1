Roast the pork for 35–40 minutes, until you have a lovely crisp crackling, then turn the oven down to 170°C/gas 3. Slow-cook the leg for 3.5 hours, until the meat is easily pulled apart.
Every time I try to roast a pork leg a lot of water drains from it and it becomes dry. Last time I did it this way: 24 hours before, I seasoned a 1.5kg (3 pounds) piece with salt, pepper, garlic, orange juice and lime juice. I put it out of the refrigerator 1 hour before roasting, and roasted it (covered), with low heat (150° C, about 300° F) for about 2 hours in the seasoned juices.
Leg of Pork ready for the roast. Once seasoned it is time for a blast at full heat for around 30 minutes, this starts that crackling going and begins to render that fat through the meat.
Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day in the refrigerator, covered and turning it once or twice. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Uncover the pork and allow the meat to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Roast the pork for 30 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and continue to roast until the meat is falling apart and an instant-read thermometer reaches 160 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the pork. Baste with the marinade every 30 minutes. Total roasting time will be approximately 5 to 5 1/2 hours.
Place the pork on a high shelf in the oven and roast it for 25 minutes. Turn the heat down to 190C/375F/Gas 5, and calculate the total cooking time allowing 35 minutes to the pound, then deduct the initial 25 minutes cooking time. In this case it would be a further 2½ hours.
Roast pork on a rack in a roasting pan in middle of oven 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 325°F and roast until an instant-read thermometer diagonally inserted at least 2 inches into meat registers 155°F, 1 to 1 1/4 hours more. Let pork stand, loosely covered, 10 minutes.
