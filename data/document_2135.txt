Metals and Nonmetals. As shown on the periodic table of the elements below, the majority of the chemical elements in pure form are classified as metals. It seems appropriate to describe what is meant by metal in general terms. This general description is adapted from Shipman, et al.
Silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) are some of the most efficient metals and are often used in electronics. 2. Reactivity: Metals are very reactive, some more than others, but most form compounds with other elements quite easily. Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) are some of the most reactive metals. A metal like iron (Fe) forms iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3), which you know as rust.
Metals are opaque, lustrous elements that are good conductors of heat and electricity. Most metals are malleable and ductile and are, in general, denser than the other elemental substances.
Here is look at the location of the metals on the periodic table and their common properties: Examples of Metals. Most of the elements on the periodic table are metals, including gold, silver, platinum, mercury, uranium, aluminum, sodium and calcium. Alloys, such as brass and bronze, also are metals.
The elements can be classified as metals, nonmetals, or metalloids. Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, and are malleable (they can be hammered into sheets) and ductile (they can be drawn into wire).
