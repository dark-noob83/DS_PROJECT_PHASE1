Osteophytes is the medical name for the overgrowth of bone tissue more commonly called  bone spurs .. Despite the term spurs, they are actually small round lumps of extra bone that grow around joints. Osteophytes are the body’s attempt to compensate for existing bone and ligament degeneration due to age or injury.

They appear to be more common in the cervical spine (neck) than in other spinal segments, as the neck is considerably more prone to degenerative conditions that contribute to osteophyte formation.
An osteophyte, sometimes known as a bone spur, is a small bone prominence that can occur on the joints of the body. The cause of osteophytes depends on the exact condition but are often the result of arthritis or other diseases including bone infections.
Osteophyte formation has been classically related to any sequential and consequential changes in bone formation that is due to aging, degeneration, mechanical instability, and disease (such as Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis).
Cervical osteophytes are bone spurs that grow on any of the seven vertebrae in the cervical spine (neck), involving the spine from the base of the skull to the base of the neck (C1 - C7 vertebrae). 1  Read more: Cervical Spine Anatomy and Neck Pain.
Cervical osteophyte formation typically occurs when ligaments and tendons around the bones and joints in the cervical spine are damaged or inflamed. The inflamed or damaged tissue abnormally influences surrounding bone growth (though hard, bones are constantly renewing, like fingernails and hair).
Osteophyte formation on the articular margin of the patella means  that there is a bone growth in the joint of the knee. A medical  specialist will be able to diagnose the c … ause for this type of bone  growth. Answered.
