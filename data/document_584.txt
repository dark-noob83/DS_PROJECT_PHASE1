100°C, 212°F or 373.15 Kelvin Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 373.15 Kelvin under standard conditions at sea level (at one atmosphere of pressure). The boiling point of water and any other substance depends on the atmospheric pressure, which changes with elevation. At higher altitudes, the pressure is lower, and so water boils at a lower temperature. If the barometric pressure is not at the standard value, the boiling point will be different. For example, water boils at 72 degrees Celsius on Mount Everest.
It is proper therefore to describe the temperature of the boiling point of water at sea level as being 373.15 Kelvin (not 373,15 degrees Kelvin), and the freezing point of water as 273.15 Kelvin (or 273.15 K). 26. The lower the pressure the lower will be the temperature at which water boils. At sea level water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit; At 12,087ft in Tibet, water boils at 188.6 degrees Fahrenheit; At the top of Mt. Everest water boils at 159.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
Boiling water. The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to flash into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased. There are two conventions regarding the standard boiling point of water: The normal boiling point is 99.97 °C (211.9 °F) at a pressure of 1 atm (i.e., 101.325 kPa).
100 212. 2nd answer: Water boils at 212 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale, which is 100 degrees on the Celsius scale, but only at sea level at a specific air pressure. If you boil water, say, half-way up Mount Everest, the boiling point temperature is so low that it is very difficult to cook food. At higher altitudes, the pressure is lower, and so water boils at a lower temperature. If the barometric pressure is not at the standard value, the boiling point will be different. For example, water boils at 72 degrees Celsius on Mount Everest.
You can compare this to the boiling point of water, which is 100 C (or 212 F). The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature where the liquid will change into a gas. The reason that different liquids boil at different temperatures is because of the chemical bonds that hold them together. 
Therefore, hard water boils at a higher temperature. The difference in the boiling point between typical supplies of hard and soft water is about a degree or two. Alcohol: Alcohol has a lower boiling point that water (about 175&deg F as compared with 212&deg F). High Altitude: Water boils at less than 212 F (approximately 96 F). Each 500 foot increase in altitude causes a drop of about 1 in the boiling point. Sea Level: Water boils at 212 F and simmers at 190 F. Tepid Water - 85 to 105 F. The water is comparable to the temperature of the human body. Warm Water - 115 to 120 F. The water is touchable but not hot
The boiling point of water also depends on the purity of the water. Water which contains impurities (such as salted water) boils at a higher temperature than pure water. This phenomenon is called boiling point elevation, which is one of the colligative properties of matter.
The boiling point of water is 100°C or 212° F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level), but water boils at a lower temperature as you gain altitude (e.g., on a mountain) and boils at a higher temperature if you increase atmospheric pressure (lived below sea level). Water which contains impurities (such as salted water) boils at a higher temperature than pure water. This phenomenon is called boiling point elevation, which is one of the colligative properties of matter.
212 degrees F (Fahrenheit). At standard pressure (the pressure of the earth's atmosphere at sea level), water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. (The same temperature as 212 degrees Fahrenheit and 373.15 Kelvin.). At lower atmospheric pressure (e.g. at higher altitudes), water will boil at a lower temperature. If under higher pressure (e.g. inside a pressure cooker), it will take higher temperature than 100 degrees Celsius to make water boil. 100 degrees Celsius
