Incubation Period Shingles is not transmitted from exposure to another infected person so there is no applicable incubation period. Anyone who has recovered from varicella may develop shingles. Mode of Transmission Transmission of the virus occurs through direct contact with the rash or fluid from the lesions.
The incubation period is seven to 21 (usually 10 to 21) days after exposure to the herpes varicella-zoster virus to the development of the symptoms. The disease is most contagious a day or two before the rash appears and until the rash is completely dry and scabbed over, about five to six days after onset of the rash.
Characteristic pancorporeal varicella lesions in unvaccinated person. The incubation period for varicella is 14 to 16 days after exposure to a varicella or a herpes zoster rash, with a range of 10 to 21 days. A mild prodrome of fever and malaise may occur 1 to 2 days before rash onset, particularly in adults. In children, the rash is often the first sign of disease.
Features. After a person has had chicken pox, the virus remains dormant in the body, in nerve tissue near the spinal cord and brain. It may reappear at any time in the form of shingles---or never, depending on the person's health. During an outbreak, only those who have not had chicken pox before are susceptible.
The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
