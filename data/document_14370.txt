Or you you could give a savings bond. A Series EE bond, backed by the U.S. Treasury, pays interest for 30 years and doubles in value over 20 years. Series I bonds offer an adjustable interest rate, so if rates are low when you purchase, this might be a more affordable gift for you to give.
The bottom line is to give what you can comfortably afford. $50 is a very nice gift for a Baptism. So use that as your benchmark. If you can afford to make ends meet while giving $50 or more, go for it. But if you’re going to have to go without groceries for the week, you may want to rethink your gift.
A traditional Bat Mitzvah gift is a check, with the amount of money as a multiple of 18. For example, you could give them $18, $36, $54, or so on, depending on how much you ar … e willing to give and how well you know the person. The multiple-of-18 thing isn't necessary, it's just a tradition.
It is the parents who normally give a small token of appreciation to the God parents, a momento of the occasion. Normally the God parents will give a small gift to the child, such as a St. Christophers medal.
A tasteful financial gift is also appropriate for a baptism. Savings bonds are particularly acceptable, because they take a long time to mature and will be ready to use for further education one day.
If $10 or $15 is a generous amount for you to give in your circumstances, it will be gratefully received. You could choose to give the money in a memorable way -- say, inside a cute piggy bank that can be a keepsake for the child.
Connection. How much you're expected to give as a christening gift often depends on the closeness of your connection to the child. If you are to be his godparent, you might be expected to give a significant gift of $100, $150 or even more if you can afford it. If you are another close relative, $50 might be equally acceptable.
