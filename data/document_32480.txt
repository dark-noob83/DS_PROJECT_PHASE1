1 Installing a standard boiler (80%-85% annual fuel utilization efficiency) typically costs about $2,500-$5,000 for a gas-fired model and $3,000-$6,500 for an oil-fired unit (generally used in areas without municipal gas lines). Counting the $80 per hour plumber fee to the specially trained Laars boiler person $1200 to install this UNIT, plus the repair labor cost what a piece of engineering work this boiler was. Good riddance.
1 Replacing aging, leaking or inadequate ductwork typically costs about $35-$55 a linear foot for labor and materials, or $1,000 -$5,000 or more for a single-family home, depending on the length and type of ducts. 2  Older ductwork might contain asbestos, creating unpredictable additional costs for asbestos removal.

Good riddance.
1 However, higher efficiency means lower monthly bills, so the cost may average out. 2  Replacing gas boilers range from $2,000 to $5,000 on average. 3  With additional modifications, it is possible for the price to leap up to as much as $7,500 to $9,000. 1 According to AutomaticBurnerBoiler.com, replacing an old oil-fired boiler can cost from around $7,000 to $11,000, depending on what the client wants to use as a replacement for the boiler. 2  Generally, oil boilers that are 15 to 20 years old already have a low efficiency rating
Removal and haul away of the old furnace usually costs $300 to $1,000, depending on size and difficulty. As with boilers, a new chimney liner for a high efficiency unit will cost anywhere from $500 to $1,500, with liners for gas units priced on the lower end of that range and liners for oil units on the higher end. No matter which type of boiler you buy, the unit’s energy efficiency rating has the greatest impact on price. Each type is available in varying efficiencies. Removal and haul away of your old boiler can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1,5
Boilers are more expensive than furnaces. Mid-efficiency boilers cost anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000, while high-efficiency boilers run $5,000 to $10,000. Those prices include installation, but keep in mind that installing a boiler is more expensive than installing a furnace because the process is more complex. No matter which type of boiler you buy, the unit’s energy efficiency rating has the greatest impact on price. Each type is available in varying efficiencies. Removal and haul away of your old boiler can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1,500, depending on size and difficulty.
BOILER INSTALLATION COSTS. If you’re replacing an old boiler, expect boiler installation costs for mid-efficiency system to cost about $2,500 to $4,000 (80 percent efficiency), and boiler installation costs for a high-efficiency system to cost between $5,000 to $9,000 (90 to 97 percent efficiency). However, there are other factors that could swing boiler installation costs higher or lower. 1  You may need a new chimney liner if you’re upgrading to higher efficiency boiler. 2  Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 3  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more.

The cost for replacing a standard gas boiler is about $4,000. A high-efficiency model costs about $7,500. This cost estimate usually includes removal and disposal of the old unit, as well as all necessary lines, ducts and wiring needed for the new system to run properly. Replacing an oil-fired boiler is typically a bit more expensive. Depending on where you live they cost between $50 and $300. Some local governments also require a fire inspection before heating system replacements. The fees for these are dependent on the size of the boiler and tend to run between $40 and $75.
1 Replacing an old oil-fired boiler with a gas model can cost thousands of dollars more than replacing one oil-fired unit with another, because of the need to install new gas lines and to update the existing fittings, valves, piping system and other parts to work with the new boiler.
