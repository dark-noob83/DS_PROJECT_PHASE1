The primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the cells of the body. RBCs contain a protein called hemoglobin that actually carries the oxygen. In the capillaries, the oxygen is released to be used by
Red cells contain a special protein called hemoglobin, which helps carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and then returns carbon dioxide from the body to the lungs so it can be exhaled. Blood appears red because of the large number of red blood cells, which get their color from the hemoglobin.
Red blood cells and haemoglobin. Oxygen is one of the substances transported with the assistance of red blood cells. The red blood cells contain a pigment called haemoglobin, each molecule of which binds four oxygen molecules. Oxyhaemoglobin forms.
Blood is red because of the hemoglobin inside our red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a protein that forms a complex with iron molecules and together they transport oxygen molecules throughout the body. Iron has the property of reflecting red light and because there is so much iron in our blood, blood looks red.
In humans, each red blood cell carries about 250,000 molecules of hemoglobin which can transport both oxygen and carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin is a molecule made of two separate components: the protein globin and the nonprotein heme groups.
The red blood cells form a major part of the blood. Oxygen is one of the matters transported with the help of red blood cells. The red blood cells contain a pigment called hemoglobin, each molecule of which binds four oxygen molecules and forms Oxyhemoglobin. The oxygen molecules are carried to individual cells in the body tissue where they are released.
