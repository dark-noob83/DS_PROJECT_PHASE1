For a total of 1800 calories consumed per day, 10% would be 180 calories as fat. Since one gram of fat is equivalent to 9 calories, 180 calories would be equivalent to 20 grams of fat. For many people, 1800 calories per day would be too much, causing weight gain.
Fat Recommendations. To calculate the grams of fat you should eat each day to facilitate weight loss while staying healthy, take 20 and 35 percent of your total calorie needs—as recommended by the Institute of Medicine-- and divide by nine, since fat provides nine calories per gram.
This is equivalent to 50 to 67 grams of fat per day when consuming a 3,000-calorie diet and 67 to 89 grams of fat per day when consuming 4,000 calories.
take the number of calories you consume daily, and take 20% of this number (the amount of fat calories per day you need). in your case, you should consume 360 fat calori … es. one gram of fat is equal to 9 fat calories, so divide the 360 grams of fat by nine, to give you 40 grams of dat per day.
(Just multiply your calorie intake by 0.20 and 0.30.). Then, since 1 gram of fat contains 9 calories, just divide both of your answers by 9. The amount you get now is the ideal range for how many grams of fat you should eat each day.
For example, you’d need 36 to 62 grams of fat when consuming a 1,600-calorie diet per day, 44 to 78 grams if eating a 2,000-calorie diet per day and 58 to 101 grams of fat when consuming 2,600 calories per day.
1 A 2,800 calorie per day diet: 31 grams of saturated fat or less, 93 grams of fat or less. 2  Keep in mind that most women should have a diet of no more than 2,000 calories/day, men no more than 2,500/day.) If you are trying to lose weight, 30 grams of fat. 3  If you are a young teenager about 40-65
1 Next, they’d figure out that 20-30% of 2500 calories is between 500-750 calories. 2  They’d then divide 500 and 750 by 9 (because there’s 9 calories per gram of fat) and get a range of 55-83. 3  So, in this example, this person would eat between 55-83 grams of fat per day.
