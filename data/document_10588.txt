PANCREATIN Overview Information. Pancreatin is usually obtained from the pancreas of pigs or cows. The pancreas is an organ in animals and people that makes chemicals — amylase, lipase, and protease — that are needed for proper digestion. Pancreatin is used as medicine.
Pancreatin is a mixture of several digestive enzymes produced by the exocrine cells of the pancreas. It is composed of amylase, lipase and protease. This mixture is used to treat conditions in which pancreatic secretions are deficient, such as surgical pancreatectomy, pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis.
1 Review. Pancreatin is a combination of digestive enzymes (proteins). These enzymes are normally produced by the pancreas and are important for digesting fats, proteins, and sugars. Pancreatin is used to replace digestive enzymes when the body does not have enough of its own.
