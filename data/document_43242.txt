Converting decimals to percents is all about moving decimal places. For example, let’s say that you have the decimal number 0.55, and you want to change it to a percent. In order to do this, you are simply going to move the decimal point 2 places to the right.
Converting From Percent to Decimal. Percent means per 100, so 50% means 50 per 100, or simply 50/100. If you divide 50 by 100 you get 0.5 (a decimal number). So, to convert from percent to decimal: divide by 100, and remove the % sign.
