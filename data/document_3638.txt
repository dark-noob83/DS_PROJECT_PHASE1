Earth's lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitute the hard and rigid outer layer of the Earth. The lithosphere is subdivided into tectonic plates. 
The lithosphere is Earth's outermost layer, composed of rocks in the crust and upper mantle that behave as brittle solids. The rigid lithosphere sits on top of the asthenosphere, a layer of the mantle in which rocks are hot and deformable. 
Lithosphere. Introduction. The lithosphere is the solid and rigid outer layer of our planet. It includes the crust and part of the upper mantle that contains rigid rocks. Beneath this layer is the asthenosphere where the rocks in this part of the upper mantle are not rigid. The rocks can flow like a liquid or break apart similar to silly putty
The tectonic plates of the Earth's lithosphere. The lithosphere (from the Greek for rocky sphere) is the solid, outermost shell of a rocky planet. In the case of the Earth, the lithosphere includes the crust and the upper layer of the mantle that is joined to the crust. 
Rockhound. The lithosphere is the solid, rocky layer covering the entire surface of the planet, composed of the crust and the hard uppermost mantle, and reacts to stresses as a brittle solid. 
The lithosphere, Greek for “rocky sphere,” is the outermost shell of the Earth. The term is also used to refer to the outermost rocky shell of other solid planets. It is a relatively thin layer, about 31 to 62 miles (50 to 100 km) thick under the oceans and 93 miles (150 km) thick on the continents. The lithosphere is 31 to 62 miles thick under the oceans. The lithosphere is the outermost shell of the Earth, separating the crust from the upper mantle. Movements of plates in the lithosphere formed giant mountains like Mount Everest. Lithospheric plates are more commonly known as tectonic plates. View slideshow of images above
