These are before tax employer contributions to super including compulsory employer contributions & salary sacrifice. If you are self-employed these are the contributions you claim as a tax deduction. There is a limit on how much you can make in concessional contributions each financial year of $25,000. However under recent changes for the 2013/2014 financial year, there is an exception to this rule. If you are over the age of 59 as at June 30, 2013 the concessional cap is $35,000.

The amount is over the one year limit of $150,000 so you decide to bring forward 2 years-worth of limits and so your limit for the next 2 years is $300,000. Note though that any contributions made over the concessional contributions limit will count towards the non-concessional contributions limit!
The non-concessional contributions cap will rise to $180,000 for 2014-15 (up from $150,000 in 2013-14). As a result, the non-concessional cap under the bring-forward rule over three years is effectively $540,000 from 2014-15 (up from $4

This is referred to as the bring-forward rule, under which non-concessional contributions of up to three times the non-concessional contributions cap in a year may be made—for example, up to $450,000 in 2012–13.
In short, for the 2015/2016 year, there are 2 annual concessional contributions caps you need to be aware of when considering before-tax contribution strategies, namely: 1  $30,000 cap for anyone aged 48 or under as at 30 June 2015. 2  $35,000 cap for anyone aged 49 years or ov
Salary sacrifice contributions count toward your concessional cap and are taxed at your concessional contribution rate, not your marginal tax rate, so you may benefit over the long term from the low-tax environment of super.
The limit is $150,000 which is six times the concessional contributions limit. Also if you are under 65 you can ‘bring forward’ up to 3 years-worth of limits into one year. Example: You sell a property and pay capital gains tax that leaves you with an after-tax profit of $300,000.
