You will not need a kit if you are using a stand. For free hanging hammocks, the kit you need will depend on what you are attaching the hammock to: Basic wood kit is for use with stud walls, beam porches, posts, or any other wood connection point. Basic concrete kit is for use with concrete walls or overhangs. Brazilian hammocks need generally 11 or 12 feet, the Mayans 11 -12 feet. The Nicaraguan hammocks need 13, 14, or 15 feet depending on size. Most of the Bar hammocks will fit in a 15 foot stand, except for the Large Playa which requires a 16 foot stand.
The size designations in the Nicaraguan hammock, are the Family, or XL, the Couples, or Large, the Single, or medium, and the Dorm/Travelers, or small. Phrases like roomy for one and cozy for two abound in the lexicon of Nicaraguan hammocks. Let me tell you that if you are a big guy you want the Family hammock.

If a less expensive stand is desired, the basic hammock stand that holds 450 lbs is perfect, such as this taupe hammock stand. Unfortunately, this stand is not compatible with the side table. If you have more decorative tastes, the Steel Arc stand is a wonderful addition to your hammock. It is 15 ft long and will accommodate any of our 13 ft hammocks. The Steel Arc stand has a weight capacity of 450 lbs, and it is available in green, bronze, black, and taupe. Our small stands accommodate hammocks between 10-12 feet, and are perfect for smaller spaces. If you are unsure which hammocks and stands accommodate each other and prefer to buy a hammock and stand together, then we suggest purchasing a combo package, such as this Hatteras Hammocks combo.

It can be irritating to me, and, I am sure, confusing to customers, to see a medium size hammock described as XL, which implies that it is a very large hammock, not a medium size hammock. Misleading descriptors like this are used all over the internet to justify a higher price for a lesser product. Below, I am charting the Mayan Hammocks by name, size and width.

Hammocks have increased in size in the last few years, and it is now more difficult to find a stand under 15 ft. Please also note that hammock hardware and hooks come with the hammock, not the hammock stand. Our small stands accommodate hammocks between 10-12 feet, and are perfect for smaller spaces.
