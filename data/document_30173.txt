Making the world better, one answer at a time. Pathogenic diseases Pathogenic diseases are caused by the presance of one or more pathogenic agent in the body, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protazoa, multicellular parasites and aberrant proteins known as prions.
answered by Shivani Nayak. Pathogens cause disease. A pathogen (disease-causing agent) is a microorganism that causes disease in its host (human, animals, plant, another microorganism). Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and a newly discovered class of pathogens prions.
The definition of a pathogenic organism is an organism capable of causing disease in its host. A human pathogen is capable of causing illness in humans. Common examples of pathogenic organisms include specific strains of bacteria like Salmonella, Listeria and E. coli, and viruses such as Cryptosporidium.
Pathogenicity vs. Virulence. Pathogenicity refers to the ability of an organism to cause disease (ie, harm the host). This ability represents a genetic component of the pathogen and the overt damage done to the host is a property of the host-pathogen interactions. Commensals and opportunistic pathogens lack this inherent ability to cause disease.
Overview. A pathogen is a biological agent, or germ, that causes disease to its host by interrupting normal body processes. Bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites are all common types of pathogens that can cause pathogenic, or infectious, diseases.
