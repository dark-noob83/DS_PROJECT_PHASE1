What is subacromial bursitis? Bursitis is an inflammation or irritation of the bursa, which is a small sac located between a bone and muscle, skin, or a tendon. The bursa allows smooth gliding between these structures. The subacromial bursa helps the motion of the rotator cuff in activities such as overhead work.
A bursa is a fluid-filled sac that cushions an area of friction between tissues, such as tendon and bone. Bursae reduce friction between moving parts of the body, such as around the joints of the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, and adjacent to the Achilles tendon in the heel.
There are 160 bursae in the body. The major bursae are located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa. Injury or inflammation of a bursa around the shoulder joint occurs causes shoulder bursitis.
More specifically bursitis in the shoulder is the inflammation of a small fluid filled sac known as a bursa. There are many bursa sacs throughout the body and their role is to act as small lubricated cushions between bones, muscles and other body tissues.
1 Chronic bursitis: The most common cause of chronic bursitis is minor trauma that may occur to the shoulder (subdeltoid) bursa from repetitive motion, for example, throwing a baseball.
A bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between a bone and other moving parts: muscles, tendons, or skin. Bursae are found throughout the body. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed (redness and increased fluid in the bursa).

Trauma. Trauma causes inflammatory bursitis from repetitive injury or direct impact. 1  Chronic bursitis: The most common cause of chronic bursitis is minor trauma that may occur to the shoulder (subdeltoid) bursa from repetitive motion, for example, throwing a baseball.
