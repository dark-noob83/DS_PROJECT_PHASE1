The normal respiratory rate is 30 to 60 breaths per minute from birth to one year, 24 to 50 breaths per minute from one to three years and 22 to 34 breaths from three to six years old. As the child moves into school-age, the normal respiratory rate slows.
A newborn's breathing rate fluctuates greatly in the first six months of life. Normal for a newborn is anywhere from 30 to 60 breaths per minute. During the first year, the respiratory rate normalizes. A child age 1 to 5 will have a respiratory rate of 20 to 30 breaths per minute. As the child moves into the ages of 6 to 12, the breathing rate continues to decrease to about one breath every 3 to 5 seconds, or 12 to 2
Children breathe faster than adults. Body size, weight and activity level influence normal breathing rates. But age is the factor most commonly used to determine normal values. Normal breathing rate ranges from as high as 30 to 60 breaths per minute at birth to as low as 12 to 16 breaths per minute at age 18.
For children from the age of one to five years old, normal respiration is 20 to 30 breaths per minute, while children who are from six to twelve years old should have a normal respiratory rate that ranges from 12 to 20 breaths per minute.
Normal Breathing Rates for Children. Babies and children normally breathe faster than older children and adults. A child who has a fever or who feels anxious breathes faster than normal. The table below shows the normal rate of breathing for children.
2. Respirations Like heart rates, respirations tend to be faster in younger children and then slow down as we age. Respirations may be taken by observing your child's chest rise and fall, placing your hand on your child's belly and feeling the rise and fall, or using a stethoscope.
