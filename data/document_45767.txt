Malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite. The parasite can be spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. There are many different types of plasmodium parasite, but only five types cause malaria in humans. These are: 1  Plasmodium falciparum – mainly found in Africa, it is the most common type of malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria deaths worldwide. 2  Plasmodium vivax – mainly found in Asia and South America.
A microorganism called Plasmodium falciparum (a parasitic protist) causes the most common strand of the disease. There are other variants in Asian and southern American countries that cause similar symptoms and are caused by closely related species of the genus Plasmodium.
Malaria Parasites. Malaria parasites are micro-organisms that belong to the genus Plasmodium. There are more than 100 species of Plasmodium, which can infect many animal species such as reptiles, birds, and various mammals. Four species of Plasmodium have long been recognized to infect humans in nature.
There is no malaria virus that causes malaria. Instead of a malaria virus, the cause of malaria is an infection with a parasite. A parasite is a microscopic organism that lives within another organism (known as a host), but provides no benefit to the host.
