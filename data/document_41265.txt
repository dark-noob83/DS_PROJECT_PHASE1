When I have it on hand, I cook my white rice in beef or chicken bone broth which is packed with minerals, gelatin, and glycosaminoglycans. These nutrients are known to benefit teeth, bones, hair, nails, and joints. (Learn to make chicken bone broth here or beef bone broth here).
White rice unlike white flour is a natural product which is unbleached however a lot of the vitamins and minerals are removed during processing. White rice is produced by mill … ing brown rice and removing the husk, bran, and germ. The rice is then polished, resulting in a bright, white, shiny grain.
We don’t bleach the rice to make it white. Rice grains have different classifications, there’s purple, black, brown and red. We don’t eat the other colors because they are crunchier in texture and is considered low-class. The white ones sold in the market are of the highest degree.
Also, white rice has been polished and bleached, at times with chlorine containing chemicals. As you know, industrial processes leave residues behind…son when eating white rice, we are eating part of the bleaching chemicals…some people claim it could be really toxic for the pancreas.

White rice doesn’t have a bunch of nutrients, but it also doesn’t have a bunch of stuff that messes with digestion and makes me feel awful either. Despite the fears of low-carbers and modern nutritionists, the simple starch in white rice is generally a benign fuel source for the body.
