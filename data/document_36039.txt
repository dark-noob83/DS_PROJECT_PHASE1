Io atmosphere. Io has an extremely thin atmosphere mostly composed of sulfur dioxide which has escaped from its volcanos. Its peak density is about ten million times less than that of the Earth's atmosphere, and is very cold (no more than 130 K = -225\deg F) near the ground. 
Volcanology of Io, a moon of Jupiter, is the scientific study of lava flows, volcanic pits, and volcanism (volcanic activity) on the surface of Io. Its volcanic activity was discovered in 1979 by Voyager 1 imaging scientist Linda Morabito. 
Confidence votes 73. Unlike most satellites in the outer Solar System, which are mostly composed of water ice, Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core. Io is the forth largest moon in the Solar System and the third largest of the moons of Jupiter. Diameter is 3,640 kmCircumference is 11,429.6 kmSurface area is 41,624,846.02 … km2Volume is 25,252,406,590 km3.
Io orbits Jupiter at a distance of 421,700 km (262,000 mi) from Jupiter's center and 350,000 km (217,000 mi) from its cloudtops. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, its orbit lying between those of Thebe and Europa. Several volcanoes produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as 500 km (300 mi) above the surface. Io's surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of Io's silicate crust.
Io is composed primarily of rocky material with very little iron. Io is located within an intense radiation belt of electrons and ions trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field. As the magnetosphere rotates with Jupiter, it sweeps past Io and strips away about 1,000 kilograms (1 ton) of material per second. 
Io's volcanism is responsible for many of that satellite's unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various shades of red, yellow, white, black, and green, largely due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur. Io is the forth largest moon in the Solar System and the third largest of the moons of Jupiter.

The interior of Io is composed of an iron or iron sulfide core and a brown silicate outer layer, giving the planet a splotchy orange, yellow, black, red, and white appearance. Based on data from scientific computer models, Io formed in a region around Jupiter where water ice was plentiful. Age: Io is about 4.5 billion years old, about the same age as Jupiter. Distance from Jupiter: Io is the fifth moon from Jupiter. Its orbital distance is about 262,000 miles (422,000 km). Io takes 1.77 Earth days to orbit Jupiter. The same side of Io always faces Jupiter. Size: Io has a mean radius of 1,131.7 miles, making it slightly larger than the Earth’s moon
