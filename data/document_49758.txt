Driving in Japan. Americans cannot drive in Japan with only a U.S. drivers license. Persons found driving in Japan without a legal license are subject to fines, arrest and possible deportation. International Driving Permits are not a medium-to-long term substitute for a Japanese driver's license.
If you have a driver's license from a country which does not have an agreement with Japan, such as the United States, China or Brazil, you will have to take a written and practical exam in order to obtain a Japanese driver's license. This process typically takes several attempts, even for experienced drivers.
It is your foreign driver's license that allows you to drive in the United States. Contact the authorities in your home country to get an international driving permit, as the United States does NOT issue international driver's licenses to foreign visitors.
The license must be valid in Japan to drive a rented vehicle. (i.e. 1. Japanese driver's license 2. International driving permit under Convention of Road Traffic of 1949 or 3. Japanese translation issued by an authorized organization for licenses issued in Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium, Taiwan, Slovenia or Monaco as well as original driving license issued in these countries/area).
Foreigners can drive in Japan with an International Driving Permit (IDP) for a maximum of one year, even if the IDP is valid for a longer period. It is not possible to drive on an International Driving Permit again unless you return to your home country for at least three consecutive months in between.
