The part of the limbic system shown is that which is along the left side of the thalamus (hippocampus and amygdala) and just under the front of the thalamus (hypothalamus): Hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a small part of the brain located just below the thalamus on both sides of the third ventricle. Emotion involves the entire nervous system, of course. But there are two parts of the nervous system that are especially significant: The limbic system and the autonomic nervous system. The Limbic System. The limbic system is a complex set of structures that lies on both sides of the thalamus, just under the cerebrum.
The hypothalamus' primary function is homeostasis, which is to maintain the body's status quo system-wide. Hypothalamic hormones include thyrotropin-releasing, gonadotropin-releasing, growth hormone-releasing, corticotrophin-releasing, somatostatin, and dopamine hormones. Hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a section of the brain responsible for the production of many of the body’s essential hormones, chemical substances that help control different cells and organs.
The different parts of the brain are: The frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, hypothalamus, cerebrum, brain stem ,and cerebellum. The nervous system is … your body's decision and communication center. The diencephalon is the region of the brain that sits on top of the  brainstem, below the telencephalon. It includes the thalamus and  hypothalamus. Parts of diencephalon pe … rform numerous functions,  from regulating wakefulness to the control of the autonomic nervous  system.
1 The portion of the brain that maintains the body’s internal balance (homeostasis). 2  The hypothalamus is the link between the endocrine and nervous systems. 3  The hypothalamus produces releasing and inhibiting hormones, which stop and start the production of other hormones throughout the body. The hypothalamus plays a significant role in the endocrine system. It is responsible for maintaining your body’s internal balance, which is known as homeostasis. To do this, the hypothalamus helps stimulate or inhibit many of your body’s key processes, including:

Hypothalamus. Hypothalamus-part of the diencephalon, ventral to the thalamus. The structure is involved in functions including homeostasis, emotion, thirst, hunger, circadian rhythms, and control of the autonomic nervous system. In addition, it controls the pituitary.

The hypothalamus is a small but important part of the brain. It contains several small nuclei with a variety of functions. It plays an important role in the nervous system as well as in the endocrine system. It is linked to another small and vital gland called the pituitary gland. Hypothalamus location. The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and right above the brain stem. It forms the anterior part of the diencephalon. All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is roughly the size of an almond.
It knows because a part of your brain, called the hypothalamus, tells it to. All humans and many animals have a hypothalamus. The hypothalamus does many things, but two of its most important jobs are to maintain homeostasis and to control certain hormones. Homeostasis is very important to all animals, including humans.
