This method is good when you are cooking only 2 or 3 ears of corn. If you are cooking more, you should choose one of the other cooking methods or do it in batches in the microwave. Place the corn in a microwave safe dish and add about 2 Tablespoons of water to the dish. Remove the husks and then the silk with a DRY paper towel. NEVER let water get on it.
