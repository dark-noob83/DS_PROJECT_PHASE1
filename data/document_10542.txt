PayPal Transaction Fees. When you sell an item via PayPal, you're charged a fee based on the cost of the item. For sales within the United States, the fee is 2.9 percent of the selling price plus an extra 30 cents. This fee comes out of the seller's cut of the item. For instance, if an item sells for $30, the buyer pays $30 via PayPal. After fees, the seller receives $28.83. Should the buyer request a refund, PayPal refunds the seller a portion of this fee. When you sell an item via PayPal, you are assessed a per-transaction fee for using the service.

The fee the seller pays is calculated for each transaction and is represented as a percentage of the total transaction plus 30 cents. The PayPal percentage rate fluctuates depending on the amount of money the seller earns in one month through PayPal. PayPal requires sellers to pay fees monthly. Step 1.
