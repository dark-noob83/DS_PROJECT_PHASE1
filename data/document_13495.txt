Chinatown is most visited for its restaurants and the annual Chinese New Year parade. Location: Chinatown is located east of downtown Washington, DC between H and I Streets and 5th and 8th Streets, NW. The closest Metro Station is Gallery Place/Chinatown. Washington, DC's Chinatown is a small historic neighborhood with approximately 20 Chinese and Asian restaurants and a handful of other small businesses. The Friendship Arch, a traditional Chinese gate, prominently marks the neighborhood at H and 7th Streets.
If you're driving, look for the large Metro signs to direct you to stations. Look for tall brown columns with a large M identifying the station entrances. Colored stripes around the column show which lines serve the station. 1  View the Metrorail System Map.

The area around Union Station is pretty dicey during the day, and I can imagine it would be even more so at that hour. There is a parking lot at 10th and H, where the old convention center used to be, but I don't know if it's overnight. You might want to check. Tomorrow night I'm catching a bus on 7th and H St that leaves at 3:30am. The only overnight parking on weekdays I can find for that time would be at Union Station (if anyone knows somewhere closer that would be even better). Google maps says its about a 20 minute walk, which is fine, but how safe of an area is...

The area between Union Station and Chinatown is perfectly safe. It gets a little dicey north of there, but even that I would not say is unsafe for a pair of adults. Frankly, you have little to worry about from a safety standpoint. Tomorrow night I'm catching a bus on 7th and H St that leaves at 3:30am. The only overnight parking on weekdays I can find for that time would be at Union Station (if anyone knows somewhere closer that would be even better).

Chinatown has really turned it around in the last 20 years. With the development of the Verizon Center, the surrounding blocks are now filled with clubs, bars, restaurants and shopping. The area is easy to access thanks to the Gallery Place-Chinatown metro station.
