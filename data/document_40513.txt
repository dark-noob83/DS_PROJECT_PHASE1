Cicadas are active underground, tunneling and feeding. After the long 2 to 17 years, cicadas emerge from the ground as nymphs. Nymphs climb the nearest available tree, and begin to shed their nymph exoskeleton. Free of their old skin, their wings will inflate with fluid and their adult skin will harden.
Cicadas are plant-sucking insects that spend most of their life underground (2-17 years) attached to the roots of trees, until it is time to emerge as flying adults! There are well over 1,000 species of cicadas around the world. Adult cicadas are large and have wide-set eyes, short antennae, and clear wings.
Other names: Cicadas are also called 17 year Locust, Cicada insects or Periodical Cicada. Large spring hatches, called broods, emerge in 13 year and 17 year cycles. The 2015 Cicada emergence will have two different broods emerging. Brood IV will arrive in IA,KS,MO,NE,OK, and TX. This brood is a 17 year cycle.
Size relative to a paper clip: Cicadas are probably best known for their buzzing and clicking noises, which can be amplified by multitudes of insects into an overpowering hum. Males produce this species-specific noise with vibrating membranes on their abdomens. The sounds vary widely and some species are more musical than others.
The Cicadoidea, cicadas (/sɪˈkɑːdə/ or /sɪˈkeɪdə/), are a superfamily of insects in the order Hemiptera, suborder Auchenorrhyncha (formerly part of the obsolete Homoptera), along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers.
Cicadas are also famous for their penchant for disappearing entirely for many years, only to reappear in force at a regular interval. There are some 3,000 cicada species, but only some share this behavior (the 17-year cicada is an example).
