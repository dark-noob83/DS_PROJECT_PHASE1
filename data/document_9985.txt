Currently, about half the states require helmets for all motorcyclists. Most other states require helmets for certain riders, and a few have no helmet law. GHSA urges all states to adopt a universal motorcycle helmet law and vigorously enforce existing laws.
Currently, 19 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring all motorcyclists to wear a helmet, known as universal helmet laws. Laws requiring only some motorcyclists to wear a helmet are in place in 28 states. There is no motorcycle helmet use law in three states (Illinois, Iowa and New Hampshire).
A 2009 study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety revealed that motorcycle riders are 25 times more likely to die from a crash than car or truck drivers. That is why a good number of states have laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets and observe other safety practices. In Massachusetts, motorcyclists are not only required to wear helmets, but they must also wear eye protection and ride a bike with turn signals.
The governor of Michigan just signed a law that overturned the state s long-standing helmet requirement for motorcyclists. Senate Bill 291 overturned the 35 year old safety requirement that was created to protect motorcycle riders from traumatic brain injuries and fatalities in the event of a crash.
Wearing helmets is very important. Most motorcyclists who don't wear helmets know they should be wearing a helmet, but just choose not to. Wearing helmets limits the amount of damage done to your head in a crash. If you don't wear a helmet but survive a motorcycle crash, the medical insurance cost would go up.
An additional $1.4 billion COULD have been saved if all motorcyclists had worn helmets. In states with a universal helmet law (all riders are required to wear a helmet), an average of $725 per registered motorcycle was saved, which is nearly four times greater than states that do not have such laws ($198 saved).
