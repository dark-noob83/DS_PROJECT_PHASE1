There are several things to consider when determining the average cost to rebuild any engine. When rebuilding a stock engine for transportation purposes only the cost should not exceed 50% of the cost to purchase a new one. However, when rebuilding an engine for performance this rule of thumb does not apply.
The average engine rebuild cost is going to depend on what kind of engine you're rebuilding. An older Volkswagen air-cooled engine can be rebuilt to performance standards for around $300 to $400. A typical water-cooled four cylinder engine can be rebuilt to original specifications for around $400 to $500. A six cylinder engine can be rebuilt to original specification for around $500 to $600. An eight cylinder engine, will cost around $600 to $700 to rebuild to original specifications. If you plan on doing a high performance rebuild on a Chevy small block eight cylinder, you can feasibly spend as much as $1,200 or more if you're not careful.
The manufacturer is the only one who can rebuild zero time your engine. If I personally were the one paying a large amount of money for an engine overhaul, 75% of the cost of a new engine. We would recommend a new or rebuilt zero time engine because it will give you paperwork that no one else can.
