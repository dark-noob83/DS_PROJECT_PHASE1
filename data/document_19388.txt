However, it may serve as a starting point for a more thorough investigation into the meaning o â€¦ f 'linguistic chauvinism'.

After decades of resistance against Hindi, even Hindi speakers realized the futility of this linguistic chauvinism and understood the importance of English as the language of opportunity in a globalized world.
Linguistic chauvinism is the idea that one's language is superior to others. For a few examples, the Greeks called all non-Greek speakers barbarians, the French are only at home where French is spoken, and English speakers consider the ability to speak another language a social defect.
