Lami's theorem. (mechanics). When three forces act on a particle in equilibrium, the magnitude of each is proportional to the sine of the angle between the other two. 1  Facebook.
Lami's theorem states that if three forces are in static equilibrium, then the magnitude of each force is proportional to the sine of the angle between the other two forces. â€¦ Since the forces are in static equilibrium, they sum to zero. This means that if the force vectors are put end-to-end, they form a triangle.
In statics, Lamis theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinearforces, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding forces.
If a body is in equilibrium under the effect of three forces, each force is proportional to 'sine' of angle between other two. Category. License.
