Parking garages are often budgeted on a cost per space. In most cases that cost averages $15-20,000 per parking spot. More efficient layouts with more parking per square foot are more affordable and smaller, taller or complex layouts tend to be more expensive.
The capital and operating costs of a garage are highly dependent on the design of the facility and its site, and the anticipated revenue is highly dependent on the market. The cost of structured parking ranges from $15,000 to $30,000 per space, and the revenue derived from each space varies from $60 to $300 per month.
Perhaps the best way to estimate the cost of a new parking garage is to look at the number of spaces it contains. In 1996, the International Parking Institute estimated that new parking garages cost between $4,500 and $15,000 per space (depending, of course, on the type of construction, special features, etc.). A reliable average is approximately $7,000 per space for multi-level garages.
For example, the average cost of constructing anunderground garage in Boston is $95 per square foot, and the average spaceoccupies 330 square feet, so the average cost of a parking space is $31,000($95 Ã— 330).
Giosa: For a parking garage to pay for itself, the owners would have to charge people more than $150 per month or $7.50 per day to park. While these charges are common in some cities, they are not customary on Long Island. However, the Intermodal parking garage at the Mineola train station comes close at $6.00 per day.
The increased market price per housing unit that includes a parking space compared to housing that does not. $50,700 Design, administration, construction and financing Two new parking garages in downtown Palo Alto providing 905 spaces cost a total of $45.9 million.
1 Such a building would run at an average of $8.56 million to complete. 2  This does not include acquisition of the land or any demolition costs, however. 3  The above figures place this construction at a $59 per square foot cost, though a national average of stands between $50 to $70 for most projects.
At a construction cost of $32,000 per apartment and $18,100 per parking spot, it would have cost $22,600 to provide parking for each $32,000 apartment, 71% as much as the cost of building the apartments.
