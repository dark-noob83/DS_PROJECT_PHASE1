Place eggs in a muffin tin to prevent them from rolling around. Cook for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes, remove eggs from the oven and place in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.I left them in there for about 10 minutes. Thatâ€™s it! Perfect eggs every time. I have cooked about 4 dozen so far and have had success with EVERY batch. Another way to cook eggs on the stove is to remember not to let the water boil. Place the water in the pan with cold water. Heat on the stove until the water is just about to boil, then remove the pan from the heat and cover with a lid for 10 minutes. After this, place the eggs in cold water or ice water to stop the cooking process. The boiling water is one thing that makes the egg shell stick to the egg

1 Preheat oven to 325 degrees. 2  Place desired number of eggs in a regular or mini muffin tin and bake for 30 minutes. 3  Remove eggs from oven and, using a pair of tongs (I like these tongs with rubber tips from OXO), immediately transfer the eggs to an ice water bath. 4  Allow to cool down for at least 10 minutes.

If you want to, you can also stand them upright using mini muffin tins. 2. Put the pan in the oven and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. 3. Remove and put the eggs in a bucket of ice water for at least 10 minutes. The only tricky part about this method is that the cooking time will vary from oven to oven. So, if your oven runs hot, you may need to cook them at 325. 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Put a whole (unopened) egg in each individual cup of a 12-cup muffin pan. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove and immediately place in an ice water bath.
