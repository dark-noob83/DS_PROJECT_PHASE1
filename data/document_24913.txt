Most normal persons have detectable concentrations of circulating CEA. Approximately 85% of adults have CEA levels less than 2.5 ng/mL, while 95% have levels less than 5.0 ng/mL. CEA levels are slightly higher in men than women. The median level is 3.4 ng/mL in men and 2.5 ug/mL in women. Healthy persons seldom have levels above 10 ng/mL.
CEA is a protein marker indicative of several types of cancers, especially colon cancer. The CEA normal levels are different for smokers and nonsmokers. Usually, for adult nonsmokers, the normal CEA levels range from 0 to 2.5 mcg/l. For adult smokers, the levels are slightly higher, and normal levels range from 0 to 5.0 mcg/l. This difference in normal values is because smokers usually produce more CEA than
The CEA blood test normal range is from 0 to 2.5 micrograms per liter. In people who smoke regularly, this normal range is slightly increased. For them, the CEA blood test range is 0 to 5 micrograms per liter. Values slightly higher than this are accepted as normal.
Elevated levels of CEA (higher than 3 ng/mL) are considered abnormal. The levels are higher than 3 ng/mL in many types of cancers, but that in itself does not necessarily mean you have cancer.
I know that on the web it says that CEA levels of 2.5 for non-smokers and 5.0 for smokers are considered normal. It also mentioned that there are a few different ways to measure cea levels. My CEA is 3.4 - I live in Boston and go to Mass General-I was stage 3. I just had it done.
