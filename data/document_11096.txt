Recommendations. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 recommends getting about 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories from carbohydrate sources. To compute how many calories this represents, consider that each gram of carbohydrates has about 4 calories.
In addition to the 45 to 65 percent of your calories that come from carbohydrates, proteins should make up 10 to 35 percent of your daily calories, while fats should make up 20 to 35 percent, according to the IOM.
Designate 45 to 65 percent of that number for foods high in carbs. If you need 2,000 calories per day, 900 to 1,300 of those calories-- 225 to 325 grams -- should come from carbohydrates, as 1 gram of carbohydrate has 4 calories.
The recommended intake is a minimum of 130 grams/day, or 45 - 65 percent of daily calories for adults, independent of age or activity level. This is the minimum needed for your brain to function. Athletes are recommended to consume 6 - 10 grams for every kilogram of body weight per day.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day.
Carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram. If you typically consume around 2,000 calories per day, 45 to 65 percent of your calories is equivalent to 225 to 325 grams of carbs. An 1,800-calorie diet requires 202 to 293 grams of carbohydrates, while a 2,500 calorie diet allows you to have 281 to 406 grams.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs.
Around 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates, recommends the Institute of Medicine, but notes the type of carbohydrates you choose make a difference in your energy level, your weight and your risk of chronic disease.
