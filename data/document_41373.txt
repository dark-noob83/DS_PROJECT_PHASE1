Answer: Have you ever wondered why we use the symbol 'lb' for the 'pounds' unit? 'pound' is short for 'pound weight' which was libra pondo in Latin. The libra part meant both weight or balance scales. The Latin usage was shortened to libra, which naturally was abbreviated 'lb'. We adopted the pound part from pondo, yet kept the abbreviation for libra.
The form lb is actually an abbreviation of the Latin word libra, which could mean a pound, itself a shortened form of the full expression, libra pondo, “pound weight”. The second word of this phrase, by the way, is the origin of the English pound.
The answer is 2000. We assume you are converting between pound and ton [short, US] . You can view more details on each measurement unit: lb or ton [short, US]. The SI base unit for mass is the kilogram. 1 kilogram is equal to 2.20462262185 lb, or 0.00110231131092
Einde O'Callaghan:[nq:1]Short question: Why is the weight unit pounds spelled lbs?[/nq]lb is short for librum, which is Latin for pound. The modern plural is lbs. BTW lbs isn't the spelling of the word, it's the abbreviation.
1 pound (lb) = 0.0005 short tons (t or ST) = 16 ounces (oz) = 0.45359237 kilograms (kg) = 453592.37 milligrams (mg) = 453.59237 grams (g) = 7000 grains (gr). The short ton (abbreviation and symbol: t, S/T or ST) is a unit of weight used in the US and equal to 2000 pounds (lbs) or 907.18474 kilograms (kg).
