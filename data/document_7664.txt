Bioluminescent Noctiluca scintillans (a dinoflagellate). Plankton is composed of the phytoplankton (the plants of the sea) and zooplankton (zoh-plankton) which are typically the tiny animals found near the surface in aquatic environments. Like phytoplankton, zooplankton are usually weak swimmers and usually just drift along with the currents.
Some phytoplankton are bacteria, some are protists, and most are single-celled plants. Among the common kinds are cyanobacteria, silica-encased diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, and chalk-coated coccolithophores.
Diatoms, dinoflagellates and microflagellates form the bottom of the aquatic food chain. Numbers of phytoplankton in an ocean might be so concentrated that they affect the color of the water and tint the water brown, green or red. Phytoplankton provide a necessary part
Three main types of phytoplankton are: 1  Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). 2  These are very small and difficult to study. 3  They may be found in large blooms - it is the color of a cyanobacteria that causes the name (and occasionally, color) of the Red Sea.
Plankton. Plankton includes plants and animals that float along at the mercy of the sea's tides and currents. Their name comes from the Greek meaning drifter or wanderer.. There are two types of plankton: tiny plants--called phytoplankton, and weak-swimming animals--called zooplankton. Some are babies that will grow into strong-swimming, non-planktonic adults. Others will remain plankton for their entire lives.
