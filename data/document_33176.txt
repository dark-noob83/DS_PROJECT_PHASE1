The Whirlpool WTW4900BW is a top load machine. Top loading washers typically cost less than front loading models and take less time to complete a wash cycle. However they typically use more energy and water during a cycle. 
Front-loading washing machines are the way to go. 1  Front-loading washers use 40-75% less water and 30-85% less energy than typical top-loaders. ( 2 source) They cost about $100 more than top-loaders (starting around $500), but they can often save $100/year or more. Front-loader economics: 1  Front-loaders cost about $100 more than top-loaders, but common savings are $100/yr. 2  The only time a front-loader won't pay for itself is if you already use cold water almost exclusively, and you do a lot less than the average 7.5 loads per week.
1 The cost of a washing machine will vary depending on the efficiency, load capacity, and make and model. 2  A standard top-loading machine with multiple load capacities and cycle options will cost $250-$500. 3  For example, the GE 4.3 cubic feet 24-cycle washer can be found at Amazon for about $300. 1 Ft. 14-Cycle Ultra Capacity High-Efficiency Washer will cost around $900. 2  A high-efficiency front-load washer with a large load capacity that is much quieter than mid-grade washers will cost between $500-$1,500. 3  For example, the Samsung 5.0 Cu. 4  Ft. 13-Cycle Steam Washer will cost around $1,45
Calculating the cost-per-load of laundry (top-loader). 1  For water, we'll figure 40 gallons for a standard top-loading U.S. washer, and the national average of $5.44 per thousand gallons, which gives us $0.22 per load for water. For electricity to power the washer, we'll figure 0.256 kWh times a sample cost of 15 /kWh, which gives us $0.04 for electricity. Front-loader economics: 1  Front-loaders cost about $100 more than top-loaders, but common savings are $100/yr. 2  The only time a front-loader won't pay for itself is if you already use cold water almost exclusively, and you do a lot less than the average 7.5 loads per week.
An average household in the U.S. runs a clothes washer 392 cycles per year [13]. A top loading washing machine such as that considered herein, costs $525 on the average [13] and has a lifetime of 5,000 cycles [14] (approximately 13 years). Over the lifetime of the machine 424. the cost for maintenance is about $300 [11]. 
Meanwhile, the Energy Savings Trust reckon the average washing machine could cost around £63 a year to run (based on an average 274 cycles a year) while a tumble dryer, used 148 times a year would add £92 on to your annual bill. 
Appliance Price Development. A household washing machine with a spinning cycle of about 400-500 RPM cost about 2,200 DM 30 years ago. Today, an appliance that spins at about 800-900 RPM costs only about 1,000 DM, in spite of a considerable devaluation in money in that time span.
