The average age at which women in the U.S. have their first child is 25.2, according to a 2003 National Vital Statistics Report (the most recent available) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that number's in flux. In 1970, for example, the average was 21.4.

The average age of first-time mothers increased by 3.6 years, from 21.4 years in 1970 to 25.0 years in 2006. While the average age for first births increased from 1970 to 2006, the increases were more dramatic during the first two decades (1970 to 1990) (Figure 1). According to the latest data for selected countries, the average age at first birth in 2006 ranged from 25.0 years in the United States to 29.4 years in Switzerland. The average age at first birth has steadily increased among developed nations (1, 4-6).
The average age of women at their first birth has also risen over the past 4 decades, and since 2000, 46 states and DC have experienced a rise in the first-birth rate for women over 35.
