The canter is a controlled, three-beat gait that usually is a bit faster than the average trot, but slower than the gallop. The average speed of a canter is 16–27 km/h (10–17 mph), depending on the length of the stride of the horse. Listening to a horse canter, one can usually hear the three beats as though a drum had been struck three times in succession. Then there is a rest, and immediately afterwards the three-beat occurs again. Depending on the horse and its speed, a trot can be difficult for a rider to sit because the body of the horse actually drops a bit between beats and bounces up again when the next set of legs strike the ground.
A horse can trot for a long time but will be able to canter only for short periods. So at a trot count 10 to 15 km/hour (average trot on good ground without pulling anything is 15 km/hour) , at a walk the average speed of a horse is around 6km/hour. Source(s): Rode for 25 years.

The horse travels 15 kilometers in 30 minutes, that is half an hour or 1800 seconds. so the average speed is   15 / 0,5 = 30 km/h (kilometers per hour)   or   15 … 000 / 1800 = 8,3 m/s (meters per second). 3 people found this useful. Many would consider 25-30 miles in a day a successful day of travel. If conditions are PERFECT and the horse is well rested, there have been days where a horse can exceed 60 miles
Show that the average speed of a rabbit that runs a distance of 30 m in a time of 2 s is 15 m/s. 
The gallop averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph). The world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is 88 kilometres per hour (55 mph). Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot.
The average speed of a mule when walking is three to four miles an  hour. A dog walks between 2 and 4 miles an hour and a human between  2 and 5 miles. 1 person found this useful. Edit. 2,894 Contributions. The average walking speed is about 5 km/h or 3.1 mph. The typical speed range is from 4.5 km/h (or 2.8 mph) to 5.4 km/h (or 3.35 mph) which makes 3.1 a reasonable average. 39 people found this useful
3 mph times 12 hours, assuming the bridges weren't out and none of the horses broke down or cast a shoe in the middle of nowhere, allowing your party to travel steadily every day, is 36 miles. How long would it take them to cover 1,000 miles? I'll let you do the rest of the math. 
The average horse walks at between 2 to 4 MPH trots at Between 4 to about 10MPH Canters at between 10-20 MPH and Gallups (ie dead run) at between 20-30 MPH. that is BEFORE adding in weights and driving. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about 4 mph. The gallop is very much like the canter, except that it is faster, more ground-covering, and the three-beat canter changes to a four-beat gait. It is the fastest gait of the horse, averaging about 25 to 30 miles per hour, a well trained pair of horses can pull a carriage at full gallup.
When these conditions were met, the average is true: At a good trot gait intermixed with slower 'resting' pace, while traveling in good conditions on good terrain, a horse could travel for 8 hours (with frequent rests) at around an average of between 3 mph (walk) to 8 mph (trot). Many would consider 25-30 miles in a day a successful day of travel. If conditions are PERFECT and the horse is well rested, there have been days where a horse can exceed 60 miles of travel.
