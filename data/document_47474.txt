Some employers track employee hours worked in 15 minute increments, and the FLSA allows an employer to round employee time to the nearest quarter hour. However, an employer may violate the FLSA minimum wage and overtime pay requirements if the employer always rounds down.
For example, if the employee is paid an hourly wage of $9.25 per hour and worked 30 hours in the workweek, the maximum amount the employer could legally deduct from the employee's wages would be $60.00 ($2.00 X 30 hours), so a $25.00 deduction for uniform replacement would be allowed under law.
The employee will be entitled to additional overtime compensation for the 1.25 hours over 40. Example #3: An employer only records and pays for time if employees work in full 15 minute increments. An employee paid $10 per hour is scheduled to work 8 hours a day Monday through Friday, for a total of 40 hours a week. The employee always clocks out 12 minutes after the end of her shift.
Federal and state laws require most employers to pay overtime. The overtime premium is 50% of the employee's usual hourly wage. This means an employee who works overtime must be paid time and a half -- the employee's usual hourly wage plus the 50% overtime premium -- for every overtime hour worked. These laws contain many exceptions, so not all employees are entitled to overtime.
Overtime is to be paid at one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 48 hours in a seven-day workweek, under state law. However, some businesses may be subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act that requires overtime after 40 hours in a seven-day workweek.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires covered employers to pay non exempt employees at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009, for all hours worked and overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.
