Oh Crap! On average, people produce 1 ounce of fecal matter, or 'poop,' for each 12 pounds of body weight, so it depends on your weight. If we assume the average person weighs 150 pounds, that's about 12 oz (1.5 ilbs or a little under a kilogram). How much water does one person need to drink per day? you should drink at least 7 to 10 average sized glasses of water each day.   One average sized glass is about eight ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pint, 2 pints in a quar … t, and 4 quarts in a gallon, so, mathematically, there are about 128 ounces in a gallon.   If the eight ounces is divided by the 128 ounces, then the average person drinks roughly 0.625 gallons of water per day
If the rest of the world produced as much as Americans, there would be about 10 MILLION tons daily, or 4 TRILLION tons yearly. on average Americans generate 4.3 pounds of trash per day. Do the math: 4.3 X 365 = 1569.5 pounds per person per year. 285 million people in the US = 447307.5 Million pounds of trash. Every day, each of us sends 20 gallons of sewage through the system. Over a lifetime, that is 567,575 gallons. To deal with the waste, the United States has built 16,000 treatment centers across the country.
