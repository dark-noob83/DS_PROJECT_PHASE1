General Intake Recommendations. Most women need 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B-12 each day to prevent a deficiency. However, pregnancy and breastfeeding increase your intake requirements -- pregnant women should consume 2.6 mcg of vitamin B-12 per day, while lactating women need 2.8 micrograms daily. Although dietary supplements can be advantageous over food sources when you have a specific vitamin B-12 deficiency, foods with vitamin B-12 tend to be more nutrient-dense and contain other important healthy substances such as fiber, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements.
(You can take in as many carotenoids as you want, however, from fruits and vegetables.). The government considers 3,000 mcg RAE (10,000 IU) to be the maximum amount of preformed vitamin A that you should get from supplements, animal sources, and fortified foods – combined – each day. The upper limit for women younger than age 19 is 2,900 mcg RAE (9,240 IU). 
Vitamin E Overdose. First, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E is quite low, 15 mg to 20 International Units (IU) per day. Many experts claim that vitamin E appears to be safe when consumed in amounts up to 1,000 IU. 
Infants from birth to 12 months need less: 400 IU (10 mcg). After the age of 70, adults need 800 IU (20 mcg). People can get vitamin D from foods that are naturally rich in the vitamin, fortified foods, supplements and exposure to the sun. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that can actually be taken infrequently; for example, once monthly, as long as the dose averages to the daily 800-2,000 international units (I.U.) per day.
Any extra vitamin C will simply be flushed out of your body in your urine. For adults, the recommended dietary reference intake for vitamin C is 65 to 90 milligrams (mg) a day, and the upper limit is 2,000 mg a day. Although too much dietary vitamin C is unlikely to be harmful, megadoses of vitamin C supplements may cause: 1  Diarrhea. 2  Nausea
The safe upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 international units (IU) per day for infants. For children aged one to eight years, the safe upper limit is 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day, and 4,000 IU/day for children nine years and older, adults and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that can actually be taken infrequently; for example, once monthly, as long as the dose averages to the daily 800-2,000 international units (I.U.) per day.
Recommended Amount. Vitamin B-12 recommendations remain the same from teenage years throughout adulthood and into your golden years. You need 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B-12 each day. If you are pregnant, your recommendation goes up to 2.6 micrograms, which increases further to 2.8 micrograms while you are breastfeeding, explains the Linus Pauling Institute. Meat, seafood, eggs and dairy are rich in vitamin B-12. 
We recommend that you take at least 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D each day. Most multivitamins contain only 400 IU. There are two forms: D2 (ergocalciferol), which is created during plant photosynthesis, and D3 (cholecalciferol), which is made when human skin is exposed to the UVB rays from sunlight. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that can actually be taken infrequently; for example, once monthly, as long as the dose averages to the daily 800-2,000 international units (I.U.) per day.
The amount of vitamin A you need depends on your age and reproductive status. Recommended intakes for vitamin A for people aged 14 years and older range between 700 and 900 micrograms (mcg) of retinol activity equivalents (RAE) per day. Recommended intakes for women who are nursing range between 1,200 and 1,300 RAE.
Intake Recommendations. Most women need 2,333 International Units, or 700 micrograms, of vitamin A each day, while men need 3,000 IU or 900 micrograms, according to the Linus Pauling Institute. While you technically don’t need to get vitamin A every day because your body can tap into your vitamin A stores to keep functioning, you should try to meet your recommended daily intake of the nutrient to avoid depleting your reserves.
