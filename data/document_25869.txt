These side effects were usually mild and of short duration. As treatment for alcoholism, naltrexone side effects, predominantly nausea, have been se vere enough to discontinue the medication in 5-10% of the patients starting it. For most other patients side effects are mild or of brief duration. One serious possibility is that naltrexone can have toxic effects on the liver.
Naltrexone is also used to reduce cravings for alcohol. Scientists are unsure how it works in relation to alcohol but it has been shown to reduce desire and cravings by blocking the same receptors that create feelings of pleasure when opioids are taken.
Naltrexone has been used in 50 mg doses for decades to help patients recover from addiction to alcohol, heroin and other opiate drugs. However, more than 20 years ago it was discovered that very small doses of this drug—3 to 4.5 mg—have profound effects on the immune system.
4. If I take naltrexone, does it mean that I don't need other treatment for alcoholism? No, naltrexone is only one component of a program of treatment for alcoholism including counseling, help with associated psychological and social problems and participation in self-help groups.
Naltrexone is a medication that blocks the effects of drugs known as opioids (a class that includes morphine, heroin or codeine). It competes with these drugs for opioid receptors in the brain.
Naltrexone does not reduce the effects of alcohol that impair coordination and judgment. Naltrexone may reduce the feeling of intoxication and the desire to drink more, but it will not cause a severe physical response to drinking.5.
Because naltrexone blocks the brain areas where narcotics and alcohol work, you should be careful not to take any narcotics, such as codeine, morphine or heroin, while you are taking naltrexone. Do not take any cough medicine with codeine in it
