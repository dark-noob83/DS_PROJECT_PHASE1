Just like letter services-the postage rate you will be given will depend on some factors. For the smallest of parcels, or what the Royal Mail call large letter, we're probably not the best shipping solution for you. But when it comes to larger parcels we can offer a significant reduction on traditional services.

USE BIG ENVELOPES FOR FLATS: Don't try to mail a small envelope that's over 3.5 oz. even if you pay for it. The small envelope will look like a letter, and LETTER service up to 64 oz was dropped on 12May2008, so now there's only big flats. Fill the airplanes with big envelopes, that's what they expect.
