Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price. The cost per square foot is often higher for a small home than that of a larger home. When building a larger home, the cost of expensive items (such as a furnace or kitchen) is spread over more square footage.

Average Price: $60 per sq. ft. A manufacturer may say something like “You’re looking at around $200,000 to have the home built and set up.” There are a few half-truths in that claim.
