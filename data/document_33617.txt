The World’s largest earthquake with an instrumentally documented magnitude occurred on May 22, 1960 near Valdivia, in southern Chile. It was assigned a magnitude of 9.5 by the United States Geological Survey. It is referred to as the Great Chilean Earthquake and the 1960 Valdivia Earthquake. The United States Geological Survey reports this event as the largest earthquake of the 20th Century. Other earthquakes in recorded history may have been larger, however this is the largest earthquake that has occurred since accurate estimates of magnitude became possible in the earnly 1900's. The earthquake occurred beneath the Pacific Ocean off the coast of
It was the most powerful recorded earthquake in U.S. and North American history, and the second most powerful ever measured by seismograph. It had a magnitude of 9.2, at the time making it the second largest earthquake in recorded history. The shaking lasted about 4 minutes. Landslides in Anchorage caused heavy damage. The 1960 Valdivia earthquake or Great Chilean Earthquake of Sunday, 22 May 1960 is to date the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Earth’s history, rating 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale.
1. Great Chilean Earthquake - 9.5 magnitude The strongest earthquake ever recorded (9.5 magnitude) struck off the coast of Chile on May 22, 1960, causing tsunamis over 10 meters high, that traveled as far as Hawaii, Japan, and New Zealand, killing 4,000-5,000 and leaving over 2,000,000 people homeless. The destruction was massive, but, luckily, only 125 lives were lost as a result of the earthquake (15) and ensuing tsunami (110). The strongest earthquake ever recorded is the 1960 Valdivia Earthquake that occurred in Chile. This had a magnitude of 9.5.
The following is a list of earthquake lists, and of top earthquakes by magnitude and fatalities. The figure of 230,000 dead is based on a historical conflation of this earthquake with earthquakes in November 1137 on the Jazira plain and on September 30, 1139 in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja. The first mention of a 230,000 death toll was by Ibn Taghribirdi in the fifteenth century.
The 7.1 magnitude Olympia earthquake in 1949 is the largest earthquake to occur in the Seattle region since records began. Edit.

On March 11, a magnitude 9.0 quake triggered a tsunami that killed an estimated 29,000 people and damaged some nuclear reactors. This earthquake is the largest ever recorded in Japan. Aftershocks continue to rock the island of Honshu. The world’s first recorded magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off the east coast of Kamchatka in 1952. The quake generated a 43-foot tsunami (13 m) locally. The tsunami rocked Crescent City, Calif. , which was also hit hard by the recent Japan earthquake.
An earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth’s crust that creates seismic waves. The seismicity, seismism or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. Determining the largest earthquakes can be a difficult task. Below is the list of all known 10 Strongest earthquakes measured or estimated to have a moment magnitude scale or Richter magnitude scale of 8.5 and above. The 1960 Valdivia earthquake or Great Chilean Earthquake of Sunday, 22 May 1960 is to date the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Earth’s history, rating 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale.
