1 Prevnar 13 ® is a vaccine approved for adults 50 years of age and older for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).
Indications for Prevnar 13 1  ®. Prevnar 13 ® is a vaccine approved for adults 50 years of age and older for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).
1 In children 6 weeks through 17 years of age (prior to the 18th birthday), Prevnar 13 ® is indicated for the prevention of invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F.
For children, the pneumococcal 13-valent vaccine is given in a series of shots. The first shot is usually given when the child is 2 months old. The booster shots are then given at 4 months, 6 months, and 12 to 15 months of age.
1 In children 6 weeks through 5 years of age (prior to the 6th birthday) Prevnar 13 ® is indicated for the prevention of otitis media caused by S pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. 2  Prevnar 13 ® is not 100% effective and will only help protect against the 13 strains included in the vaccine.
First, the recommendation calls for offering a dose of the PCV13 vaccination, marketed by Pfizer Inc. as Prevnar 13, to adults age 65 or older who have not previously received a pneumococcal vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown.
Adding value (in terms of diseases covered) to the already profitable Prevnar means jacking up the price too. The new vaccine will cost $108 per dose, up 35 percent from $80. With four injections needed to complete the vaccine dosing, uninsured families would have to pay $432 out of pocket for Prevnar 13. Government health providers will pay $100 a dose for the new vaccine, up from $65 per dose for original Prevnar.
