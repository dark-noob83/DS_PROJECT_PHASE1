A POSITIVE test result from a Hemoccult II test means that there was evidence of occult (hidden) blood detected in your stool specimen. This means you have traces of blood in your stool. A single, positive Hemoccult screening does not mean you have cancer.
The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is a lab test used to check stool samples for hidden (occult) blood. Occult blood in the stool may indicate colon cancer or polyps in the colon or rectum â€” though not all cancers or polyps bleed.
The main use for the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is as a screen for early colon cancer. Most cases of colon cancer begin with the development of benign intestinal polyps. Benign polyps are relatively common in people over the age of 50.
Even if your test results are different from the normal value, you may not have a problem. To learn what the results mean for you, talk with your health care provider. A fecal occult blood test uses chemicals to find out if there is blood in a sample of feces. If your test is negative, your result is normal.
A normal FIT/iFOBT or FOBT test means that there was no blood in your stool at the time of the test. A normal sDNA test means that no abnormal cells were found. Normal test results are called negative.
What does Occult Blood in Urine Mean. Occult blood is blood that cannot be seen without a microscope, so occult blood in urine indicate the presence of the red blood cells in the urine so indicating a problem. Another term commonly used for the same condition is hematuria.
What Test Results Mean A NEGATIVE result from a Hemoccult II test means that there was no evidence of occult (hidden) blood detected in your stool specimen. However, this test is not a complete cancer detection examination; it only detects blood in the stool.
