Natalie's Yours Truly album is delightful. I love three types of music: classical, bluegrass and Celtic. I was thrilled to hear Yo Yo Ma, Alison Krauss and Natalie together playing and singing the Wexford Carol. They are three truly universal musicians.

Mary Francis was so very good also. Much Luck to you both.
