They can go in incubator now. They can be put in incubator 2 days after set or up to 8 days. The duck egg that was layed yesterday can be but wait a day or 2 for the newer ones. I would wait a while until you have a clutch of eggs that are needed, the eggs will be fine
dont put them in the incubator unless you are planning on hatching them. They can last up to 12 to 14 days without being in the incubator but any more than that and the embryo will die. the duck eggs will be fine if they are under 12 days old.
FACT: fertile eggs can sit at room temperature for two weeks before being incubated, and will still hatch! The first 10 days of a parakeet's life are the most delicate. Once they make it to the downing and pin feathers, they usually survive.
10 days before they start to lose fertility, however many have set older eggs with success. X2. I have had a few hatch that were older though. I set eggs once a week, but a few times I've skipped a week and set eggs when a few eggs were 14 days old and still had good hatches. The trick is keeping the eggs cool and turning them a couple of times a day until you are ready to put them in the incubator. I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.
Before incubation, quail eggs can be stored for up to 7 days. When storing quail eggs before incubating, make sure that they are kept at a constant temperature of 13-18 degrees Celsius or 55-65 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not store the quail eggs at ordinary room temperature or in a refrigerator.
