Yes, DNA is an acid. In the structure of DNA, there is sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate ion, and a nitrogenous base. the phosphate ion gives the acidic property. Fri Jan 14, 2005 5:07 pm. Which is kind of funny because the nitrogen base really IS a base.
First of all, DNA is not made up of nucleotide bases but of nucleotides. These consist of a sugar bound to one of the 4 nucleobases Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine or Thymine (Uracil in the case of RNA) and a phosphate group.
As you already know, the letters in DNA stand for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.. DNA is a polymer made up of monomers called nucleic acids, which are linked together in long chains. Each nucleic acid monomer is made up of a sugar (deoxyribose in DNA), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. The nitrogenous bases are called adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).
Great question. Deoxyribonucleic Acid is made up of a sugar (the deoxyribose), a phosphate ion, and a nitrogenous base. the phosphate ion is where the acidity is, its also called phosphoric acid while in your cells.
DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a personâ€™s body has the same DNA.
