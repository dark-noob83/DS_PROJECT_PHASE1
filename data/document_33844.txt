Once the message is encoded with the pad, the pad is destroyed and the encoded message is sent. On the recipient's side, the encoded message is XORed with the duplicate copy of the pad and the plaintext message is generated. Think of a one-time pad as a 100% noise source which is used to mask the message.
The other critical aspect of the Vernam cipher is the randomness of the pad sequence. An event sequence can be said to be truly random if it is impossible to predict the next event in the sequence even if the entire state of the generating process up to that point is known.
One-Time-Pad (Vernam's Cipher) Frequently Asked Questions. A one-time pad isn't a cryptosystem: it's a state of mind. - Marcus Ranum. A Russian One-time pad, captured by MI5 (click to enlarge). As a practical person, I've observed that one-time pads are theoretically unbreakable, but practically very weak.
De-Coded-encryption. The vernam cipher, sometimes known as the 'one time pad', is a stream cipher, which providing certain requirements are met, can be theoretically unbreakable.
Vernam cipher (one time pad). The vernam cipher, sometimes known as the 'one time pad', is a stream cipher, which providing certain requirements are met, can be theoretically unbreakable. It uses a randomly chosen key, which is XOR'd one bit at a time with the plain text.
Vernam proposed a teleprinter cipher in which a previously prepared key, kept on paper tape, is combined character by character with the plaintext message to produce the ciphertext. To decipher the ciphertext, the same key would be again combined character by character, producing the plaintext.
Of all the methods of encryption ever devised, only one has been mathematically proved to be completely secure. It is called the Vernam cipher or one-time pad. The worth of all other ciphers is based on computational security.
