My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer stage 4 over a year ago. She is in palliative care and of course getting weaker. The past few days her legs have swelled up like footballs and now today her arms are swelling up. The doctor has ordered an ultra sound.
Swelling. Swelling (edema) is a build-up of water in the tissues. This can be caused by retaining salt and water due to medicines or heart, liver, or kidney failure. It can sometimes be due to poor nutrition, pelvic tumors, or a blockage in the veins or lymph system.
My Mom has lung cancer and it has metastasized to her liver. She is in the advanced stage of small cell lung cancer. She has gotten in real bad shape over the last few weeks. Her feet have swollen up so much, I can barely distinguish her toes. I asked the nurse why and she said it has to do with the liver failure.
