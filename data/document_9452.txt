When you are infected with a virus, a battle begins between your body's natural defenses against infections, or immune system, and the virus. When the hepatitis C virus leaves your blood and enters the liver cells it begins making as many copies of itself as possible. Your immune system tries to get rid of the virus by sending in special cells and releasing several natural chemicals.
Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can trigger autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in a minority of patients. This means that the liver cells are damaged not only by the virus but also by the body's own immune system. People with another form of hepatitis, HIV, hemophilia, kidney disease, and diabetes have a higher rate of infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) than the general population. Some conditions share a common transmission route with HCV, such as other viruses, hepatitis B, and HIV.
Hepatitis C virus and the immune system: a concise review. Gremion C(1), Cerny A. Author information: (1)Clinic for Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology/Allergology, University of Bern, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland. During the chronic phase of the infection, HCV does not seem to be cytopathic. This aspect is still controversial as the virus was linked to the development of cholestatic syndrome or acute lobular hepatitis after liver transplant in HCV infected patients.
Chronic infection can cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). As the disease progresses, symptoms such as skin problems, blood disorders, and fever may appear. In the long term, hepatitis C can lead to severe liver damage, liver cancer, and liver failure. Early treatment can help delay or prevent serious damage. Learn the Effects of Hepatitis C on the Body. Hepatitis C is a viral disease that primarily causes inflammation of the liver, but the effects can be felt throughout the body. Hepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver. Over time, this leads to scarring and severe damage to the liver and its functions. Evenutally, the liver loses its ability to work at all
Hepatitis C affects the immune system, causing serious liver damage leading to scarring of the liver. The virus causes the immune system to break down, making the affected person more susceptible to other infectious diseases. Autoimmune Diseases. There are a variety of autoimmune diseases that weaken the immune system. An autoimmune disease is the result of the body attacking itself. Some cells within the body become hyperactive and don't function as they should.
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) induces a chronic infection in 50%-80% of infected individuals, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. During the chronic phase of the infection, HCV does not seem to be cytopathic. This aspect is still controversial as the virus was linked to the development of cholestatic syndrome or acute lobular hepatitis after liver transplant in HCV infected patients.
Hepatitis C is caused by a virus that is passed through contact with the blood of an infected person. The infection leads to inflammation of the liver. The liver processes blood and filter toxins so they don’t cause damage to your body. Learn the Effects of Hepatitis C on the Body. Hepatitis C is a viral disease that primarily causes inflammation of the liver, but the effects can be felt throughout the body. Hepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver. Over time, this leads to scarring and severe damage to the liver and its functions. Evenutally, the liver loses its ability to work at all
When the body is infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the immune system swings into action. The immune systems of approximately 15% to 45% of people infected with HCV are able to rid their bodies of the virus. •The hepatitis C virus: The virus is growing and making proteins inside your body, which affects your immune system, your liver cells, and other parts of your body. •The immune system: Your immune system is now in attack mode because it senses danger from the hep C virus.
A. When the immune system becomes activated, as in the case of an autoimmune disease, there is increased production of inflammatory cells (T-cells), antibodies, and other inflammatory chemicals. The overactivated immune system can lead to systemic symptoms of fatigue and low-grade fever. A. Autoimmune hepatitis requires laboratory tests to distinguish it from uncomplicated hepatitis C infections. When AIH is triggered, the immune system produces protective antibodies that actually attack the enemy organ.
