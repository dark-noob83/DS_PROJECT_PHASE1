A gigabyte (GB) is a measure of computer data storage capacity that is roughly equivalent to 1 billion bytes. A gigabyte is two to the 30th power or 1,073,741,824 in decimal notation. The term is pronounced with two hard Gs. The prefix giga comes from a Greek word meaning giant. The base-10 definition of gigabyte uses the decimal system to show that 1 GB is equal to one to the 10 th power of bytes, or 1 billion bytes. This is the standard most storage manufacturers and consumers use today. Computers typically use the binary form of measurement, referred to as base-2.
The gigabyte (/ˈɡɪɡəbaɪt/ GIG-ə-byt or /ˈdʒɪɡəbaɪt/) is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The prefix giga means 10 9 in the International System of Units (SI), therefore one gigabyte is 1000000000bytes. The unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB. This definition is used in all contexts of science, engineering, business, and many areas of computing, including hard drive, solid state drive, and tape capacities, as well as data transmission speeds
Meronyms (parts of GB): MB; megabyte (a unit of information equal to one million (1,048,576) bytes). Holonyms (GB is a part of...): T; TB; terabyte (a unit of information equal to a trillion (1,099,511,627,776) bytes or 1024 gigabytes). 4. a monarchy in northwestern Europe occupying most of the British Isles; divided into England and Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland. Familiarity information: GB used as a noun is uncommon.
MB, KB and GB are all shortened names measuring the amount of memory or disk space that is used by a computer. KB stands for kilobyte, which is 1000 bytes. MB stands for megabyte, which is 1000 kilobytes. GB stands for gigabtye, which is 1000 megabytes. 
What is 250 GB (250 gigabytes) and why is this phrase so popular? Webopedia explains what the phrase 250 GB means in reference to data storage capacity and Internet service provider data transfer limits. In computing, the phrase 250 GB (or 250 gigabytes) is most commonly used in reference to disk storage and also data transmission (transfer capacity) for Internet account usage. In data storage, the phrase 250 GB is used to refer to the amount of data a storage medium can hold.
There are two standards for measuring the number of bytes in a gigabyte: base-10 and base-2. The base-10 definition of gigabyte uses the decimal system to show that 1 GB is equal to one to the 10 th power of bytes, or 1 billion bytes. This is the standard most storage manufacturers and consumers use today. Computers typically use the binary form of measurement, referred to as base-2.
gb. .gb is a reserved Internet country code top-level domain for the United Kingdom. The domain was introduced with RFC 920 in October 1984 that set out the creation of ccTLD generally using country codes derived from the corresponding two-letter code in the ISO 3166-1 list. 
GB means giga bytes or it might refer to Great Britain. Or could refer to 'George Benson' signature model.
