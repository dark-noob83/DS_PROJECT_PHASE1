These temperatures are the core body temperature. It is in the normal range if the orally measured temperature of adults is 98.2°F, with fluctuation of 1.3°F higher or lower. If the adult shows oral temperature of more than 99.5°F, then it is considered as fever or some other medical conditions. In elderly people, the temperature is lower. If it falls below 96.8°F then the child has low temperature and needs immediate warming up. For children, the normal body temperature range is between 96.8°F to 98.2°F. It is the same as the range of normal body temperature for adults. If the rectal temperature of children reaches 100.4°F, then it need call for immediate medical attention for fev
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Although it is commonly thought that 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the average oral temperature for an adult, normal temperature can range from 97.1 degrees to about 99.5 degrees. It is a good idea to determine your own normal body temperature by taking your temperature when you feel well. 
The normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). In adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 33.2–38.2 °C (91.8–100.8 °F) for normal temperatures, depending on the gender and location measured. The body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change.
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally. Strength of the pulse. The normal pulse for healthy adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. The pulse rate may fluctuate and increase with exercise, illness, injury, and emotions. Females ages 12 and older, in general, tend to have faster heart rates than do males.
A fever is a body temperature above 100.4°F. A normal oral temperature for a resting, healthy adult is about 98.6°F (37°C) (for someone over 70 normal temp is 96.8°F (36°C)). Your temperature can go up or down 1 to 2 degrees throughout the day. Fever is a sign of inflammation or infection and is a common symptom of illness. Fever is not a disease. 
In grown adults, a normal temperature can range from 97.8°F to 99°F, or between 36.5°C and 37.2°C. Fevers. When an adult's body temperature is above the normal range, he or she is considered to have a fever. Medically speaking, a fever is present with temperatures above 98.6°F with an oral thermometer or above 99.8°F with a rectal thermometer.
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally. 
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) .
