Hi there, In Australia the pharmacy cost price for a single epipen is over one hundred dollars add on their profit etc and the recommended retail price is $135.00 for a single pen. Our health insurance covers only $20.00. But at least I was lucky to get 13 months on the expiry date.

Colleen, Last time we got an Epi-pen JR it was $50.00 (we pay 1/2 so it was $25 for us). I have heard that the adult dose is $100. It is a lot of money and I get so upset when I get one and it expires in less than a year.We had to get an anakit when the pens were recalled last year. Luckily we had one that was O.K.
