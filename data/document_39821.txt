Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a condition in which the heart 's mitral valve doesn't work well. The flaps of the valve are floppy and don't close tightly. These flaps normally help seal or open the valve.
Chest pain is the most frequent symptom in people who have symptoms with mitral valve prolapse. The chest pain may be very bothersome and frightening, but it does not increase the risk of heart attack, death, or other heart problems. Mitral valve prolapse is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation.
In this article. Mitral valve prolapse is a common cause of a heart murmur caused by a leaky heart valve. Most cases of mitral valve prolapse are not serious and only need to be monitored. Mitral valve prolapse is associated with many other symptoms and conditions.
Mitral (MI-tral) valve prolapse (MVP) is a condition in which the heart's mitral valve doesn't work well. The flaps of the valve are floppy and don't close tightly. These flaps normally help seal or open the valve. Much of the time, MVP doesn't cause any problems.
Mitral Valve Prolapse. In MVP, when the left ventricle contracts, one or both flaps of the mitral valve flop or bulge back (prolapse) into the left atrium. This can prevent the valve from forming a tight seal. As a result, blood may leak from the ventricle back into the atrium.
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) occurs when the valve between your heart's left upper chamber (left atrium) and the left lower chamber (left ventricle) doesn't close properly. During mitral valve prolapse, the leaflets of the mitral valve bulge (prolapse) upward or back into the left atrium as the heart contracts.
