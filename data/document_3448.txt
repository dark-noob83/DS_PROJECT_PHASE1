Calculating the Premium. The simplest way to calculate the premium cost for workers' compensation is to multiple the annual payroll by the rate classification. For example, a company with an annual payroll of $250,000 paying a rate of 10 percent would have an annual workers' comp premium of $25,000. Once the premium is calculated, employers can work with their insurance agents to lessen the overall cost of the insurance.
Costs. In addition to their social costs, workplace injuries and illnesses have a major impact on an employer's bottom line. It has been estimated that employers pay almost $1 billion per week for direct workers' compensation costs alone. The costs of workplace injuries and illnesses include direct and indirect costs.
In the mid-1950s, private sector employers paid an average 0.5 percent of payroll for workers compensation. By 1970 this figure was 1 percent, escalating steeply in the 1980s and 1990s to a record high in 1994 of 2.99 percent.
