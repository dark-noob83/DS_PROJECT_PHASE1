Filox-R is a superior high efficiency media that removes iron, hydrogen sulfide and manganese. This product is popular for having the highest flow rate of any standard iron removal media, and for its excellent filtration media that outperforms traditional Greensand and Birm.
Filox-R™ is used for removing iron, hydrogen sulfide, and manganese from water supplies. It is a media that utilizes an oxidation-reduction reaction and filtration process similar to Greensand, but at a much higher level of performance.
The Filox filter is controlled by the old reliable, tough Fleck 2510 filter valve. It's easy to program—you can change the backwash cycle, for example, by simply opening the hinged face and moving a pin or two—and it lasts forever.
Filox. Filox water filters are a filter medium specifically created for lowering the levels of manganese, iron and hydrogen sulfide from well water. Filox filters are superior performers to other filter media due to the product’s notably high manganese dioxide percentage. Manganese Dioxide Content.
This particular Filox iron filter used an air charger control valve which keeps a head of air at the top of the filter tank. As the water enters the tank, it falls through air trapped inside the top of the filter tank. This adds oxygen to the water and helps the Filox iron filter media work correctly. The iron filter back-washed every night with a strong backwash from the well pump. However, this water had 3 PPM of iron, 0.5 PPM of manganese and was high in hydrogen sulfide odors.
