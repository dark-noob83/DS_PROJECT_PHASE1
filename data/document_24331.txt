If the Power of Attorney grants you the power to sell her property you can sell the home and use the money for HER car and her care only. Your financial plan is not complete until it is co-ordinated with your estate plan.
Power of Attorney. When your mother grants you power of attorney, she grants you the right to make specific decisions on her behalf. Your right to act on your mother's behalf is dependent on the kinds of powers you receive, but also upon the capacity of your mother.
I have had a few questions lately from people who say they have a Power Of Attorney for their parent and the parent recently died. Usually, they want to know if they can use that Power Of Attorney to sell their parent’s house. A Power Of Attorney allows the agent to do anything that the principal can do. In the situation above, the child was named as the agent and the parent was the principal. If we think about it logically, a principal can’t do anything after they have died, and that is exactly what happens with the Power Of Attorney.
Save. When parents plan for the end of life, they often grant their children power of attorney. A power of attorney is a legal document a parent can use to let her children make decisions for her. If your mother grants you power of attorney to sell her home, you can only do so while she remains alive.
If your mother is still alive, you can record with the county recorder the power of attorney and then sell her home to pay her bills. If she has passed away, then the power of attorney is no longer valid.
Even if your mother has granted you power of attorney and wants you to sell her home for her, you may have to register the document before you can conduct the transaction. Some states require that an attorney-in-fact who conveys real estate or interests in real estate must record the power of attorney document.
