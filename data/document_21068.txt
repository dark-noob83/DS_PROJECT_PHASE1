I’ve been reading articles that say starting with cardio is not the way to go when doing a weight training workout. My friends and other people in the gym say I should end my weight lifting workout with 45 minutes of slow cardio (walking, bike) or 20 minutes of intense cardio to maximize results.
Alternate doing days of cardio and weight training with days of just cardio. Do your cardio before your weight training routine, as fat loss is your main goal, you want to dedicate 100% of your intensity to your cardio workouts.
Training To Gain Muscle. If you're training to lose fat, you're going to need to do more cardio than someone who is training to gain muscle. A good starting point is three times per week, 20 to 30 minutes per session. Depending on the other factors we're going to discuss, you may need more or less than this.
I do 60 min of weight lifting 3 times a week, and cardio (running, hiit etc.) 45 min after workout 5 times a week. So, I do more cardio than weight lifting, that’s because I want to lose at least one inch more of waistline.
An ideal cardio session should be around 45 minutes. If you lift weights before aerobic training, you’ll only need 15-20 minutes of cardio. You’ll get the same benefits as you would do in 45 minutes without weight training.
As you see, fat is last on the scale. It takes 20 to 30 minutes for your body to burn fat once you start doing cardio. In this interval, you will burn glycogen and BBAs. The first 20-30 minutes of cardio are a waste. For optimal results, you should lift weights for at least 20 minutes and then do cardio exercises. This way, your muscles will be depleted of glycogen when you start doing cardio. Strength training does use up your glycogen stores.
