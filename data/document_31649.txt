Resolved Question: My vet recommended Kaopectate for my cat's diarrhea, and I gave her a dose earlier tonight. It seems to have helped, but then I read the ingredients and found it's not kaolin and pectin, it's the same as pepto bismol. Pepto contains salycilate which is bad for cats, I've always heard.
Report Abuse. Yes, you can give a cat kaopectate. 1 cc for every 5 pounds of body weight. Once every 12 hours, do not allow the cat to have food for 24 hours. But make sure cat has plenty of water. Mind you, this is for ADULT cats.
Summary. Kaolin/pectin is used to treat mild diarrhea in dogs and cats. May cause constipation at high doses. If the vomiting and/or diarrhea persists for more than 48 hours; the pet has a fever, is depressed or shows abdominal pain; or the pet does not continue to be active and alert, contact your veterinarian.
Kaopectate is a popular over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medication used by humans, and often gets attention from cat owners as a potential fix for loose cat stools.
1 If your cat goes outside, check that your neighbors aren't feeding your cat. 2  Eating too much or eating food they aren't used to can give cats diarrhea. 3  Check your yard and your neighbors' yards for poisonous plants that your cat may have nibbled. 4  Your vet should be able to give you a list of poisonous plants.
