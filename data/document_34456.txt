Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, a type of thermoplastic, is used to make LEGO® blocks. Polycarbonate, a common type of thermoplastic, is used in eyeglass lenses. Polyethylene, one of the most common thermoplastics, is often used in shampoo bottles. A toy with thermoplastic parts.
These 10 animal facts will amaze you. A thermoplastic (sometimes written as thermo plastic) is a type of plastic made from polymer resins that becomes a homogenized liquid when heated and hard when cooled. When frozen, however, a thermoplastic becomes glass-like and subject to fracture.
In fact, this is usually the case when a thermoplastic is being used for plastic injection molding or extrusion. The specific action of a plasticizer is to lower the material’s glass transition temperature (Tg), which is the point it becomes brittle when cooled and soft when heated.
• THERMOPLASTIC (adjective). The adjective THERMOPLASTIC has 1 sense: 1. having the property of softening or fusing when heated and of hardening and becoming rigid again when cooled. Familiarity information: THERMOPLASTIC used as an adjective is very rare.
1. thermoplastic-a material that softens when heated and hardens again when cooled. thermoplastic resin. plastic-generic name for certain synthetic or semisynthetic materials that can be molded or extruded into objects or films or filaments or used for making e.g. coatings and adhesives.
The hot alternative. Thermoplastic is a hot-applied road marking compound for the creation of highly reflective stripings with long-term performance. Thermoplastic is based on either alkyd or hydrocarbon resins and contains a significant portion of premix glass beads. The material is available as powder or in preformed blocks.
Though thermoset plastics and thermoplastics sound similar, they have very different properties and applications. Understanding the performance differences can help you make better sourcing decisions and improve your product designs.
