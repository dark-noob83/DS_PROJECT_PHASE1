At CollectorsLine, we carry only the finest collectible figurines. We are delighted to present the beautiful Nao by Lladro line made from the most excellent Spanish porcelain. The Nao by Lladro line was created in 1968 by the Lladro brothers under the name Rosal. This unique collection was intended to be a simple, elegant, and modest collection of distinctive figurines, though duplicate figurines were made both as part of the original Lladro core collection and under the newer Nao name. Though the Nao by Lladro line has a different name and reflects different inspirations, its place in the Lladro group ensures that each piece represents the quality for which Lladro is famous. CollectorsLine is pleased to offer a beautiful selection of Nao by Lladro collectible figurines that will delight any collector!
Lladro and Nao are both made by the same company. A piece by LLadro and Nao might be similar in appearance, but, if you look closer, you start to notice differences. Both pieces are made from porcelain, however, Lladro uses a better quality, more refined, porcelain resin to cast each piece. After the pieces are cast, the Lladro figurines are sanded by hand longer and held to a much higher standard for smoothness than the Nao.

Best Answer: lladro is made by the experts of pottery and nao by their apprentices both are high quality lladro wont let pieces go for sale unless they are to a specific standard even those by nao ....a friend of mine works in there factory. Source(s): casha1 · 8 years ago. Thumbs up. My understanding is that Nao is manufactured by Lladro but is their less expensive line of pieces. Not as limited in edition as the Lladro pieces. Nao is still worth some money just not stupid money..lol.
