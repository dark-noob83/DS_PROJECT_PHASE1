The oil determins how long your 4-stroke ATV will last. Check it after each ride... Here's how: 1  Before you check the oil level, start your engine and let it turn for a minute or 2 before you shut it down again. 2  Screw out the oil dipstick. 3  Clean it with a clean cloth and screw it back in. 4  The way you put the dipstick back in depends on the ATV model you own.
Next is the oil change. On the Polaris's you take this side panel off and it fits in grooves right here, right here and there is a rubber pin that sits in there. You just set it aside and then the oil on the Polaris's to check the oil, you need a rage. To check your oil on the Polaris's they have a separate oil tank. All the oil is not in a Polaris motor. Most Polaris motors they have what they call a remote reservoir oil system and this is the dipstick for a Polaris.
Some of them are up under here and the dipstick on a Polaris when you check it, you pull it out and wipe it off and you don't screw it back on. You just set it on back on top and bring it out and you can tell your oil level. This one is right here. It's right where it is supposed to be.
In this video I walk through how to change the oil on a Polaris Sportsman four wheeler. I cover draining the oil tank, draining the crank case, changing the oil filter and cleaning off the oil screen. Some people who own a Sportsman don't even know where the crank case drain plug is located, let along how to remove it.
