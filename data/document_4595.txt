Putting a puppy in some warm, shallow water for a shampoo-less bath can be beneficial to both her and you. Breeds that require a lot of grooming will benefit from getting used to bath time at a young age. In fact, a puppy's early introduction to a bath can also benefit you, no matter what breed she is.
Puppies at any age like to get dirty. But it is not smart to bathe your puppy when it is too young. You should only bathe puppies that are older than 12 weeks. Until they are old enough you might have to settle cleaning your puppy with a sponge bath. Before your dog is 12 weeks old the less water the better. Just spot clean your puppy with a damp cloth.
Not all dog shampoos are suitable for all puppies; the label will note the age at which the product is safe for use. Puppies shouldn't be bathed using most dog shampoos until they're 12 weeks old, but dog shampoos differ, much as human shampoos do. For example, if your puppy got into something stinky, you can use a deodorizing shampoo.
When your dog does need a bath, be sure to use a shampoo that was specifically designed for dogs, because even the most mild human shampoo is not formulated for your dogâ€”and it can cause dry, itchy, irritated skin. If you're not sure about how often you should bathe your dog, ask an experienced groomer or your vet.
In general, puppies don't need to be bathed unless they're visibly dirty or smelly. Puppies -- and older dogs -- need the natural oils in their fur to keep their coats and skin healthy. Most dog shampoos are for dogs around 3 months old or older, but you can still bathe younger puppies if need be.
