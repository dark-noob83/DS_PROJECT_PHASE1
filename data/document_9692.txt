The purpose of system integration testing is to ensure all parts of these systems successfully co-exist and exchange data where necessary. There may be more parties in the integration, for example the primary customer (consumer) can have their own customers; there may be also multiple providers. There is not that much to do with the application layer when we perform a system integration testing. 1. Mark all the fields from business requirement documents which should be visible in the UI. 2. Create a data map from database fields to application fields and check whether necessary fields are visible in UI.
Visual Studio .NET 2003. Integration testing is a logical extension of unit testing. In its simplest form, two units that have already been tested are combined into a component and the interface between them is tested. A component, in this sense, refers to an integrated aggregate of more than one unit. Integration testing identifies problems that occur when units are combined. By using a test plan that requires you to test each unit and ensure the viability of each before combining units, you know that any errors discovered when combining units are likely related to the interface between units.
In the context of software systems and software engineering, system integration testing (SIT) is a testing process that exercises a software system's coexistence with others. With multiple integrated systems, assuming that each have already passed system testing, SIT proceeds to test their required interactions. There is not that much to do with the application layer when we perform a system integration testing. 1. Mark all the fields from business requirement documents which should be visible in the UI. 2. Create a data map from database fields to application fields and check whether necessary fields are visible in UI.

System integration testing is testing performed when two systems, generally presumed stable themselves, are integrated with one another. For example, this could be when an inventory management system is integrated with a sales accounting system. Each system feeds into the other. The goal of systems integration testing is to ensure that the data crossing the boundary between systems is received, stored and used appropriately by the receiving system. Until integration begins, testing of the isolated systems is done on mocked or replayed data and not on live data. 
System Integration Testing(SIT) is a black box testing technique that evaluates the system's compliance against specified requirements. System Integration Testing is usually performed on subset of system while system testing is performed on a complete system and is preceded by the user acceptance test (UAT). 
Software System Integration. Software system integration refers to the practice of combining individually tested software components into an integrated whole. Software is integrated when components are combined into subsystems or when subsystems are combined into products. 
Systems testing is often performed against the whole platform, and treats the environment as a black box. system integration testing however, acts upon a subset of the whole system, and may mock other platforms, interact with databases, network sockets etc to evoke appropriate responses from the parts being validated.
Integration Testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. 1 Big Bang is an approach to Integration Testing where all or most of the units are combined together and tested at one go. 2  This approach is taken when the testing team receives the entire software in a bundle.
(August 2010). Integration testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing. A type of Big Bang Integration testing is called Usage Model testing. Usage Model Testing can be used in both software and hardware integration testing. The basis behind this type of integration testing is to run user-like workloads in integrated user-like environments.
