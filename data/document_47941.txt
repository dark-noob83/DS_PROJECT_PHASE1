Your dose of clonazepam will depend on the condition you have and your response to the drug. Your doctor will start you at a low dose and increase your dose until you have a good response. This may take a few weeks. Clonazepam comes in tablets of 0.5, 1, and 2 milligrams (mg). A typical adult dose to treat seizures may start at 1.5 mg a day, divided into three doses. Your doctor may gradually increase your dose to a maximum daily dose of 20 mg. A typical adult dose to treat panic disorder may start at 0.25 mg twice a day. After three days, your doctor may increase the dose to 1 mg a day. You’ll most likely take clonazepam one to three times a day at about the same time.
