By Don R. Hastings. There were many times in the life of Abraham when his faith was put to the test. However, these trials were relatively easy when compared with the severity and difficulty of this supreme test of Abraham's great faith. I am amazed .and astonished at the degree of faith which Abraham possessed in God.
The Testing of Abraham's Faith. God appears to Abraham for the purpose of testing him. The Lord God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac on a mountain that God would later show him.
This incident where God asked Abraham to sacrifice his own son was the supreme test of Abraham’s faith. This offering took place on one of the mountains in the land of Moriah, where Jerusalem was later built.
The Test of Abraham's Faith. Genesis 22:1-14. This story of God testing Abraham’s faith is one of the clearest types of the crucifixion that appears in the Old Testament. There is indeed no type or pattern giving a clearer picture of the death of God’s only, unique, and well-loved Son.
God tests our faith to prove it, that we may see what kind of faith we have. God used three special tests to test Abraham's and He uses the same tests for us today. There is the test of circumstances, the test of people, and the test of things. I. Test of Circumstances.
The Supreme Test of Faith. Abraham was willing even to sacrifice his own son in obedience to God. Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I shall show you. (NRSV, Genesis 22:2). Abraham did not hesitate.
