The demographic shifts since then have been dramatic. Between 1990 and 2010, Philadelphia’s Latino population increased by 110 percent, while the African American population increased just 3.3 percent. While African Americans still make up 44 percent of the city’s population, Latinos now comprise nearly 13 percent. Forty-six percent of African American males and 51 percent of Latino males drop out of Philadelphia public high schools each year. Thirty-four percent of African Americans and 42 percent of Latinos live in poverty in Philadelphia.

Gallup Poll results from March 26-28, however, show that slightly less than one in 10 Americans can accurately identify that the population of either blacks or Hispanics in this country falls between 10% and 14%. Americans earning less than $20,000 estimate the black percentage of the U.S. population to be 42%, and the Hispanic percentage to comprise 37%. At the other end of the spectrum, adults earning at least $75,000 and adults with a college degree or postgraduate education are least likely to overestimate these populations

In the 2010 United States Census, 50.5 million Americans (16.3% of the total population) listed themselves as ethnically Hispanic or Latino. For example, Mexico's white population is 9% or about 17% only, while Mexico is majoritarily mestizo, meaning that have European descent and Native American descent at an extent while 52.8% of Mexican Americans are White, or identify themselves as white in the Census (See the table).
