The yellow colour of iron(III) in solution is due to species such as [Fe(III)(H2O)5OH]2+, which absorb strongly in the blue-near UV through charge transfer transitions, in which an electron is transferred from a coordinated anion to the reducible central ion. Iron(II) ion = green. Iron(III) ion = yellow. Rust (Iron oxide + water)= black or brown. Explain why the rust of iron is not green or yellow, but black or brown. Add your answer. Source.
Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Iron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, blackstrap molasses, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in molasses, teff, and farina
Pure iron is metallic in color, it absorbs visible light only very weakly due to d-d transitions which are forbidden by quantum mechanical selection rules for electronic trans … itions. 1  A List of Foods That Have High Concentrations of Iron Iron deficiency is one of the most common of the human nutritional deficiencies. When you get a set of Ping irons custom fit, the use your height and where on the sole the club strikes the ground to give you a colour code. This colour is usually a little d … ot on the club. For example, black is standard, blue is 0.75 degrees upright, and gold is 4 degrees flat.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Iron (II) salts are usually very pale green in aqueous solution and Iron (III) salts are yellow in aqueous solution. These colours are caused by the absorption and emission of light at different wavelengths (colours) by the complex ions [Fe.6H2O]2+ and [Fe.6H2O]3+. Source(s): Chemistry teacher for 35 years.
The strong colours of iron oxides are due to charge transfer, including in some cases, such as magnetite, charge transfer between iron(II) and iron(III) in slightly different environments. Intervalence charge transfer of this kind is also responsible for the extremely deep colour of Prussian Blue. Iron(II) ion = green. Iron(III) ion = yellow. Rust (Iron oxide + water)= black or brown. Explain why the rust of iron is not green or yellow, but black or brown. Add your answer. Source.

Best Answer: Actually, the iron(III) ion, [Fe(H2O)6]3+, is an extremely pale purplish colour, as you will see if you grow a crystal of iron ammonium alum, NH4Fe(SO4)2.12H2O.This is because the ion is high spin d5, meaning that d-d transitions are spin-forbidden, and therefore even weaker than usual. Iron(II) ion = green. Iron(III) ion = yellow. Rust (Iron oxide + water)= black or brown. Explain why the rust of iron is not green or yellow, but black or brown. Add your answer. Source.
