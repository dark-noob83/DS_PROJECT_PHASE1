Description. In this clip the structure and function of a ciliated epithelial cell is described. Cilia are tiny hair like structures on the surface of the cell. The hairs sweep hair, mucus, trapped dust and bacteria up to the back of the throat where it can be swallowed.

Top 10 facts about the world. Ciliated cells are cells that are covered in tiny hair-like projections known as cilia. There tend to be two main types of this cell, namely motile and non-motile, sometimes also known as “primary.” In most cases this distinction has to do with how the cell uses its cilia.
A ciliated epithelial cell is a cell that you have inside your body mainly your throat and it has tiny little hairs that act like a brush. Those hairs brush away any diseases … or infections. 10 people found this useful. JD Heyl.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The ciliated cells has tiny hairs on it, called cilia, which sweep mucus, which is produced by goblet cells, up the airway. The mucus traps dirt particles and stop them from entering the lungs and causing infection. The ciliated cell therefore sweeps mucus up the airway where it is either swallowed or coughed out.
The lumen of the trachea is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Note that all the surface cells have cilia at their free (apical) surface. (What function do these cilia serve in the trachea?) Mucus-secreting unicellular gland cells (goblet cells) are interspersed among the ciliated cells.
Cilia are slender, microscopic, hair-like structures or organelles that extend from the surface of nearly all mammalian cells (multiple or single).
