Crunching the Numbers. On average, a woman needs 2,000 calories per day, while men need 2,500 calories. Removing 300 calories for snacks -- a rough estimate -- you're left with about 1,700 meal calories for females, and 2,200 meal calories for males. Dividing those numbers by three, the average woman should eat about 565 calories per meal, while the average man should eat about 735 calories per meal. If you eat more snacks, have smaller meals, and vice versa. These numbers work for weight maintenance; if you eat more calories than you burn, you'll gain weight.
