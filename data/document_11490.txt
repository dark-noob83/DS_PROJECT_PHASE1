Aerobic respiration occurs in plants as well as animals. Oxygen enters plant cells through the stomata. Plants produce their food via photosynthesis and release energy from it through the process of respiration. Below is a reminder of what the equation for photosynthesis is: (Energy via sunlight). Carbon dioxide + Water Glucose + Oxygen. Comparing the two equations we can see that aerobic respiration works in the opposite way to photosynthesis.
The chemical equation for respiration is: C6H12O6 + 6O2 6CO2 + 6H2O Glucose + Oxygen Carbon Dioxide + Water. Splits the 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvic acid molecules and 2 ATP molecules. This process is anaerobic, not requiring the presence of molecular oxygen. The chemical equation for respiration is: C6H12O6 + 6O2 6CO2 + 6H2O Glucose + Oxygen Carbon Dioxide + Water The key points: Glucose stores the sun's energy in chemical form.
1) Aerobic respiration is respiration which uses oxygen: glucose + oxygen = water + carbon dioxide + ENERGY C6H12O6 + 6O2 = 6H2O + 6CO2 + ENERGY Aerobic respiration is the same in animals and plants. 2) Anaerobic respiration is respiration without using oxygen. This is different in plants and animals. In plants: glucose = carbon dioxide + ethanol (alcohol) + ENERGY C6H12O6 = 2CO2 + 2C2H5OH + ENERGY In animals: glucose = lactic acid + ENERGY C6H12O6 = 2C3H6O3 + ENERGY.
There are two kinds of respiration, so there are two different equations. 1) Aerobic respiration is respiration which uses oxygen: glucose + oxygen = water + carbon dioxide + ENERGY C6H12O6 + 6O2 = 6H2O + 6CO2 + ENERGY Aerobic respiration is the same in animals and plants. 2) Anaerobic respiration is respiration without using oxygen. This is different in plants and animals. The chemical formula for photosynthesis (the process in which a plant creates its own food) is 6CO2+6H2O=C6H12O6+6O2, which is six molecules of carbon dioxide plus six molecul … es of water produce one molecule of glucose (sugar) and six molecules of oxygen gas.
The equation for the process of anaerobic respiration is: Glucose -------------a à Lactic + Acid. Energy the equation clearly shows that the glucose is broken down without any use of oxygen to release energy and produce lactic acid as a-by product instead of carbon dioxide and. water Aerobic Respiration Equation. Respiration is the process through which the cells of our body produce the energy that is required for performing many important tasks. Each cell of our body utilizes the food we eat by respiration to break down the glucose present in the food into usable energy.
Glucose (a sugar): Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis, and is described by the equation: Simply stated, this equation means that oxygen combines with sugars to break molecular bonds, releasing the energy (in the form of ATP) contained in those bonds.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water (+ energy). Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this. 
Photosynthesis. The net process of photosynthesis is described by the following equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2. This equation simply means that carbon dioxide from the air and water combine in the presence of sunlight to form sugars; oxygen is released as a by-product of this reaction. Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis, and is described by the equation: Simply stated, this equation means that oxygen combines with sugars to break molecular bonds, releasing the energy (in the form of ATP) contained in those bonds.
Carbon dioxide + Water + (Energy as Sunlight) ------------a à + Glucose. Oxygen it is clear from this equation that the plants cells follow a total opposite road when producing their food through the process of photosynthesis than is taken by them during aerobic. respiration Aerobic Respiration Equation. Respiration is the process through which the cells of our body produce the energy that is required for performing many important tasks. Each cell of our body utilizes the food we eat by respiration to break down the glucose present in the food into usable energy.
When we examine the equation for cellular respiration, we see that the reactants are glucose and oxygen (for aerobic respiration), and the products are carbon dioxide, water, and ATP. Note the number of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water molecules involved in each 'turn' of the process.
