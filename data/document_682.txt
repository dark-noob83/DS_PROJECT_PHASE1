Education Requirements for Anesthesiologists. The road to becoming a board-certified anesthesiologist is long, requiring a minimum of 12 years of postsecondary education. Aspiring anesthesiologists must first become fully qualified physicians and then complete rigorous residency requirements. At this stage in their training, many anesthesiologists go on to complete an additional year of study in a subspecialty. This training, called a fellowship, is within a subset of anesthesiology that may be of particular interest, such as pediatric, obstetric, cardiac, neurologic or critical care.
