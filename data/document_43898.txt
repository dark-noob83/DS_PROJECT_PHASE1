1 Depending on the type of care that is necessary, the costs of hospice care can widely vary anywhere from $140 to as much as $1,000 per day.
Subsequent analysis may lead to changes in the specific results, and some of the differences may be due to confounding variables that cannot be adjusted for. According to these data, hospital based (HB) hospice costs per day are 44 per cent higher than home care (HC) hospice costs per day ($95 versus $66, respectively). In addition, per patient hospice costs are 24 per cent more for patients enrolled in HB than in HC hospices ($5,890 versus $4,758
