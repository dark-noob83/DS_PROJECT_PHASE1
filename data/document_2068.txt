Narcissism is a serious diagnosed disorder, the symptoms and signs of which do not include hypersensitivity. In fact, a true narcissist is very much the opposite; cold, unfeeling toward others and extremely self assured. The narcissist I was, and still am involved with to a lesser degree, is super hypersensitive and super cold. I'm not sure if the hypersensitivity is a charade or what. 
Abstract: A new measure of hypersensitive narcissism was derived by correlating the items of H. A. Murray's (1938) Narcissism Scale with an MMPI-based composite measure of covert narcissism. In three samples of college students (total N = 303), 10 items formed a reliable measure: the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS). 
The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) is a measure of hypersensitive narcissism derived by correlating the items of H. A. Murray's (1938) Narcism Scale with an MMPI-based composite measure of covert narcissism.

In three samples of college students (total N = 303), 10 items formed a reliable measure: the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS). These 10 items formed a reliable scale which we named the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS; alpha = .72 for Sample 1 of 109 college women, M = 28.7, SD = 6.2; alpha = .75 for Sample 2 of 151 college women, M = 29.7, SD = 6.1; alpha = .62 for Sample 3 of 143 college men, M = 29.3 SD = 4.7).

Hypersensitivity most closelyresembles vulnerable narcissism and is the most clearly pathological(Pincus & Lukowitsky, 2010). Hypersensitive individuals are charac-terized by grandiosity and entitlement, but these attributes aremasked by inhibition, defensiveness, and a lack of self-conÔ¨Ådence(Wink, 1992b). 
Download. A new measure of hypersensitive narcissism was derived by correlating the items of H. A. Murray's (1938) Narcism Scale with an MMPI-based composite measure of covert narcissism. In three samples of college students (totalN= 403), 10 items formed a reliable measure: the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS). Results support P. Wink's (1991) distinction between covert and overt narcissistic tendencies in the normal range of individual differences and suggest that it would be beneficial for personality researchers to measure both types of narcissism in future studies.
