Coconut milk yogurt is very easy to make (almost as easy as coconut milk kefir, but perhaps not quite so forgiving). Empty a can of full-fat Coconut Milk (or equivalent volume of homemade coconut milk) into a 1 pint mason jar. Heat to 115F (that is exactly 1 minute with my microwave).
I use the entire can of coconut milk – water and all – because I don’t mind if my yogurt is a little thin. One might even call it “runny”. By the way, the amount of yogurt you get from this recipe is equal to the amount of coconut milk you use. So if you use an entire 13.5-ounce can, you’ll get the whole 13.5 ounces, or about 1¾ cups. Step 2: Combine Ingredients.
1 ). Use the full fat variety of coconut milk that comes in a can. 2  If you use the low or no fat variety, your yogurt will separate and get all weird and watery. 3  You could fix that by adding a thickening agent, but I'm not one to complicate things.
So, I did some experimenting. Coconut milk yogurt is very easy to make (almost as easy as coconut milk kefir, but perhaps not quite so forgiving). Empty a can of full-fat Coconut Milk (or equivalent volume of homemade coconut milk) into a 1 pint mason jar. Heat to 115F (that is exactly 1 minute with my microwave).
This coconut milk yogurt should really be called “cheater’s” coconut milk yogurt,” or something like that. You see, homemade yogurt is supposed to involve fermentation, or kefir grains, or a yogurt maker, or any number of proper and time-honored yogurt-making techniques. I used none of the above.
You can also make a fairly thick yogurt without using any thickener at all. Instead of using the whole can of coconut milk, just use the extra-thick creamy layer that rises to the top. To do this, refrigerate the can of coconut milk overnight, open up the can, and scoop the layer of thick white cream off the top.
