The denominator of this equation is the contribution margin. Imagine a company where fixed costs are $60,000, the price of the product is $2.00 per unit and variable costs are 80 cents per unit. Here is an example: Breakeven point = $60,000/$2.00 - $0.80 = 50,000 units. The contribution margin in this case is $1.20 per unit. 
The contribution margin, sometimes used as a ratio, is the difference between a company's total sales revenue and variable costs. In other words, the contribution margin equals the amount that sales exceed variable costs. This is the sales amount that can be used to, or contributed to, pay off fixed costs. The contribution margin ratio takes the concept of the contribution margin per unit produced and calculates it as a percentage of the sales price per unit.
For example, if you have variable costs of $10,000 to produce 1,000 units, then the variable cost per unit is $10. Step 2. Calculate the contribution margin per unit of each product by subtracting the variable costs per unit from the unit-selling price -- that is the price you sell a single unit for. For instance, with a variable cost per unit of $10 and a unit-selling price of $20, the contribution margin per unit would be $10. Step 3. Calculate your market share in volume by dividing the number of units that you produce for the market by the number of units produced in the overall market.
As an example of contribution per unit, ABC International has generated $20,000 of revenues in the most recent accounting period from sales of its purple widget. There are $14,000 of variable costs associated with these revenues, which means that the overall contribution margin for the purple widget was $6,000. Since ABC sold 500 purple widgets, the contribution per unit was $12 (calculated as $6,000 contribution margin / 500 units sold). 
Product Revenue-Product Variable Costs Product Revenue. The phrase contribution margin can also refer to a per unit measure of a product's gross operating margin, calculated simply as the product's price minus its total variable costs. 
Therefore, total variable costs per unit are 50+10+15 = $75. Contribution margin per unit is 100 - 75 or 25. if we sell 20 units of product, total revenues are $2,000 [20 * 100] and total variable costs are 75 * 20 or $1,500. total contribution margin is 2,000 - 1,500 or $500. Contribution margin [CM] is defined as the difference between revenues and variable costs. CM can be calculated on a total or per unit basis. Assume we have a selling price of $100/unit and per-unit variable costs of $50 for labor, $10 for supplies, and $15 for sales commissions.
Theoretical basis [edit]. Contribution margin per unit is the difference between the price of a product and the sum of the variable costs of one unit of that product.
