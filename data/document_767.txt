All that said, an excellent credit score is generally one that will allow you to qualify for most any loan or credit card with the lowest interest rate. Obviously having an excellent credit score can save you a ton of money on everything from your car insurance to your auto lease to your mortgage. Over the years, the savings could enter the five to six-digit range. Seriously.
When you apply for a credit card or mortgage, thereâ€™s a good chance the creditor is basing the decision on your FICO scores (you have three, one each from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion). If you want to know how good (or bad) your score is, what you really should be doing is basing that decision on your FICO scores.
