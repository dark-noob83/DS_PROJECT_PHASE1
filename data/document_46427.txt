The stretch reflex is caused by a stretch in the muscle spindle. When the stretch impulse is received a rapid sequence of events follows. The motor neuron is activated and the stretched muscles, and its supporting muscles, are contracted while its antagonist muscles are inhibited.
The reflex is initiated by special muscle receptors called muscle spindles, which are sensitive to stretch. Muscle spindles are composed of 8-10 modified muscle fibers called intrafusal fibers arranged in parallel with the ordinary (extrafusal) fibers that make up the bulk of the muscle.
The stretch reflex; which is also often called the myotatic reflex, knee-jerk reflex, or deep tendon reflex, is a pre-programmed response by the body to a stretch stimulus in the muscle.
The Stretch Reflex : (See Figure 13.15). The stretch reflex in its simplest form involves only 2 neurons, and is therefore sometimes called a 2-neuron reflex. The two neurons are a sensory and a motor neuron. The sensory neuron is stimulated by stretch (extension) of a muscle. Stretch of a muscle normally happens when its antagonist contracts, or artificially when its tendon is stretched, as in the knee jerk reflex. Muscles contain receptors called muscle spindles. (See Figure 13.13) These receptors respond to the muscles's stretch.
Also called stretch receptors. y. y The purpose of muscle spindles stretch reflex is to help maintain muscle tone and to protect your body from injury caused by overstretching.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The receptor in the reflex arc of a stretch reflex are 'muscle spindles' which are spindle shaped receptors distributed throughout the belly of the muscle.
