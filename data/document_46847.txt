LH. The hormone LH causes the mature egg to be released from the ovary. This image shows how the level of oestrogen changes during the menstrual cycle. Progesterone is another hormone secreted by ovaries: it maintains the lining of the uterus and stays high during pregnancy.
FSH/LH's role in females; FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) stimulates the follicle to secrete the hormone oestrogen. It also helps toward regulating the menstrual cycle. LH also plays an important role in the menstrual cycle. During this cycle, LH (Luteinizing Hormone) levels rise. This causes the egg in the ovary to complete Meiosis I. About two weeks later, LH levels surge; this sudden rise in LH triggers ovulation.
1 In women, LH helps regulate the menstrual cycle and egg production (ovulation). 2  The level of LH in a woman's body varies with the phase of the menstrual cycle. 3  It increases rapidly just before ovulation occurs, about midway through the cycle (day 14 of a 28-day cycle).
A luteinizing hormone test measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in a sample of blood or urine. LH is produced by the pituitary gland. 1  In women, LH helps regulate the menstrual cycle and egg production (ovulation). 2  The level of LH in a woman's body varies with the phase of the menstrual cycle. 3  It increases rapidly just before ovulation occurs, about midway through the cycle (day 14 of a 28-day cycle).
