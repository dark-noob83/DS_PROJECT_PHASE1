Cooking time depends on the size of the roast and the cut of meat. Also pay attention to the meat thermometer to ensure the beef is medium rare. For a standing rib roast or a top sirloin, the meat needs to cook for 20 to 22 minutes per pound. For a top round roast, the meat needs to cook for 30 to 33 minutes per pound. Place roast beef on a shallow roasting pan, fat side up, in the oven. Do not cover or add liquid. Insert a meat thermometer into the middle of the roast so it touches solid muscle and not fat or gristle. Estimate how long the beef needs to cook.

How long and at what temperature should I cook a beef roast in the oven? Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast. Sirloin-tip, rump, rolled-rump, eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice. Cooking at a constant oven temperature of 300°F (160°C), a 5- to 8-lb standing rib roast will take 17-19 minutes per pound for rare, 20-22 for medium rare, 23-25 minutes for medium, and 27-30 minutes for well done.
1 Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 2  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 3  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time
1 Cook the roast for about 10 to 15 minutes and then turn it over in the pan. 2  Continue to cook it for another 10 to 15 minutes for every pound. 3  Remove the tenderloin from the oven when the internal temperature of the meat reaches 140°F, as indicated on a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the roast. Place the beef on a rack in a shallow roasting pan with the fat side up. Do not cover the roast and do not add any liquid (liquid is used for braising, not roasting). Allow the beef to roast at 450°F for 45 minutes and then begin checking the internal temperature of the meat with a meat thermometer.

Drizzle the beef with olive oil and season well with salt and pepper, rubbing it all over the meat. Place the beef on top of the vegetables. To cook your beef: Place the roasting tray in the preheated oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and cook for 1 hour for medium beef. If you prefer it medium-rare, take it out 5 to 10 minutes earlier. For well done, leave it in for another 10 to 15 minutes.
