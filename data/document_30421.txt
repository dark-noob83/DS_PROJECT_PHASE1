Alumni who graduated in 2012 and worked in the private sector had a median salary of $45,000 while 2013 graduates with student loans for law school carried an average debt of $150,360. The school's salary-to-debt ratio is 0.299.
The average starting salary for law school graduates declined from $72,000 in 2009 to $60,000 for 2011, according to a National Association for Law Placement study.
The average salary is a misleading figure. Salaries in the legal profession are bimodal. A small percentage of practitioners earn six figures and even as much as 160,000. A much, much larger percentage earn $45,000-$65,000 and a substantial percentage earn less than that.
The median starting salary for 2012 law graduates in the private sector from all of these schools was at least $100,000. Graduates of Clark Law School at Brigham Young University receive the largest median salary in relation to average law school debt, according to data submitted to U.S. News.
National Starting Salaries. Law school graduates working in the public sector earned less than their peers in the private sector. According to a 2011 article in U.S. News & World Report, the average starting salary earned by lawyers in the public sector was $49,831. The average starting pay of those in the private sector was $84,111, according to the National Association for Legal Career Professionals. About 7 percent of law school graduates worked part-time, while about 2 percent of the professionals worked for a legal temp agency, the association says.
