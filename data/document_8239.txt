How long to keep records. You must normally keep records for at least 6 years from the end of the last company financial year they relate to. You may need to keep records longer if: 1  they show a transaction that covers more than one of the company’s accounting periods. 2  the company has bought something that it expects to last more than 6 years, like equipment or machinery. 3  you sent your Company Tax Return late.
