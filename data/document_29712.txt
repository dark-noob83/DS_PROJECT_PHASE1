Body Cavities. Body cavities are areas in the body that contain our internal organs. The dorsal and ventral cavities are the two main cavities. The dorsal cavity is on the posterior (back side) of the body and contains the cranial cavity and spinal cavity. In human anatomy, dorsal, caudal and posterior mean the same thing. The ventral cavity is on the front (anterior) of the body and is divided into the thoracic cavity (chest) and abdominopelvic cavity.
In Human Anatomy and Physiology. The dorsal body cavity is a space within the body, located towards the dorsal/posterior surface of the body, that contains the brain   Contains the brain and spinal cord. â€¦ I think there are only 2 cavities that the dorsal cavitiy encompasses and those are the cranial cavity and the spinal cord. The human dorsal cavity consists of the cavities in the posterior of the torso and head, including the cranial cavity and the vertebral column. 1 person found this useful. Answered.
Body Cavaties. The cavities, or spaces, of the body contain the internal organs, or viscera. The two main cavities are called the ventral and dorsal cavities. The ventral is the larger cavity and is subdivided into two parts (thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities) by the diaphragm, a dome-shaped respiratory muscle.
