INTRODUCTION: Gamma-Amino Butyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid which acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It inhibits nerve transmission in the brain, calming nervous activity. As a supplement it is sold and promoted for these neurotransmitter effects as a natural tranquilizer. GABA'S ROLE IN THE BRAIN. GABA is made in brain cells from glutamate, and functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter meaning that it blocks nerve impulses. Glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter and when bound to adjacent cells encourages them to fire and send a nerve impulse.
Although in chemical terms it is an amino acid, GABA is rarely referred to as such in the scientific or medical communities, because the term amino acid, used without a qualifier, by convention refers to the alpha amino acids, which GABA is not, nor is it considered to be incorporated into proteins. Contents. Gabaergic neurons which produce GABA. Exogenous GABA does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier; it is synthesized in the brain. It is synthesized from glutamate using the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and pyridoxal phosphate (which is the active form of vitamin B6) as a cofactor.
GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) supplements have been known to treat these issues along with many others that prevent people from following through with their everyday routines. GABA is a natural source of energy that is given off in your brain through specific neurotransmitters. GABA supplements have been proven to reduce these issues to some extent. Although GABA supplements do not provide the same kind of direct attention to the body's nervous system as the natural chemical does, they do work with the body's peripheral nervous system in order to slow down actions in order to remain calm.

GABA is a neurotransmitter that blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain. Low levels of GABA may be linked to: 1  Anxiety or mood disorders. 2  Epilepsy. 3  Chronic pain. Side effects. There has not been enough research to uncover the side effects of GABA supplements. Risks. Overall, there isn't enough information to be sure about the safety of GABA. For this reason, it's best to play it safe and not use GABA if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
GABA or gamma-aminobutyric acid, discovered in 1950, is the most important and widespread inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Excitation in the brain must be balanced with inhibition. Too much excitation can lead to restlessness, irritability, insomnia, and even seizures. 
Popularly referred to as the body's natural tranquilizer, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an amino acid produced in the brain. Dosage Information. Special tips: --GABA is usually found in the amino acid section of the supplement aisle.--For those who don't like swallowing tablets, capsules can be opened and added to juice or water, as can powders. A tablet, which is placed under the tongue until it slowly dissolves, is also available.
GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) is a non-essential amino acid found mainly in the human brain and eyes. It is considered an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which means it regulates brain and nerve cell activity by inhibiting the number of neurons firing in the brain. 
GABA (Gamma Aminobutyric Acid) is a natural occurring brain chemical or neurotransmitter that sends signals from your nerve cell to a specific target cell. The main role of GABA is to have a calming effect on you and your nervous system.
