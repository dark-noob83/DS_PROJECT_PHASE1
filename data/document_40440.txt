The Valyrian languages are a fictional language family in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, and in their television adaptation Game of Thrones.
Westeros Edit. Only two major languages are used in significant numbers in Westeros: the  Old Tongue , and the  Common Tongue  of the Andals which has almost entirely replaced it. The original humans that migrated to Westeros some 12,000 years ago, the First Men, spoke their own language now called the Old Tongue.
To create the Dothraki and Valyrian languages to be spoken in Game of Thrones, HBO selected the linguist David J. Peterson through a competition among conlangers.
Home. Welcome to Dothraki.org/Valyrian.org! We are an unofficial fan-site for the Dothraki and Valyrian (and perhaps more to come) languages, used in HBOâ€™s Game of Thrones series, and derived from words used in the original A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R.R. Martin.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The Dothraki language is a constructed fictional language in George R. R. Martin 's fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire and its television adaptation Game of Thrones, where it is spoken by the Dothraki, the indigenous inhabitants of the Dothraki Sea.
However for the release of HBO 's Game of Thrones, a actual spoken Dothraki language has been developed. This language takes cues from George R. R. Martin 's few bits of published words, and expands greatly upon it. A website, dothraki.org, has been created to help teach and spread the constructed tongue.
