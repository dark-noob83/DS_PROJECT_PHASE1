In green plants starch is produced by photosynthesis; it is one of the chief forms in which plants store food. It is stored most abundantly in tubers (e.g., the white potato), roots (e.g., the sweet potato), seeds, and fruits; it appears in the form of grains that differ in size, shape, and markings in various plants. The plant source can usually be identified by microscopic examination of the starch grains. Starch is important because we eat it! Starch is found in potatoes, and in grains such as corn and wheat. Starch is made up of glucose repeat units. In your body, special proteins called enzymes (which are also polymers, by the way) break starch down into glucose, so your body can burn it for energy.
There are 3 parts to a wheat kernel (sometimes called a wheat berry): 1) The BRAN is the hard outer covering of the wheat kernel, high in fiber & nutrients. 2) The GERM is the nutrient-rich embryo that will sprout and grow into a new wheat plant. 3) The ENDOSPERM is the biggest part (83%), the insides of the kernel-mostly starch. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. 
1. Cereals store energy in the form of starch in the endosperm which generally consists of the d-glucose (d-Glc) homopolymers, amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is essentially a linear polymer composed of 1,4-linked α- d-glucan chains. Summary of the starch biosynthesis processes in rice endosperm. Starch biosynthesis consists of two distinct phases: the glucan initiation process and the starch amplification process. (A) Pho1 extends the chains of the initial priming sites such as free chains of malto-oligosaccharides in the presence of Glc-1-P.
Ancestral flowering plants have seeds that have small embryos and abundant endosperm, and the evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with mature seeds with little or no endosperm. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut meat and coconut water, and corn. Some plants, like the orchid, lack endosperm in their seeds.
For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut meat and coconut water, and corn. Some plants, like the orchid, lack endosperm in their seeds.
Endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants around the time of fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in human diet. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut meat and coconut water, and corn. Some plants, like the orchid, lack endosperm in their seeds.

It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. Nutritive tissue in the seeds of most flowering plants. It surrounds the embryo and is produced by an unusual process that parallels the fertilization of the ovum by a male gamete. A second male gamete from the pollen grain fuses with two female nuclei within the embryo sac.
It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. Endosperm is formed when the two sperm inside a pollen grain reach the interior of an embryo sac or female gametophyte. One sperm fertilizes the egg, forming a zygote, while the other sperm usually fuses with the two female nuclei at the center of the ovary, creating endosperm (double fertilization). Nutritive tissue in the seeds of most flowering plants. It surrounds the embryo and is produced by an unusual process that parallels the fertilization of the ovum by a male gamete. A second male gamete from the pollen grain fuses with two female nuclei within the embryo sac.
