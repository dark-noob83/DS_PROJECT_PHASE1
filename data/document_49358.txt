Definition of the Smooth ER. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or smooth ER, is an organelle found in both animal cells and plant cells. An organelle is a sub-unit within a cell that has a specialized function. The main function of the smooth ER is to make cellular products like hormones and lipids.
Two types of Endoplasmic Reticuli exists, the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the synthesis of … proteins -{from through}- VIA the ribosomes embedded within its structure.
The endoplasmic reticulum is composed of sac-like structures called cisternae that are folded and bound together by a cytoskeleton. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: smooth endoplasmic reticulum and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum gets its name from its smooth folded surface.
It can be defined as a eukaryotic organelle, which forms a network of tubules, vesicles and cisternae within the cells. There are two regions of the Endoplasmic reticulum, which differ in both structure and function.
Ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum are called ‘membrane bound’ and are responsible for the assembly of many proteins. This process is called translation. Certain cells of the pancreas and digestive tract produce a high volume of protein as enzymes.

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the synthesis of lipids and steroids.
The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of tubules and flattened sacs that serve a variety of functions in the cell. There are two regions of the ER that differ in both structure and function. One region is called rough ER because it has ribosomes attached to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.
