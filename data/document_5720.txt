Food contamination is when something makes the food inedible or can cause illness when consumed. Contamination can be   # Biological (bacteria, parasites, viruses, etc.) …  # Chemical (cleaners, sanitizers, additives, etc.)  # Physical (glass, metal, etc.)   Contamination is not necessarily obvious or visible. Food cross contamination is basically food poisoning. If you cooked 2 different raw things together, your mixing 2 nasty raw things together and cross contaminate. Get it, contamination as like when you mix 2 different things together and cross as in 2 or more things.
Environmental contaminants are chemicals that are present in the environment in which the food is grown, harvested, transported, stored, packaged, processed, and consumed. The physical contact of the food with its environment results in its contamination. Possible sources of contamination include: Also, food contaminant testing assures consumers safety and quality of purchased food products and can prevent foodborne diseases, and chemical, microbiological, or physical food hazards.
Food contamination refers to the presence in food of harmful chemicals and microorganisms which can cause consumer illness. Also, food contaminant testing assures consumers safety and quality of purchased food products and can prevent foodborne diseases, and chemical, microbiological, or physical food hazards.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Biological contamination occurs when foods containing naturally occurring substances that are poisonous to humans are ingested; such solanine in green potatoes, oxalic acid in the leaves of rhubarb and some type of mushrooms. Food cross contamination is basically food poisoning. If you cooked 2 different raw things together, your mixing 2 nasty raw things together and cross contaminate. Get it, contamination as like when you mix 2 different things together and cross as in 2 or more things.
An important method for reducing the risk of microbial contamination is the HACCP approach. HACCP is a systematic approach to the identification and control of the biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with a particular food production process. Domestically, we are expanding inspections of establishments that produce food that is at high risk of microbiological contamination or high risk of causing severe disease. High-risk foods include infant formula, ready-to-eat foods, heat-and-serve products, seafood, low-acid canned foods and acidified foods.

Syllabus. Biology is the science of studying living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals and non-living being such as viruses. Biological contaminants of food are harmful and hazardous substances of biological origin in the food that can cause foodborne illness when they are consumed. - Food linked with this bacteria are food that are contaminated by hands such as salads containing TCS food (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken) and food that has been in contact with contaminated water, such as produce.
Hazard: A biological, chemical or physical agent in food, or a condition of a food, that may cause an adverse health effect. (Danger). Hazard analysis: The process of collecting and evaluating information on hazards and conditions leading to their presence, to decide which ones are significant for food safety. 
Food processing may also be a source of cross-contamination, such as contamination of nonallergenic foods with known food allergens. Migrants from Packaging Materials. Direct contact of foods with packaging materials can result in chemical contamination caused by migration of certain substances into foods. Examples of other processing contaminants include PAHs (in grilled and smoked products), ethyl carbamate (in yeast-fermented alcoholic beverages and other products) or furan (in a variety of heat-treated foods, especially coffee and canned/jarred food).
