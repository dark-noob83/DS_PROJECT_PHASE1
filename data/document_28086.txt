Silverfish are described as small, wingless insects that are scaly and silver or light grey in color. Silverfish earned its name by its fish-like appearance and quick, wiggling movements. They have 6 legs, a long antennae at the front and 3 smaller appendages at the rear.
Silverfish are harmless, but these grayish-blue, serpentine creatures aren't pleasant to have around the house. They feed on books, dead skin cells, and other starchy materials and thrive in dark, wet spaces.
Appearance: White to brown-grey or bluish-silver in color, silverfish are teardrop-shaped insects that measure up to12-19 mm in length. Three long bristles on rear. Grow from egg to adult without visible change in appearance.
Behavior, Diet & Habits. Capable of thriving in most climates, silverfish prefer to dwell in dark, damp areas such as basements, attics, kitchens and bathrooms. They are especially attracted to paper and damp clothing. Commonly found in stored boxes in garages and sheds. Silverfish feed on carbohydrates, particularly sugars and starches.
Silverfish can lay eggs at any season of the year and grow from larva to adult in 3-4 months. Silverfish feed on mold, fungi and carbohydrates (such as sugars, starch or cellulose). This means that your food (especially dry foods), clothes, shampoos, soaps, books, wallpaper, plants and many other things are in danger.
Silverfish bugs are found throughout the world including parts of North America, Australia, Asia and Europe. They are also found on a number of Pacific islands. They are mostly limited to areas with quite a bit of moisture, as they require humidity upwards of 75%.
