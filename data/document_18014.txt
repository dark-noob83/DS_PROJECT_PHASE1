Long Walks: The key to getting ready to finish a half marathon is the long walk, progressively increasing in distance each weekend. Over a period of 12 weeks, your longest walk will increase from 3 to 10 miles. Don't worry about making the final jump from 10 miles in practice to 13.1 miles in the race.
On average though, a mile can be walked in about 15-20 minutes. Therefore walking a half-marathon will take an average of 3-4 hours depending on how fast you are walking per mile. This of course will depend on where you live and what your preferences are.
If you run a little, figure anywhere between 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours for a beginner. … If you walk exclusively, expect 6 - 8 hours for a beginner. Note that you'd want to check the cut off times for races in big cities because they will usually open up the course for traffic in the 6 - 7 hour time frame.
MOST MAJOR HALF MARATHONS ARE FOR RUNNERS --but walkers can do them too. One advantage of a half marathon over a full marathon is that you won't need to spend as much time on the course. Most reasonably fit individuals should be able to walk 13.1 miles in around four hours. Doing so is fun.
It should take about four hours to walk a half marathon (13.1 miles).
RE: Is it possible to walk a half marathon (13.1miles) in 3.5hours? I'm taking part in the run to the beat half marathon and I'm just thinking if I walk a mile every 15 minutes then I would complete the course in 3 hours and 15 minutes! Doesn't sound too unreasonable does it walking a mile every 15minutes!
