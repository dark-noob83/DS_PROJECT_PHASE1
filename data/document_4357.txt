Requirements. Education. To obtain a job in a crime laboratory, aspiring forensic lab technicians should have a four-year bachelor’s degree, preferably in one of the life sciences, forensic science or criminal justice. Forensic lab technicians are not required to have a license or certification, but they do need to pass proficiency tests on occasion. They must stay well informed of advances in the field by attending conferences, seminars or additional training classes.
Many of those who seek to become forensic science technicians will have an undergraduate degree in the natural sciences and a master’s degree in forensic science. Many crime scene investigators are sworn police officers and have met educational requirements necessary for admittance into a police academy. Most forensic science technicians who perform laboratory analysis specialize in a specific type of evidence analysis, such as DNA or ballistics. Some forensic science technicians, called forensic computer examiners or digital forensics analysts, specialize in computer-based crimes.
What Forensic Science Technicians Do. Forensic science technicians help investigate crimes by collecting and analyzing physical evidence. Many technicians specialize in either crime scene investigation or laboratory analysis. Most forensic science technicians who perform laboratory analysis specialize in a specific type of evidence analysis, such as DNA or ballistics. Some forensic science technicians, called forensic computer examiners or digital forensics analysts, specialize in computer-based crimes.
Forensic lab technicians apply their knowledge and background in lab science to further the reach of the law. By using the latest laboratory techniques to analyze physical evidence from crime scenes, these professionals help to solve crimes and successfully prosecute criminal offenders. Forensic lab technicians are not required to have a license or certification, but they do need to pass proficiency tests on occasion. They must stay well informed of advances in the field by attending conferences, seminars or additional training classes.
Forensic science technicians typically need at least a bachelor’s degree in the natural sciences, such as chemistry or biology. Students who major in forensic science should ensure that their program includes extensive course work in mathematics, chemistry, and biology. Most forensic science technicians who perform laboratory analysis specialize in a specific type of evidence analysis, such as DNA or ballistics. Some forensic science technicians, called forensic computer examiners or digital forensics analysts, specialize in computer-based crimes.
A: In order to become a forensic scientist, you will need an education in forensic sciences. If you are just looking for an entry level in the criminal justice sector, you can go for a 6 month certificate or diploma. A 4 year bachelor's degree can also get you entry-level positions with forensic departments. A: A forensic scientist needs to have a proper education in their respective field. You first need a bachelor's degree in forensic sciences or any other related science topic like psychology, medicine etc. after the completion of the degree it is recommended by most employers that you have a graduate degree as well.
Instructions. Decide if you would like being a forensic scientist or science technician. You will need to take plenty of college-level math and science courses. Once you're hired you will need to be comfortable with looking at and handling bodies, tissues and body fluids. Of course a forensics laboratory would be best. It will give you experience and the opportunity to work with a professional forensic scientist. Don't be discouraged if you do not get a job in a forensics laboratory right away. Start in a general chemistry lab or something similar.
Forensic science technicians may either be generalists who perform all or many of the duties listed above, or they may specialize in certain techniques and sciences. Generalist forensic science technicians, sometimes called criminalists, perform the duties of crime scene investigators and laboratory analysts. Most forensic science technicians who perform laboratory analysis specialize in a specific type of evidence analysis, such as DNA or ballistics. Some forensic science technicians, called forensic computer examiners or digital forensics analysts, specialize in computer-based crimes.
Educational Requirements for Forensic Science Technicians. The basic requirement for most forensic science technician jobs is a bachelor's degree in forensic science or a natural science, such as chemistry, biology, molecular biology or physics. Forensic Science Technician Degrees and Certificate Programs. Aspiring forensic technicians can earn a bachelor's or master's degree, or a graduate certificate in forensic science.
