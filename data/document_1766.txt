Monthly production of the factory = 150 X 10 X 26 (working days) = 39000 pieces. So, Factory overhead per piece = (Factory overhead / Production quantity). = (2,268,000.00 / 39000) = INR 58.15. First, calculate labor cost of garment from garment SAM, line efficiency and labor daily wages. Suppose labor cost per garment is INR 30.00. Calculate overhead amount using overhead ratio and add overhead amount to labor cost and direct material cost to estimate garment manufacturing cost. I am using factory overhead ratio from the above table. When you are making garment for export orders you should know correct method of costing your product. For example, suppose monthly direct labor cost and factory overheads of a small factory are INR 1,042,000.00 and INR 2268,000.00 respectively. Factory overhead ratio = 2,268,000.00 / 1,042,000.00 = 2.18. An example of the overhead factor calculation sheet is shown in the following table.
Factory Overhead. Definition: Factory overhead is the costs incurred during the manufacturing process, not including the costs of direct labor and materials. Factory overhead is normally aggregated into cost pools and allocated to units produced during the perio
Given that the material cost per unit for the product is $35 per unit and the overhead allocation rate is $0.20 per material dollar, the overhead per unit is calculated as $0.20 per material dollar x $35 per unit = $7 per unit. Assume that for the entire production, the business conducted 10 tests, 15 setups and 20 cleaning jobs. Thus, the unit cost for each overhead activity is as follows: $5,000/10 tests = $500 per test, $3,000/15 setups = $200 per setup and $2,000/20 cleaning jobs = $100 per cleaning job.
The allocation base is the link that is used to attach overhead costs to the cost object. In a manufacturing setting, the simplest allocation base is the number of units produced. For example, if the factory makes 15,000 units, the accounting system can simply spread the overhead costs evenly over all 15,000 units. 
Factory overhead, also called manufacturing overhead or factory burden, is the total cost involved in operating all production facilities of a manufacturing business. It generally applies to indirect labor and indirect cost, it also includes all costs involved in manufacturing with the exception of the cost of raw materials and direct labor. Factory overhead also includes certain costs such as quality assurance costs, cleanup costs, and property insurance premiums.
That is, total overhead cost is highly correlated with the total amount of production material used. If total overhead cost is $10,000 and the dollar amount of production material used for all products is $50,000, calculate the overhead cost per material dollar as $10,000/$50,000 = $0.20 per material dollar. Step 2. Determine the amount of cost driver used in each unit of a product. Assume that for the entire production, the business conducted 10 tests, 15 setups and 20 cleaning jobs. Thus, the unit cost for each overhead activity is as follows: $5,000/10 tests = $500 per test, $3,000/15 setups = $200 per setup and $2,000/20 cleaning jobs = $100 per cleaning job.
SHARE SHARE TWEET EMAIL. Controlling manufacturing overhead is especially important for a small business. Also known as indirect costs or factory overhead, manufacturing overhead is everything of a support nature that is needed to help make the product. It is not the direct materials and direct labor required to make the actual product. 
Indirect cost is the cost to run a company, which is otherwise referred to manufacturing overhead or simply overhead. Manufacturing overhead covers all other cost not associated with direct material and labour cost. The overhead contributes around 30% to the total cost of the garment (Jeffrey and Evans, 2011). 18.3.2. Cost can be classified as direct or indirect, depending on their traceability. Direct cost is a cost that can be traced in relation to a produced product. The direct cost in the garment industry may be the direct cost of material (cost of fabric, cost of trims, etc.) and direct cost of labour.
Based on the unit cost for each overhead activity, the amount of overhead cost from each overhead activity assigned to the product is as follows: $500 per test x five tests = $2,500, $200 per setup x eight setups = $1,600 and $100 per cleaning x 10 cleaning = $1,000. Assume that for the entire production, the business conducted 10 tests, 15 setups and 20 cleaning jobs. Thus, the unit cost for each overhead activity is as follows: $5,000/10 tests = $500 per test, $3,000/15 setups = $200 per setup and $2,000/20 cleaning jobs = $100 per cleaning job.
