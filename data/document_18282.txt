The diminutive Sargent crabapple (Malus sargentii) is one of the most common slow-growing crabapples. This small variety produces fragrant flowers in the spring followed by tiny fruit only about 1/2 inch in diameter. It grows 6 to 10 feet tall and spreads between 6 and 12 feet, giving it a shrubby appearance. Another slow growing variety is the Coralburst crabapple (Malus coralcore).
Lancelot Flowering Crab will grow to be about 8 feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 8 feet. It has a low canopy with a typical clearance of 3 feet from the ground. It grows at a medium rate, and under ideal conditions can be expected to live for 50 years or more.
Medium Growth. Trees that grow between 13 and 24 inches per year are considered to have medium growth. A vast majority of crabapple trees fall into this category. Highlights of the medium-growth category include the Snowdrift crabapple (Malus Snowdrift), which is well-known for its abundant white flowers.
Crabapple trees that grow wider than tall are said to have a horizontal or spreading form. Strawberry Parfait (Malus Strawberry Parfait) can reach a mature height of 18 feet and a width of 20 feet. It blooms with large pink flowers and reddish leaves emerge in spring that later turn green.
Size. While the majority of crabapple trees will grow in the 15- to 25-foot-tall range some species are as small as 6 feet tall while others may grow 50 feet in height.
Coralburst Flowering Crab will grow to be about 12 feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 10 feet. It has a low canopy with a typical clearance of 4 feet from the ground, and is suitable for planting under power lines. It grows at a medium rate, and under ideal conditions can be expected to live for 50 years or more.
