Food. Milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich natural sources of calcium and are the major food contributors of this nutrient to people in the United States [ 1 ]. Nondairy sources include vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Spinach provides calcium, but its bioavailability is poor. Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is found in some foods, added to others, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some medicines (such as antacids).
Essential nutrients need to be provided by the diet for proper functioning. An essential nutrient is a nutrient that the body cannot synthesize on its own -- or not to an adequate amount -- and must be provided by the diet. These nutrients are necessary for the body to function properly. The six essential nutrients include carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals and water.
Dietary supplements may contain only calcium or calcium with other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the label on the Supplement Facts panel to determine the amount of calcium. Calcium absorption is best when taken in amounts of no more than 500 mg at a time. CALCIUM AND DAIRY PRODUCTS. Many foods contain calcium, but dairy products are the best source. Milk and dairy products such as yogurt, cheeses, and buttermilk contain a form of calcium that your body can absorb easily. Whole milk (4% fat) is recommended for children ages 1 to 2. Adults and children over the age of 2 should drink low-fat (2% or 1%) or skim milk and other dairy products
Relationship with Other Nutrients. Many foods that contain calcium also contain vitamin D. For example, two of our top calcium-containing WHFoods (sardines and cow's milk) also belong to our top vitamin D-containing WHFoods. 
Calcium dose and instructions for use. The Department of Health has set a reference nutrient intake (RNI) for calcium. Getting this amount from your diet, with or without supplements, may be enough to keep your bones healthy. Calcium is a mineral important for strong bones and teeth.

They are two categories of nutrients, macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients include: Carbohydrates, fats, protein Micronutrients include: vitamins and minerals â€¦ like iron and vitamin A. Vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables, are the most nutrient dense foods for calcium.
The body uses nutrients for growth, maintenance, and repair and needs to take in about 40 varieties to function properly. Nutrients can be grouped into six categories: carbohydrate, protein, lipid (fat), water, vitamins, and minerals (see table 8.1). 
Removing the fat will not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product. 1  Yogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk are excellent sources of calcium and come in low-fat or fat-free versions. 2  Milk is also a good source of phosphorus and magnesium, which help the body absorb and use calcium.

Experts advise adult consumers to consume adequate amounts of calcium, that is, 1,000mg or 100%DV in a daily 2,000 calorie diet. This advice is often given in milligrams (mg), but the Nutrition Facts label only lists a %DV for calcium. For certain populations, they advise that adolescents, especially girls, consume 1,300mg (130%DV) and post-menopausal women consume 1,200mg (120%DV) of calcium daily. The DV for calcium on food labels is 1,000mg. Note the * used after the heading %Daily Value on the Nutrition Facts label. It refers to the Footnote in the lower part of the nutrition label, which tells you  %DVs are based on a 2,000 calorie diet . This statement must be on all food labels.
