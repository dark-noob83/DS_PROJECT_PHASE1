Impressed by the presence of rabid, stage diving fans at No Doubt's concerts and Gwen's on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created Interscope Records in 1990.
No Doubt's self-titled debut album was finally released in 1992, but it featured no radio singles, although a video was made for Trapped in a Box. The album's distinctly upbeat pop/cartoon sound sharply contrasted with the then-dominant grunge movement.
No Doubt is an American rock band from Anaheim, California, that formed in 1986. Since 1994, the group has consisted of vocalist Gwen Stefani, bassist and keyboardist Tony Kanal, guitarist and keyboardist Tom Dumont, and drummer Adrian Young.
The Climb is track #6 on the album Tragic Kingdom. It was written by Eric Stefani.
