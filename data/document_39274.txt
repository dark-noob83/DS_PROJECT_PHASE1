How much does a gallon of unleaded gas weigh. One gallon of unleaded gas weighs around 6 pounds. Unleaded, fuel-grade gasoline has a specific gravity around 0.75 g/ml (grams per milliliter). report this answer. 
A gallon is 3.785 liters, and a liter of water weighs a kilogram. If gasoline has a density 0.739 compared to water s 1.000, then a gallon of gasoline weighs 0.739 times 3.785 kilograms, or about 2.8 kilograms. That changes a bit with temperature, pressure, and composition, but that number should be 2% accurate. And if gasoline costs $2.80 per gallon, it costs $1.00 per kilogram. BTW, pennies weigh 2.500 grams, $4 per kilogram, so a kilogram of pennies buys four kilograms of gasoline at the above price.
During the summer, diesel will weigh between 6.951 (API 38) and 7.076 (API 35) pounds per gallon. Last winter, the diesel weighed around 7.206 (API 32) pounds per gallon. Regular unleaded gasoline weighs around 6.184 (API 59) pounds per gallon and premium usually has an API of 56, or 6.263 lbs per gallon. An approximate weight is 8 pounds, based on the common adage: A pint's a pound the world around. So, since a gallon of liquid is 4 quarts or 8 pints, it's nearly 8 pounds. However water is a bit heavier, since water goes to the bottom, and diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene stay on top.
The specific gravity of gasoline is about 0.72. That is, it's about 72 percent the density of water. Since a gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds per gallon, we can easily calculate the density of gas as 6.00 pounds per gallon. By the way, I say about above because the density of gasoline varies with temperature. Don't measure, pour or heat gasoline!! Gasoline wegihs 6.08 pounds per gallon, diesel weighs an average of 7.1 pounds per gallon, water weighs 10.0 pounds per gallon. I Taransport gasoline daily and have been for the past 14 years. 5 people found this useful

Since a gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds per gallon, we can easily calculate the density of gas as 6.00 pounds per gallon. One gallon weighs from 5.8 to 6.5 pounds, depending on the temperature when yo … u weigh it. Water holds similar weight properties as gasoline, so you may wish to test this by weighing one gallon of hot water and one gallon of cold water and taking the average. Don't measure, pour or heat gasoline!! Gasoline wegihs 6.08 pounds per gallon, diesel weighs an average of 7.1 pounds per gallon, water weighs 10.0 pounds per gallon.

Water weighs about 8.3 pounds/gallon. Gasoline floats on water. Therefore, gasoline weighs less than 8.3 pounds/gallon. The two answers at 6.25 and 6 lbs/gal are the most likely correct ones. The answer that replied 8.66 cannot be right. The weight of gasoline is dependent on the temperature, as mentioned above, but it also depends on how much alcohol has been added. Today, that's sometimes a lot. So we come up with 1 gallon of water equals 8.33 lbs.
A gallon of water weighs 8 pounds. Gasoline is lighter. It weighs in the low 6 pound range depending on temperature. It weighs 6.25 pounds at 72F. Best Answer: 6.25 lbs/gallon Vehicle grade petroleum has a specific gravity of .71-.79 (for ease of math, use .75), so it weighs .75 kilograms/liter, do some conversions and you get 6.25 lbs/gallon.
