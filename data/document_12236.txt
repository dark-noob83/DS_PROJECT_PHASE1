… manufactured fibres are like materials made out of a natural fibre like acrylic which is made from wool...they are like 2nd hand things... hope this makes sense _______________________________________________________________ Natural Fibres come from plants, animals and minerals. These are made mainly out of the metal that gives the name of the fiber, but other metals or traces of something can be added to improve special qualities. Rockwool, Glass, Asbestos are among the mineral varieties. These are made from minerals. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral.
A bundle of optical fibers. Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic string used as a component of composite materials, or, when matted into sheets, used to make products such as paper, papyrus, or felt. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. 1 Vegetable fibers are generally based on arrangements of cellulose, often with lignin: examples include cotton, hemp, jute, flax, ramie, sisal, bagasse, and banana.
Natural fiber, or dietary fiber, is a type of carbohydrate that occurs naturally in food and cannot be digested by human enzymes. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans and legumes are good sources of dietary fiber. These foods contain intact forms of pectin, gums, cellulose and wheat and oat fiber. Fiber occurs naturally in plant foods and can also be isolated from plants to be added to foods to increase the fiber content. Consume both natural and manufactured fiber as part of a healthy diet.

Manufactured Fiber Uses. I n addition to the traditional consumer products, such as apparel, carpets, upholstered furniture, bedding and window treatments, manufactured fibers are used in many less obvious ways. Polyester. Polyester has a high strength-to-weight ratio, and is the most widely sold manufactured fiber. It is utilized in all types of clothing, home furnishings (bedspreads, sheets, pillows, curtains, furniture, and carpets), and as a reinforcing fiber in tires, belts, and hoses.
Synthetic fibers or fibres are the result of extensive research by scientists to improve on naturally occurring animal and plant fibers. In general, synthetic fibers are created by extruding fiber forming materials through spinnerets into air and water, forming a thread. Before synthetic fibers were developed, artificially manufactured fibers were made from polymers obtained from petro chemicals. These fibers are called synthetic or artificial fibers.
Manufactured fibers are now being produced with the feel, look, and drapability of the most expensive silk. Commonly known as microfiber, these are superfine polyester, nylon, acrylic, or rayon fibers. Its use is growing rapidly in the apparel industry, due to its luxurious feel, ease of care, strength, and comfort. Polyester. Polyester has a high strength-to-weight ratio, and is the most widely sold manufactured fiber. It is utilized in all types of clothing, home furnishings (bedspreads, sheets, pillows, curtains, furniture, and carpets), and as a reinforcing fiber in tires, belts, and hoses.
Manufactured Fiber. Manufactured, or functional fiber, is nondigestible fiber isolated from plant sources that imparts beneficial effects on your body, including laxation, when added to low-fiber foods, says the USDA. Fiber occurs naturally in plant foods and can also be isolated from plants to be added to foods to increase the fiber content. Consume both natural and manufactured fiber as part of a healthy diet.
Lyocell, the newest of the cellulosic manufactured fibers, is wrinkle-free, and washable. Its yarns have an especially soft and luxurious touch, and finds use in casual and upscale jeans, shirts, and other garments. Nylon. Nylon carpet yarn resists stains, hides soil, resists mildew and bacteria, and prevents static. Polyester. Polyester has a high strength-to-weight ratio, and is the most widely sold manufactured fiber. It is utilized in all types of clothing, home furnishings (bedspreads, sheets, pillows, curtains, furniture, and carpets), and as a reinforcing fiber in tires, belts, and hoses.
Manufactured fiber does not provide the vitamins and minerals found in food sources of fiber, as it is removed from these foods. Dietary fiber from whole foods, particularly cereals and fruits, protects you from heart disease, confirms the American Dietetic Association in a 2008 position paper. Fiber occurs naturally in plant foods and can also be isolated from plants to be added to foods to increase the fiber content. Consume both natural and manufactured fiber as part of a healthy diet.
