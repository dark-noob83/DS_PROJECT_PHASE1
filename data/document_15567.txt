Colon cancer may affect the large intestine's ability to perform some of these functions, causing changes in bowel habits or unexplained weight loss. However, in the early stages of the disease, there are usually no obvious symptoms of colon cancer.
Some of the most common symptoms of advanced colon cancer include bloody stools, differences in usual bowel habits and chronic abdominal discomfort. Unintentional weight loss, changes in appetite and ongoing nausea can also be symptoms. Some individuals with colon cancer may also suffer from extreme fatigue.
In its early stage, colorectal cancer usually produces no symptoms. The most likely warning signs include: 1  Changes in bowel movements, including persistent constipation or diarrhea, a feeling of not being able to empty the bowel completely, an urgency to move the bowels, rectal cramping, or rectal bleeding.
The symptoms of more advanced stages of bowel cancer include those seen in initial stages and: 1  Severe weakness. 2  Anemia â€“ this is due to lower numbers of red blood cells in blood. 3  Anemia may result when there is severe bleeding within the tumors.
Colon cancer in its advanced stage can cause blockage of the intestine if the tumor has recurred or has not been completely removed by surgery. Changes in bowel habits, such as constipation, diarrhea or difficulty passing stool, will often ensue. Blood in the stool may also be noted.
Stage 3. A stage 3 colorectal cancer is considered an advanced stage of cancer as the disease has spread to the lymph nodes. For a colon cancer, surgery is usually done first, followed by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy and radiation may precede or follow surgery for a stage 3 rectal cancer.
