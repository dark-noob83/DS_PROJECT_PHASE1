The hens are broody and good mothers. The hen will also lay light brown eggs year round. The bird itself has a long, broad body with a moderately deep breast. The yellow-skinned Barred Rock matures early into a broiler at 8 to 12 weeks of age. Cocks weigh up to 9.5 pounds and hens up to 7.5 pounds.
I've got a hatchery mutt barred SOMETHING (not sure if she's supposed to be a Dominique or Barred Rock) who is only the size of a gamefowl...but she has decided TODAY to go broody. In my straw bales.
I know Barred Rock's are reported to not go broody, and that is why they're good production hens. I have two barred rocks and upon looking in the coop today I noticed Esther was sitting in the box. She lays early in the morning, never the afternoon, so I opened the door to the garden.
I need some positive feedback from this. I read at one of the hatchery sites that barred rocks are likely to go broody. This means less eggs I have to put in the bator. Then they can be raised by their mommy and all will be good.
