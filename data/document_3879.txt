Vacuum sealing asparagus is the preferred method of freezing asparagus because it removes the cold air that causes freezer burn, or oxidation and dis-colorization of the spears, which can cause the spears to have an off taste that will spoil the flavor and texture of the asparagus.
METHOD: 1. Wash the Asparagus spears thoroughly to remove soil and any garden debris or insects off of the cut spears and trim, if necessary, to fit into the bag. 2. Make the bag by cutting off a portion of the roll of bag material that will accommodate the length of the spears and seal one of the opened ends.
You might want to freeze a bag of chopped spear pieces, depending on how you’ll ultimately use the asparagus. Sliced asparagus speeds up meal prep, especially when you’re adding them to soup, egg dishes, or stir fries. Blanch small spears 2 minutes, medium spears 3 minutes, and large spears 4 minutes.
8. Put the asparagus into freezer containers or freezer bags (with the air pushed out of them) and label them for later consumption. 9. Freeze asparagus for 8-12 months. If you package in a FoodSaver your asparagus will stay fresh for 2-3 years in the freezer. Read how to freeze butter or how to freeze cheese.
Freezing Asparagus. Freezing asparagus by either the traditional or vacuum sealing are both excellent ways to preserve the delicate flavor of asparagus for use throughout the year. Asparagus freezes well and can be used in all recipes requiring fresh asparagus, including casseroles, soups, and steamed.
Vacuum sealing the asparagus spears allows you to freeze the spears without the blanching, keeping the texture fresh and the color at optimum green. Drying asparagus is also a good way to preserve asparagus. This method is great for use in soups and can be taken camping, to use in stews and campfire cooking.
