The data distributor, known more commonly as a Demultiplexer or “Demux” for short, is the exact opposite of the Multiplexer we saw in the previous tutorial. The demultiplexer takes one single input data line and then switches it to any one of a number of individual output lines one at a time.
In electronics, a multiplexer or mux (occasionally the term mul-dex is also found, for a combination multiplexer-demultiplexer) is a device that selects one of many analog or digital input signals and outputs it into a single output line. This process is termed: multiplexing.
Mutliplexer: Multiplexer means many into one. A multiplexer is a circuit used to select and route any one of the several input signals to a signal output. An simple example of an non electronic circuit of a multiplexer is a single pole multiposition switch. Multiposition switches are widely used in many electronics circuits.
In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line. A multiplexer of 2 inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output. Multiplexers are mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over the network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth. A multiplexer is also called a data selector.
