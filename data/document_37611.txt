The prothrombin time (PT) — along with its derived measures of prothrombin ratio (PR) and international normalized ratio (INR) — are assays evaluating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. This test is also called ProTime INR and PT/INR. They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status. PT measures factors I (fibrinogen) , II (prothrombin) , V, VII, and X.
Wot is the inr level for someone with a mechanical valve INR = International Normalised Ratio, which describes how 'sticky' the blood is. Values are taken relative to 'norma … l' which is an INR of 1.0. People taking anticoagulant drugs, such as Warfarin, will have a raised INR, typically between 2.5 and 3.5. This means the blood is less sticky and less likely to form clots in the event of certain surgical procedures or disease.
Laboratory measurement [edit]. The reference range for prothrombin time depends on the analytical method used, but is usually around 12–13 seconds (results should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test), and the INR in absence of anticoagulation therapy is 0.8-1.2. This test is also called ProTime INR and PT/INR. They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status. PT measures factors I (fibrinogen) , II (prothrombin) , V, VII, and X.
The normal range for a healthy person not using warfarin is 0.8–1.2, and for people on warfarin therapy an INR of 2.0–3.0 is usually targeted, although the target INR may be higher in particular situations, such as for those with a mechanical heart valve. This test is also called ProTime INR and PT/INR. They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status. PT measures factors I (fibrinogen) , II (prothrombin) , V, VII, and X.

People taking anticoagulant … drugs, such as Warfarin, will have a raised INR, typically between 2.5 and 3.5. This means the blood is less sticky and less likely to form clots in the event of certain surgical procedures or disease. However, in people taking warfarin a normal INR level is  … somewhere between 2 and 3.   High levels of INR are associated with: Disorders affecting  clotting factors; Warfarin usage; Vitamin K deficiency; Liver  disease; Disseminated intravascular coagulation etc.
People on warfarin treatment will have different target INR ranges to aim for with warfarin treatment, depending on the reason for anticoagulation (blood-thinning treatment). One example is a range of 2.0 to 3.0 for DVT. An INR lower than the desired range means the blood is “not thin enough” or clots too easily. An INR result higher than the desired range means the blood is “too thin”. Warfarin doses are adjusted, initially every few days, aiming for the desired target range of INR.
A normal INR is approximately 1.0. People taking the blood thinner warfarin typically have a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. People with an INR higher than the normal range who aren’t taking warfarin may have a medical condition that needs further evaluation. A low INR is rarely significant
It's safer for you when your INR is in your Normal INR Range because the risks of an INR Level lower than your Normal INR range could mean that you are at risk for potential clots and an INR higher than your Normal INR Range could mean that you are at risk for potential internal bleeding. As an example, we are going to use an INR of 2.5 because usually an INR of 2.5 is a normal INR level for someone taking Warfarin.
