Chlorophyll is a complex organic molecule that enables plants, and some other organisms, to carry out photosynthesis â€” the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen using sunlight.
Chlorophyllin is made from chlorophyll, a green pigment that is present in plants. Chlorophyllin has been used in alternative medicine as an aid to reduce the odor of urine or feces (bowel movements).
Chlorophyll is a green pigment (one of several photosynthetic pigments) that plays a crucial role in producing food for green plants by synthesizing simple sugars (glucose) from carbon dioxide and water in the process of photosynthesis. The by-product of photosynthesis is free oxygen.
Answer 2: Chlorophyll is a green pigment that gives most plants their color.The reason that it is green is because it absorbs other colors of light such as red and blue, so in a way the green light is reflected out since the pigment does not absorb it.
Chlorophyll absorbs most strongly in the blue and red but poorly in the green portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues like plant leaves. Chlorophyll is an essential component for photosynthesis, which helps plants get energy from light.
Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in plants. Plants use chlorophyll and light to make food. People use chlorophyll as medicine. Common sources of chlorophyll used for medicine include alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and silkworm droppings. Chlorophyll is used for bad breath and reducing colostomy odor.
Chlorophyll is the molecule that traps this 'most elusive of all powers' - and is called a photoreceptor. It is found in the chloroplasts of green plants, and is what makes green plants, green. The basic structure of a chlorophyll molecule is a porphyrin ring, co-ordinated to a central atom.
