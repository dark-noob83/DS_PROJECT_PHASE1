There are many families of flies in North America. Although the life cycle of a fly can range from days to years depending on species and conditions, all flies undergo a complete four-stage life cycle that consists of egg, larva, pupa and adult stages. The adult housefly can live up to one month in the wild. The fruit fly also lives for approximately 30 days after reaching adulthood. Flies survive longest in warmer temperatures and their ideal temperatures—between 75 and 80 degrees—are those found in most American homes
There are two types of African trypanosomiasis (also called sleeping sickness); each named for the region of Africa in which it was found historically. Individuals can become infected with West African trypanosomiasis if they receive a bite from an infected tsetse fly, which is only found in Africa. West African trypanosomiasis, also called Gambian sleeping sickness, is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense carried by the tsetse fly. In recent years, 7,000-10,000 new cases of West African trypanosomiasis have been reported to the World Health Organization annually.
The adult fly emerges from the pupa in the ground after about 30 days. Over a period of 12-14 days it matures, mates and, if it is a female, deposits its first larva. Thus 50 days elapse between the emergence of one female fly and the subsequent emergence of the first of its progeny. For a more detailed description of the life cycle and general biology of tsetse flies, see Stephen Leak's excellent book (Leak, 1999). References. Leak, S.G.A. (1998) Tsetse biology and ecology: their role in the epidemiology and control of trypanosomosis.
At the end of the pupal stage, tsetse emerge as adult flies. Tsetse adults are relatively large flies, with lengths of ½–1½ cm, and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies. Tsetse have large heads, distinctly separated eyes, and unusual antennae. Tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in two forms: as third instar larvae, and as adults. Tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar, during which they have the typical appearance of maggots.
1 The adult fly emerges from the pupa in the ground after about 30 days. 2  Over a period of 12-14 days it matures, mates and, if it is a female, deposits its first larva. 3  Thus 50 days elapse between the emergence of one female fly and the subsequent emergence of the first of its progeny. 1 Eggs hatch in the female and after larval development, the deposited larvae pupates immediately. 2  The pupal stage lasts about 3 weeks. 3  The adult fly emerges from the pupa in the ground after about 30 days. 4  Over a period of 12-14 days it matures, mates and, if it is a female, deposits its first larva.
The lifespan of a hover fly is similar to other flies. They can  live anywhere between 15 to 30 days and it all depends on the  climate and temperature they are in. The common housefly (suborder Cyclorrhapha) generally can have a life cycle of 15 to 30 days. Four distinct stages characterize its life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.

A Tse Tse fly will live generally from One to Three months. The tsetse fly is a large biting insect native to Africa, and it is dangerous because it has been identified as a disease vector. The fly bites victims to drink blood, and can … infect that victim. A bitten individual may get sleeping sickness. Nagana, a disease affecting cattle, can be passed on to these herd animals.
The average lifespan of an adult housefly is approximately 15 to 25 days. Since they can complete their lifecycle in as little as seven to ten days, flies typically live … between 22 and 25 days from egg to death. The common housefly (suborder Cyclorrhapha) generally can have a life cycle of 15 to 30 days. Four distinct stages characterize its life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.
