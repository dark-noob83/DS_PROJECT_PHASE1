Reversals: At the beginning of each accounting period, there is an accounting practice to use reversing entries to cancel out the adjusting/accrual entries that were made to accrue revenues and expenses at the end of the previous accounting period. Understand the difference between accruals and reversals. Recap the earlier discussion we had on accruals and reversals and see the comparison between these two different but related accounting concepts.

Answers. Best Answer: You make reversing entries for accruals at year end. An example would be the accruals for salaries owed at year-end but not paid until early January. Let say we owe them 10,000 on December 31 (a Wednesday) but will pay them 15,000 on Friday. It could be that different people are doing both entries so they don't know what the other is doing. Without a reversing entry the journal entry would be Salaries Expense 5,000 Salaries Payable 10,000 Cash 15,000 This assumes that the person making this entry knows about the accrual. More than likely the accrual has not been make yet since it is only January 2nd.
Reversing accruals cancel the prior monthâ€™s accruals. Accrual-based accounting matches revenue and expenses to the current accounting period. Accruals accumulate until an adjusting entry is made.

Reversing entries, or reversing journal entries, are journal entries made at the beginning of an accounting period to reverse or cancel out adjusting journal entries made at the end of the previous accounting period.

For example, if an accrued expense was recorded in the previous year, the bookkeeper or accountant can reverse this entry and account for the expense in the new year when it is paid.
