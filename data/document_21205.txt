Flexibility and suppleness. Another difference between men and women’s feet is that there is less cartilage in between of the women’s feet. Coupled with the general flexibility of a woman’s foot, the female foot is therefore more flexible than a man’s feet. That is why a woman can bend her feet further than most males can, by 45 degrees.
Report Abuse. The first public listing of differences between men's and women's feet was published in the American College of Sports Medicine Journal, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. Researcher Peter Cavanagh looked at data from 293 men and 491 women that was used to help the US Army design comfortable boots.
Women’s feet are not comparable to men with smaller feet. The anatomy of feet as examined by various researchers yield data, which reiterate the differences between men and women’s feet. Women need shoes that can support their higher arches and calves, broader ankles and calves.
Some people might say that women’s feet are just smaller version of a man’s and they could just as easily wear each shoe when the right size fits. However, the difference between men and women’s feet lies much more than what meets the eye. It is important to consider these differences especially when it comes to manufacturing the right footwear for each one.
Contingency tables were used to illustrate the distribution of foot length in relation to the given variables for both genders. Significant differences between men and women for the foot lengths 25.00-25.66 cm (Size 38, net value) and 25.67-26.32 cm (Size 39, net value) were detected using Student´s t-test.
All else being equal, differences in the foot structure of men and women may impact the fit of women’s shoes on a transwoman. When corrected for their foot length, women tend to have a greater plantar arch height, calf height, ankle circumference, and calf circumference.
