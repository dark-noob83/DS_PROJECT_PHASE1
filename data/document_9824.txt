In 2006 it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to Earth, orbiting at only 2.8 times Earth’s distance from the sun. Its year takes 4.6 Earth years and its day is 9.1 hours. Haumea was discovered in 2003. This dwarf planet has an extremely elongated shape, with its longest dimension being about 1,218 miles long (1,960 km). Haumea rotates very rapidly and has the shortest day of all the dwarf planets, only 3.9 hours.
One day on Pluto (one rotation around its axis) is roughly 6.4 Earth days. A year (one orbit around the Sun) is about 248.09 Earth years. See related link for more information. Pluto's sidereal rotation period is 6 days, 9 hours, 17 minutes, and 36 seconds. 
A day on Venus is 243 Earth days. Venus’ day is actually longer than its year. It only takes 224.7 Earth days for the planet to orbit the Sun. We measure a day on Earth as a period of 24 hours, but it actually takes the planet 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds to rotate on its axis. Some astronomers believe that we will never know how long a day on Saturn is. A day on Uranus only takes 17 hours 14 minutes and 24 seconds. Since the planet has such an extreme axial tilt (97.8°), it actually rotates on its side. A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours 6 minutes and 36 seconds in Earth time
We can write a paragraph about how long days last on other planets. On Mercury a day lasts 1,408 hours, and on Venus it lasts 5,832 hours. On Earth and Mars it’s very similar. Earth takes 24 hours to complete one spin, and Mars takes 25 hours. The gas giants rotate really fast. Jupiter takes just 10 hours to complete one rotation.
by Fraser Cain on May 15, 2008. Pluto takes 6 days and 9 hours to complete one rotation, so this is how long a day is on Pluto. You can also look through these books from Amazon.com if you want more information about Pluto. One interesting note is that Pluto’s moon Charon is tidally locked around Pluto. This means that Charon takes 6 days and 9 hours to orbit around Pluto – the same amount of time it takes for a day on Pluto. This means that Charon is always at the same place in the sky when seen from Pluto. You would have the same view from Charon as well. 
How long is a day on other planets. by Colm Byrne on January 3, 2013. When we think of a day on Earth we measure it in a period of 24 hours, actually it takes 23 hours and 56 minutes and 4 seconds to rotate on it’s axis. So, if we measure a day on each planet compared to Earth it kind of makes it easier. Some of the planets rotate and spin slow and some rotate and spin fast so you can see a big difference as they orbit the Sun in our solar system. Mercury - 58 days and 15 hours. Venus – 243 Earth days. Earth – 23 hours and 56 minutes.
Eris has the orbit that is most highly inclined of all the dwarf planets, tilted nearly 47 degrees from the plane of the planets’ orbits. A day on Eris takes 25.9 hours. Eris has one moon, Dysnomia. Pluto, discovered in 1930, orbits the sun at an average of 39.5 times the Earth’s distance. Its diameter is 1,430 miles (2,302 km). Pluto takes 247.9 Earth years to orbit the sun, and its day is 6.39 times as long as Earth’s. Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra and two that were recently discovered and have not yet been named. Haumea was discovered in 2003. This dwarf planet has an extremely elongated shape, with its longest dimension being about 1,218 miles long (1,960 km). Haumea rotates very rapidly and has the shortest day of all the dwarf planets, only 3.9 hours.
Pluto's rotation period, its day, is equal to 6.39 Earth days. Like Uranus, Pluto rotates on its side on its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its solstices, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness. Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune.
Pluto rotates much more slowly than Earth so a day on Pluto is much longer than a day on Earth. A day on Pluto is 6.4 Earth days or 153.3 hours long. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 2  Learn how.
