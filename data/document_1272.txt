Best Answer: NaOH is a alkali (bases soluble in water) & HCl is an acid. 1) Acid + base â†’ Salt + water + heat (neutralisation reaction). 2)The equation is already balanced. To check whether it is balanced check whether the number of atoms of each kind are equal on both RHS & LHS.
Contrary to expectations, the reaction is gentle and a precipitate of sodium chloride (sparingly soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid) is formed. The sodium sits on top of this, hissing gently. Potassium A small cube of potassium is placed in a test tube of concentrated hydrochloric acid.
Na2CO3 + HCl forms H2CO3 + NaCl. The H2CO3 (carbonic acid) then reacts to form H20 and CO2 so you would observe the bubbles of carbon dioxide (CO2) The NaCl (table salt) does not form a precipitate.
This reaction involves a base (NaOH) and an acid (HCl), so it's a neutralization reaction, which is a special type of double-displacement reaction. Follow this procedure to write balanced molecular equations for double displacement reactions, when you know only the formulas of the reactants:
If you add concentrated HCl solution to a saturated NaCl solution, you will drive the equilibrium of equation 1) back to the left by increasing the concentration of Cl - (aq). As a result, NaCl will re-crystallize in the solution.
Yes, it will neutralize the HCl and form carbonic acid, which is not stable and decomposes to form CO2. The overall reaction is: and takes place in two stages: Stage I: sodium carbonate is converted to sodium hyrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) as shown in the reaction: Stage II: the gas, carbon dioxide is released.
3)NaOH & HCl are the reactants & NaCl & H2O are the products. Remember :- L.H.S always signifies reactants & R.H.S. products. Something more :- In this reaction as you can see the anions (negatively charged ions) of both the reactants get exchanged. Cl goes with Na & OH with H (H + H = H2).
