In the stomach, a large sack-like   organ, the food is churned and mixed with a strong gastric (mostly   hydrochloric) acid. Only partly digested, this   mix in the s … tomach is called chyme.   Additional Information:   However, the digestive process isn't   restricted to the stomach. Digestion is accomplished over the full   range of the digestive system, beginning in the mouth and ending at   the anus.
The chyme, or partially digested food from the stomach, is pushed along the small intestine by muscle contractions called peristaltic waves. Most of the chemical digestion and breakdown of the food happens in the duodenum. Food is mixed with bile from the gallbladder and digestive juices from the pancreas. The jejunum is responsible for absorption the majority of nutrients from the chyme. The digested food passes into the capillaries and lymphatic vessels in the wall of the intestine.

1 Partially digested food, or chyme, from the stomach is mixed with bile from the liver and pancreatic juice from the pancreas to complete its digestion in the duodenum. 2  The jejunum is the middle section of the small intestine that serves as the primary site of nutrient absorption. 3  It measures around 3 feet in length. The small intestine is, however, about twice the length of the large intestine and usually measures about 10 feet in length. The small intestine winds throughout the abdominal cavity inferior to the stomach. Its many folds help it to pack all 10 feet of its length into such a small body cavity....
Chyme has a low pH that is countered by the production of bile, helping to further digest food. Chyme is part liquid and part solid: a thick semifluid mass of partially digested food and digestive secretions that is formed in the stomach and small intestine during digestion. With a pH of approximately 2, chyme emerging from the stomach is very acidic. The duodenum secretes a hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes the gall bladder to contract, releasing alkaline bile into the duodenum.

Chyme (/kaɪm/ ; from Greek χυμός khymos, juice) is the semifluid mass of partly digested food that is expelled by the stomach into the duodenum and moves through the intestines during digestion. With a pH of approximately 2, chyme emerging from the stomach is very acidic. The duodenum secretes a hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes the gall bladder to contract, releasing alkaline bile into the duodenum.
