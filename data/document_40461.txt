RE: How long does a first class mail take to deliver within UK? hi i ordered a game form Amazon.co.uk and payed extra for a first class mail and basically i was wondering how long it takes for a package to get delivered through 1st Class Mail. the deliver will take place within UK so its not coming from another country.
First-Class Mail. In most cases, the first-class mailing option takes from one to three days on average and three to five days for delivery to Alaska and Hawaii. To use the first-class mail option, prices are based on weight of up to 13 ounces maximum.
Timeframe. The United States Postal Services reports that as of January 2011, it takes an average of one to three days for First-Class Mail to arrive at its destination. Priority Mail takes an average of one to two days to arrive, according to the USPS. USPS only includes the time a package stays in transit in their estimations. Packages dropped off at a post office during business hours usually leave that day. Packages dropped off after hours may take an additional day.
