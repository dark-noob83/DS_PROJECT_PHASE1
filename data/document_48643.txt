In music, vamping is the repeated use of a phrase through an entire song or the improvisation on top of a repeated phrase through a song. Looping, samples and grooves are all examples of vamping, as is almost all popular music with repeated chord progressions. It is not a negative attribute, but implies building on top of a groove to create a song. The keyboardist used extensive vamping to create an intricate song based on a funk groove.
Vamping is a rhythmic style of picking while chording. The chords typically are closed (that is, all 4 fretting strings fretted). The banjo plays either boom/chick (downbeat/offbeat), or when an instrument like bass or guitar is providing the boom, it might just do the chick (offbeat).
