reverse osmosis - (chemistry) a method of producing pure water; a solvent passes through a semipermeable membrane in a direction opposite to that for natural osmosis when it is subjected to a hydrostatic pressure greater than the osmotic pressure.
Reverse Osmosis is a technology that is used to remove a large majority of contaminants from water by pushing the water under pressure through a semi-permeable membrane.
LINK / CITE ADD TO WORD LIST. noun. Reverse osmosis is a way to get clean water out of dirty water or salt water by forcing water under pressure through a membrane. An example of reverse osmosis is the process of filtering polluted water under pressure.
Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove larger particles from drinking water. In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, a colligative property, that is driven by chemical potential, a thermodynamic parameter.
reverse osmosis. a method of extracting essentially pure, fresh water from polluted or salt water by forcing the water under pressure against a semipermeable membrane, which passes the pure water molecules and filters out salts and and other dissolved impurities.
reverse osmosis. noun. A process by which a solvent such as water is purified of solutes by being forced through a semipermeable membrane through which the solvent, but not the solutes, can pass.
: the movement of freshwater through a semipermeable membrane when pressure is applied to a solution (as seawater) on one side of it.
