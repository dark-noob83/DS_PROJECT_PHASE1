The cost of installing an above ground pool is less than the cost of inground swimming pool installation. Buying a swimming pool is full of hidden costs that, over time, may deplete your savings. Do your homework, get the best pool builder, and ask not just questions, but the right questions.
For the purpose of this discussion, we will look at the costs associated with the installation of both kinds of modern swimming pools. According to P.K. Data the average cost of a 19' diameter above ground swimming pool is $6,243; while the average cost of a 32'x16' inground swimming pool is $21,919.
1 Most pools begin with the liner, and they can be made from vinyl or fiberglass. 2  The vinyl is the least expensive with a standard cost of roughly $18,000. 3  The fiberglass bump up the costs to $20,000 without installation. 4  There are also concrete and gunite pools that require around $20,000 to $50,000 to install.
Inground vs. Above Ground Pool Costs. The biggest determining factor in the cost of your swimming pool will be whether you choose an inground or above ground option. On average, the cost of installing a new swimming pool runs between $14,961 and $21,649. However, that is more accurate for pools installed in-ground. Choosing a pool installed at the ground level won't require excavation, which keeps costs much lower.

1 Installing an aboveground pool can cost $1,500-$5,000; for in-ground estimated costs are $7,000-$16,000 for a vinyl-lined model, $15,000-$25,000 for a fiberglass shell and $17,000-$45,000 for concrete or gunite. 2  However, custom designs can run prices much higher.
