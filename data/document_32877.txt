A one server based network. A peer-to-peer based network. In Computer science client-server is a software architecture model consisting of two parts, client systems and server systems, both communicating over a computer network or on the same computer. A client-server application is a distributed system made up of both client and server software.
A client-server network is designed for end-users called clients to access resources (such as files, songs, video collections or some other service) from a central computer called a server.
Lesson Summary. In this lesson, we learned that the client-server model is very efficient for ease of management. In a client-server setup, multiple clients (such as laptops, desktops and any other devices) connect to use the network and contact the server for resources.
Client/Server network. A network setup that utilizes both servers and clients. For example, a network that utilizes a DNS server is an example of a client/server network. Most client/server networks are the networks you would find in a corporate or business environment.
A client-server network is a central computer, also known as a server, which hosts data and other forms of resources. Clients such as laptops and desktop computers contact the server and request to use data or share its other resources with it.
Client-server architecture (client/server) is a network architecture in which each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server. Servers are powerful computers or processes dedicated to managing disk drives (file servers), printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers).
Identification. A client server network is defined as specific type of online network comprised of a single central computer acting as a server that directs multiple other computers, which are referred to as the clients.
