Tim Boyle/Getty Images. Subway is one of the cheapest major fast-food restaurants to franchise. To open one restaurant, the company requires that potential franchisees have liquid assets of at least $30,000 and a net worth of $80,000 to $310,000, according to Entrepreneur. Subway franchisees need less money because the sandwich chain's restaurants are cheaper to open. Subway's startup costs, which include construction and equipment leasing expenses, range from $116,200 to $262,850, according to the company. Opening a McDonald's restaurant requires as much as $2.3 million in startup costs alone, by comparison. But Subway restaurants generate less revenue than McDonald's units
Cost to Start a Subway Franchise. It usually takes anywhere from $115,000 to $220,000 to start a Subway franchise. Occasionally, with larger restaurants, the cost can run up to $250,000. One of the first expenses is the initial franchise fee of $15,000. This fee covers the cost of using the Subway name and is generally non-refundable.
Subway deems the equipment lease to be a true lease and not a financing lease. Subway offers to finance $10,000 of the initial franchise fee under its minority loan program for qualified franchisees purchasing their first franchise at the full franchise fee in the USA only. $7,500 plus $3,000 for any satellite (3,750, plus $1,500 for any satellite if the franchisee transfers to or transfers by adding their spouse or child to the franchise agreement). Location Rent/License Fee. $1,000 - $6,000 per month, estimated.
How much does the average Subway owner net? I have $200,000 cash (is this too low for a business?) and I want to franchise a Subway/Jimmy Johns/7-Eleven/etc. in the Austin, Texas area. So for easy round numbers lets say the average store does $400k/year. It is relatively easy to pull 20% profit if you keep an eye on the business. I averaged 22.63% for the first quarter this year and I was in my stores an average of 10 hours or less per week so 20% is not that hard.
The investment required to open a Subway Franchise is between $85,200-$260,350. There is an initial franchise fee of $15,000 which grants you the license to run a business under the Subway name. How much money you could make as a Subway Franchise owner depends on a wide variety of factors. As a business owner, your primary goals are to strive for high sales while keeping your operating costs as low as possible while still maintaining quality products and service.
