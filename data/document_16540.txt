A point at the Earth's equator moves approximately 27907 meters east in one minute. The Earth rotates 360 degrees around its axis in approximately 1436 minutes (the siderial d … ay). The estimated circumference of the Earth is 40,075,160 meters. Thus the a point on the Earth's equator moves 40,075,160 meters in 1436 minutes.
The Earth rotates around its axis once in 24 hours and thus covers 3600 in 24 hours earth takes 4 minutes to cover one degree of latitude. 360 degrees in 24 hours 15 degrees per hour (15 / 3,600) (1/240) degree per second 0.25 minute of angle per second 15 seconds of angle per second.
The Earth rotates 60 degrees in four hours. This is because the  Earth rotates 360 degrees n 24 hours. So, it rotates 15 degrees per  hour. Dividing 60 degrees by 15 degrees … , you get the result 4  hours.
The Earth rotates in 24 hours and during that time it covers 360 degrees. One hour has 60 minutes, so a day has 24x60=1440 minutes. Therefore, the Earth covers 360/1440 degrees per day and 0.25 degrees per minute.
The earth rotates 360 degrees in 24 hours, so in one hour it rotates 15 degrees. (If you look at a map of time zones you will see the time zones divided into 15 degree segments). One hour is 60 minutes, so in one minute of time the earth rotates 15/60 degree. Now a degree of longitude is 60 minutes, so in one minute of time, the earth rotates by. 15/60 times 60 minutes, ie 15 minutes of longitude.
