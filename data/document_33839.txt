Limited liability is granted only to charities that organize as a nonprofit corporation. If the charity is run by a few individuals who do not take the formal steps to incorporate the charity as a nonprofit corporation, it will not be afforded limited liability.
Nonprofit organizations, such as charitable organizations, are legal entities separate and distinct from the individuals who control and operate them. The primary difference between a charity and a for-profit corporation is that charities do not operate to make money; they exist to further some public good.
