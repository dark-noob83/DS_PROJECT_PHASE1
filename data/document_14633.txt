A magnetic field can be formed by passing electric current through a wire, and electromagnets work on this basic principal. Electromagnets are used for creating plenty of appliances ranging from motors, speakers, heads for tape drives, and hard disks; here's a brief insight to electromagnets.
An electromagnet is a magnet that runs on electricity. Unlike a permanent magnet, the strength of an electromagnet can easily be changed by changing the amount of electric current that flows through it. The poles of an electromagnet can even be reversed by reversing the flow of
An electromagnet can be regarded as a temporary magnet that functions with a flow of electricity, and its polarity can be easily altered by varying the direction of current. On the other hand, the magnetic strength of electromagnets can be changed by varying the amount of current flowing through them. This diagram depicts formation of magnetic field produced by electric current and the working of a simple electromagnet.
An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of a large number of closely spaced turns of wire that create the magnetic field.
Lesson Summary. An electromagnet is a device that sends electricity through a coil of wire to produce a magnetic field. This leads to a magnet that can be controlled -- turned on and off with the flip of a switch, or increased or decreased in strength. The coils are often wrapped around a regular magnet to make it stronger.
