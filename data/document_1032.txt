  . Name 3 sites where receptors for taste are found. Which one of these 3 has the most receptors. Name and describe 3 types of papillae found on the dorsal tongue surface. On which of the papillaes are the taste buds located? What cranial nerve serves the anteior 2/3 of the tongue? What cranial nerve serves the posterior 1/3 of the tongue? Tast babies tend to favor bland foods, whereas adults tend to like highly seasoned foods. with age, taste buds become less acute and respond more slowly.
