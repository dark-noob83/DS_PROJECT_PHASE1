1 Median. 2  The median of a set of numbers is the number in the middle. 3  For example, in the set of numbers {4,6,25}, the median is 6. 4  However the numbers must be in order for the median to be in the middle. 1 For example, in the set of numbers {4,6,25}, the median is 6. 2  However the numbers must be in order for the median to be in the middle.
The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated central value of a set of numbers. To calculate: Just add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are. 
b. The average of the two middle numbers, when such a sequence has an even number of values. For example, in the sequence 4, 8, 10, 56, the median is 9 (the average of 8 and 10). Compare arithmetic mean, average, mode. 2. A line joining a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. 3. the middle number in a given sequence of numbers, or the average of the middle two numbers when the sequence has an even number of numbers: 4 is the median of 1, 3, 4, 8, 9. 4. a straight line from a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. 5.
more ... The middle number (in a sorted list of numbers). To find the Median, place the numbers you are given in value order and find the middle number. Example: find the Median of {13, 23, 11, 16, 15, 10, 26}. Put them in order: {10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 23, 26} The middle number is 15, so the median is 15
1 The median of a set of numbers is the number in the middle. 2  For example, in the set of numbers {4,6,25}, the median is 6. 3  However the numbers must be in order for the median to be in the middle. 4  If there are an even number of numbers, then the median is the average of the last 2 middle numbers. 1 For example, in the set of numbers {4,6,25}, the median is 6. 2  However the numbers must be in order for the median to be in the middle.
Median is the middle data value of an ordered data set. 1  If there are two middle values, then the median is the mean of the two numbers. 1 The middle numbers from the above data set are 30 and 31. 2  As there are two middle numbers we have to find the mean of those numbers. = = 3  30.5. 4  So, 30.5 is the median (middle value) of the data set 33, 30, 42, 22, 18, and 31.
Arithmetic Median Definition: Median is the middle value of the given numbers or distribution in their ascending order.Median is the average value of the two middle elements when the size of the distribution is even.
The mean is the average you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The median is the middle value in the list of numbers. To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order, so you may have to rewrite your list first. The mode is the value that occurs most often. If no number is repeated, then there is no mode for the list. The range is just the difference between the largest and smallest values. Just remember the following: mean: regular meaning of average median: middle value mode: most often. (In the above, I've used the term average rather casually. The technical definition of average is the arithmetic mean: adding up the values and then dividing by the number of values.
1 If there are two middle values, then the median is the mean of the two numbers. 2  There will be two middle values when the number of values in the data set is even. 1 The middle numbers from the above data set are 30 and 31. 2  As there are two middle numbers we have to find the mean of those numbers. = = 3  30.5. 4  So, 30.5 is the median (middle value) of the data set 33, 30, 42, 22, 18, and 31.
