THANKS ALOT :) 12,000 B.C.E– Onwards The Start of the Neolithic Age and the beginning of Agriculture-The term the Neolithic Age refers to the period of time in which refinements in tool-making... show more When did the Neolithic Age end.... Doing Cause and effect thing at school, wondering if i have correct info. Best Answer: Yeah i'd say what you wrote is pretty much accurate, though it would be better to put 10,000 BCE as the start of the neolithic rather than 12,000 BCE, but then again there is no definitive start date for the period. As for the end of the neolithic age, well it depends on the region.
Toward the end of the Neolithic Era, people began to use tools made from metal. Copper was the first metal used for tools. Eventually copper replaced stone, leading to the Copper Age. We will talk in class about an amazing early Copper Age discovery in the mountains near the Italian and Austrian border. 
The beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant (Jericho, modern-day West Bank) about 10,200–8,800 BC. It developed directly from the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region, whose people pioneered the use of wild cereals, which then evolved into true farming. The Neolithic 1 (PPNA) period began roughly 10,000 years ago in the Levant. A temple area in southeastern Turkey at Goebekli Göbekli tepe dated 9,500 9500 bc may be regarded as the beginning of the. period
The Paleolithic Era (or Old Stone Age) is a period of prehistory from about 2.6 million years ago to around 10000 years ago. The Neolithic Era (or New Stone Age) began around 10,000 BC and ended between 4500 and 2000 BC in various parts of the world. In the Paleolithic era, there were more than one human species but only one survived until the Neolithic era. Paleolithic humans lived a nomadic lifestyle in small groups. In general, Paleolithic people were healthier than Neolithic man. Life expectancy was 35.4 years for men and 30.0 years for women in the late Paleolithic era (30000 to 9000 BC).

The Neolithic period, which began in China around 10,000 B.C. and concluded with the introduction of metallurgy about 8,000 years later, was characterized by the development of settled communities that relied primarily on farming and domesticated animals rather than hunting and gathering. 
By K. Kris Hirst. The Mesolithic (or middle stone) period is traditionally that time period in the Old World between the last glaciation at the end of the Paleolithic (~12,000 years ago) and the beginning of the Neolithic (~7000 years ago), when farming communities began to be established. 
In South India, the Neolithic began by 6500 BC and lasted until around 1400 BC when the Megalithic transition period began. South Indian Neolithic is characterized by Ashmounds since 2500 BC in Karnataka region, expanded later to Tamil Nadu. The Neolithic 1 (PPNA) period began roughly 10,000 years ago in the Levant. A temple area in southeastern Turkey at Goebekli Göbekli tepe dated 9,500 9500 bc may be regarded as the beginning of the. period
The Neolithic Period began in different parts of the world at different times, the first being around 10,200 BCE in the Middle East, and lasted until the development of metal tools between 4,500 and 2,000 BCE. The Neolithic is the last part of the Stone Age, and was replaced by Bronze Age and use of bronze tools. 
The term Neolithic derives from the Greek νεολιθικός, neolithikos, from νέος neos, new + λίθος lithos, stone, literally meaning New Stone Age . The term was invented by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three-age system. The Neolithic 1 (PPNA) period began roughly 10,000 years ago in the Levant.
