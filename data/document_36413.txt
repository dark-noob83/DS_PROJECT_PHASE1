The Arctic Ocean, and sea ice. Most of the Arctic Ocean is over 1000 m deep and is continuously covered with ice whose thickness varies between 1-10 m. About one third of the Arctic Ocean is shallow, i.e. continental shelf. Over these shelf areas, ice is absent at least part of the year, but ice is found year-round over the deep ocean.
The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the recently delimited Southern Ocean).
Antarctica (Section 16.3) is a continent in a hemisphere that is mostly water. The Arctic (Fig 1) is mostly ocean, surrounded by mostly land. Therefore the two polar areas are very different. Greenland is covered by an icecap up to 2,700 m thick.
The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five ocean basins. A polar bear walks on the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean. The freezing environment provides a home for a diverse range of creatures. With an area of about. , the Arctic Ocean is about 1.5 times as big as the United States. It is bordered by Greenland, Canada, Norway, Alaska, and Russia. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is. and it is. at its deepest point.
Arctic Ocean. The Arctic Ocean is the world's smallest with an area of 5,427,000 square miles (14,056,000 sq km). It extends between Europe, Asia and North America and most of its waters are north of the Arctic Circle.
The Arctic Ocean receives a large amount of fresh water from river runoff relative to its area, compared to other oceans. There are five major rivers that flow into the Arctic, the Mackenzie and Yukon in North America, and the three largest in Asia, the Ob, Yenisey and Lena Rivers.
