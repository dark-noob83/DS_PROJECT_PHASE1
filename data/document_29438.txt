Structure of acetylcholine (ACh). 11.2 Acetylcholine in the Autonomic Nervous System. In the autonomic nervous system, acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter in the preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. These are shown in Figure 11.2 as the red ACh in the ganglion.
When a nerve action potential reaches and invades the nerve terminal, a shower of acetylcholine vesicles is released into the junction (synapse) between the nerve terminal and the ‘effector’ cell which the nerve activates.
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a major Neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is the ester of acetate and choline, formed by the enzyme choline acetyl transferase, from choline and acetyl-CoA. This was the first substance (ca. 1906) to meet the criteria of identification for a neurotransmitter.
Acetylcholine is released from a presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft. Once in the synaptic gap, acetylcholine can: - Bind to presynaptic receptors: presynaptic activation or inhibition leads to automodulation of the presynaptic cholinergic neuron.
Acetylcholine is found at the synapses between neurons and muscle cells. It serves to activate the muscle to contract. If acetylcholine receptors sites on the muscle cell are blocked in someway, then the acetylcholine cannot get on the site and the muscles will be incapable of contracting-paralyzed that is.
Acetylcholine is also used as a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system, both as an internal transmitter for the sympathetic nervous system and as the final product released by the parasympathetic nervous system.
acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter released from nerve endings (terminals) in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. It is synthesized within the nerve terminal from choline, taken up from the tissue fluid into the nerve ending by a specialized transport mechanism.
Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction —in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles.
acetylcholine (ACh) One of the main neurotransmitters of the vertebrate nervous system. It is released at certain (cholinergic) nerve endings and may be excitatory or inhibitory; it initiates muscular contraction at neuromuscular junctions.
Acetylcholine is released when a nerve impulse reaches a myoneural junction. It diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to cholinergic receptors on the muscle fibers, causing them to contract. cholinesterase splits acetylcholine into its components, thus stopping stimulation of the muscle fibers.
