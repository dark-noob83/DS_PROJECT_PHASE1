The frost fair of 1814 began on 1 February, and lasted four days. An elephant was led across the river below Blackfriars Bridge. A printer named George Davis published a 124-page book, Frostiana; or a History of the River Thames in a Frozen State. During the Great Frost of 1683–84, the worst frost recorded in England, the Thames was completely frozen for two months, with the ice reaching a thickness of 11 inches (28 cm) in London.
Thames Frost Fair, 1683-84, by Thomas Wyke. River Thames frost fairs were held on the tideway of the River Thames at London in some winters between the 17th century and early 19th century, during the period known as the Little Ice Age, when the river froze over. During the Great Frost of 1683–84, the worst frost recorded in England, the Thames was completely frozen for two months, with the ice reaching a thickness of 11 inches (28 cm) in London.
The Thames is only 346 km (215 miles) long. It is England's longest river and the second longest river in the United Kingdom. Long ago, before Britain was separated from continental Europe, the Thames was a tributary of the Rhine. The English Channel was formed about 7,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. 
When the river froze, the watermen, who transported people along the Thames, and the lightermen, who moved goods, lost their ability to earn. They followed the tradition of their forebears and organised a frost fair, charging traders and punters for access to the ice. In the 200 years that have elapsed since, the Thames has never frozen solid enough for such hedonism to be repeated. But between 1309 and 1814, the Thames froze at least 23 times and on five of these occasions -1683-4, 1716, 1739-40, 1789 and 1814 - the ice was thick enough to hold a fair.
The Thames has frozen since. In the winter of 1962-63 - known as the Big Freeze-a man was spotted cycling on the Thames near Windsor Bridge. But it was only parts of the Thames further upriver and for short periods, certainly not long enough to turn the capital's river into a mixture of circus and rave.

The source of the Camel is at 218 metres (715 ft) above sea level and it has an average incline of 7m/km. The upper reaches of the Camel and its tributaries are mainly moorland giving way to woodland and farmland, predominantly livestock. The river flows into the eastern Celtic Sea between Stepper Point and Pentire Point having covered about 30 miles. The river is tidal upstream to Egloshayle and is popular for sailing, birdwatching and fishing. The name Camel comes from the Cornish language for 'the crooked one', a reference to its winding course.
For a time, Spanish explorers trying to find the river’s headwaters called it Rio Grande (also translated as “Big River”), an apt name for a river that discharges 600,000 cubic feet of water per second when it empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The source of the river is Lake Itasca, near Bemidji, Minnesota.
