Replication Forks and Origins of Replication. The first step in DNA replication is the separation of the two DNA strands that make up the helix that is to be copied. DNA Helicase untwists the helix at locations called replication origins. The replication origin forms a Y shape, and is called a replication fork.
1 Most archaea have a single circular molecule of DNA, and several origins of replication along this circular chromosome. 2  Eukaryotes often have multiple origins of replication on each linear chromosome that initiate at different times (replication timing), with up to 100,000 present in a single human cell.
The origin of replication also determines the plasmid's compatibility: its ability to replicate in conjunction with another plasmid within the same bacterial cell. Plasmids that utilize the same replication system cannot co-exist in the same bacterial cell. They are said to belong to the same compatibility group.
The origin of replication (also called the replication origin) is a particular sequence in a genome at which replication is initiated. This can either involve the replication of DNA in living organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes, or that of DNA or RNA in viruses, such as double-stranded RNA viruses.

The origin of replication determines the vector copy number, which could typically be in the range of 25 50 copies/cell if the expression vector is derived from the low-copy-number plasmid pBR322, or between 150 and 200 copies/cell if derived from the high-copy-number plasmid pUC.
