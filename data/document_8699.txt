A neuron possesses a cell body (Often Called the soma), dendrites, and an axon. The dendrites are constituted by branches similar to those of a tree. The complexity affects the dendritic tree in the number of signals received by the neuron itself. Inside there is another structure called nucleolus. The nucleolus is a region of the cell nucleus responsible for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The nucleolus is not an organelle but a dense region of genetic material and protein. It is not bordered by a membrane but is held together by a protein structure called the nuclear matrix which constitutes one of the three components of the nuclear skeleton
At rest, neurotransmitter-containing vesicles are stored at the terminal of the neuron in one of two places. A small number of vesicles are positioned along the pre-synaptic membrane in places called active zones.. This is where neurotransmitter release occurs. Most vesicles, however, are held close to these zones, yet further from the membrane itself until they are needed. These vesicles are held in place by Ca2+-sensitive vesicle membrane proteins (VAMPs), which bind to actin filaments, microtubules, and various other elements of the cytoskeleton. Docking is the process by which the vesicle and the pre-synaptic membrane line up in a position that will allow them to fuse easily. Fusion then takes place, in which the vesicle membrane and the pre-synaptic membrane connect to form a small opening, a pore, connecting the lumen of the vesicle with the synaptic cleft.
It also is the site where m â€¦ ost of the cell's cellular activities take place such as the metabolic pathways. It also makes helps the animal by making its eyes bluer at night. Cell division also occurs in the cytoplasm. YOUR WELCOME! ;D The main function of the cytoplasm is to hold the cell organelles of the cell. Cell organelles are basically components of the cell which control all the activities of the cell. its mainly like a bed for the organelles. The cytoplasm in the cell of a chlamydomonas helps to suspend the organelles in the cell. 1 person found this useful. Edit.

it holds all of the cell organelles, or stuff in the cell, together The cytoplasm acts like the cell s skeleton. it is a jelly like substance around nucleus The cytoplasms function in a plant cell is to help gel the parts of the cell in place but it is also where many of the cells chemical reactions happen.

Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites; signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon. A typical synapse, then, is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another. Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and of the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
A 3D model of Neuron Cell Structure in Plasm.js. The cell is the structural and functional unit of living organisms. It answers three fundamental requirements: teleonomy, biogenesis and reproduction. Inside there is another structure called nucleolus. The nucleolus is a region of the cell nucleus responsible for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The nucleolus is not an organelle but a dense region of genetic material and protein. It is not bordered by a membrane but is held together by a protein structure called the nuclear matrix which constitutes one of the three components of the nuclear skelet
The cytosol is made up of water, salts and organic molecules and many enzymes that catalyze reactions. The cytoplasm plays an important role in a cell, serving as a molecular soup in which the organelles are suspended and held together by a fatty membrane. The cytoplasm in the cell of a chlamydomonas helps to suspend the organelles in the cell. 1 person found this useful. Edit.

A typical neuron consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly in its undifferentiated stage. Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and of the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
Cell Membrane and neuron. The outer cell membrane plays a delimiting and protective for the cell itself. The function of the plasma membrane is to divide the internal environment from the external one in order to constantly regulate the passage in and out of all the substances. Inside there is another structure called nucleolus. The nucleolus is a region of the cell nucleus responsible for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The nucleolus is not an organelle but a dense region of genetic material and protein. It is not bordered by a membrane but is held together by a protein structure called the nuclear matrix which constitutes one of the three components of the nuclear skeleton
