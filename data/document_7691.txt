Setting a budget for your kitchen remodel and staying within it sounds so obvious and simple, but it's harder than you think. The average cost of an upscale kitchen remodel is more than $80,000, but three factors should determine whether you want to spend that much. The first is how much you can afford to spend.
Homeowners have many options when it comes to bathroom remodels and the total cost depends on style and budget. The average bathroom remodel costs $9,254, but you can spend less-between $3,500 and $7,000 - to fix up the essentials in a small-to medium-sized bathroom.
For homes that are valued at less than $100,000, you should spend about $10,000 for a quality bathroom remodel. In most circumstances, anything below that will include linoleum floors, a leaky bathtub, and other materials that you won’t be happy with.
I don't recall the exact cost of the bathroom, as it was part of a larger remodel (kitchen, master bedroom hard floor patching plus closet addition, and a few other things), but I would estimate around $25,000 to $30,000 for the bathroom (in the LA area).
The materials for the average small bathroom remodel will cost between $8,000 and $10,000. This includes new fixtures like a new toilet, new sink, and a new bathtub. It also includes the cost of new tiling, new cupboards, and a countertop for the sink.
As for how much a particular kitchen upgrade will cost, that will depend on the size of your kitchen and the specifics of the appliances, cabinets, countertop and other elements of the project. Highly rated remodelers tell our team that a full kitchen remodel can range from $10,000 to $100,000.
Then add that to the $4,000 for the typical materials used, and that already creates a bill in excess of $10,000. Then you have to account for the back-end expenses and provide some profit to the owner of the company. That’s why the cost of a typical bathroom remodel in the United States is about $16,000.
The bathroom shown here, done by Case Remodeling for $30,000 to $35,000, is an example of a midrange bathroom remodel. It features porcelain tile, a his-and-her semicustom vanity, granite countertops and brushed-nickel plumbing fixtures.
As you set your budget for a bathroom remodel, keep in mind that you should spend 5 to 10 percent of your home’s value on a bathroom remodeling project. If you have a $200,000 house, this means you should plan to spend $10,000 to $20,000 on your bathroom.
