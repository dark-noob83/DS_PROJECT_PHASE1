A prokaryotic cell is normally a bacteria. A prokaryotic cell does not have a membrane around it's nucleus, it has loops of DNA free in its cytoplasm. A eukaryotic cell is any cell with many organelles (other parts which help it function) and a membrane-bound nucleus. The nucleus is the key difference-if it has a membrane, it is Eukaryotic/a Eukaryote.
Antonym: prokaryotic (having cells that lack membrane-bound nuclei). Pertainym: eukaryote (an organism with cells characteristic of all life forms except primitive microorganisms such as bacteria; i.e. an organism with 'good' or membrane-bound nuclei in its cells).
eukaryote. an organism of the Eucaryotae, whose cells (eukaryotic cells) have a true nucleus that is bounded by a nuclear membrane, contains the chromosomes, and divides by mitosis. Eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus.
â€¢ EUKARYOTE (noun). The noun EUKARYOTE has 1 sense: 1. an organism with cells characteristic of all life forms except primitive microorganisms such as bacteria; i.e. an organism with 'good' or membrane-bound nuclei in its cells. Familiarity information: EUKARYOTE used as a noun is very rare.
Eukaryote: An organism that consists of one or more cells each of which has a nucleus and other well-developed intracellular compartments. Eukaryotes include all organisms except bacteria, viruses, and certain (blue-green) algae which, by contrast, are prokaryotes. See: Prokaryote.
It is this nucleus that gives the eukaryote its name. Eukaryote means true nucleus. Eukaryotic organisms also have other specialized structures, called organelles, which are small structures within cells that perform dedicated functions. As the name implies, you can think of organelles as small organs.
