Data Pay Per Use At&t. AT&T charges $2 a megabyte for data on mobile phones that are set up pay per use. Not a bad deal for some customers but a great deal for AT&T. Yesterday I was going over a customers bill and saw the were charges of $2 every month for data pay per use. The usage shown on the bill was 1 kilobyte of data per month. I asked the customer what she was doing on the web and she told me that she hits the web button on the mobile phone by accident.

100 dollars = 1MB of data. 200 dollars = 2MB of data. I’m thinking something has to be um…incorrect there. because at $2/MB, AT&T is DRASTICALLY dropping their pay per use data rate. At the dime/KB rate, that 1.2MB, or 1200KB download would cost you $120, whereas at $2/MB, that download would cost you $4. I’m thinking you may have gotten the initial rate wrong. On my last bill (after I fired AT&T) they slapped me with a $2.00 DATA PAY PER USE fee. Dawn March 17, 2010 at 12:28 pm | Permalink. I just have to say this: I am with att and sprint. att charges 1 cent per kb,2 dollars per mb, sprint charges 3 cent per kb,30.72 per mb.
