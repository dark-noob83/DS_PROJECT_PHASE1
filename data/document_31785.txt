Concrete footings are the unsung heroes in a quality built home. For most home construction the concrete footing forms the base of your home. Concrete footings are installed below the frost line to prevent the home from heaving and settling during winter months. Foundation walls and Lally support columns rest on the concrete footings.
In terms of the dimensional requirements for spot concrete footings, the footing pads placed under Lally columns, the typical dimensions are 24 x 24, with a 10 to 12 depth, again depending upon the load bearing capacity of the soil and the number of levels in the home.
Concrete Footing Fundamentals. Footings are an important part of foundation construction. They are typically made of concrete with rebar reinforcement that has been poured into an excavated trench. The purpose of footings is to support the foundation and prevent settling. Footings are especially important in areas with troublesome soils.
B. Minimum Pier and Pier Footing Thickness. The minimum thickness for a pier is 8 inches. The minimum thickness for pier footings is 8 inches or 1-1/2 times the length of the footing projection from the pier, whichever is greater. 503-3.
B. Minimum Foundation Wall and Wall Footing Thickness. For masonry or concrete construction, the minimum foundation wall will be 6 inches. The minimum reinforced concrete footing thickness will be 6 inches or 1-1/2 times the length of the footing projection from the foundation wall, whichever is greater. 503-2.
