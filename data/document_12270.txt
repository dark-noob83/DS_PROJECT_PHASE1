How much electricity does an American home use? In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. 
Wattage: The wattage is on the label and is listed at 1500 W. 3. Daily energy consumption:(1,500 W × 1) ÷ 1,000 = 1.5 kWh 4. Annual energy consumption: The kettle is used almost every day of the year.1.5 kWh × 365 = 547.5 kWh 5. Annual cost: The utility rate is 11 cents per kWh.547.5 kWh × $0.11/kWh = $60.23/year II. 120V × 3A = 360W 3. Daily energy consumption:360 W × .25 ÷ 1000 = 0.09 kWh 4. Annual energy consumption: The shredder is used about once per week (52 days per year).0.09 kWh × 52 = 4.68 kWh 5. Annual cost to operate: The utility rate is 11 cents per kWh.4.68 kWh × $0.11/kWh = $0.51/year.
Household electricity use: 6,000 kWh per household per year for 3 residents average per household. So the household use per capita is 2,000 kWh or about of per capita electricity from all applications. Household Natural Gas use: 400 therms per household x 30 give 12,000 kWh equivalent electricity. Since much of the electricity is generated by natural gas, it is not totally unreasonable to compare these two in kilowatt hours. Reduction of Total Household Energy Use. We are now down to about 8,000 kWh from gas and 1,800 kWh from electricity for a total of 9,800 kWh total of GHG producing household usage, down from the initial 18,000 kWh.
Across the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home. I’d estimate our normal household electricity consumption (i.e. not for heating) to be around 1500-2000 KWh/a. The heated surface area of the house is 185 m2 and includes a couple of rooms in the cellar.
(The state that comes closest to matching the average monthly electricity usage is Ohio). Depending on whether a state is hot or cold, urban or rural, an average household can use as little as 531 kWh a month (Maine) or as much as 1,245 kWh (Louisiana). Costs vary state-by-state, too. Hawaiians pay the most for electricity ($203 a month) and New Mexicans pay the least ($75 a month). 
Our household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand. I’d estimate our normal household electricity consumption (i.e. not for heating) to be around 1500-2000 KWh/a. The heated surface area of the house is 185 m2 and includes a couple of rooms in the cellar.
In the US typical household power consumption is about 11,700 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010. I’d estimate our normal household electricity consumption (i.e. not for heating) to be around 1500-2000 KWh/a. The heated surface area of the house is 185 m2 and includes a couple of rooms in the cellar.
The average electricity consumption is 4,800 kWh per household [36]. A smaller than average household is taken arbitrarily to be 3,000 kWh (i.e. roughly two-thirds of the average), and a larger than average household to be 7,000 kWh (i.e. roughly 50% more). The energy contained in gas is measured in kilowatt-hours (abbreviated to kWh) and for natural gas is 11.2 kWh per cubic metre. Older gas meters measure gas in hundreds of cubic feet - 100 cubic feet equal 2.83 cubic metres.
The average electricity consumption of a US family of four is in the neighborhood of 50 kWh per day, or 1,500 kWh per month. Similar figures apply for Canada. Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh, that translates into about $6 per day for electricity, or $180 per month. And the consumption of individual households can be quite far from that average. As I explain in my About me page, my family of four got our household use down to 180 kilowatt hours a month which is about one sixth the average of my home province of Ontario.
