The trans-syn thymine dimer (2) is formed at a much lower level in single and double stranded DNA. In sunlight, the 6-4 photoproduct is converted to its Dewar isomer (4) by absorption of long-wave UV light at around 325nm.
1 DNA-protein cross-links. 2  Ultraviolet radiation (UV-A) typically causes base damage, such as 8-oxo-G and pyrimidine dimers (e.g. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, and 6-4 photoproduct), although can also lead to SSBs.
Nevertheless, replicative errors stilloccur. Polymerase errors mainly result in misincorporation, but small duplications and deletionscan also occur. DNA is also subject to damage by environmental agents such as radiation, ultraviolet light, andvarious chemicals. Spontaneous modification of DNA bases 
Fig. 1. UV light induced thymine dimer formation (cis – syn stereoisomer) between two adjacent thymine bases in the same strand of a DNA molecule. The photoreactivation process is catalyzed by DNA photolyase, which uses near-UV and visible light.
The predominant reaction induced by UV light on DNA is dimerization of adjacent pyrimidine bases leading to cyclobutane dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts. The dimers formed in the most significant quantity are the cis-syn cyclobutane dimer of two thymine bases (1) and the corresponding 6-4 photoproduct (3).
1. Exposure of DNA to UV radiation has a mutagenic effect on cellular systems. A major type of UV light induced damage is the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (PyrPyr) between adjacent pyrimidine bases in DNA exposed to UV radiation in the range of 200–300 nm (far-UV) [1] and [2] .
