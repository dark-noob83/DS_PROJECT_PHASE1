The Manifesto for Agile Software Development, also known as the Agile Manifesto, was first proclaimed in 2001, six years after Agile Methodology was originally introduced by the preeminent software engineers of the late 80's and early 90's.
Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional project management, typically used in software development. It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.
In software application development, agile software development (ASD) is a methodology for the creative process that anticipates the need for flexibility and applies a level of pragmatism into the delivery of the finished product.
Scrum is part of the Agile movement. Agile is a response to the failure of the dominant software development project management paradigms (including waterfall) and borrows many principles from lean manufacturing.
The Agile Manifesto. Agile development is used to describe any development process that is aligned with the concepts of the Agile Manifesto. This well-known documentation was developed by leaders in the software industry and is based on experience with what works and what doesn't in software development.
Agile software development is a group of software development methods in which solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
In an Agile environment there is a 10 minute daily stand-up meeting for the whole team to discuss what they did, what they will do, and any roadblocks they have encountered. This meeting may be facilitated by the project manager or it may be facilitated by a development manager.
Scrum is an agile methodology that can be applied to nearly any project; however, the Scrum methodology is most commonly used in software development.
