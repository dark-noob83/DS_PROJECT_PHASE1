Most UK taxpayers are given a Personal Allowance, an amount of annual income they are allowed to earn tax-free. For taxpayers under the age of 65, the basic allowance is £7,475. If the income after adjustments is greater than £100,000, the allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2 greater than £100,000. The Personal Allowance has been raised in the 2011/12 tax year from £6,475 to £7,475 for taxpayers under the age of 65 and from £9,640 to £9,940 for those over 75. The amount of the age related tax allowance for taxpayers between 65 and 74 remains unchanged. In both the older age groups, the income limit has been raised from £22,900 to £24,000. The adjusted net income is the total income from all sources adjusted to take deductible allowances into account
Most taxpayers born before 6 April 1948 are entitled to a higher Personal Allowance known as an age-related Personal Allowance. The amount depends on their date of birth and their income. The income limit for age-related Personal Allowance is £27,000 in the 2015/2016 tax year. If income is above this income limit, the age-related allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2 of income over the limit.
The Government is phasing out the age-related personal tax allowance for pensioners and has stopped new over-65s from having access to age-related tax allowances. This will cut incomes for pensioners with modest occupational pensions. Send the accompanying letter to your MP to tell them about the impact. The personal allowance for the under-65s will be £9,205 in 2013-14. Age-related allowances will no longer be available to people who turn 65 on or after 6 April 2013. Government policy over the past few years has narrowed the gap between the basic tax. allowance and the age-related allowances available to older people.
The change in age-related personal allowances-the amount of income that is tax-free-will save the government £1bn by 2015. It will mean that millions of people will not be as protected from tax as they expected to be-which will affect their financial planning as they approach retirement. 
** The age-related personal allowance reduces where the individual's income in the tax year is above the income limit by £1 for every £2 above the limit until the level of the basic personal allowance is reached. From 2013/14 an individual's personal allowance depends on their date of birth and their income in the tax year. Only people born before 6 April 1938 are entitled to age-related personal allowance.
Not all income you receive is taxed. Individuals have an annual personal allowance, which is an amount of income they can keep tax free. For most people it will be £10,600 for 2015-16 (£10,000 for 2014-15). Older people may be eligible for a larger tax-free allowance, depending on their age and total income. For 2015-16 age-related personal allowance has been abolished for those born on or after 6 April 1938. Only those born before 6 April 1938 will receive any extra allowance

Jane Kennedy: I have been asked to reply. Age related income tax personal allowances are available for people over 65 years of age. The cost of extending the age related income tax personal allowance to all men and women aged 60 to 64 would be around £1 billion in 2008/09.
