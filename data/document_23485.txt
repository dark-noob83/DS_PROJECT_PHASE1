I am building a deck thats 30 feet wide in the middle I have a 10 foot section of concrete where I have cut sleepers (accounting for the slope of concrete). On either side of the concrete is another 10 feet of joists. What is the best way to attach the sleepers to the concrete (they go from 1.5 to 3.0).
My plan is to remove the subfloor and lay a series of sleeper joists over the existing floor joists that are comprised of 2x8's on 16-inch centers.
Ensure that the end of each sleeper leaves a 1/4-inch gap between the side boards. Cut the sleeper joists down using a circular saw if needed to create the necessary gap. Place a 4-foot-long level on top of two sleepers so that it is perpendicular to them. Check the center air bubble to determine if the sleepers are even. If the sleepers are uneven, the air bubble will not center.
Installing sleepers (aka floor joists) is a reliable way to have a secure deck. Whether you call them floor joists or sleepers, they are just another name given to the frame of a deck that is directly placed on top of concrete (or any other flat surface).
In architecture and engineering, a joist is one of the horizontal supporting members that run between foundations, walls, or beams to support a ceiling or floor. Typically, a joist has the cross section of a plank. Joists are often supported by beams laid out in repetitive patterns.
Sleeper joists are wooden boards installed on top of an existing subfloor that are typically used as support for hardwood flooring. The sleeper joists follow the same arrangement and spacing as the main home joists located under the subfloor.
