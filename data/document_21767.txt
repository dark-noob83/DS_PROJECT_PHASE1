Almost 25 percent of professionals work more than 40 hours a week. BananaStock/BananaStock/Getty Images. In 1840, the average employee worked for 13 hours a day, six days a week. Fortunately, the 40-hour, 8-hours-per-day workweek has become the standard in many occupations, and is generally accepted as the norm. However, salaried employees' workweeks need not hold to this standard.
Since salary constitutes wages at straight time for all hours worked, the employer owes an additional half-time for the hours in excess of 40 in a week. An example follows: Example: A non-exempt employee is paid a salary of $500 per week, and works 50 hours in a given week. Since the agreement is just that the employee will be paid a $500 salary, that sum would cover any number of hours worked. The regular rate for this week is the salary ($500) divided by the 50 hours worked, or $10.00.
Under this agreement, the regular rate will vary in overtime weeks. If the employee works 50 hours, the regular rate is $9.60 ($480 divided by 50 hours). In addition to the salary, half the regular rate, or $4.80, is due for each of the 10 overtime hours, for a total of $528 for the week.
Non-exempt employees may be paid a salary, but are also paid overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a week. Employers typically want non-exempt employees to work 40 hours per week or less. FLSA rules require employers to convert the salary to an equivalent hourly rate to calculate overtime pay.
If the employee works 40 hours on such a basis, the total pay would be the salary for the 36 hours plus 4 hours times the regular rate. If the employee works 42 hours, the total pay would be the salary for the first 36 hours, plus 4 hours times the regular rate, plus two hours times 1.5
The employee is entitled to an additional one-half times this regular rate for each hour over 40, plus the full piecework earnings. Example: An employee paid on a piecework basis works 45 hours in a week and earns $405. The regular rate of pay for that week is $405 divided by 45, or $9.00 an hour.
Exempt Employees and the FLSA. Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA allows employers to pay some employees a salary without meeting minimum wage or overtime requirements. Employers may ask an exempt employee to work as many hours as the job requires with no additional compensation, even when a work week exceeds 40 hours.
