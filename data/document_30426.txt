Extratropical cyclones, sometimes called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones, are an everyday phenomenon which, along with anticyclones, drive the weather over much of the Earth. They are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales and thunderstorms. The wind flow around an Extratropical cyclone is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, due to the Coriolis effect (this manner of rotation is generally referred to as cyclonic).
A midlatitude cyclone is an area of low pressure located between 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude. Since the continental United States is located in this latitude belt, these cyclones impact the weather in the U.S. This instructional module introduces the most important features of midlatitude cyclones. SectionsLast Update: 08/22/97 Definition of a Cyclone The general structure of a cyclone and associated air masses and fronts is discussed. Winds Associated With a Cyclone A cyclone can be located simply using the wind barbs. Air Masses and Cyclones The movement of air masses associated with cyclone

The eye of a tropical cyclone is part of the warm core that is found in such systems. The other type of cyclone is an extratropical or mid-latitude cyclone. Like tropical cyclones, these systems have low pressure centers and rotate cyclonically about a center. Unlike tropical cyclones, mid-latitude cyclones often form in cold environments and over land. Cyclonic rotation is defined as counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern. Unlike tropical cyclones, such as hurricanes, mid-latitude cyclones are powered by temperature contrasts, usually along boundaries between large-scale air masses.
A mid-latitude cyclone is a large scale area low pressure and cyclonically rotating air that occurs in the middle latitudes (i.e. neither tropical nor polar). Cyclonic rotation is defined as counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern. Unlike tropical cyclones, such as hurricanes, mid-latitude cyclones are powered by temperature contrasts, usually along boundaries between large-scale air masses. These systems develop a system of fronts, usually with a warm front on the eastward side and a cold front on the equatorward side
Introduction. Mid-latitude or frontal cyclones are large traveling atmospheric cyclonic storms up to 2000 kilometers in diameter with centers of low atmospheric pressure. An intense mid-latitude cyclone may have a surface pressure as low as 970 millibars, compared to an average sea-level pressure of 1013 millibars. (Figure 7s-1). Figure 7s-1: A series of mid-latitude cyclones forming along the polar front (black line with red half circle and blue triangle symbols). On the illustration, the low pressure center of the mid-latitude cyclones is identfied by a red L.
Introduction Mid-latitude or frontal cyclones are large traveling atmospheric cyclonic storms up to 2000 kilometers in diameter with centers of low atmospheric pressure. An intense mid-latitude cyclone may have a surface pressure as low as 970 millibars, compared to an average sea-level pressure of 1013 millibars. (Figure 7s-1). Figure 7s-1: A series of mid-latitude cyclones forming along the polar front (black line with red half circle and blue triangle symbols). On the illustration, the low pressure center of the mid-latitude cyclones is identfied by a red L.
Mid-latitude cyclones form just as other low pressure systems do with the divergence of air high in the atmosphere. The jet stream plays a major role in the location of mid-latitude cyclones. The jet stream brings down colder air from the north into the southern regions of the United States. A front separates these two air masses. The low pressure system forms to the east of the upper-level trough of the jet stream.
Frontal cyclones are the dominant weather event of the Earth's mid-latitudes forming along the polar front. (Figure 7s-1). Figure 7s-1: A series of mid-latitude cyclones forming along the polar front (black line with red half circle and blue triangle symbols). On the illustration, the low pressure center of the mid-latitude cyclones is identfied by a red L.
A cyclone is an area of low pressure around which the winds flow counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere. Winds associated with midlatitude cyclones transport heat and moisture from the tropics to higher latitudes and these air masses typically clash in the middle latitudes, often producing clouds and precipitation.
