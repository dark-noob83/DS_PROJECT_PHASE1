Transfer Ribonucleic Acid tRNA is a nucleic acid that is involved in protein synthesis-specifically translation. When mRNA arrives in the cytoplasm, the large and small subunits of the ribosome come together and attach to the mRNA.
mRNA, abbreviation for messenger RNA. An RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecule which has coding regions and translation signals derived from a gene, carries the reverse template message from DNA, and is required for protein synthesis. mRNA is a nucleic acid intermediate that specifies the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide during translation.
MRNA. Definition. noun. Abbreviated form for messenger ribonucleic acid, the type of RNA that codes for the chemical blueprint for a protein (during protein synthesis). Supplement. In prokaryotes, mRNA is produced by splicing a large primary transcript from a DNA sequence.
transfer RNA / tRNA. Transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) is a type of RNA molecule that helps decode a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a protein. tRNAs function at specific sites in the ribosome during translation, which is a process that synthesizes a protein from an mRNA molecule.
Confidence votes 65. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a form of RNA that codes for amino acids. During transcription a sequence of mRNA is made from a corresponding sequence of DNA. In a eukaryote, the mRNA is then processed and sent outside the nucleus to be translated by a ribosome in the cytoplasm.
The synthesis of mRNA, or messenger RNA, (ribonucleic acid), is called transcription. This process occurs inside cells for the purpose of building proteins that are essential for the bodyâ€™s energy and metabolic requirements.
