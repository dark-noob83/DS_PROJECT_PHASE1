Whatever the case may be, dabbing is popular and will soon transcend daily language usage, probably not so unlike twerking, the shmoney dance etc. Rich The Kid, another Quality Control/Migos affiliate, is also a dabbing enthusiast. When we had him by the office recently, he gave us a quick tutorial on how to properly dab-- so now everyone can get in on the fun, even Patrick. The sneeze method is key.

The DAB or Dabbing is a popular dance move, originating in Atlanta. There's been some debate as to who was the first person to start the dab craze, although Migos and PeeWee Longway have definitely received some of the credit. Recently, the origin of dabbing even became the cause of an argument on social media between Quality Control members, OG Maco and Migos.
