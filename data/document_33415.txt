Alright so the other day i went to go look at a horse I was interested in buying. well He si two years old and let me tell you he is the most trained 2 year old ive ever seen, he is more trained then my 12 year old mare. And Im absolutly in love with him. But I worry that his knees might not be closed up or that...
It's my understanding that a horse's knees close around age 2- 2 1/2. My gelding JUST turned 3. A couple days ago in fact. Will a horse's knees almost certainly be closed by that age?
On the average a racing horse should spend at least 6 months in training (by that time his knees will be closed), before we start to increase the speed from a working gallop, and at least 10 months before he runs his first race.
Most warmbloods start in their second year, about 30 months of age. Training for jumping with a rider should not start before the horse has at least one year of flat work, hence the minimum age of about 42 months. No horse should take part in a jumping competition before the age of five.
Regarding the age issue, I will be using the Lipizzaner and the English Thoroughbred for examples. The Lipizzaner is a late maturing horse; hence most of them should not start training before they are three-year-olds, usually at four but not later than four.
Basically the issue with the knees is you don't want to start riding a horse too strenuously until the knees close. For each breed it is different. Some close at 3, others, like drafts and WBs, can wait until 5 or so. If you put too much stress on the joints too soon, you can run into arthritis early.
Here's an overview of what you can expect when training and handling a two and three year old. Answer: For many horses this is the age at which a horse starts learning to be ridden or driven. By now, it should have good ground manners, stand for the farrier and load on a trailer.
