Answer by lauryn (194). The length of time it takes a women to get her period after giving birth varies from women to women. For many women it can take about 2 to 3 months before your period returns to normal. If you are nursing than this time frame will last even longer. It could take about 6 months on average.
If you're not breastfeeding, your period may start again in 6 to 8 weeks after giving birth. If you are breastfeeding, you may not start again for months. Some women don’t have a period again until they stop breastfeeding. It’s possible that you may ovulate (release an egg) before you get your period again.
