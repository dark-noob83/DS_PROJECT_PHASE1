Installed prices for PV systems in 2012 fell by a range of roughly $0.30 per Watt (W) to $0.90/W, or 6 to 14 percent, from the prior year, depending on the size of the system.
The report indicates that the median installed price of PV systems completed in 2012 was $5.30/W for residential and small commercial systems smaller than 10 kilowatts (kW) in size and was $4.60/W for commercial systems of 100 kW or more in size.

So is there such a phenomenon? The National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy has watched solar photovoltaic price trends since 1980. They’ve seen the price per Watt of solar modules (not counting installation) drop from $22 dollars in 1980 down to under $3 today.
• The decline in installed system prices since 2008 is largely attributable to module price. reductions, which fell by $2.7/W from 2008 through 2013 and represented 67% of the total. drop in installed prices for ≤10 kW systems over that period.
As a rough measure of this trend, the capacity-weighted average 17 installed price declined from $6.21/W for projects installed during 2004–2008 to $3.94/W for projects installed during 2009–2010, and to $3.42/W for projects installed in 2011.
