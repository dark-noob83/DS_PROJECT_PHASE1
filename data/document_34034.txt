So if your maintenance was 2000 calories, for example, you’d need to eat about 1,500 calories in order to lose fat. Now there is one exception to this guideline — if you are “underweight” and have a caloric maintenance of 1,500 or less, you will instead subtract 20% of that number to get your calorie deficit.
Athletes should decrease their total caloric intake by 500 calories per day to lose 1 pound in 1 week. The caloric deficit can be created from additional exercise, diet, or a combination of both. Remember to consider activity level when calculating caloric intake.
Since 1 pound = 3,500 calories, in order to lose 1 pound a week, you’d need to have a weekly calorie deficit of 3,500 calories, Kohn says. That means you’d need to eat 3,500 calories fewer than you’re using throughout the week.
For example: Assuming you are female, 5' 5, 170lbs at the start of August and would like to be 150lbs by Christmas, you would specify that you want to lose 20lbs in 5 months. The calculator will then give you your calories required on a week-to-week basis to reach your goal weight.
The number of calories you need to eat each day depends on several factors, including your age, size, height, sex, lifestyle, and overall general health. As an example, a physically active 6ft 2in male, aged 22 years, requires considerably more calories than a 5ft 2ins sedentary woman in her 70s.
To maintain weight, the chart below shows you your daily calorie limit. It's based on your age, activity level, and the BMI (body-mass index) of 21.5 for women and 22.5 for men. To lose weight -- about 1 pound a week -- reduce total calories in the chart by 500 a day. To gain weight, add 500 calories per day for each pound you want to gain per week.
To Lose Weight. To lose 1 pound a week, you need to cut 500 calories per day. You can do this by eating less, exercising more, or both. Try these strategies: 1  Cut 250 calories from your daily diet. 2  That’s about one 20-ounce regular soda. 3  Burn an extra 250 calories through physical activity.
