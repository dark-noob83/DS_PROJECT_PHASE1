A fractal is a natural phenomenon or a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern that displays at every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern.
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos.
Many things! But one amazing, characteristic aspect of fractals, is that they are infinite! A fractal is infinite in two distinct senses, the macro level, and the micro level. Fractals extend to infinitely large values of their co-ordinates, outwards in all directions from the center.
A Geometric pattern that is repeated at ever smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical geometry. Fractals are used especially in computer modeling of irregular patterns and structures in nature.
The most striking characteristic of fractals is their self-similarity, the way the whole resembles smaller parts of itself at different scales. This property reveals natural fractal structures all around us-the way a branch with small twigs can look like a larger branch, which looks similar to the entire tree.
Fractals are the geometry of the natural world, they describe the texture of reality! This insight was introduced by the Polish born French/American mathematician, Benoit Mandelbrot. In 1975 he coined the word ‘fractal’ as a way to describe shapes that are detailed at all levels. of scale.
