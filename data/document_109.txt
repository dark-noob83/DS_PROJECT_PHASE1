If you're currently making $100,000, and going to a two-year MBA program for $100,000 is going to land you making $100,000, that doesn't make sense, says von Tobel, who dropped out of Harvard Business School to start LearnVest.
How much a master’s degree costs depends on several factors. Length of the program is one factor. Most master’s degree programs can be completed in between one to two years. For most, 30 credits are required for graduation. The average cost of an MBA, for example, is $40,000. At most universities, this is what master’s degree graduates will pay. Some institutions have programs for less, and MBA programs at Harvard or Stanford could cost in excess of $120,000.
