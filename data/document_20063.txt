Sylvan, Huntington Learning Center and Kumon operate tutoring centers across the United States. While these centers may charge over $50 per hour for students to attend, their tutors get a relatively lower wage than that. Huntington is an accredited tutoring center, which means they can only hire tutors with teaching certificates. As a result, Huntington tutors can earn hourly wages between $11 and $13 for regular tutors, and $15 to $18 per hour for SAT and ACT tutors. Kumon, like Sylvan, does not require their teachers to have teaching certificates

Answers. Best Answer: It really depends on the center that you are applying to. The center I work at (and most centers) only offer minimum wage. As you gain experience and the longer you stay, the better a chance you have for a raise. It also depends on what job you are applying for. At most centers, an assistant just grades homework and classwork. Students complete worksheets and therefore you will never be needed for tutoring.
