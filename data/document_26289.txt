No, it forms only ionic bonds. Covalent bonds are only formed between non-metals, although a few metals, such as Aluminum, can also form covalent bonds with non-metals. 3 people found this useful.

A covalent bond forming H 2 (right) where two hydrogen atoms share the two electrons. A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. 
COVALENT BONDS. Unlike ionic bonds, covalent bonds are often formed between atoms where one of the atoms cannot easily attain a noble gas electron shell configuration through the loss or gain of one or two electrons. In such cases, it is easier to ‘share’ valence electrons. 
About Covalent and Ionic Bonds. The covalent bond is formed when two atoms are able to share electrons whereas the ionic bond is formed when the sharing is so unequal that an electron from atom A is completely lost to atom B, resulting in a pair of ions. Each atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons. 
Covalent bonds form when two nonmetals share an electron. Hi Covalent bonds occur when nonmetal elements have a unstable outermost shell know as the valence electrons. The two non-metal either give up of gain electrons and then live with the other element or elements outer shell. A polar covalent bond is formed when 2 atoms are sharing the same electron unequally. It occurs because one of the atoms has a stronger affinity for electrons that the other. …. 24 people found this useful. 1  The Periodic Table of Elements Life is sustained by a number of chemical elements.
Bond strength. A single bond is a shared pair of electrons that is attracted to both nuclei of the bonded atoms. The bonding electrons draw the atoms closer together but as the atoms get very close they experience repulsive forces from the other non-bonding electrons and from the two nuclei themselves.
