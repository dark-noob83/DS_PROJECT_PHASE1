Kennecott produces annually 250,000 tons of copper, 350,000 ounces of gold, 2.5 million ounces of silver, and 8 million pounds of molybdenum. It is considered among the top copper producers in the world and by many as the most efficient. 
In 1944 Utah gold amounted to 34.5 percent of the U.S. total. In 1983, Utah mines produced 238,459 troy ounces of gold valued at $101,107,000 and amounting to 12.2 percent of the total U.S. production. Gold production dropped sharply in 1985, the last year for which data is currently available.

Yellow, green and red golds are produced by alloying gold with copper and silver in different proportions. The gold content of jewellery is expressed as a number of carats-pure gold is said to be 24 carat gold; 18 carat gold contains 18/24 or 75% pure gold. 
While the first metal mining was for gold and silver, the real mineral wealth of Montana was found it its copper mines around Butte. Butte began as a mining town in the 19th century in the Silver Bow Creek Valley, a natural bowl sitting high in the Rockies straddling the Continental Divide. Mining in Montana began in 1864, when the glint of gold in a prospectorâ€™s pan attracted hundreds to the banks of Silver Bow Creek.Mining first centered around Bannack and Virginia City and the miners quickly spread out around the territory seeking new gold fields.
The mining sector represented 6.7 percent of GDP in 1992, as compared with 8.9 percent in 1985. In 1991, copper exports represented 30 percent of the total value of exports, a substantial decline with respect to the 1960s, when it represented almost 80 percent of total exports. Mining exports in general accounted for about 48 percent of total exports in 1991. The mining sector in Chile is one of the pillars of Chilean economy and copper exports alone stands for more than one third of government income. Most mining in Chile is concentrated to the Norte Grande region spanning most of the Atacama Desert. Mining products of Chile includes copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, iron and coal
In 2014, copper mining produced about 15 metric tons of gold, worth $600 million, which represented 7% of US gold production. Other byproducts of the copper extraction process included silver, and minor amounts of rhenium and platinum-group metals. Sulfuric acid is recovered at copper smelters. Copper mining activity increased in the early 2000s because of increased price: the price increased from an average of $0.76 per pound for the year 2002, to $3.02 per pound for 2007.
Copper mining in the United States has been a major industry since the rise of the northern Michigan copper district in the 1840s. In 2014 the United States produced 1.37 million metric tonnes of copper, worth $9.7 billion, making it the world's fourth largest copper producer, after Chile, China, and Peru. Copper was produced from 27 mines in the US. Copper mining activity increased in the early 2000s because of increased price: the price increased from an average of $0.76 per pound for the year 2002, to $3.02 per pound for 2007.
