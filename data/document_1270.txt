Aspirin is a salicylate (sa-LIS-il-ate) that reduces substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation. Aspirin is also a fever reducer. Carisoprodol is a muscle relaxer that works by blocking pain sensations between the nerves and the brain. Codeine is an opioid pain medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Aspirin, carisoprodol, and codeine is a combination medicine used together with rest and physical therapy to treat pain, muscle spasm, and other symptoms related to injuries and other painful muscular conditions.
Carisoprodol is a skeletal muscle relaxant. It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relax muscles. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used for pain and fever. Codeine is a narcotic analgesic (pain medicine) that acts on the CNS to relieve pain. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

Do not use it if you had an allergic reaction to carisoprodol, codeine, aspirin, or meprobamate, you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or you have a history of bleeding problems, porphyria, or stomach or bowel problems (such as blockage, perforation) caused by aspirin.
