Amazon says its data shows if you priced an e-book at $14.99 and would have sold $100,000 of it at that price, you’d sell $179,000 of that same e-book if you cut the price to $9.99. Lower prices greatly expand the audience of potential buyers. If you’re thinking a 50-page e-book about gardening is worth $20, but everyone else sells their similar-length e-books for $2.99, you’re probably not going to see a ton of sales. If you’re only selling off your own website, you might have more leeway to price without regard to market competition.
If uploading your e-book on to Kindle is relatively simple, deciding how much to charge for it is anything but. I have spent the last few days perusing the web for advice on the issue and much of it appears to be conflicting. Therefore, I think self-published authors should charge between $0.99 and $3.99 for their books. With this in mind, lets return to one of our earlier questions: Although the maths above suggests Model 2 is the better option, experience suggests otherwise.
During the week I’m writing this, 21 books were selling for just 99¢. Others were priced at $4.98, $7.59, and $8.82. The most expensive single book, at $16.99, was Dick Cheney’s memoir. There is none of the clarity of iTunes in its early years, when the price of music tracks was fixed at 99¢. If you sell 1,000 books at $2.99, then you’ll make $2,090. If you are contemplating a price drop to $0.99, then you’ll have to sell 5,972 books to make the same net royalties you did when it was priced at $2.99.
If you used Model 1 and charged $0.99 for your book you would make $0.35 cents for every book you sold. This means you would need to sell 28,571 books in a year to reach your target. If instead you used Model 2 and charged $2.99 for your book you would make $2.10 for every book you sold. Therefore, I think self-published authors should charge between $0.99 and $3.99 for their books. With this in mind, lets return to one of our earlier questions: Although the maths above suggests Model 2 is the better option, experience suggests otherwise.
Amazon initially charged a little over $15 for a version for its Kindle reading device, and readers revolted. Several posted reviews objecting that the electronic edition of the book wasn’t selling for $9.99, the price Amazon has promoted as its target for the majority of e-books in the Kindle store. Hundreds more have joined an informal boycott of digital books priced at more than $9.99.
Think about percentages. One of the biggest factors to consider in pricing your eBook is the percentage of sales you’ll receive from the retailers. Amazon pays out a royalty of 70% on all Kindle titles priced between $2.99 to $9.99. For eBooks priced below $2.99 and above $9.99, Amazon pays out only 35%. Most of the other eBook retailers have similar price banding. If you sell 1,000 books at $2.99, then you’ll make $2,090. If you are contemplating a price drop to $0.99, then you’ll have to sell 5,972 books to make the same net royalties you did when it was priced at $2.99.
It's important to understand, though, that things don't have inherent value, they only have perceived value. Picking a price for an e-book can be a real headache. There are e-books out there that cost as little as 0.50$, and there are also e-books out there that cost as much as 6,232$ . How are you supposed to decide what you should charge for your ebook when the range of possible prices are so large? 
Once the price is set, authors should make use of promotions to boost revenue. For a Kindle e-book priced at $7.99, run a Kindle Countdown Deal for $4.99. If you are trying to sell it at $4.99, run a promotion at $2.99. As with a book giveaway, these sales should be advertised as widely as possible. Authors will want to begin at a price under $10 if possible, and test out different pricepoints with short-term promotions. An added motivator for pricing at this level is that retailers will often pay higher royalties for e-books priced between $2.99 and $9.99.
They can charge anywhere between $0.99 and $200. Model 2: 70%. Under this alternative model, the author must set the price of the book between $2.99 and $9.99. There is also a delivery charge under this second model, which reduces the amount earned per book to around 68%. Therefore, I think self-published authors should charge between $0.99 and $3.99 for their books. With this in mind, lets return to one of our earlier questions: Although the maths above suggests Model 2 is the better option, experience suggests otherwise.
There are two basic Royalty price points you should be aware of when pricing your Kindle book. Books priced between $2.99 and $9.99 will earn you 70% royalty whereas any other price will awards you only 35% of the list price. It is easy to see that it makes the most sense to go for the 70% royalty. It is not reasonable to attempt to sell a 300 page book for 10-cents a page since a $30 book is way and beyond the typical price of $9.99 for a Kindle book. I believe the biggest opportunity in publishing articles is the price point of $2.99 because you royalties more than double once you reach that price threshold.
