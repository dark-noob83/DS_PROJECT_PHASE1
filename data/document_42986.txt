Sugar maples provide stunning fall color in bright shades of yellow, orange and red. The deciduous sugar maple tree reaches up to 100 feet high with a spread of 50 feet and lives up to 400 years. A native to Eastern North America, the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) grows in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 4 through 8. This variety of maple provides the sap for making maple syrup. Stratify the sugar maple seed using your refrigerator or other cold location with temperatures between 33 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave the seed to stratify for up to 90 days, checking weekly for germination.
Sugar maple trees average about 1 foot of height growth and 0.2 inch of diameter growth annually for the first 30 to 40 years. Hence a 30-year-old tree might be 6 to 8 inches in diameter and 30 to 35 feet in height. After about 140 to 150 years, height growth ceases and radial growth slows greatly. Thus average growing seasons are from 80 to 260 days. Soils Sugar maple can survive in a wide variety of soil types, but for maximum tree growth and sap production, soils should be deep, moist, and well drained with medium or fine textures.
The Japanese red maple (Acer palmatum var. atropurpureum) possesses a slow-to-medium rate of growth and typically achieves a maximum height of 15 to 25 feet. The amount of time necessary for this species to grow to maturity will range from seven to 10 years. The red maple (Acer rubrum) grows to between 40 and 60 feet in height at a rate of medium-to-fast. Therefore, the tree will require between 20 and 30 years to spread upward to its maximum height.

Sugar Maple. The sugar maple tree (Acer saccharum) is considered to possess a slow-to-medium rate of growth. According to the Arbor Day Foundation, slow growth denotes a tree that grows less than 13 inches annually, while medium growth indicates growth between 13 and 24 inches each year. The red maple (Acer rubrum) grows to between 40 and 60 feet in height at a rate of medium-to-fast. Therefore, the tree will require between 20 and 30 years to spread upward to its maximum height.
The length of time that a maple tree requires to grow is dependent on the particular species. Red maple, sugar maple, Japanese red maple--and cultivars like the October Glory maple--all possess a different maximum height potential and rate of growth. The red maple (Acer rubrum) grows to between 40 and 60 feet in height at a rate of medium-to-fast. Therefore, the tree will require between 20 and 30 years to spread upward to its maximum height.
Description Under optimal growing conditions, sugar maple can attain heights in excess of 100 feet. The largest reported individual was found near Bethany, West Virginia; it had a diameter of 5.6 feet, a crown spread of 75 feet, and a height of 110 feet. Thus average growing seasons are from 80 to 260 days. Soils Sugar maple can survive in a wide variety of soil types, but for maximum tree growth and sap production, soils should be deep, moist, and well drained with medium or fine textures.
