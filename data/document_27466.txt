The human range is commonly given as 20 to 20,000 Hz, though there is considerable variation between individuals, especially at high frequencies, and a gradual loss of sensitivity to higher frequencies with age is considered normal. Sensitivity also varies with frequency, as shown by equal-loudness contours. The commonly stated range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Under ideal laboratory conditions, humans can hear sound as low as 12 Hz. Humans are most sensitive to (i.e. able to discern at lowest intensity) frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 Hz.
It ismeasured in decibels (dB or dB HL). The Audiogram -100102030405060708090100110120130 decibels Hearing Level 125 250 500 1000 2000 4000 8000 Frequency (Hz) Frequency is measured by the number of wavesor cycles that a sound makes in a second. Weuse Hertz (Hz) to measure cycles per second(cps). Another word for frequency is pitch.
When you notice a difference between loud sounds and quiet ones, your ears are perceiving changes in sound pressure level. Intensity (or volume) is measured in decibels (dB). Zero (0) dB is the softest sound that can be heard. Normal conversation is around 40dB to 60dB, a whisper around 30dB. A rock concert can average between 110 and 120 dB. 
The typical range of human hearing for a child is approximately 20 Hz to 20 KHz, but very few of us over 18 years of age can hear 20 kHz, I do a lot of noise induced hearing loss training and run experiments with guys in the class. Most are lucky to still be playing above about 14 kHz and several below that. But they are older and have been exposed to a working life in a noisy environment. So yeah, it is widely accepted that the range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
For humans, normal hearing is between −10 dB(HL) and 15 dB(HL) , although 0 dB from 250 Hz to 8 kHz is deemed to be 'average' normal hearing. Hearing thresholds of humans and other mammals can be found by using behavioural hearing tests or physiological tests. They are not the same as equal-loudness contours, which are a set of curves representing equal loudness at different levels, as well as at the threshold of hearing, in absolute terms measured in dB SPL (sound pressure level).
Loudness or amplitude is measured in decibels and it is marked or notated using dB to designate decibels. Keeping in mind that at 85 dB hearing loss can begin, normal everyday conversation is at approximately 70 dB and loud talking is about 90 dB. This is one of the reasons why loud and boisterous people bother us so much. Loudness or Amplitude – Science, specifically audiology, knows that the difference between the threshold of human hearing (0 dB) and the threshold of pain (120 dB) and hearing loss occurs at approximately 120 decibels.
The hearing level is quantified relative to 'normal' hearing in decibels (dB), with higher numbers of dB indicating worse hearing. Hearing loss can be graded as follows: 1  Normal hearing: less than 25 dB in adults and 15 dB in children. 2  Mild hearing loss: 25-39 dB. 3  Moderate hearing loss: 40-69 dB. 4  Severe hearing loss: 70-94 dB.
Every increase of 10 decibels (10 dB) sounds twice as loud. 20 dB sounds twice as loud as 10 dB... 40 dB sounds twice as loud as 30 dB and 8 times as loud as 10 dB (10 to 20 to 30 to 40 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8). Normal hearing ranges from 0 to 20 dB in all frequencies. From here on, the assumption is that you have a sensorineural hearing loss (that you have nerve damage to the inner ear). 
Thresholds between -10 and +20 dB HL are considered in the normal range, while thresholds above 20 dB HL are considered diagnostic for mild, moderate, severe or profound hearing loss, as shown here: Particular causes of hearing loss will be show up in the clinical audiogram in characteristic ways. Clinical Audiograms and Hearing Level (dB HL). Clinicians measure sound intensity in dB HL (decibels Hearing Level) , i.e. dB relative to the quietest sounds that a young healthy individual ought to be able to hear.
The Y axis represents intensity measured in decibels and the X axis represents frequency measured in Hertz. The threshold of hearing is plotted relative to a standardised curve that represents 'normal' hearing, in dB(HL). They are not the same as equal-loudness contours, which are a set of curves representing equal loudness at different levels, as well as at the threshold of hearing, in absolute terms measured in dB SPL (sound pressure level).
