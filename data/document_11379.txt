The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and all of the nerves that connect these organs with the rest of the body. Together, these organs are responsible for the control of the body and communication among its parts.
• Neurons = Nerve cells The Nervous System is Composed of Two Parts • Central Nervous System – Consists of all neurons (nerve cells) located in the brain and spinal cord • Peripheral Nervous System – Consists of all neurons (nerve cells) located outside the brain and spinal cord.
The central nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord, which is a bundle of nerves that is contained within the vertebral column.
1 The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. 2  The peripheral nervous system is made up of the nerve fibers that branch off from the spinal cord and extend to all parts of the body, including the neck and arms, torso, legs, skeletal muscles and internal organs.
The nervous system consists of two main parts: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system: 1  The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord.
Overview. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. The brain functions to receive nerve impulses from the spinal cord and cranial nerves. The spinal cord contains the nerves that carry messages between the brain and the body.
The nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It is essentially the body’s electrical wiring. Structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
The central nervous system is composed of the brain and the spinal cord. Everything else is classed as the Peripheral nervous system.
