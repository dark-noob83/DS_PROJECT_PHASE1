synthetic oil is a lubricant consisting of chemical compounds that are artificially made synthesized synthetic lubricants can be manufactured using chemically modified petroleum components rather than whole crude oil but can also be synthesized from other raw materials 
most experts agree that the main benefit of using synthetic oil is the convenience of longer oil change intervals while conventional non synthetic oil is recommended to be changed every 3000 miles you can typically go 5000 7500 miles on synthetic without worry and though synthetic is much more expensive it s worth the extra cost for drivers that dont want to change their oil as frequently good old german technology came up with turning dinosaur oil into synthetic oil and exxon mobil is continuing in that fine tradition and i d like to know wha
every tv commercial for synthetic motor oil says theirs is the best most of the time however they offer vague reasons why often they don t offer and real proof at all relying on fluffy slogans such as nothing outperforms mobil 1 or it s liguid engineering synthetic motor oils are becoming more and more popular by now most people know that synthetic oil far outperforms conventional oil just a few years ago there were only a handful of synthetic motor oils available
conventional vs oil whether synthetic or petroleum based consists of molecular chains of hydrogen and carbon atoms referred to as hydrocarbons petroleum crude oil is a thick highly flammable dark brown or greenish liquid with high energy densities 
first off synthetic oil is better than conventional oil when it comes to its form and function conventional oil could never stand up to synthetic when it comes to longevity and ability to handle extreme high temperatures without breaking down but all this advanced technology doesn t come cheap 
technically synthetic oil originates as traditional mineral based motor oil what separates the two is the level of advanced engineering refinement and criteria that goes into this modern engine lubricant 
on vehicles with high mileage it is not recommended to use full synthetic oil because it is thin and very free flowing and use of it does more often than not result in internal oil combustion i used full synthetic oil in a plymouth neon 
synthetic oil is a product that contains additional chemical ingredients that are not present in crude oil these additional ingredients are synthesized or created artificially and added to petroleum as a means of meeting specific needs for lubrication 
motor oil synthetic vs blend oil 101 full synthetic motor oil full synthetic motor oil contains base oil that is man made the synthesis processes through which the oil is made improve key performance attributes and enable improvements to wear protection extreme temperature performance and deposit control part synthetic motor oil is designed to have some of the benefits of a full synthetic but at a lower cost the number of oems original equipment manufacturers whose specifications require the use of full synthetic or part synthetic engine oils began increasing several years ago
motor oil is one of the most important fluids in your vehicle the purpose of motor oil is to reduce friction and keep a vehicle s engine clean and corrosion free another critical function is to buffer heat from moving parts in the engine most motor oils are manufactured from petroleum based crude oil which is processed into motor oil synthetic motor oils have a higher tolerance to heat and aging the performance characteristics of these synthetic lubricants can be custom designed to exceed the performance limits of petroleum based motor oils and their use can possibly increase the life of your engine
