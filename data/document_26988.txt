Public Variables. 1  Create a variable in the Command window. 2  Any variable created in the Command window is automatically declared public. 3  For example, from the Command window, type X=1000. 4  The variable X is now public to all applications. 5  Within a program, declare a variable as public by using the PUBLIC command. 1 Create a variable in the Command window. 2  Any variable created in the Command window is automatically declared public. 3  For example, from the Command window, type X=1000. 4  The variable X is now public to all applications.
When executing such a program, Visual FoxPro creates a list that assigns each variable in the code to the name table index. Internally, FoxPro calls a function that receives the index as parameter and returns a filled out structure containing the value. As you can see the length of the variable name is not relevant. The Name Table Index (NTI). In Visual FoxPro we can name various items. To those items, Visual FoxPro assigns something called a name. These items are variables (not properties), array names, procedures, functions, aliases of tables, field names and objects (not classes).
To manipulate data-and display-calculated results in a report, you can use report variables. Using report variables, you can calculate values and then use those values to calculate subsequent values. To define a report variable. 1  Open or create a report. 2  From the Report menu, choose Variables. 3  In the Report Variables dialog box, select the Variables box and type a name for the variable. 4  In the Value to store box, type a field name or any other expression
Variables in FoxPro can store values of any data type. However, as Visual FoxPro is written in C itself, FoxPro variables, as well, have to be stored in a C format at some point. Visual FoxPro stores variables in a C structure. The Name Table Index (NTI). In Visual FoxPro we can name various items. To those items, Visual FoxPro assigns something called a name. These items are variables (not properties), array names, procedures, functions, aliases of tables, field names and objects (not classes).
SUMMARY. Ths article describes how variables are defined (declared) in FoxPro. A variable in FoxPro can have one of three attributes: Public, Private, or Hidden. 1 Create a variable in the Command window. 2  Any variable created in the Command window is automatically declared public. 3  For example, from the Command window, type X=1000. 4  The variable X is now public to all applications. 5  Within a program, declare a variable as public by using the PUBLIC command
A few things that are important to remember when using memory variable files: 1  All memory variables that are stored in the .MEM file, regardless of being declared PUBLIC or PRIVATE, are treated as PRIVATE variables if they are restored in a program unless the ADDITIVE clause is added to the RESTORE FROM command. Expand all | Collapse all. Memory variable files are a way to store the status of memory variables that are currently stored in memory and use them later in the same program or in another session of FoxPro. The commands used when creating and using .MEM files are as follows: and. A few things that are important to remember when using memory ...
ISDIGIT(cExpression) Parameters cExpression Specifies the character expression that ISDIGIT() tests. Any characters after the first character in cExpression are ignored. I'm looking for a Visual FoxPro function which is similar to the PHP function is_numeric() . I have found this, but I could not use VARTYPE or TYPE because the variable is always a character string which contains digits only. I found ISDIGIT() function, but the manual says that it only checks the first character. FoxPro functions which determine if a variable is a character string or a numeric string. up vote 1 down vote favorite. Determines whether the leftmost character of the specified character expression is a digit (0 through 9).
