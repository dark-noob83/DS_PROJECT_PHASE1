This has a major influence on Mars’ climate. While the average temperature on Mars is about 218° K (-55° C, -67° F), Martian surface temperatures range widely from as little as 140° K (-133° C, -207° F) at the winter pole to almost 300° K (27° C, 80° F) on the dayside during summer. The average pressure on the surface of Mars is only about 7 millibars (less than 1% of Earth’s), but it varies greatly with altitude from almost 9 millibars in the deepest basins to about 1 millibar at the top of Olympus Mons.
Conditions on Mars: Temperatures, seasons, climate By: Elisabeth Ambrose The average surface temperature on Mars ranges from 180 to 270 K, or –93 degrees C to–3 degrees C -135 (degrees F to 26 degrees F). 
The temperature on Mars may reach a high of about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) at noon, at the equator in the summer, or a low of about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius) at the poles. Air Pressure: A barometer is used to measure air pressure. The average air pressure on Earth is 29.92 inches of mercury (or 1,013 millibars). This is more than 100 times Mars' average of 0.224 inches of mercury (7.5
According to NASA, the average temperature on Earth is 57 degrees Fahrenheit -- 138 degrees above Mars' average of -81 degrees. 
Differing in situ values have been reported for the average temperature on Mars, with a common value being −55 °C (218 K; −67 °F). Surface temperatures may reach a high of about 20 °C (293 K; 68 °F) at noon, at the equator, and a low of about −153 °C (120 K; −243 °F) at the poles. Mars' atmosphere has a scale height of approximately 11 km (36,000 ft), 60% greater than that on Earth. The climate is of considerable relevance to the question of whether life is or was present on the planet.
Mars's atmosphere is about 100 times thinner than Earth's. Without a thermal blanket, Mars can't retain any heat energy. On average, the temperature on Mars is about minus 80 degrees F (minus 60 degrees C). In winter, near the poles temperatures can get down to minus 195 degrees F (minus 125 degrees C). A summer day on Mars may get up to 70 degrees F (20 degrees C) near the equator, but at night the temperature can plummet to about minus 100 degrees F (minus 73 C).
This has a major influence on Mars' climate. While the average temperature on Mars is about 218 K (-55 C, -67 F), Martian surface temperatures range widely from as little as 140 K (-133 C, -207 F) at the winter pole to almost 300 K (27 C, 80 F) on the day side during summer. The surface of Mars is therefore much colder than the Earth would be at that distance from the Sun. Mars has a very thin atmosphere composed mostly of the tiny amount of remaining carbon dioxide (95.3%) plus nitrogen (2.7%), argon (1.6%) and traces of oxygen (0.15%) and water (0.03%).
Mars is, by our standards, a freezing planet. The average surface temperature is minus 20 to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, while average high altitude temperatures are below minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit. According to NASA, Mars' elliptical orbit causes temperature to vary wildly according to location, season and time of day. Mars is characterized by profound temperature variations. Around the equator during summer months, the temperature can reach up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The poles, however, experience lows of minus 225 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures are much lower at higher altitudes than at surface level.
But Mars is a cold planet now; the average recorded temperature on Mars is -63° C (-81° F) with a maximum temperature of 20° C (68° F) and a minimum of -140° C (-220° F). The first spacecraft to visit Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965. Several others followed including the two Viking landers in 1976. The average pressure on the surface of Mars is only about 7 millibars (less than 1% of Earth’s), but it varies greatly with altitude from almost 9 millibars in the deepest basins to about 1 millibar at the top of Olympus Mons.
