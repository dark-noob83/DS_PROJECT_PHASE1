Campylobacter causes food poisoning. Two species of campylobacter, C. jejuni and C. coli, cause most infections. The bacteria live in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals including livestock and pets such as dogs and cats. People often get C. jejuni and C. coli from: 1  raw or undercooked meat, especially poultry
Campylobacter is a notifiable disease – this means the local public health team may need to contact you and help trace the source of infection to reduce the risk to others of a large outbreak. See the Ministry of Health's schedule of notifiable diseases. Usually people can go back to work and children can return to early childhood centres and school if they have been free of symptoms for 24 hours. However, as campylobacter infection is a notifiable disease (see diagnosis below) you will need to check with your doctor first.
Records of all confirmed cases of Campylobacter infection with a notification receive date between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2007 inclusive were extracted from the Victorian Government Department of Health Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance database for descriptive analysis. An evaluation of the system was undertaken to assess performance against its objectives, identify areas requiring improvement and inform a decision of whether Campylobacter infection should remain a notifiable infectious disease.
Campylobacter is a common foodborne illness caused by a bacteria called Campylobacter. 1  Campylobacter bacteria are found in the gut of birds (especially poultry) and animals such as cattle, sheep, cats and dogs. 2  The most common way to become infected is by eating raw or undercooked chicken or other poultry. Usually people can go back to work and children can return to early childhood centres and school if they have been free of symptoms for 24 hours. However, as campylobacter infection is a notifiable disease (see diagnosis below) you will need to check with your doctor first.

‘Notification of infectious diseases’ is the term used to refer to the statutory duties for reporting notifiable diseases in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. Registered medical practitioners: report notifiable diseases. Registered medical practitioners (. ) have a statutory duty to notify the ‘proper officer’ at their local council or local health protection team (. ) of suspected cases of certain infectious diseases.
Contents. Public Health England (. ) aims to detect possible outbreaks of disease and epidemics as rapidly as possible. Accuracy of diagnosis is secondary, and since 1968 clinical suspicion of a notifiable infection is all that’s required. Registered medical practitioners: report notifiable diseases. Registered medical practitioners (. ) have a statutory duty to notify the ‘proper officer’ at their local council or local health protection team (. ) of suspected cases of certain infectious diseases.
Clinical features. Campylobacter infection may be subclinical or cause disease of variable severity. C. jejuni infection typically results in abdominal pain, fever and diarrhoea which may be mucopurulent or bloody. Symptoms usually last two to five days. Public health significance & occurrence. Campylobacter infections are now the most commonly notified of the enteric pathogens in Victoria and over 14 900 cases were reported Australia-wide in 2003 (Communicable Diseases Network Australia – National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System).
The objectives of Campylobacter infection surveillance in Victoria are to monitor the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection, identify outbreaks, initiate control and prevention actions, educate the public in disease prevention, evaluate control and prevention measures, and plan services and priority setting. An evaluation of the system was undertaken to assess performance against its objectives, identify areas requiring improvement and inform a decision of whether Campylobacter infection should remain a notifiable infectious disease.
7. This disease is notifiable in the UK (as a cause of food poisoning), see NOIDs article for more detail. Campylobacteriosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Campylobacter and is the most common reported bacterial cause of infectious intestinal disease in England and Wales. Two species are responsible for most cases of enteric campylobacteriosis: Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. They both produce a similar illness. Duration of shedding is 0-3 weeks; the average is 15 days. Untreated duration is 4 weeks.
