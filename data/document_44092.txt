Last fiscal year, Harris County paid jurors $193,055 for their service beyond the first day, according to the district clerk's office. That office, in a document filed with the court's meeting agenda, recommends keeping the stipend the same or eliminating it.
Updated 10:40 pm, Monday, September 12, 2011. Jury duty won't make you rich, but even the modest daily stipend trial jurors are paid appears likely to fall this month, another casualty of state budget cuts. Trial jurors get $6 from Harris County for their first day of service. For each day served after that, they get $40 - $34 from the state and $6 from the county. The state budget passed earlier this year will see Texas' contribution drop from $34 to $28 per day on Sept. 28.
The 2011 law allowed counties not to pay jurors $6 a day for service in addition to the pay provided by the state. Harris County Commissioners Court opted not to pay $6 starting in 2011 as a cost-cutting measure. So jury pay went from $40 to $28 in 2011. The state added $2 more in September 2012, bringing it to $30. Jury pay now rises to $40 a day, with $34 coming from the state and $6 from the county.
When Harris County paid each juror $12.50 a day, the county was shouldering the burden alone. Now, the county is responsible for only $6 per juror, per day. That's what jurors receive on the first day, and then the raise kicks in.
