If arthritis is causing your clicking you may also notice stiffness in the joint or inflammation in the area or in other joints. You may also notice joint erythema or bursitis. An ACL tear and MCL tear. An ACL tear can cause the knee to click as the leg begins to sit in a different location than it normally would. An MCL tear can cause a similar situation. Both injuries cause chronic pain and will cause the knee to be stiff and tender. This is often caused by an injury or stress on the tibia, or the lower bone in your leg which protects our kneecap. If any of these bones come out of line, the knee may click when it is bent. You may also suffer runner's knee if the IT band which stabilizes the kneecap or your quad muscles are overworked.
1 Meniscus tears. 2  The meniscus is a rubbery C-shaped disc that cushions your knee and acts as a shock-absorber. 3  It also helps spread weight evenly so your bones don’t rub together. 4  Tears to the meniscus are often caused by sudden twisting or other things you might do while playing sports. 1 Typically the knee will respond to this injury by swelling or catching. 2  Cartilage in your knee can also wear thin or break down, commonly known as arthritis. 3  Some people say it feels like their knees are grinding when they move. 4  Osteoarthritis is the most common kind of
3. Severe damage to the meniscus and shock absorber: The meniscus is a lubricator between the bones of your knee, and if damaged and not healed properly, the balance of your knee is thrown off and can also cause the knee to turn when you put force on it—this can cause the knee to develop a clicking sound. The knees can become inflamed and align differently, which will cause a clicking sound. 5. ACL tear and MCL tear: Both tears will cause the knee to click; the tears can also lead to chronic pain, knee stiffness, and tenderness.
If you have cracking or popping that does cause pain or swelling, though, see a doctor.

Knee pain and popping is a common problem and can be caused by a number of factors. Another term commonly used for popping in the knee is Crepitus, which essentially means a noisy joint, whether it be popping, cracking or snapping. Popping noises in the knee usually fall into one of three categories: Knee Popping with an Injury. If there is a loud pop at the time of injury it usually indicates a ligament injury. The two most common ligaments that produce knee pain and popping when they are injured are the ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) and the MCL (Medial Collateral Ligament).
There are various reasons why you can experience knee clicking. Below are some of the most common causes: 1. Unnecessary tissue around the knee: After a serious injury to the knee, if it is not treated or if it does not heal properly, you can develop unnecessary tissue or plica around the knee. The knees can become inflamed and align differently, which will cause a clicking sound. 5. ACL tear and MCL tear: Both tears will cause the knee to click; the tears can also lead to chronic pain, knee stiffness, and tenderness.
Knee problems are common among all age groups. A clicking sound in the knee may indicate one of several issues. Overuse of the knee may irritate the bands of synovial tissue in the knee, called plicae, which can cause plica syndrome and clicking. Clicking may also indicate a tear in the meniscus cartilage on the sides of the knee or runner's knee, where clicking happens when you straighten the knee. So if your knee is clicking, see a doctor and perform exercises to correct weak or tight muscles. Weak muscles in the thighs contribute to knee instability and clicking. Strengthening the quadriceps on the front of the thigh and hamstrings on the rear give the knee support. Also, stretching exercises for the iliotibilal -- or IT -- band relieve tension that could be pulling the knee to the side.
4. Arthritis: Arthritis in your legs can spread to the knees. The knees can become inflamed and align differently, which will cause a clicking sound. 5. ACL tear and MCL tear: Both tears will cause the knee to click; the tears can also lead to chronic pain, knee stiffness, and tenderness.
And remember, if your knee clicks but it doesn’t cause you any pain, don’t worry. It is usually entirely normal and nothing to worry about. You may find that strengthening your leg muscles actually eliminates the noise – see the strengthening exercises section for ideas on where to start. Knee Popping with an Injury.
