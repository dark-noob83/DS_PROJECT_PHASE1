How stomach ulcers heal is related to their cause. Stomach ulcers may be caused by a number of things, including: 1  H. pylori, bacteria that exists in the stomachs of nearly half of the worldâ€™s population.
Ulcers that don't heal within 1 to 3 months of starting treatment are called Refractory Ulcers. Why Ulcers don't heal. There are many reasons why stomach ulcers don't heal. The number 1 reason is because people don't take their medications properly.
If you have an ulcer, you should be tested for H. pylori, and if found to be infected, you should be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are the new cure for ulcers; therapy is 1-2 weeks of one or two antibiotics and a medicine that will reduce the acid in the stomach. This treatment is a dramatic medical advance because eliminating H. pylori with antibiotics means that there is a greater than 90% chance that the ulcer can be cured for good.
With appropriate treatment from both a medication and the patient, stomach ulcers usually heal within three months. Depending on the severity of the sore (size and depth), it can take several months to completely heal a stomach ulcer if treatment is successful. Successful treatment includes the prevention of stomach ulcers becoming worse, too.
One way to treat ulcers is to get rid of the H. pylori bacteria. Treatment may also be aimed at lowering the amount of acid that your stomach makes, neutralizing the acid and protecting the injured area so it can heal.
Treatment to get rid of H. pylori usually takes about 2 to 3 weeks. Your doctor may want you to take medicine that lowers the stomach acid for up to 8 weeks. Most ulcers heal within this time.
Healing Times Based on Cause and Treatment. For those who suffer stomach ulcers as a result of h. pylori, a course of antibiotics for a period of two weeks is often the standard time for ridding the body of the bacteria.
