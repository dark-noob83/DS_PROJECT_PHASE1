The Renewable Energy degree integrates the study of engineering, technology, science, and business to prepare graduates to design, implement, and manage renewable energy systems and similar technologies. Students learn to evaluate renewable resources, complete site assessments, design systems, and model performance.
About the Program. Renewable energy is a burgeoning industry, especially in Oregon, where public and private programs and incentives fuel rapid growth. Oregon Institute of Technology has long been an advocate and user of sustainable energy in the region.
The UMass Lowell Renewable Energy Engineering program offers an M.S. or Ph.D in Energy Engineering, as well as a graduate certificate and a minor for undergraduate students.
The Energy Engineering major interweaves the fundamental of classical and modern physics, chemistry, and mathematics with the energy engineering applications. A great strength of the major is its flexibility.
The Electrical Engineering & Renewable Energy (EERE) department at Oregon Tech offers the following programs at two of the Oregon Tech campuses, the Klamath Falls campus in southern Oregon, and the Wilsonville campus, on the south end of the Portland metro area:
Essential Information. Renewable energy engineers focus their efforts on developing new means for energy extraction and designing energy-efficient machinery. The sector for green jobs is continually growing, so students getting a degree in this field can expect to see a lot of job opportunities after graduation.
Renewable energy focuses on the production, transmission and storage of sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar power, geothermal, hydropower and biomass.
