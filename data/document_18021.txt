Inground vs. Above Ground Pool Costs. The biggest determining factor in the cost of your swimming pool will be whether you choose an inground or above ground option. On average, the cost of installing a new swimming pool runs between $14,961 and $21,649. However, that is more accurate for pools installed in-ground. Choosing a pool installed at the ground level won't require excavation, which keeps costs much lower. In fact, the costs of an above-ground pool is typically a third of the price range listed above, and they rarely cost more than $4,500 to purchase and have professionally installed.
The cost of installing an above ground pool is less than the cost of inground swimming pool installation. Buying a swimming pool is full of hidden costs that, over time, may deplete your savings. Do your homework, get the best pool builder, and ask not just questions, but the right questions. 
1 Total cost, labor and materials, for replacing an in-ground swimming pool liner is typically $2,000-$5,000. 2  A vinyl liner for an above ground pool can cost $150-$600, depending on the size and style of the swimming pool, plus any special colors, patterns or textures in the liner. 1 Replacing a vinyl liner in an in-ground swimming pool typically costs $700-$1,500 for just the liner, depending on the size and shape of the pool, the thickness (20-30 mil, but typically 28 mil) of the liner and any special colors or designs o
The average above ground swimming pool kit will cost between $1500 and $4500, depending on the quality of the pool. Typically, the more resin and less metal the pool has, the higher the price will be and the longer it will last. The installation costs of above ground pools usually run $1000-$3000, depending on the size and type of pool. Keep in mind that oval pools normally cost more to install than round pools, and the kits are also more expensive
1 Installation labor to replace an above ground pool liner can cost $200-$800 or more, depending on local rates and the size and shape of the pool. 2  For example, Edwards Pools in Ohio estimates its labor charges for replacing an above ground pool liner vary from $400 for an 18' round pool to $700 for a 18'x33' oval. 1 Replacing a vinyl liner in an in-ground swimming pool typically costs $700-$1,500 for just the liner, depending on the size and shape of the pool, the thickness (20-30 mil, but typically 28 mil) of the liner and any special colors or designs on the liner.
1 Installing an aboveground pool can cost $1,500-$5,000; for in-ground estimated costs are $7,000-$16,000 for a vinyl-lined model, $15,000-$25,000 for a fiberglass shell and $17,000-$45,000 for concrete or gunite. 2  However, custom designs can run prices much higher. 
1 For example, a 20' Round and 4' High 20 gauge Vinyl Liner with a pebble pattern on the bottom costs about $265 from Inyo Pools in Florida. 2  Installation labor to replace an above ground pool liner can cost $200-$800 or more, depending on local rates and the size and shape of the pool. 1 Replacing a vinyl liner in an in-ground swimming pool typically costs $700-$1,500 for just the liner, depending on the size and shape of the pool, the thickness (20-30 mil, but typically 28 mil) of the liner and any special colors or designs on the liner.
The installation costs of above ground pools usually run $1000-$3000, depending on the size and type of pool. Keep in mind that oval pools normally cost more to install than round pools, and the kits are also more expensive. Many swimming pool companies only sell above ground pool kits, and do not actually do the pool's installation. The average above ground swimming pool kit will cost between $1500 and $4500, depending on the quality of the pool.
We, as an above ground pool installation company, charge anywhere from $775 for a 15foot round to $1895 for a 21'x42' oval. These pools are made for the home owner to be able to install themselves. I have an above ground 24 ft x 52 in pool and it cost about $260 for 2 5000 gallon tanks. I still had to add some but that give â€¦ s an estimate. Depending on your area most city water systems charge between $2-3 per unit (748 gals.) A 10,000 gal. pool at $2.50 per unit would cost about $33.
For the purpose of this discussion, we will look at the costs associated with the installation of both kinds of modern swimming pools. According to P.K. Data the average cost of a 19' diameter above ground swimming pool is $6,243; while the average cost of a 32'x16' inground swimming pool is $21,919.
