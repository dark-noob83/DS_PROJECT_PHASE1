~ Producers synthesize their food through photosynthesis using energy from sunlight and carbon dioxide from the air. Their respiration returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Consumers use the food produced by producers for energy. Their respiration also returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Decomposers break down plant and animal waste products. They also break down dead plants and animals. The decomposing process releases carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere
The concept of producers, consumers and decomposers is interconnected with the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. It is important for students to understand the mechanisms of their own bodies, what interactions make them possible, and how they fit into a bigger picture (the carbon cycle). c. Burning fossil fuels and wood releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. d. When organisms die their carbon containing molecules become part of the soil. The molecules are broken down by fungi, bacteria, and other decomposers. During this decay process carbon dioxide is released into the air.
Decomposers are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms, and in doing so, carry out the natural process of decomposition. Like herbivores and predators, decomposers are heterotrophic, meaning that they use organic substrates to get their energy, carbon and nutrients for growth and development. 
Photosynthesis & Cellular Respiration. Name____________________________________Hour_______. PHOTOSYNTHESIS. Photosynthesis is the process by which sunlight energy, along with carbon dioxide and water, is converted into glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. 
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, normally from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen.
Decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, derive their nutrients by feeding on the remains of plants and animals. The bacteria and fungi use cellular respiration to extract the energy contained in the chemical bonds of the decomposing organic matter, and so release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cellular respiration requires oxygen (which is the by-product of photosynthesis) and it produces carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. In this way, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are linked in the carbon cycl
Photosynthesis (photo = light and synthesis = to make) is the process plants use to change carbon dioxide and water into sugar using sunlight. This sugar, glucose, is their fo … od, and the process gives off oxygen. Photosynthesis is the conversion of light energy into chemical energy by living organisms. The raw materials are carbon dioxide and water. The energy source is sunlight, and the end-products include glucose and oxygen. decomposers break down dead animals and plants and turn the into soil by eating it and pooping out soil most things that do this are insects bacteria and muchrooms A decompose … r's role in an ecosystem is to break down dead
Photosynthetic organisms are also referred to as autotrophs. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria, and some protistans use the energy from sunlight to produce sugar, which cellular respiration converts into ATP, the fuel used by all living things. decomposers break down dead animals and plants and turn the into soil by eating it and pooping out soil most things that do this are insects bacteria and muchrooms A decompose … r's role in an ecosystem is to break down dead organisms.
Animals that eat plants, or that eat other animals, incorporate the carbon in the sugars, fats, and proteins derived from the ingested biomass into their bodies. Inside their cells, energy is extracted from the food in a process called cellular respiration. Cellular respiration requires oxygen (which is the by-product of photosynthesis) and it produces carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. In this way, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are linked in the carbon cycle
