Roundup is a trade name for the herbicide glyphosate; it is manufactured by Monsanto. Roundup has been used since 1976 to kill unwanted plants in fields and gardens. Roundup is not without controversy, however.
Roundup is taken up by the leaves and stems of the plants and transported to the roots of the plant. Roundup comes in a ready to use mix that is sprayed on the leaves of the plant until it is wet. It needs to be applied when the plant is actively growing or this transfer to the roots will not occur. Roundup becomes inert upon contact with the soil.
Cover up any plants in your garden that you want to keep safe from Roundup. Any type of plastic covering, such as a tarp or old kitchen tablecloth, will do. Roundup is a nonselective herbicide, meaning it will kill any plants it comes into contact with.
Hand weeding is safer than using Roundup when weeds grow underneath flowers. A broad-spectrum herbicide, Roundup controls most weeds and grasses, but it also kills desired plants in a flower bed unless applied with care. Roundup contains glyphosate, which is toxic to plants. Glyphosate travels through plants from their leaves to their roots.
Roundup is a series of weed and grass killers produced by ScottsMiracle-Gro Company. According to Roundup's website, both the Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Ready-to-Use Plus and the Roundup Weed & Grass Killer Super Concentrate can be used to kill weeds in between vegetable plants.
