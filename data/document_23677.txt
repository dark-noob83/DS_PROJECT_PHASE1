On direct appeal, the cost of appellate defense averages $100,000 more in death penalty cases, than in non-death penalty murder cases. Personal restraint petitions filed in death penalty cases on average cost an additional $137,000 in public defense costs. That translates to $37.2 million for each of the state’s five executions since the state reenacted the death penalty. The study estimates that the average cost to Maryland taxpayers for reaching a single death sentence is $3 million - $1.9 million more than the cost of a non-death penalty case.

By comparison, a non-death penalty murder case in nearby Lubbock County typically costs about $3,000, court officials estimate. The average cost to house an inmate in Texas prisons is $47.50 per day, according to Michelle Lyons, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Thus it would cost about $17,340 to house an inmate for a year and $693,500 for 40 years, far less than even part of the death penalty costs. The regional public defender's office estimates that just the legal costs for a death penalty case from indictment to execution are $1.2 million
At least 15% of the prisoners in 20 states are 50 or older, according to the ACLU report. In West Virginia, 20% were at least 50. The costs of confining such prisoners are about double — $68,270 per year — the $34,135 annual cost for the average younger inmate. The cost information that the agency did track showed that the BOP paid $28,893 per year to house the average inmate, while it cost $57,962 per year for each inmate housed at one of its medical centers.

With the exception of a man convicted last year, the seven Washington inmates on death row now have been there an average of 14 years; add over another half million in prison costs not counting the extra expense of death row. Per Prisoner Per year = $43,352*. so. 14 years = $606,928*. However even leaving out some death penalty costs, the death penalty ($1.7 million) would still likely have been the more expensive option than life in prison ($1.3 million) for a hypothetical guilty verdict for Kevin Harper.
A Seattle University study examining the costs of the death penalty in Washington found that each death penalty case cost an average of $1 million more than a similar case where the death penalty was not sought ($3.07 million, versus $2.01 million). That translates to $37.2 million for each of the state’s five executions since the state reenacted the death penalty. The study estimates that the average cost to Maryland taxpayers for reaching a single death sentence is $3 million - $1.9 million more than the cost of a non-death penalty case.
Most people have little idea what the average cost is to house inmates in prison. For example, in California, an average bill per day to house an inmate in state prisons is about $129. The bill at some prisons is a little less depending on the cost of living in the particular state, but these figures will likely increase every year.
But $1,612 a year might be eliminated from the annual cost, assuming prisoners who could never be paroled are not enrolled in rehabilitation programs. However, at an annual cost of $137,102, a prisoner who sits on death row for 20 years could cost taxpayers a total of $2,742,040 in that time. Adding to the total cost of LWOP is that the California's prison population is aging. According to an Associated Press story published in July 2008, California housed 4,805 inmates 60 and older at the end of 2007, about 3 percent of all prisoners. 
It costs approximately $90,000 more a year to house an inmate on death row, than in the general prison population or $57.5 million annually. The Attorney General devotes about 15% of his budget, or $11 million annually to death penalty cases.
