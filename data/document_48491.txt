When this effort is complete, revised FIRMs for the Addicks Reservoir watershed will be produced based on 1-foot contour interval (rather than on 2-foot contour interval) topographic maps, and based on 2008 Land Use Data (rather than on 2001 Land Use data).
2013-02-12: The rating curve for Addicks Reservoir has been updated and replaced with data from the Texas Water Development Board's Report 126.
WATERSHED OVERVIEW. The Addicks Reservoir watershed is located in western Harris County with a small portion crossing into eastern Waller County. Rainfall within the 138 square miles of the Addicks Reservoir watershed drains to the watershedâ€™s primary waterway, Langham Creek (U100-00-00).
Together with Barker Reservoir, Addicks Reservoir was built in the 1940s as part of a federal project to reduce flooding risks along Buffalo Bayou, which runs west to east through downtown Houston. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) completed construction of Addicks Dam and the outlet facility in 1948.
Welcome to Addicks and Barker reservoirs, a place where visitors can find peace and quiet in the middle of a throbbing metropolitan area. Located about 17 miles from downtown Houston, both Addicks and Barker reservoirs lie entirely within the boundaries of this growing city.
There are 159 miles of open waterways in the Addicks Reservoir watershed, including Langham Creek and its major tributaries, such as South Mayde Creek (U101-00-00), Bear Creek (U102-00-00) and Horsepen Creek (U106-00-00).
The Addicks Reservoir Watershed Model and Map Update study is updating the hydrologic and hydraulic computer models for the Addicks Reservoir watershed that will result in revised Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMS or floodplain maps).
