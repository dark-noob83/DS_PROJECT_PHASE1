Often, slate is used to describe shale but the two are different in that shale is actually converted into slate. Slate is used for different varieties of flooring and roofing. School children used pieces of slate as a writing board to practice their math and writing during the 1800s. Slate is a metamorphic rock that forms from mudstone or shale. The mudstone or shale normally contains clay or volcanic ash. Slate is unique in that it does not require any type of cementation to hold its particles together. It has a very attractive appearance and it is also durable. Interesting Slate Facts:
Slate Macro (~ 6 cm long and ~ 4 cm high). Slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism. It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock. Slate is mainly composed of the minerals quartz and muscovite or illite, often along with biotite, chlorite, hematite, and pyrite and, less frequently apatite, graphite, kaolinite, magnetite, tourmaline, or zircon as well as feldspar.
Foliation in slate is caused by the parallel orientation of platy minerals in the rock such as microscopic grains of clay minerals and mica. These parallel mineral grain alignments give the rock an ability to break smoothly along planes of foliation. Slate is a fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock that is created by the alteration of shale or mudstone by low-grade regional metamorphism. The specimen shown above is about two inches (five centimeters) across.

Slate is a fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock that is created by the alteration of shale or mudstone by low-grade regional metamorphism. It is popular for a wide variety of uses such as roofing, flooring and flagging because of its durability and attractive appearance. Slate is a fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock that is created by the alteration of shale or mudstone by low-grade regional metamorphism. The specimen shown above is about two inches (five centimeters) across.
In the coal mining industry of the Appalachian Basin, the word slate is still used by many miners to in reference to the shale that forms the roof and floor of a mine and for fragments of shale that are separated from the coal in preparation plants. Slate is a fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock that is created by the alteration of shale or mudstone by low-grade regional metamorphism. The specimen shown above is about two inches (five centimeters) across.
The original clay minerals in shale alter to micas with increasing levels of heat and pressure. Slate can also contain abundant quartz and small amounts of feldspar, calcite, pyrite, hematite and other minerals. Most slates are gray in color and range in a continuum of shades from light to dark gray. Slate is a fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock that is created by the alteration of shale or mudstone by low-grade regional metamorphism. The specimen shown above is about two inches (five centimeters) across.
slate. 1. a fine-grained rock formed by the metamorphosis of clay, shale, etc., that tends to split along parallel cleavage planes, usu. at an angle to the planes of stratification. 2. a thin piece or plate of this rock or a similar material, used esp. for roofing or as a writing surface. 3. a dull, dark bluish gray. 1. (Geological Science). a. a compact fine-grained metamorphic rock formed by the effects of heat and pressure on shale. It can be split into thin layers along natural cleavage planes and is used as a roofing and paving material. b. (as modifier): a slate tile.
