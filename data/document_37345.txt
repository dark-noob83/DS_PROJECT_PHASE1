b. the strength of a field in a given area expressed as the product of the area and the component of the field strength at right angles to the area: magnetic flux; electric flux.
Materials Science and Engineering Dictionary. the quantity of mass diffusing through and perpendicular to a unit cross-sectional area of material per unit time. See also: SAE gross horsepower, Query, FAME, X-type engine, RANKINE SCALE.
The flux of a quantity is defined as the rate at which this quantity passes through a fixed boundary per unit time. In various contexts, flux is called the exitance, irradiance, or radiancy.
In the case of fluxes, we have to take the integral, over a surface, of the flux through every element of the surface. The result of this operation is called the surface integral of the flux. It represents the quantity which passes through
Flux is the presence of a force field in a specified physical medium, or the flow of energy through a surface. In electronics, the term applies to any electrostatic field and any magnetic field. Flux is depicted as lines in a plane that contains or intersects electric charge poles or magnetic poles.
= E A cos. You can also think of the electric flux as the number of electric field lines that cross the surface. Remembering the dot product or the scalar product, we can also write this as. = E A. where E is the electric field and A is a vector equal to the area A and in a direction perpendicular to that area.
F Â·d S is the component of flux passing though the surface, multiplied by the area of the surface (see dot product). For this reason flux represents physically a flow per unit area. In the various subfields of physics, there exist two common usages of the term flux, each with rigorous mathematical frameworks.
