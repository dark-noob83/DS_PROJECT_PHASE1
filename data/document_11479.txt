Neutrophil granulocytes (also known as neutrophils) are the most abundant (40% to 75%) type of white blood cells in most mammals and form an essential part of the innate immune system. Functionality varies in different animals. They are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow.
Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell, comprising about 50-70% of all white blood cells. They are phagocytic, meaning that they can ingest other cells, though they do not survive the act. Neutrophils are the first immune cells to arrive at a site of infection, through a process known as chemotaxis.
A neutrophil is one type of a white blood cell (leukocyte/leucocyte) that assists the body's immune system to ward off disease. From 40 - 60% of the white blood cells in an he â€¦ althy human are neutrophils.
