It is also known as tricalcium phosphate and calcium hydroxyapatite. The unit cell (the smallest unit containing some form of symmetry) consists of two triangular prismatic subcells. These form a rhombic prism.
Hydroxyapatite consists of Ca 2+ ions surrounded by both PO 4 2- and OH-ions, and has the chemical formula Ca 5 (OH)(PO 4) 3.
Common Names. Some compounds have been known for so long that a systematic nomenclature cannot compete with well-established common names. Examples of compounds for which common names are used include water (H 2 O), ammonia (NH 3), and methane (CH 4).
Hydroxylapatite, also called hydroxyapatite (HA), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 (OH), but is usually written Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities. Hydroxylapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group. The OH âˆ’ ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite. It crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system.
18.4987 %. To calculate molar mass of a chemical compound enter it's formula and click 'Calculate!'. In chemical formula you may use: Examples of molar mass computations: NaCl, Ca(OH)2, K4[Fe(CN)6] , CuSO4*5H2O, water, nitric acid, potassium permanganate, ethanol, fructose.
The ClO 4 - ion is therefore the perchlorate ion. There are only a handful of exceptions to these generalizations. The names of the hydroxide (OH -), cyanide (CN -), and peroxide (O 2 2-) ions, for example, have the-ide ending because they were once thought to be monatomic ions. Practice Problem 5The bone and tooth enamel in your body contain ionic compounds such as calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite.
