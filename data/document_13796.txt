North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon). The climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long.
Reykjavik is at latitude 64°08' N. The Arctic circle is (according to Wikipedia) at approximately 66° 33′39″ (but is drifting North). A degree of lati … tude is approximately 110km of linear distance. So Reykjavik is less than 330km from the Arctic circle. Here is a link to a lecture on measurement of latitude, if you need more precision: http://www.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/geog140/lectures/latitude.html. The largest western city north of the  Arctic Circle is Tromso, in Norway, with a population of more than  66,000. The largest city in North America is Barrow in Alaska, with  more or less 4,000 inhabitants.

Cylindrical projection showing the Arctic Circle in red. The Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. As of 21 October 2015, it runs 66°33′45.9″ north of the Equator. The climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long.
The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the Northern Hemisphere at which the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for 24 hours (at the June solstice and December solstice respectively). The climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long.

Distance between Reykjavik, Iceland and the Arctic Circle. 270 km = 168 miles. During our calculation of the distance to the Arctic Circle we made three assumptions. 1) We assumed a spherical Earth as a close approximation of the true shape of the Earth (an oblate spheroid). The distance was calculated as great-circle or orthodromic distance on the surface of a sphere. Find out the distance between Reykjavik and the North Pole, the South Pole, the Equator, the Tropic of Cancer, the Tropic of Capricorn, the Antarctic Circle.
