Use a microwave oven to cook rice properly and prevent food poisoning. Combine rice, liquid, salt and butter (if desired) in a 2- to 3-quart microwave-safe baking dish. Cover tightly with microwave-quality plastic wrap or lid designed for microwave cooking. Found This Helpful. Rice is a clean, relatively safe food. A small amount of Bacillus Cereus, a bacteria that potentially causes food poisoning, is found in uncooked rice and is not killed by cooking. It will have no effect at all if the rice is kept hot, held for less than 2 hours, or cooled down quickly for storage.
Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Bacillus cereus Food Poisoning Associated with Fried Rice at Two Child Day Care Centers -- Virginia, 1993.

Yes. You can get food poisoning from eating reheated rice. However, it's not the reheating that causes the problem but the way the rice has been stored before it was reheated. When the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. If the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria. These bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins (poisons) that cause vomiting or diarrhoea.

Bacillus cereus is an endemic, soil-dwelling, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, motile, beta hemolytic bacterium. Some strains are harmful to humans and cause foodborne illness, while other strains can be beneficial as probiotics for animals. Pathogenesis [edit]. B. cereus is responsible for a minority of foodborne illnesses (2â€“5%), causing severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Bacillus foodborne illnesses occur due to survival of the bacterial endospores when food is improperly cooked.
CHICKEN often gets the blame when you fall victim to food poisoning, but it's likely it was the salad in your meal that actually made you sick. Dodgy takeaway foods are also assumed to be the cause of foodborne illnesses, but it's more likely that the leftover rice is what made you sick-not the curry or stir fry. Lorraine Belanger, spokeswoman for Food Standards Australia New Zealand, said a lot of foodborne illness happens in the home. In the lead up to Australian Food Safety Week next week, here are seven foods you should know pose food poisoning risks. Picture: Thinkstock Source: Supplied. Rice. Rice can be infected with Bacillus cereus, which is present as spores and can survive easily in dry conditions such as a packet.
Very few people realise that cooked rice can be responsible for their foodborne illness. Rice forms the basis of many ethnic foods and foods containing rice are frequently implicated in food poisoning episodes. It is common for food producers to prepare large quantities of rice a day ahead of use and leave it to cool slowly at room temperature, before heating and serving the next day.
The grains of uncooked rice tend to have bacteria which can cause food poisoning. Once the rice is cooked and is not going to be eaten on the same day, it is best to refrigerate the cooked rice, as soon as possible. The way to prevent any form of food poisoning is to avoid keeping cooked rice at room temperature for too long. Preparations with rice like rice salads and other dishes should also be refrigerated once prepared, till it is serving time. Avoid reheating the rice more than once or eating rice that is really old.
Uncooked rice can contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. When the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. If the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria. These bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins (poisons) that cause vomiting or diarrhoea.
