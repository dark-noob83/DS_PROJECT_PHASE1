Glucose is a carbohydrate, and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism. Glucose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates. Glucose is also sometimes called dextrose. Corn syrup is primarily glucose. Glucose is one of the primary molecules which serve as energy sources for plants and animals. It is found in the sap of plants, and is found in the human bloodstream where it is referred to as blood sugar.
Starches are insoluble in water and thus can serve as storage depots of glucose. Plants convert excess glucose into starch for storage. The image shows starch grains (lightly stained with iodine) in the cells of the white potato. Rice, wheat, and corn (maize) are also major sources of starch in the human diet.
The amylopectin structure is found in both glycogen and starch. This form of the polysaccharides has alpha 1-4 glycosidic bonds and alpha 1-6 glycosidic bonds, according to the City University of New York, Brooklyn College. The amylopectin structure in glycogen includes additional glucose molecules.
The breakdown of starch to glucose nourishes the plant during periods of reduced photosynthetic activity. We often think of potatoes as a “starchy” food, yet other plants contain a much greater percentage of starch (potatoes 15%, wheat 55%, corn 65%, and rice 75%). Commercial starch is a white powder.

Foods such as potatoes, rice, corn and wheat contain starch granules which are important energy sources for humans. The human digestive process breaks down the starches into glucose units with the aid of enzymes, and those glucose molecules can circulate in the blood stream as an energy source.
Polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, are complex chains of carbohydrates composed of monosaccharide units, such as glucose. Plants and animals store excess energy for later use or as structural support. Animals create starch ito store unused energy for later, while animals store glycogen for the same purpose.
