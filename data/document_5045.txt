The honey badger is the only member of the genus Mellivora. Although it was first put to the badger group in the 1860s, they do not have much in common with the subfamily Melinae. They are closer to the marten family. The honey badger or ratel (Mellivora capensis) is a type of mustelid. It lives in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its name, the honey badger does not look much like other types of badgers. It looks more like a weasel
Honey badgers live alone in self-dug holes. They are skilled diggers, able to dig tunnels into hard ground in 10 minutes. These burrows usually only have one passage and a nesting chamber and are usually only 1–3 m long. Although mostly solitary, honey badgers may hunt together in pairs during the May breeding season. Little is known of the honey badger's breeding habits. Its gestation period is thought to last six months, usually resulting in two cubs, which are born blind.

Honey badgers live in warm climates and don't need to hibernate to reserve energy, and American badgers don't undergo true hibernation. The American badger (Taxidea taxus) is not as active in cold weather, to preserve energy in an environment where food is less available. Badger is an umbrella term for Mustelids in three subfamilies: Melinae (9 Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger) and Taxideinae (the American badger). This answer will focus on the Melinae and Taxideinae, which live in colder climates. Some hibernate, and some don't.

Nursery chambers are lined with grass
The honey badger (Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel (/ˈreɪtəl/ or /ˈrɑːtəl/), is a species of mustelid native to Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels. Although mostly solitary, honey badgers may hunt together in pairs during the May breeding season. Little is known of the honey badger's breeding habits. Its gestation period is thought to last six months, usually resulting in two cubs, which are born blind.
How long do honey badgers live? In captivity honey badgers can live up to 24 years but in the wild are only likely to live 7-8 years, may be less. Old honey badger teeth are badly worn and these individuals are probably more likely to be killed by predators. Honey badgers are however considered to be good swimmers (Kingdon 1977). Honey badgers are often reported in the literature to have a gestation of six months, and there are zoo records of 153 and 162 days gestation respectively. Certainly in the southern Kalahari and Israel gestation was recorded as six to eight weeks.
The honey badger's odor doesn’t last long, like that of a skunk’s, but it still gets its message across: “Leave me alone!”. Honey badgers are native to areas of Africa and Asia, from southern Morocco to Africa’s southern tip, and western Asia’s Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, and western India. They live mainly in dry areas but are also found in forests and grasslands. Honey badgers are good swimmers and can climb trees. With those long claws, the honey badger digs burrows up to 9 feet (3 meters) long and up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep. A single tunnel ends in a chamber, which is usually bare, where the honey badger rests.
