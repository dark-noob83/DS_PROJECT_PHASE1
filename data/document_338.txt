Climate. The climate is brutal in the African Savanna. There is a rainy season and a dry season. It rains about 15-30 inches in the rainy season and not more than 4 in the dry season. The rainy season is December-April and the Dry season is May-November. The storms that occur the most are lightning storms.
A savanna or savannah is a grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. Savanna ecoregions are of several different types: 1  Tropical and subtropical savannas are classified with tropical and subtropical grasslands and shrublands as the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome.
Savanna is an enormous plain with hills and forests. It has different names in the seperate parts of the globe from the equator to tropics. Savanna is an enormous plain between moisture equator forests and tropical deserts. The biggest savannas are in Africa. It is 40% from it. The seasons in Africa's savanna are two: wet and dry. In the equator the dry season is shorter - 2-3 months and near the tropics it is longer - 9-10 months, but in the largest part of the savanna the wet and dry seasons are long 5-6 months. In the wet seasons there are heavy rains pouring down. In the dry seasons vegetable life grows very fast.

WEATHER: An important factor in the savanna is climate. The climate is usually warm and temperatures range from 68° to 86°F (20 to 30°C). Savannas exist in areas where there is a 6 - 8 month wet summer season, and a 4 - 6 month dry winter season. The annual rainfall is from 10 - 30 inches (25 - 75 cm) per year. 
Plants Animals Climate Australian Tropical Savanna African Savanna A savanna is a rolling grassland scattered with shrubs and isolated trees, which can be found between a tropical rainforest and desert biome. Not enough rain falls on a savanna to support forests.
The grass in savanna grows 2-3 meters up and forests are thin. There are parts where trees are scarce. The most enormous tree is baobab that leaves are fallen down. In the dry season there are strong evaporation and the tree leaves fall off, and grass and bushes wither.t has different names in the seperate parts of the globe from the equator to tropics.
