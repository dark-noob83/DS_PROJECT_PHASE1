While the precipitation level in most tundra environments doesn't exceed 10 inches, there are some exceptions to the trend. In areas of tundra that are closer to oceans or large bodies of water, the precipitation can measure up to 20 inches per year.
Precipitation. According to Blue Planet Biomes, the climate of the tundra is extremely dry with precipitation levels similar to those of tropical deserts. The average precipitation, including melting snow, in the tundra is between 6 and 10 inches per year. Coupled with strong drying winds, the annual precipitation makes the tundra an area of extreme weather.
The city of Nome, Alaska, is in a tundra environment. The city's annual precipitation is 18.4 inches per year. By contrast, Point Barrow, the northernmost United States city, has an annual precipitation of 4.3 inches. In addition to the increased precipitation, coastal tundra areas tend to have more fog.
Precipitation in the tundra totals 150 to 250 mm a year, including melted snow. That's less than most of the world's greatest deserts! Still, the tundra is usually a wet place because the low temperatures cause evaporation of water to be slow. Much of the arctic has rain and fog in the summers.
The tundra is an unusually cold and dry climate. Precipitation  totals 6-10 inches of rain a year, which includes melted snow. This  is almost as little as the world's dries â€¦ t deserts. Coupled with  strong and drying winds, the tundra is an extreme weather biome.
The tundra is an unusually cold and dry climate. Precipitation totals 6-10 inches of rain a year, which includes melted snow. This is almost as little as the world's driest deserts.
The average winter temperature is -34 C (-30 F), but the average summer temperature is 3-12 C (37-54 F) which enables this biome to sustain life. Rainfall may vary in different regions of the arctic. Yearly precipitation, including melting snow, is 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches). Soil is formed slowly.
