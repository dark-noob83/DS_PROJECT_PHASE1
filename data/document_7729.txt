1 A silver amalgam (metal) filling on one or two surfaces can cost $50-$150; three or more surfaces can cost $120-$300 or more. 2  Dental insurance typically covers at least some of the cost for amalgam fillings.
1 For example, CostHelper readers without dental insurance report paying $90-$350 for a composite filling, at an average cost of $204; CostHelper readers with dental insurance report paying $63-$300 out of pocket for a composite filling, at an average cost of $207.
1 The average cost for cavity repair is $80 to $200 per tooth, depending on the size of your tooth cavity. 2  Cavities that have a white resin filling are going to cost more than a filling that is silver. 3  Generally, the white filling is going to be 30% to 40% more than the silver filling.
1 For one or two surface fillings, the cost can be from $90 to $250, while more layers can cost anywhere from $130 to $350. 2  Custom made cast gold fillings can also be placed on tooth decays. 3  This particular process requires 2 visits as well as a temporary filling, which can cost anywhere from $900 to $3,500.
The cost for amalgam fillings averages approximately $110 to $200 per filling. The cost for resin-based composite fillings, which is determined by the number of tooth surfaces on which the material is placed, ranges on average from $135 to $24
How much is it? 1  The average cost for cavity repair is $80 to $200 per tooth, depending on the size of your tooth cavity. 2  Cavities that have a white resin filling are going to cost more than a filling that is silver. 3  Generally, the white filling is going to be 30% to 40% more than the silver filling.
1 Resin fillings that are tooth colored can also cover tooth decays caused by a cavity. 2  For one or two surface fillings, the cost can be from $90 to $250, while more layers can cost anywhere from $130 to $350. 3  Custom made cast gold fillings can also be placed on tooth decays.
1 A small filling for one or two surfaces can cost anywhere from $75 to $160. 2  Up to four surfaces can cost in the $120 to $300 range. 3  This price is for the general metallic fillings that are most common. 4  Resin fillings that are tooth colored can also cover tooth decays caused by a cavity.
