“If you make $2,500 a month but get a $5,000 midyear bonus, your withholding will be computed as if you received a single wage payment of $7,500 for the monthly payroll period. Then that $7,500 is annualized, or assumed to be part of your yearly salary. If you receive a bonus of more than $1 million, your employer must withhold 35% of the amount above $1 million, as well as the standard 25% of the amount below $1 million. Of course, as discussed above, employers are not limited to the percentage method.
WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service handed out $2.8 million in bonuses to employees with disciplinary issues — including more than $1 million to employees who didn't pay their federal taxes, a watchdog report says. About 69% of the agency's 98,000 employees received some kind of bonus. The IRS suspended most bonuses last year in a cost-savings move to avoid furloughs but restored them in fiscal year 2014. Non-payment of taxes by federal employees is a government-wide problem.
The Percentage Method. (source). The IRS specifies a flat “supplemental rate” of 25%, meaning that any supplemental wages (including bonuses) should be taxed in that amount. If you receive a $5,000 bonus, under this rule, $1,250 (25% of $5,000) goes straight to the IRS. Using this approach, the amount of your bonus – whatever it is – is “singled out” from the rest of your income and taxed directly. If you receive a bonus of more than $1 million, your employer must withhold 35% of the amount above $1 million, as well as the standard 25% of the amount below $1 million. Of course, as discussed above, employers are not limited to the percentage method.
You would also subtract Social Security tax at 4.2 percent of the bonus amount and Medicare tax at 1.45 percent, as of 2012. Social Security tax has a yearly wage threshold of $110,100 so you would not withhold Social Security tax on any bonus amount that causes the employee’s wages to exceed that limit. Subtract 1.000 from 0.3065 to get 0.6935.Then, divide the bonus amount of $1,000 by the decimal amount of 0.6935 to arrive at $1,441.96. You would pay the tax cost of $441.96 and the employee would receive $1,000.
You are a monthly schedule depositor for a calendar year if the total taxes on Form 941, line 10, for the 4 quarters in your lookback period were $50,000 or less. Under the monthly deposit schedule, deposit employment taxes on payments made during a month by the 15th day of the following month. The employer determines the wages to be used in the withholding tables by adding to the $500 amount of wages paid the amount of $88.50 from the chart under Step 1 ($588.50 total). The employer then applies the applicable tables to determine the income tax withholding for nonresident aliens (see Step 2).
Option 1. The employer may withhold a flat 25% for federal income taxes from the bonus payment. If the employee receives over $1 million in bonus payments in one year, the employer can withhold 35% from the amount over $1 million in addition to 25% of the first $1 million. Option 2. However, seems to me that your bonus is not $1,200 but is $984 as $984 is what is showing up on your pay stub. As I stated before – the IRS play by the “You can pay me now or you can pay me later rules” – your bonus just gets added with normal income to determine how much you owe the IRS.
Basically, under IRS rules, companies have three options in calculating taxes on bonuses. The first two listed immediately below apply where the bonus is paid to you separately from your regular pay. The third is applicable when the employer gives you your bonus and regular pay in one payment. Here your employer adds the amount of your bonus to the amount of your most recent regular paycheck. Let’s say that your regular gross paycheck is $2000, and your bonus is $5000, for a combined total of $7000. Let’s also assume that the normal withholding from your regular pay is $500.
Separate or Specified Payment. If the bonus is paid separately from regular wages or if you combine it with regular wages and state the amount of each, you may withhold federal income tax at a flat 25 percent. If the bonus is more than $1 million, withhold federal income tax on the excess amount at 35 percent. Subtract 1.000 from 0.3065 to get 0.6935.Then, divide the bonus amount of $1,000 by the decimal amount of 0.6935 to arrive at $1,441.96. You would pay the tax cost of $441.96 and the employee would receive $1,000.
From no matter what company and bonus or regular earning, you pay the same amount of taxes to the IRS. That is, if you earn $50,000 in income from one empolyer, $20,000 from one employer and $30,000 from a second employer or $40,000 in income and a $10,000 bonus – you federal taxes on all 3 – will be exactly the same. However, seems to me that your bonus is not $1,200 but is $984 as $984 is what is showing up on your pay stub. As I stated before – the IRS play by the “You can pay me now or you can pay me later rules” – your bonus just gets added with normal income to determine how much you owe the IRS.
IRS Rules for the Tax Deduction of Bonuses. The Internal Revenue Service regards bonuses as supplemental wages, which are not regular wages. If you choose to reward your employees for their hard work with a bonus incentive, the payment is taxed according to how it is made. Subtract 1.000 from 0.3065 to get 0.6935.Then, divide the bonus amount of $1,000 by the decimal amount of 0.6935 to arrive at $1,441.96. You would pay the tax cost of $441.96 and the employee would receive $1,000.
