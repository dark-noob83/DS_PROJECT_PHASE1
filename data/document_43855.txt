Tags: electricity, conservation. * The average residential monthly bill is $95.66 * Average residential monthly use is 920 kilowatt hours (kWh) * The average price paid per kWh is 10.4 cents, so about a dime. Your numbers are wrong in several aspects, First the average residential electric bill is $96.50 per month and the average lighting percentage is 10 -15 percent, that would mean a $ 9.60 to 14.50 per month. And you will not save 80 to 85 percent going to fluorescent.
A kWh costs currently in average a little less than 20 cents, i.e. NZD. Add 1.00 dollar for metre rent per day and let's say it is 20 cents. That makes it around 0.12 EUR, 0.10 GBP and 0.16 USD. General information is provided here http://www.powerswitch.org.nz/powerswitch. Here is a global comparison of electricity prices. Not sure what the average NZ price is... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electri...ice_comparison 65 cents/hour ($255 a month at 13hrs/d) for one 1500W gas radiator does seem a bit high.
The price also differs from the source of the electricity. In the U.S. in 2002, the cost of electricity by different sources is listed below: Coal: 1-4 cents; Gas: 2.3-5.0 cents; Oil: 6-8 cents; Wind: 5-7 cents; Nuclear: 6-7 cents; Solar: 25-50 cents. Electricity pricing (sometimes referred to as electricity tariff or the price of electricity) varies widely from country to country, and may vary significantly from locality to locality within a particular country. There are many reasons that account for these differences in price.
In Christchurch apartment living is rare. The typical rental property is a 3-4 bedroom house which rents for $350-450 NZD per week (note that this is $1400-1800 per month.) If you can not afford this, you would typically flat with others to share the cost. # NMich on Dec 08, 2011 : Those prices are no way real. The cheapest apartment(1 room) costs 180$ per week, and the average (2 rooms) is around 280-350$ per week. A capuccino costs 4.50$, a bus ticket 3.20$, and there is no Zara or H&M shops, in Chch.
My average monthly electric bill is around $42.00 U.S. My average monthly usage is 240 kilowatt hours (kWh) The average price I pay is something like $10.6 / kWh I'm pretty efficient, but let's see.. A lot of the compact fluorescents are 27W jobs, and I'm getting more 13W ones to replace those energy hogs.

At the same time, the price has dropped about 36 per cent, for an average system cost of about $10,000. International Energy Agency figures expected 11 per cent of all the world's power would be generated by PV by 2030. So we had a supply charge for all three and a maintenance charge for all three, Brian said. It's really expensive.. When it came to renovating the family's new home, they decided the cost of firewood, gas and electricity no longer stacked up.
I based the 35 U.S. cents/KWH on the news report, but that number might very well be wrong. I did a bit more searching, and per this report the average cost per KWH for 8/11 ranged from 25-33C/KWH, up about 30% over the past 3-5 years. So if you go with 28c, that comes out to 22 cents in USD. About 2/3rds of the amount I extrapolated from that news report. Here is a global comparison of electricity prices.

So the average rate of electricity is all but useless for most purposes. Therefore, on this site, I generally use a sample rate of 15 per kWh. This isn't a typical rate, since there's no such thing as typical when it comes to electricity rates. Here's the formula to figure the cost of running a device: wattage x hours used 1000 x price per kWh = cost of electricity For example, let's say you leave a 100-watt bulb running continuously (730 hours a month), and you're paying 15 /kWh.
