The Magnoliophyta phylum is the dominant group of plants on the planet, as it contains almost a quarter of a million species. These species belong to two classes: Magnoliopsida (dicots) and Liliopsida (monocots), although this is a division currently under debate.
Cycadophyta. The plant phylum Cycadophyta is millions of years old, but only three families are alive today. These families are Cycadaceae, Strangeriaceae and Zamiaceae, all of which inhabit tropical or subtropical areas. These plants bear a resemblance to palms, and have leaves categorized as pinnately compound.
This is a conspicuous group of woody plants commonly known as the conifers. The members of this group produce ovules that mature into seeds. These ovules and seeds are found on the upper surfaces of scale structures which often are clustered into cones.
Cycads are neither dicot or monocot. There division in the plant kingdom is the cycadophyta division. It is a vascular plant and a seed plant. Cycads are Gymnosperm and evergr â€¦ een.
The phylum Cycadophyta contains about 140 living species of plants called cycads, with more species present in the fossil record. Cycads have seeds and water-conducting vessels. Cycads belong to a larger group of plants called gymnosperms, which bear seeds in cone-like structures.
In gymnosperms such as cycads, seeds don't develop in a plant ovary as they do in flowering plants, but rather on the surface of the reproductive structures. Other gymnosperms include gingko trees, ephedra and its relatives, and pine trees and their relatives.
General Characteristics of the Phylum Cycadophyta. Considered living fossils, cycads are fern-like seed plants that make up
