DNA and RNA are composed of nucleotides that are linked to one another in a chain by chemical bonds, called ester bonds, between the sugar base of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the adjacent nucleotide.
Nucleotides with two or three phosphate groups are good energy donors. Phosphate groups can be joined together to form phosphodiester bonds. Phosphate groups can also be joined to other molecules, such as sugar. When phosphate is added to a nucleoside, the molecule is called a nucleotide.
The sugar is the 3' end, and the phosphate is the 5' end of each nucleiotide. The phosphate group attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar on one nucleotide forms an ester bond with the free hydroxyl on the 3' carbon of the next nucleotide.
Nucleic Acids. Nucleotides join together through phosphodiester linkages between the 5' and 3' carbon atoms to form nucleic acids. The 3' -OH of the sugar group forms a bond with one of the negatively charged oxygens of the phosphate group attached to the 5' carbon of another sugar.
DNA consists of a phosphate group, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA is a helical, double-stranded macromolecule with bases projecting into the interior of the molecule. These two strands are always complementary in sequence.
A DNA strand is simply a string of nucleotides joined together. I can show how this happens perfectly well by going back to a simpler diagram and not worrying about the structure of the bases. The phosphate group on one nucleotide links to the 3' carbon atom on the sugar of another one. In the process, a molecule of water is lost-another condensation reaction. . . . and you can continue to add more nucleotides in the same way to build up the DNA chain.
