500 Wh x $ 0.25 = $0.12 per hour to run our air conditioner. Twelve cents per hour is your hourly cooling cost to run your A/C. Paul Presson, R.A. notes: Correct the cost per operating hour calculation-the $0.25/kwh needs to be divided by 1,000 to get the watt hour cost..
Typical Electricity Costs. The town of Wellesley, Mass., has estimated the average cost of running central air conditioning in a typical home for six hours a day will use 900 kilowatt/hours (kWh) per month. At a cost of $0.134 per kWh, this amounts to $120.60 per month. A large 12,000 BTU air conditioner, like that in a window, running six hours each day will consume 270 kWh, at a cost of $36.26 per month. A smaller 6,500 BTU room air conditioner will consume 144 kWh at a cost of $19.34 per month. The kilowatt-hour (kWh) is the standard unit of measurement for electricity in the United States.
In this case, the cost per month will be approximately $45. A yearly cost can be determined by multiplying the cost per week, $11.20, by how many weeks in a year, 52. The total approximate yearly amount to run a 5,000-Btu air conditioner continuously will be about $585.
1 The cost to operate the unit will vary from region to region. 2  In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the kilowatt-hour cost is about 63 percent greater than the national average, so it would cost about $950 annually to run a 5,000-Btu air conditioner.
For example, a 12,000 BTU air conditioner with a SEER rating of 10 and a cost of 25 cents per kWh would calculate as follows: 12,000 BTUs / SEER 10 = 1,200 W = 1.2 kWh. 1.2 kWh x $0.25 = $0.30 per hour to run your window air conditioner. At 8 hours a day for 125 days of summer, your window air conditioner will have an annual running cost of $300 a year.
