a physical change. because the water is still water just the appearance of it has changed. It is also known as a phase change because the boiling is just a phase once it is off the heat it will be normal water and if you freeze it it will become ice, but once you leave it out again its just water.
Physical Change in Water. Water as steam or water vapor. It is formed when water is heated to the boiling point or it evaporates. Water as a liquid is formed then water vapor is cooled or ice is heated. Ice is formed when water is cooled to the freezing point.
There are several differences between a physical and chemical change in matter or substances. A physical change in a substance doesn't change what the substance is. In a chemical change where there is a chemical reaction, a new substance is formed and energy is either given off or absorbed. For example, if a piece of paper is cut up into small pieces it still is paper.
It is a physical change, known as a phase transition (see related links below). There is no chemical change: the water molecules remain water molecules. They have simply acquired enough kinetic energy to escape the attraction of the molecules in the liquid and move (almost) freely.
It is a physical change. All phase changes are physical, not chemical. The chemical composition of water does not change when it changes from a liquid to a gas, or for that ma … tter, to a solid. 3 people found this useful.

This shows that boiling water results in no chemical change. If water is just heated to its boiling temperature then there is a physical change of rise in temperature and if it is boiled for some time then there is a physical change from liquid to gaseous state.
