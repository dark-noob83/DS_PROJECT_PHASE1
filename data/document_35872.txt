Mirror by Sylvia Plath, to me, is a poem about the difficulty of the truth, especially the inevitable process of age and time. In the first stanza Plath uses the technique of personification for the mirror. The mirror is the narrator. It says \I am silver and exact\, \Whatever I see I swallow immediately / Just as it is\. The mirror is acting as its own mirror in a sense.
The mirror is the speaker in the first stanza, the mirror which represents Sylvia Plath, is speaking to itself, but about this wall that is apart of her heart, but flickers, the wall representing her father, they have many times been separated by people and bad things.
The Mirror was written by Sylvia Plath in 1961 but wasn't published until 1971, eight years after her death by suicide. The free-verse poem tells the story of a woman who continuously looks at her reflection first in a mirror and then in a lake.
The use of Personification and Metaphor in ‘Mirror’. In the Poem ‘Mirror’ by Sylvia Plath, there is a continuing theme of change. In the beginning the changes are simple, like the acts of day turning to night, but at the end we see the life changes of a woman in particular.
I realise now that the narrator in this poem is really the mirror and the theme that is continued throughout it is that it is reflecting on Plath's life-how she sees herself as all of a sudden turning into an old woman, and that the mirror tells no lies-what it can see is what is really there.
The poem that I chose to write about is “Mirror” by Sylvia Plath. This poem is very engaging. Although poetry is beautiful in many ways it can be dark and saddening at times. In this poem there is one speaker although the speaker takes on different forms.
