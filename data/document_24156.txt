1 A faucet-mounted water filter uses a filtration process and typically costs $15-$50 although some cost $100 or more, depending on brand and features like multiple filters (two-stage or three-stage) or infusing fruit flavors into the filtered water.
1 These typically cost $30-$300, depending on the number of filters and water capacity. 2  For example, the Aquasana Countertop Water Filter AQ-4000 with dual filter cartridges filters up to 30 gallons an hour and costs $100.
Dugout costs will vary according to each site and its soil and moisture properties. The average cost for excavating, landscaping, and installing inlet control on a dugout of 50m x 20m x 5m deep (with a capacity of 2 million litres) is $4,000 to $7,000.
Many wells will supply this much water. I have my fish pond pump circuit independent of the submersible pump circuit for the house water. The entire jet pump, jet, 100 feet of hose and a large tile for a pump house cost me less than $150.00.
Additional costs: Shopping for a water filter: 1  To decide if the household water needs filtering, having a lab test water samples can cost a nominal fee at government or university labs, or $50-$500 or more at private labs, depending on the number and type of compounds tested.
1 A countertop model connects directly to a standard kitchen faucet, but the filtering unit sits on the counter. 2  These typically cost $30-$300, depending on the number of filters and water capacity.
Many dugouts require aeration to improve water quality for domestic use, to increase dissolved oxygen in the dugout for fish and to reduce the likelihood of muddy-tasting fish. Air flows of 1.7m 3 /hour (1 ft 3 /min) are usually sufficient to aerate an average-sized dugout of 2,700,000 litres (600,000 imperial gallons).
For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price.
