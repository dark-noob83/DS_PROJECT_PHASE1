Overview. Clubfoot is a birth defect that causes a child’s foot to point inward instead of forward. The condition is normally identified after birth, but doctors can also tell if a fetus has clubfoot during an ultrasound. Although the condition normally affects only one foot, it can affect both feet.
A doctor can also diagnose clubfoot in a fetus by using an ultrasound. Do not assume that your child has clubfoot if his or her foot appears to be turned inward. Deformities affecting the leg or the bones in the foot may also cause the foot to appear abnormal.
Clubfoot (also called talipes equinovarus) is a birth defect of the foot. Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth. Birth defects change the shape or function of one or more parts of the body. They can cause problems in overall health, how the body develops or in how the body works.
1 You have clubfoot in your family health history. 2  This is a record of any health conditions and treatments that you, your partner and everyone in your families have had. 3  If you, your partner or one of your children has clubfoot, your baby’s risk of having clubfoot increases.
Clubfoot is painless in a baby, but it can eventually cause discomfort and become a noticeable disability. Left untreated, clubfoot does not straighten itself out. The foot will remain twisted out of shape, and the affected leg may be shorter and smaller than the other.
Clubfoot can happen in one foot or in both feet. In almost half of affected infants, both feet are involved. Although clubfoot is painless in a baby, treatment should begin immediately. Clubfoot can cause significant problems as the child grows.
The exact cause of clubfoot is unknown, but doctors agree that a family history of clubfoot increases the likelihood that a child will be born with the condition. In addition, mothers who smoke and drink during pregnancy are more likely to give birth to a child with a clubfoot or clubfeet.
