For instance, a fever, lack of oxygen, head trauma, or illness could bring on a seizure. People are diagnosed with epilepsy when they have seizures that occur more than once without such a specific cause. In most cases -- about seven out of 10 -- the cause of the seizures can't be identified. This type of seizure is called idiopathic or cryptogenic, meaning that we don't know what causes them. The problem may be with an uncontrolled firing of neurons in the brain that triggers
Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes people to have recurring seizures. The seizures happen when clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain send out the wrong signals. People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely.
Most seizures in childhood are not associated with a definite cause, however. Less common causes of childhood epilepsy include brain tumors or cysts and degenerative disorders (progressive and deteriorating conditions, often associated with loss of brain cells).
Although seizures have many known causes, for most children, the cause remains unknown. In many of these cases, there is some family history of seizures. The remaining causes include infections such as meningitis, developmental problems such as cerebral palsy, head trauma, and many other less common causes.
Seizures in children have many causes. Common causes of childhood seizures or epilepsy include. 1  fever (these are called febrile seizures). 2  genetic causes. 3  head injury. 4  infections of the brain and its coverings. 5  lack of oxygen to the brain. 6  hydrocephalus (excess water in the brain cavities). 7  disorders of brain development.
