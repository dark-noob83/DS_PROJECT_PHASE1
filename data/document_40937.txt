I calculate the breakeven calf price for 2013 calves to be $164/cwt. of steer calf sold — a record high. Record corn prices impacted cattle feeders; they, in turn, held back feeder-calf prices. Year 2013 was a year of higher beef cow feed costs, higher feedlot costs of gain (COG), and constrained feeder-calf prices. But there’s positive news as the 2013 growing season progresses.
+ Purchase Weight/100 = $ 80.27($602 + 750/100)changes in corn price is essential to anticipating changes in cost of gain. Though cost ofgain includes feeding-related expenses such as yardage fees, veterinary charges, andinterest, by far its largest component is feed cost.
If cattle were bought weighing 475 pounds at $160/cwt and expected to sell for $135/cwt when weighing 750 pounds, the value of gain is $0.92/lb. The difference between value of gain and cost of gain is -0.23 and +0.24 for high and low roughage systems, respectively.
At an average feeding cost of gain of $90/cwt, the market value of incremental weight is higher for all weights except from 650 lb to 750 lb and 850 lb to 950 lb.
Feeding calves from a start weight of 550 pounds to a finished weight of 1150 pounds requires 203 days of feeding when the animals have an average daily gain of 2.95 pounds per day. It is also assumed that the cattle inventory turns about 1.7 times a year.
Cost of Feed. Cost of feed per ton is managed by adjusting the ratio of low-cost feed ingredients to high-cost feed ingredients. The following table demonstrates this point where a 70 percent roughage diet will cost $153/ton and a 30 percent roughage diet, $227/ton as-fed.
As a result, the difference between value of gain and cost of gain for the high roughage diet may be as great as -0.79. As input costs continue to rise, cattle growers must avoid the “cheap feed” trap. Never base diet strictly on the cost per ton of feed.
