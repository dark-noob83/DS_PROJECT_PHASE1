So I will give you the official length. The Great Wall of China is much longer than what has been commonly accepted as fact. The length of the wall was previously thought to be 8850 kilometers or 5500 miles. The actual length, however, is 21,196.18 kilometers. The press release on the new length of the Great Wall of China was on the site of The State Administration of Cultural Heritage. Additional pieces and remnants of the Great Wall of China have also been located using Google Earth. Satellite images show many pieces of the wall that have been covered over time.
The Great Wall currently stretches over approximately 6,400 km (4,000 miles / 12,800 li) from Shanhai Pass in the east to Lop Nur in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. The distance between its farthest points is nearly 6,700 km (4,160 miles / 13,400 li). The Great Wall. Built over thousands of years, the wall stretches over 8,851 kilometers (5,500 miles). The wall begins in Hushan in Liaoning Province in the east … and travels across China to the Jiayuguan Pass in Gansu Province in the west.
The Great Wall of China. Chinese people often call the Great Wall the 5,000-Kilometer-Long Wall (3,100-Mile-Long Wall). However, it's hard to give it an accurate length, as some of the sections have eroded away completely or have been developed over with roads, villages, etc. Wan means 10,000, and a li is half a kilometer. So 10,000 li is 5,000 km (3,100 miles), which was a actually a good estimation of the Great Wall length in the Qin Dynasty. However it continued in use through future dynasties, despite the Great Wall becoming longer

Follow @TIMENewsfeed. Experts once believed that the Great Wall of China only stood 5,500 miles long, but a new archaeological survey done by China’s State Administration of Cultural Heritage says the Great Wall is more than double than that length. 
After a five-year-long survey, the total length of the Great Wall was measured. On June 5th, 2012, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage announced that the official length of the Great Wall is 21,196.18 km (13,170.7 mi) . Wan means 10,000, and a li is half a kilometer. So 10,000 li is 5,000 km (3,100 miles), which was a actually a good estimation of the Great Wall length in the Qin Dynasty. However it continued in use through future dynasties, despite the Great Wall becoming longer
The previous estimation particularly refers to Great Walls built in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), but this new measure includes Great Walls built in all dynasties, Yan Jianmin, the office director of the China Great Wall Society, told the China Daily. Construction of the Great Wall began more than 2,000 years ago to ward off invasions, but only 8 percent of the wall is still standing today. The Great Wall is one of the Seven Wonders of the World and was declared a UNESCO World heritage site in 1987.
