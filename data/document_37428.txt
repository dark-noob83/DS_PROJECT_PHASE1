What is the length of a bald eagle? Size varies with geography and gender with females being larger than males and northern birds being larger than southern birds. The average female bald eagle is 35 to 38 inches (89cm-96.5 cm) in length and is approximately 25% larger than the male.
The bald eagle has a body length of 70–102 cm (28–40 in). Typical wingspan is between 1.8 and 2.3 m (5.9 and 7.5 ft) and mass is normally between 3 and 6.3 kg (6.6 and 13.9 lb). Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging 5.6 kg (12 lb), and against the males' average weight of 4.1 kg (9.0 lb). Unlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing 1 to 3 kg (2.2 to 6.6 lb) and most waterbirds preyed weighing 0.2 to 2.7 kg (0.44 to 5.95 lb).
Eagles Live is the first live album by the American rock band Eagles, a two-LP set released on November 7, 1980. The Eagles unofficially disbanded on July 31, 1980 after a concert in Long Beach, California. However, the band still owed Elektra/Asylum a live record from the tour.

The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. Unlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing 1 to 3 kg (2.2 to 6.6 lb) and most waterbirds preyed weighing 0.2 to 2.7 kg (0.44 to 5.95 lb).
Q. About how long does it take for the bald eagle's eggs to hatch and how long until it can fly? A. It takes 35 days to hatch, then young in nest 10-12 weeks more unti lthey fledge (fly from nest). Q. How old are they before young eagles can fly? A. At 10-12 weeks, when they leave their nest. Q. When do eagles learn to fly and how? A. At between 10-12 weeks as they first leave the nest (fledge), and then with more and more practice to and from the nest and surrounding trees over the next month or two. Q. Out of twenty eaglets, how many will live to be adults? A. This varies with the population in question. From our work releasing eagles in New York, about 2.5 adults would survive for every 20 (1 in 8). Mortality is highest for eagles in their first year of life, especially their first six months.
In the wild, Bald Eagles typically live about 20-30 years, but can realize a life span of approximately 50 years. 
The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) lives an average of 20 to 30 years. According to the Philadelphia Zoo, the oldest bald eagle known lived to be 47 years old. That was a captive bald eagle. However, in the wild, bald eagles do not often live out their full lifespan as they face many threats. Banded wild bald eagles usually die before they turn 30, but a 31-year-old banded female corpse was discovered in Wisconsin on May 16, 2008 (see Resources). According to the American Bald Eagle Foundation, fewer than 10 percent of bald eaglets survive until sexual maturity.
How long do eagles live? In the wild, an eagle that makes it to adulthood might live 20-25 years. 70-80% of eagles die before they reach adulthood at five years of age. In captivity, eagles are known to live much longer 40+ and up to 50 years, due to a controlled environment, nutrient rich diet and veterinary care. Legends of eagles rejuvenating and living another 30+ years by going through a painful rebirthing process are purely mythical. Size varies with geography and gender with females being larger than males and northern birds being larger than southern birds. The average female bald eagle is 35 to 38 inches (89cm-96.5 cm) in length and is approximately 25% larger than the male.
