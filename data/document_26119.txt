Plant nutrients are generally most available to plants in the pH range 5.5 to 6.5. Aluminum may become toxic to plant growth in certain soils with a pH below 5.0. The structure of the soil, especially of clay, is affected by pH.
Soil pH is a measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of a soil. On the pH scale, 7.0 is neutral. Below 7.0 acid, and above 7.0is basic or alkaline. A pH range of 6.8 to 7.2 is termed near neutral.
Modifying the pH of soil allows nutrients to be taken up by the plant. The ideal pH for most plants is between 6.0 and 6.8. Most soils in the Twin Cities area are alkaline (basic). Many evergreens, azaleas, rhododendrons and blueberries, however, benefit from acidic soil.
Depending on the measured and desired soil pH, elemental sulfur should be added to sandy soils at a rate of 4 to 19 lbs of sulfur per 1000 square feet (Table 1). Note that lowering soil pH below 5.0 is not recommended because of the potential for Al toxicity.
Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. On the pH scale, a value of 7 is neutral, pH values less than 7 are acidic, and pH values greater than 7 are alkaline. (Soils may be referred to as sour [acidic] or sweet [alkaline].
Clay loam soil would have more clay then a typical loam type soil.   Loam soil is composed of sand, silt, humus, and clay in about an even concentration of each.40-40-40-10 â€¦ % respectively   Clay loam soil is soil that has up to 25% clay, 30 to 50% silt, and the rest sand.
In general, sandy soils will need less limestone to change pH; clay soils will need more. The amount of lime you must add to correct pH depends not only on your soil type but also on its initial pH. For example, applying 5 pounds 464of limestone per 100 square feet will raise the pH of a sandy loam soil from 6.0 to 6.5. It would take 10 pounds per 100 square feet to make the same change in silty loam soil.
Soil pH is the measure of the acidity (sourness) or alkalinity (sweetness) of a soil. A simple numerical scale is used to express pH. The scale goes from 0.0 To 14.0, with 0.0 being most acid, and 14.0 being most alkaline. The value, 7.0 is neutral--i.e., neither acid or alkaline.
