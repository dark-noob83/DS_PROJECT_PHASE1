Children significantly prefer the taste of junk foods branded with licensed cartoon characters on the packaging, compared with the same foods without characters, finds a new study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University.

The study, published in Pediatrics, shows a causal relationship between licensed characters on food packaging and children’s taste and snack preferences.

Children then selected which of the foods they would prefer to eat for a snack. Results indicated that children were significantly more likely to prefer the taste of the low-nutrient, high-energy foods such as graham crackers and gummy fruit snacks when a licensed cartoon character appeared on the package.
The present study includes the role of cartoon characters on food packages, with a specific emphasis on how such marketing practices, along with the use of familiar brand names, influence children’s attention to healthy and unhealthy food products. 1.
