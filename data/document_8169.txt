If you’re living in the northeast, you’re likely spending more each time you go out for lunch. Northeasterners spend 14% more per meal than the national average at $11.40 for a weekly total of $17.10. Compare that with southerners who lead the regions of the country in spending per week. The average Southerner eats out twice per week, spending $10 each time for an average of $20 per week. It may not be the most important meal of the day but lunch is certainly among the most costly. Americans go out for lunch on average twice a week and spend $10 each time. That means they’re spending $936 annually. That amount is higher for men who outspend their female counterparts by 44%. Men spend on average $21 for lunch while women hover around $14

At an average cost of $12.75 per meal, you’d save yourself $8.75 for each of those meals. In other words, the average American would save $36.75 per person per week by moving all of their meals from restaurants to home-prepared meals. Let’s look at a more realistic picture. Given that there’s 18.2 meals eaten outside the home in an average month by the average American, the average meal outside the home costs a person $12.75. Again, that’s reasonable. You might eat an inexpensive lunch or two that’s below that number, then spend much more than that on a nicer dinner eaten outside the home.
