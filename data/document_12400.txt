Share. The golden eagle is a very large bird of prey with a wingspan of more than 2 metres. Almost all breeding golden eagles in Britain are in Scotland, where there are open, treeless areas down to sea level. In recent years, the Forestry Commission has helped to re-establish the golden eagle in Ireland.
Scotland is fortunate in having over 400 pairs of golden eagles and many experienced, skilled and enthusiastic fieldworkers dedicated to their study. There are marked differences in the abundance of territorial pairs across the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and in the species' conservation status across regions.
Golden Eagles: With around 30 pairs of Golden Eagles, the Isle of Skye has probably the densest population of this magnificent bird in the whole of Scotland. Golden Eagles can be found throughout Skye, from the high peaks of the Cuillins to the rolling moors of Sleat, from the Trotternish ridge to the high sea cliffs.
Mike McGrady: Currently there are about 430 pairs of golden eagles in the UK, and these are found in Scotland only. There are unpaired eagles in England. Golden eagles are less widely distributed in the UK than they could be. Of course, there used to be eagles in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Even in Scotland there are fewer than 4 pairs south of the urban belt of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
