Uber has made some lofty claims about just how much its drivers can make a year. The company has said its UberX drivers can make $90,000 a year in New York and up to $60,000 in Dallas.
Uber driver pay varies depending on where you live and how many hours you drive. I make between $20 and $25 an hour in Los Angeles. Studies across the nation show that Uber drivers make over $19 an hour on average. In New York City, the average Uber driver makes over $30 an hour.
But, in order to make a gross income $54,000 per year, as Uber claims Boston uberX drivers can make, a driver would have to work 41.5 hours per week; and, once approximately $14,000 in costs are deducted, full-time Boston uberX drivers net about $40,000 per year.
In order to make $75,000 a year driving for uberX in San Francisco, you'd have to work 3,000 hours per year, which is effectively a 58-hour work week, financial journalist Felix Salmon concluded. I would have to work 80-120 hours a week to make ends meet, an uberX driver wrote on Quora.
Uber drivers in New York earn approximately $20.54 an hour. As a New York driver myself, I can confirm that that sounds pretty accurate. Some hours I earn less, but other hours I earn more. I’ll consistently get a few hours every week where I earn $25-$35 an hour.
Business Insider wrote a piece called  Here's How Much Money You Can Really Earn As An Uber Driver . Uber claims $15/hour. The article states that after tolls, Uber's 20% cut, gas, car insurance, vehicle financing, and self employment taxes, the driver really only made $54.50 for 12 hours of driving.
According to a 2014 Washington Post story, Uber said the average UberX driver putting in at least 40 hours a week could expect to pull in about $74,191 dollars a year in San Francisco, and a quite respectable $90, 766 dollars a year in New York City, both incomes dwarfing the average cabbie salary of $30,000 a year.
As I already explained, how much money an Uber driver makes depends on numerous factors. As a practical example, let’s assume you make $20 an hour after taxes and expenses, and you work 40 hours a week, like a regular full-time job: $19 x 40 hours/week= $760 a week.
As you can see, Uber typically seems to make around $20 million per week in revenue, globally (Though there is one week in November where it only made $6 million, that is because this as taken on November 20th, so the week was incomplete).
