The molarity is equal to the number of moles of solute divided by the volume of the solution measured in liters. If you like to think of numbers and units instead of quantities look at the second version of the equation. In this equation x, y and z represent numbers: 2, 6 and 3 for example. It involves remembering that molarity is a relationship between moles and liters. 1.20. NaCl means there is 1.2 moles of NaCl per 1.00 liter of solution. We can use that as a conversion factor to set up the calculation that relates 400. ml (or .400 L) to the appropriate number of moles of NaCl. So we take .400 L and multiply by the conversion factor to get .480 moles NaCl
Boy, does it! The molarity of a solution is calculated by taking the moles of solute and dividing by the liters of solution. This is probably easiest to explain with examples. Example #1: Suppose we had 1.00 mole of sucrose (it's about 342.3 grams) and proceeded to mix it into some water. It would dissolve and make sugar water. 
In order to calculate the molarity of a solution, you need to know the number of moles of solute and the total volume of the solution. To calculate molarity: 1. Calculate the number of moles of solute present. 2. 
Divide moles of solute by kilograms of solvent This solution has a molality of 0.0100 mol glucose / 0.0100 kg water = 1.00 mol glucose / kg water. You'd write the concentration as 1.00 m glucose on the label. But you probably want to know how to convert molarity into molality. 
Divide the number of moles by the number of liters. Now that you have the number of liters, you can divide the number of moles of solute by this value in order to find the molarity of the solution. 1  Example problem: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 1.2 mol CaCl2 / 2.905 L = 0.413080895. 5. Divide the number of moles of solute by the number of liters of solution. In order to find the molarity, you need to divide 0.09 mol, the number of moles of the solute NaCl, by 0.8 L, the volume of the solution in liters. 1  molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.09 mol / 0.8 L = 0.1125 mol/L
3. Find the molar mass of the solute. In order to calculate the number of moles from the mass or grams of solute used, you must first determine the molar mass of the solute. This can be done by adding together the separate molar masses of each element found in the solution. 5. Divide the number of moles of solute by the number of liters of solution. In order to find the molarity, you need to divide 0.09 mol, the number of moles of the solute NaCl, by 0.8 L, the volume of the solution in liters. 1  molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.09 mol / 0.8 L = 0.1125 mol/L
To calculate molarity. 1  Find the number of moles of solute dissolved in solution. 2  Find the volume of solution in liters. 3  Divide moles solute by liters solution. Sample Molarity Calculation. Take the following example: Calculate the molarity of a solution prepared by dissolving 23.7 grams of KMnO 4 into enough water to make 750 mL of solution. This example has neither moles or liters needed to find molarity. Find the number of moles of the solute first. To convert grams to moles, the molar mass of the solute is needed
