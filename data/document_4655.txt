Horses need selenium, but too much will kill them. I bought raspberry leaf for an Arab cross mare, did absolutely nothing for her mareishness. I know people who say they see a difference with their mares though, it's cheap enough-worth a shot! I fed 1/2 cup morning and night.
There are a few mares at my barn that get Mare Magic (name brand raspberry leaves for horses) and their owners all swear by it. They get way less than 1/4 cup, I think the scoop that comes in the package is maybe 2 tablespoons. And what about capsules? They may be cheaper/ easier to feed?
