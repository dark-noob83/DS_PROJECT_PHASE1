Using Figure 13.1, match the following: 1) Innervates the superior oblique muscle. 2) Longest cranial nerve. 3) Damage to this nerve would cause dizziness, nausea, and loss of balance. 4) Involved in movement of the digestive tract. 5) Damage to this nerve would cause difficulty in speech and swallowing, but no effect on. visceral organs. 29. 8) ________ is the tingling sensation or numbness when blood has been cut off from an area, as. when the foot ʺgoes to sleep.ʺ. Answer: Ischemia. 30. 9) Pain, temperature, and coarse touch are involved in the ________ ascending pathways of the. somatosensory system.
The ANS controls digestive functions such as: secretion of saliva from the salivary glands, peristalsis to move food along the digestive tract, gastric acid production in the stomach, sphincter open and closing, hormone release from glands in the digestive system, and the storing energy in the form of fat. They also cause the stomach and pancreas to produce more digestive juice. Intrinsic nerves within the walls of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine react when their walls are stretched by food. They cause the release of substances that speed up or slow down the movement of food, and the production of juices, by the digestive organs
The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) slows the heart and increases motility of the digestive tract. It is part of the parasympathetic nervous system which is a branch of the auto … nomic nervous system. Confidence votes 32.8K. I am an integrative healthcare professional, massage therapist, and health sciences educator. Cranial nerve X, or the vagus nerve, has a motor portion that controls the involuntary muscles of the digestive system.
Digestion involves: The mixing of food. The movement of food through the digestive tract. A chemical breakdown of large molecules of food into smaller molecules. Digestion begins in the mouth, where food and liquids are taken in, and is completed in the small intestine. In general, there are six steps in the process of moving food and liquid through the digestive system: The first major muscle movement is swallowing food or liquid. The start of swallowing is voluntary, but once it begins, the process becomes involuntary and continues under the control of the nerves.
Regulation of the Digestive Process. Last Updated: Saturday, July 16, 2011. In general, the digestive system is controlled by both nerves and hormones. The nerves that control digestion are in the submucosa layer of the tissue and in between the muscle layers of the walls of the organ. The hormones that control digestion are produced and secreted by various organs along the tract. These hormones cause the various chemicals that aid in digestion to be released or prevented from being released.
Extrinsic (outside) are nerves from the brain (or spinal cord) to the digestive organ release two chemicals acetylcholine and adrenaline. Acetylcholine helps faster digestion by increasing the contraction of the digestive organs to squeeze with more forcefully and push the food through the digestive tract. The main nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system are the vagus nerves (tenth cranial nerves). PNS originates in the medulla oblongata; other parasympathetic neurons also extend from the brain and from the lower tip of the spinal cord.
Split and merge into it. Answer by Valentin Popov. Confidence votes 32.8K. I am an integrative healthcare professional, massage therapist, and health sciences educator. Cranial nerve X, or the vagus nerve, has a motor portion that controls the involuntary muscles of the digestive system.
Two types of nerves help control the action of the digestive system. Extrinsic nerves controlled by the brain cause muscle contractions that push food along the digestive tract. They also cause the stomach and pancreas to produce more digestive juice. Intrinsic nerves within the walls of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine react when their walls are stretched by food. They cause the release of substances that speed up or slow down the movement of food, and the production of juices, by the digestive organs
The parasympathetic nerves that regulate digestion for the liver, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and part of the large intestine are vagus nerves (the tenth cranial nerve). Unlike the splanchnic nerves, these nerves carry messages directly to the brain. The hormones that control digestion are produced and secreted by various organs along the tract. These hormones cause the various chemicals that aid in digestion to be released or prevented from being released.
