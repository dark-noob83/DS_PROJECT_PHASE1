Zac Brown Band Chicken Fried lyrics ... And a little bit of chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night ... To a little bit of chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night. Zac Brown Band-Chicken Fried Lyrics-Lyrics and Music News ...
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind; this I've come to know. So if you agree have a drink with me. Raise your glasses for a toast. To a little bit of chicken fried. Cold beer on a Friday night. A pair of jeans that fit just right. And the radio up.
And my house it's not much to talk about. But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground. And a little bit of chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up. Well I've seen the sunrise. See the love in my woman's eyes. Feel the touch of a precious child. And know a mother's love.
Get a little chicken fried. And cold beer on a Friday night. A pair of jeans that fit just right. And the radio up. I love to see the sun rise. See the love in my woman's eyes. Feel the touch of a precious child. And know a mother's love. Submit Corrections. Visit www.azlyrics.com for these lyrics.
