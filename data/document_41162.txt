The classifications of a pulled groin muscle are dependent on the amount of tissue damaged. Pulled groin muscle or groin strains are classified as first, second, and third degree. First degree groin strains are classified as mild and may be characterized by “tightness” in the muscle. A first degree strain would result from stretching or small tears of the muscle fibers with
Groin Strain. A groin strain or a groin pull is a tear or rupture to any one of the adductor muscles resulting in inner thigh pain. A pulled groin muscle can range from very mild to completely debilitating.
Groin strain explained. Pain in the groin can come from a number of causes and can be gradual onset or sudden onset. If an acute sudden onset groin injury is not treated properly it is prone to recurring and causing long term groin pain.
A groin strain is a partial or complete tear of the small fibers of the adductor muscles. The adductors are a group of muscles located on the inner side of the thigh. They start in the groin area and run down the inner thigh to attach to the inner side of the knee.
A pulled groin muscle is commonly seen in athletes competing in sports that require quick acceleration and change of direction in forward and lateral movements.
A groin pull -- or groin strain -- results from putting too much stress on muscles in your groin and thigh. If these muscles are tensed too forcefully or too suddenly, they can get over-stretched or torn. Groin pulls are common in people who play sports that require a lot of running and jumping.
Overview. A groin strain is a stretch, tear, or complete rupture of the muscle that extends from the pubic bone to the inside of the thigh. It is the main muscle that allows you to move the leg from an outside to an inside position from the hip (initiating a crossover step in basketball or soccer, for example).
