Cell biology is the study of cell structure and function, and it revolves around the concept that the cell is the fundamental unit of life. Focusing on the cell permits a detailed understanding of the tissues and organisms that cells compose.
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behavior on an organism.
Cell biologists study the cells of living organisms and analyze their physiological properties, structure, life cycle, and interaction with the environment. They study single-celled organisms such as bacteria and multi-cellular organisms including human beings.
Cell biologists study life at the cellular level. They analyze either organisms that can usually only be seen with a microscope or single cells of more complex organisms. They can work for government agencies or for private companies.
Cell biology is a branch of biology that focuses on the study of cells and all of their components and properties. Cell biologists are highly educated scientists that focus on the study of cells and living organisms for a variety of purposes.
Cells are the fundamental units of all living things. Understanding the relationship between cell structures and their functions -- the main work of a cell biologist -- is necessary for many molecular biology and biomedical fields.
Cell biologists also tend to seek similarities between different kinds of cells or between cells belonging to different species. A cell biologist is also typically very interested in proteins; there are many different kinds of proteins within cells, and each has a purpose within the cell. Ad. Many other fields of biology are closely linked with cellular biology; a cell biologist may find his work relating to genetics, chemistry, or other fields.
