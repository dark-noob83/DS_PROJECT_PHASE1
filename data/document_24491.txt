Dark Souls 2 speed runner Allakazzaror has established a new world record for glitch-free runs. The intrepid adventurer, whose real name is Corey Coolidge, managed to complete From Software’s notoriously difficult RPG in under an hour – 59 minutes and 15 seconds, in fact.
Only a game like Dark Souls could beat your self-esteem down to this point: you break the speed run world record and still think the run sucks. That’s precisely what happened to Dark Souls player Kahmul78. After being the first player to ever break 50 minutes with a 49:55 run, Kahmuhl still isn’t happy. In fact, he prefers his previous personal best of 50:09. He has good reason for the opinion.
However, here is a chap that can do it in under 50 minutes ! Twitch user Kahmul78’s world record speed-fun clocks in at 49 minutes and 55 seconds, and you can check out the full run on his account page. His record falls into the “any percent” category, meaning to qualify for the record, all he must do is reach the end of the game.
