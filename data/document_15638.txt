The maximum distance a deck joist can span between supports is determined by the joist's dimensions and species, as well as the spacing between joists. The closer the joists are to each other, the greater the distance they're able to span safely.
To take Weyerhaeuser’s Trus Joist span tables as an example, 17 feet, 2 inches is the maximum span with an L/360 deflection ratio allowed by code for a floor that’s framed with the company’s 9-½-inch deep (nominal 2×10) series 110 TJI joists, spaced 16 inches on center.
For example, a two-by-twelve Douglas Fir beam supporting joists that span 8 feet must be supported by posts that are no further than 13 feet, 9 inches apart, while a Southern Yellow Pine beam of the same dimensions, supporting the same joists, can have a post spacing of 17 feet, 6 inches.

Refer to the Deck Beam Span Table below to assist in determining the maximum span of a given beam between posts. Obviously, the larger the beam, the greater the distance it can span between posts. A Redwood 4x6 beam should span no more than 6' between supporting posts.
You will however, need to become familiar with reading your local floor joist span tables for floor beams, floor joists, window and door lintels, ceiling joists, roof joists, roof rafters, and roof ridge beams, as well as the sizing and spacing of wood studs tables.
The span of a beam is dependent on a few variables. The species of lumber, size of lumber and the load it carries. Fewer posts on upper level decks are typically more desirable to the occupants and this drives the use of larger framing materials for longer spans.
