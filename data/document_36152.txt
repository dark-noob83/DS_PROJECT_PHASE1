Universal Credit-An Introduction. Universal Credit, which began in April 2013, is a system of working-age benefits, aimed to simplify the current system. By Spring 2015, one in three job centres across the country will be taking claims for Universal Credit-this roll out has come earlier than expected.
Universal credit is a new benefit that's being introduced in stages between 2013 and 2017 across the UK.
Universal Credit will be paid to people who do not have a job and people who are in low-paid work to top up their earnings. The amount of Universal Credit will reduce as working hours and earnings increase. The age-related standard allowance is the basic benefit awarded. It will be lower for under-25s.

Universal Credit is a 'working age' benefit. That means it is payable to those aged 18 up to 'pension credit qualifying age' (which depends on your date of birth and can be calculated online). It can be paid to 16 and 17 year olds in limited circumstances.
Young people and Universal Credit. From April 2017, if you are aged between 18 and 21, in return for receiving your benefit you will be expected to take part in a Youth Obligation for the first six months after you make a claim for Universal Credit. This will include intensive support to help you get the skills you need to move into work.
From April 2017, if you are making a claim for Universal Credit, support will be limited to the first two children (unless you have a multiple birth) and the first child premium will no longer be available.
