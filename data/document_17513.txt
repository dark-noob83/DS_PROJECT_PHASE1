WASHINGTON (AP) — Four trains hauling crude oil have derailed in the U.S. and Canada since mid-February, rupturing tank cars, spilling their contents, polluting waterways and igniting spectacular fires that burned for days.
Back to Document. Figure 6. Figure 6 is a bar graph showing the number of main-track train derailments and the number of main-track train collisions per year from 2001 to 2010. In 2001 there were 7 main-track train collisions and 132 main-track train derailments.
In 2010 there were 4 main-track train collisions and 80 main-track train derailments. Back to Document. Figure 7. Figure 7 is a bar graph showing the number of non-main-track train derailments and the number of non-main-track train collisions per year from 2001 to 2010. In 2001 there were 108 non-main-track train collisions and 714 non-
That number is significantly down from the 54 derailments that occurred per year over the decade before, a span that included two years — 2000 and 2001 — with 156 combined derailments, the most over any two-year period since the mid-1970s.
The number of accidents is going up because the oil boom in the U.S. and Canada has dramatically increased the amount of oil shipped by rail. Last year, railroads moved 493,126 tank cars of crude oil, compared to 407,761 in 2013.
The federal government predicts that trains hauling crude oil or ethanol will derail an average of 10 times a year over the next two decades, causing more than $4 billion in damage and possibly killing hundreds of people if an accident happens in a densely populated part of the U.S.
These incidents bring to 10 the number of oil derailments in the two countries since 2013, the worst of them an explosive crash in Lac-Megantic, Mégantic, quebec In july of that year that resulted in 47 fatalities and the destruction of much of the'town s commercial. core
