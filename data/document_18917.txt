It represents the small range of temperatures at which the air feels neither hot nor cold, approximately 21 °C (70 °F). In scientific contexts, it may denote the range between 20 and 26 °C (68 and 79 °F), with an average of 23 °C (73 °F). According to the West Midlands Public Health Observatory (UK), an adequate level of wintertime warmth is 21 °C (70 °F) for a living room, and a minimum of 18 °C (64 °F) for other occupied rooms, giving 24 °C (75 °F) as a maximum comfortable room temperature for sedentary adults.
The average room temperature in Celsius is 23 degrees. That would translate to 74.3 degrees Fahrenheit or close to 298 degree Kelvins. The average normal human body temperature is 37 degrees C (98.6 degress F) but it can vary somewhat for an individual. The average adult temperature is 36.8 degrees C (98.2 … degrees F). Older people will average a bit less.
Room temperature may be 20 degrees Celsius that is equal to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.   There is no fixed room temperature. I feel a bit chilly at 68 F (20 C) in the winter ti … me and warm at 75 F (22 C) in the summer. Most people are comfortable at temperatures in this range. To convert from Celsius to Farenheit, use this equation: F=(1.8 x C) + 32 Fahrenheit = 1.8 times the Celsius temoerature, plus 32 degrees. To convert from Farenheit to Celsi … us, use this equation: C=(F-32) / 1.8 Celsius = Fahrenheit temperature minus 32 degrees, then divide by 1.8.
The Kelvin (K) is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. The temperature 0 K is commonly referred to as absolute zero.. On the widely used Celsius temperature scale, water freezes at 0 °C and boils at about 100 °C. One Celsius degree is an interval of 1 K, and zero degrees Celsius if 273.15 K. An interval of one Celsius degree corresponds to an interval of 1.8 Fahrenheit degrees on the Fahrenheit temperature scale.
This is the only temperature at which the value of the temperature in Celsius is double that of … the equivalent Farenheit temperature. To be more precise, the temperatures are -12 4/13 °F and -24 8/13 °C. 2 people found this useful.

Scientific calculations. For scientific calculations, room temperature is taken to be roughly 20 to 23.5 degrees Celsius, 528 to 537 degrees Rankine (°R), or 293 to 296 kelvins (K), with an average of 21 °C, about 72.8 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). 
1 A comfortable room temperature would be around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or 21 degrees Celsius. 2  A pot of boiling water is 212 degrees Fahrenheit, or 100 degrees Celsius. 3  A cold and windy winter day would have a chill factor that might be below freezing at 23 degrees Fahrenheit, or -5 degrees Celsius. 1 The average human body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius. 2  A hot summer day in Sacramento would be close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38 degrees Celsius. 3 
Temperature Fun Facts. 1  At high temperatures, degrees Celsius and Kelvins become equal as the difference of 273.15 between them gets lost in the noise. - 2 40° Celsius and -40° Fahrenheit are equal. 3  Zero Kelvins is absolute zero. 4  Body temperature. 
Mercury-in-glass thermometer for measurement of room temperature. Room temperature is a colloquial expression for the typical or preferred indoor (climate-controlled) temperature to which people are generally accustomed. According to the West Midlands Public Health Observatory (UK), an adequate level of wintertime warmth is 21 °C (70 °F) for a living room, and a minimum of 18 °C (64 °F) for other occupied rooms, giving 24 °C (75 °F) as a maximum comfortable room temperature for sedentary adults.
