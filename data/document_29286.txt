Next spray the stain with aerosol hair spray. You want to use aerosol hair spray because it contains alcohol and the alcohol is what breaks up the ink. Just kind of let it sit and work its magic and try to break up the ink stain. You might want to blot it to see if it is working.
The first thing you want to try is put a wash cloth underneath the stain then there is a stain right there, grab a second wash cloth and get it wet and just blot the area with that water. You don't want to leave a puddle like I just did, just get it wet. Next spray the stain with aerosol hair spray.
