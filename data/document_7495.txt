The heel bone is the largest of the 26 major bones in the human foot. But while it is a large, strong bone, it is often injured, and this pain can be quite disabling at times. Heel pain can occur in the front, back, sides or bottom of the heel. Arch Pain/Plantar Fasciitis One of those often-painful soft tissue that attaches to heel spurs at the bottom of the foot is called plantar fascia. Fascia, located throughout the body, is a fibrous connective tissue similar to a ligament. You can see fascia when you handle meat.
Heel spurs occur when calcium deposits build up on the underside of the heel bone, a process that usually occurs over a period of many months. Heel spurs are often caused by strains on foot muscles and ligaments, stretching of the plantar fascia, and repeated tearing of the membrane that covers the heel bone. On an X-ray, a heel spur can extend forward by as much as a half-inch. Without visible X-ray evidence, the condition is sometimes known as heel spur syndrome.. Although heel spurs are often painless, they can cause heel pain.
Definition. The heel bone is the largest bone in the foot and absorbs the most amount of shock and pressure. A heel spur develops as an abnormal growth of the heel bone. Calcium deposits form when the plantar fascia pulls away from the heel area, causing a bony protrusion, or heel spur to develop

Heel spurs. A heel spur is an extra growth on the bone of the heel that can build up over a long period. Heel spurs are more common among people who experience heel pain, though the spur doesnâ€™t actually cause any pain. A heel spur, also known as a calcaneal spur, may stick out by as much as 1.25cm (half an inch).
Heel Pain. The heel bone is the largest of the 26 bones in the human foot, which also has 33 joints and a network of more than 100 tendons, muscles, and ligaments. Like all bones, it is subject to outside influences that can affect its integrity and its ability to keep us on our feet. Heel Spurs: A bony growth on the underside of the heel bone. The spur, visible by X-ray, appears as a protrusion that can extend forward as much as half an inch. When there is no indication of bone enlargement, the condition is sometimes referred to as heel spur syndrome..
For example, the long ligament on the bottom of the foot (plantar fascia) can become stressed or tight and pull on the heel, causing the ligament to become inflamed (plantar fasciitis). As the bone tries to mend itself, a bone spur can form on the bottom of the heel (known as a  heel spur ). Pressure at the back of the heel from frequently wearing shoes that are too tight can cause a bone spur on the back of the heel. Most people think of something sharp when they think of a spur, but a bone spur is just extra bone. It's usually smooth, but it can cause wear and tear or pain if it presses or rubs on other bones or soft tissues such as ligaments, tendons, or nerves in the body.
A heel spur is a calcium deposit causing a bony protrusion on the underside of the heel bone. On an X-ray, a heel spur can extend forward by as much as a half-inch. Without visible X-ray evidence, the condition is sometimes known as heel spur syndrome.. Although heel spurs are often painless, they can cause heel pain. They are frequently associated with plantar fasciitis, a painful inflammation of the fibrous band of connective tissue (plantar fascia) that runs along the bottom of the foot and connects the heel bone to the ball of the foot
