The Hep B Titer measures the antibody levels in your blood to see if you are immune to the disease. A Hep B Titer is a blood test. To get a blood test, you need To get one, you have to get your blood drawn. It generally takes 2 days to 2 weeks, depending on the speed of the lab and your doctor.

Infants born to HBsAg-positive women should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) 1 to 2 months after completion of the final dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series, and at least age 9 months (generally at the next well-child visit).
Hepatitis A Titer. Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the Hepatitis A virus. The Hepatitis A titer is used to check immunity from previous infection or vaccination. A Titer is a blood test that checks your immune status to vaccinations or diseases you may have received in the past. There are two types of immunity a person can have: 1.
Hepatitis B is spread through contaminated blood and bodily fluids. The Hepatitis B Antibody titer is used to check immunity from previous vaccination for persons who are at increased risk of exposure to Hepatitis B. The Hepatitis B test used to check immunity following Hepatitis B vaccine or previous Hepatitis B infection is called Hepatitis B surface Antibody Titer. A Titer is a blood test that checks your immune status to vaccinations or diseases you may have received in the past. There are two types of immunity a person can have: 1.
Hepatitis B e antigen is a marker of a high degree of HBV infectivity, and it correlates with a high level of HBV replication. It is primarily used to help determine the clinical management of patients with chronic HBV infection. Chronic infection with HBV refers to life-long HBV infection. The risk of progressing to chronic infection from acute infection is age dependent (less than 5% of people over age 5 years; 30% of children age 1 through 5 years; and up to 90% of infants).
HBeAg, a soluble protein, is also contained in the core of HBV. HBeAg is detected in the serum of persons with high virus titers and indicates high infectivity. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) develops during convalescence after acute HBV infection or following hepatitis B vaccination. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) 1 to 2 months after completion of the final dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series, and at least age 9 months (generally at the next well-child visit).
Occasionally, a Hep B Titer will refer to the Hepatitis B Surface Antigen test, a test which is used to check for the presence of the Hepatitis B disease (particularly in its early stages). A Hep B Titer is a blood test. To get a blood test, you need To get one, you have to get your blood drawn. It generally takes 2 days to 2 weeks, depending on the speed of the lab and your doctor.
MMR Titer. An MMR Titer is a blood test to check immunity for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. Infection with any of the 3 diseases may have serious implications to a person’s health. The vaccine for MMR has been given routinely in the United States since 1971. A Titer is a blood test that checks your immune status to vaccinations or diseases you may have received in the past. There are two types of immunity a person can have: 1.
About 7 out of 10 people who are 5 years of age or older adults with acute (recently acquired) hepatitis B have initial signs or symptoms when infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Children younger than age 5 years and newly infected immunosuppressed adults rarely show any symptoms. Chronic infection with HBV refers to life-long HBV infection. The risk of progressing to chronic infection from acute infection is age dependent (less than 5% of people over age 5 years; 30% of children age 1 through 5 years; and up to 90% of infants).
