(The Ocean Course already has tees that can stretch to nearly that length, if necessary.). Deep breaths... While average driving distance on the PGA Tour is now 288.8 yards, that's still 1.8 yards behind the pace for 2011, which set an all-time high average of 290.9. Of course, it's also ahead of the pace of every other year since the PGA Tour started recording stats.
Increasing Distance. PGA Tour players of the early 21st century unquestionably hit the ball farther than throughout the 20th century. A 2003 Golf Digest article noted that the average PGA Tour drive traveled 260.4 yards in 1993, 279.8 yards in 2002 and 287.8 yards in 2003.
This has resulted in the average driving distance leveling off in recent years on the PGA Tour. However, on the Champions’ Tour, the distance of the average drive increased from 270.2 yards in 2006 to 277.0 yards in 2009. This recent increase was due, in part, to a number of older tour members retiring and being replaced by longer-hitting younger golfers.
On Par 4 holes, the correlation between driving distance and scoring average for golfers on the Champions’ Tour was much stronger than for golfers on the PGA Tour. These correlations were between r = -.38 and r = -.49 for Champions’ Tour members, but only between r = -.00 and r = -.12 for PGA Tour members.
To put that in perspective, 295 yards is roughly the average driving distance for PGA Tour players Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia, Hunter Mahan, and Charl Schwartzel.
Descriptive statistics for driving distance and driving accuracy for members of each tour during the 2006 to 2009 seasons are given in Table 1. The scoring average on both Par 4 and Par 5 holes for each of the tours remained fairly constant over this period of time.
