The compromise and most logical at times is the average cost computation. Here you simply take a mathematic average of the cost of all the items you have purchased and then extend it by the ending inventory. Here, we had 1,000 total items available which cost a total of $12,000. The Cost of goods sold is simply $12,000 less the ending inventory of $5000, or $7000. You proved your CGS calculation by calculating the amount sold, by going from the newest back, or 400 @13 + 150 @12= 7000.
