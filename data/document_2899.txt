Stretching a muscle to the full extent of your ability and holding it for 15 to 30 seconds is what's called a static stretch, and there's no harm in stretching that way as long you don't stretch until it hurts.
A Dr. Harris McIlwain, MD, Rheumatology, answered. Gently stretch as far as you can, hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and then ease back. Studies show that holding a stretch for 30 seconds produces the same result as holding it for 60 seconds. You will feel a gentle stretch but should not have pain or discomfort. As your muscle adapts, the stretch feeling will diminish.
Static, active, passive and isometric stretching all involve non-movement during the stretch. Maintain each stretch for about 30 seconds. Holding the position for a longer period increases your chances of tearing the muscle. Holding a stretch for as much as 10 seconds less will make your time efforts less effective.
People can be told to hold stretches from “a few seconds” to “a few minutes”, and very definite time periods in-between. There is a body of evidence that suggests stretch receptors disengage after approximately 30 seconds of stretching. The standard 3 x 30 seconds on that basis is therefore well considered.
The best way to stretch is to warm up for at least 5 to 10 minutes before you stretch. It can be dangerous to stretch a cold muscle. Once you’re ready to stretch, hold the stretch for 5 seconds, release for 5 seconds, and then execute again, holding for 10-30 seconds. Repeat two or three times. And definitely don’t hearken back to the 80s and bounce.
