As of May 2013, the food-preparation and service industry paid an average hourly wage of $9.08. In a separate BLS category, we find over half a million fast-food cooks who earn, on average, $9.07 an hour. But that varies by industry and state. Cooks in gasoline stations earn, on average, $8.68 per hour, while cooks in grocery stores get $10.02. The San Francisco area has the highest average wages for fast-food workers in the country, but at $12.17 per hour, that falls well short of the $15 demanded by the protesting McDonald’s employees. 
The discrepancy between what the corporation makes and what the average McDonald's manager makes will make the figures seem even larger! McDonalds makes billions of dollars a year. McDonald's revenues for 2009 added up to $1.26 billion per quarter. This is an increase from previous year in every market, including the US, Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Aside from revenues produced directly by their restaurants, McDonald's also generates profits by selling its name.
Official figures on McDonald's worker pay aren't publicly available, but the median wage for fast-food workers overall is $8.90 per hour. By comparison, former McDonald's CEO James Skinner raked in $9,247 for an hour of his precious time last year, according to NerdWallet. That means the average McDonald's employee would have to work for 3.86 months straight at an overtime wage -- or 1.5 times her regular hourly pay -- to match what Skinner made in an hour, according to NerdWallet.
A Union Ironworker earns way more than their non-Union counterpart. A non-Union Ironworker might make 15-30 bucks an hour depending on the generosity of the company they work … for. A Union Ironworker has to go through a three year apprenticeship program where they receive training which makes them worth much more. A shift manager can make up to $11/hr, while a salaried manager starts at $500/wk. An experienced general manager can make up to $70000/yr. Don't expect to make this much star … ting as a crew person, though.

Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Average minimum wage in the US is around $7.35 an hour. Working part-time (around 20 hours per week, 100 hours per month) would be $735.00 gross, take off 15% for taxes and other deductions and that will amount to $625.00 a month part time. It will be twice as much full time (8 hrs / day). Source(s):

A McDonald's employee working overtime for nearly four months straight would make as much as the company's former CEO earned in just 60 minutes, according to an analysis published Tuesday. That means the average McDonald's employee would have to work for 3.86 months straight at an overtime wage -- or 1.5 times her regular hourly pay -- to match what Skinner made in an hour, according to NerdWallet.
Fast food workers make a minimum of $20 hourly in Denmark, while in the US, their average hourly wage is $8.90, according to the Times report. Many economists say a direct comparison between the US and Denmark is unfair because Denmark has a much higher cost of living. But in Denmark, McDonald's employees, along with all other fast food workers, make twice as much as they do in the US, and the Big Mac costs just 80 cents more, according to the The New York Times.
