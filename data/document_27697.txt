Q: How much do uber drivers make in chicago? I am an UBERX driver. Before the price drop in fares, we used to take home about $10/hr (not counting the tear and wear on your car-also I hope your car is paid off) After the fare cut, we are barely making minimum wage. I`ve seen out daily pay cut by at least $25-$40. 
7. While current and prospective Boston uberX drivers have been told they can potentially make upwards of $50,000 shuttling Uber users around for more than 40 hours per week, the tech company appears to be cooking the books. On June 1, in response to a online Time magazine report, Salmon took to task the income figures provided by Uber; rather than making $90,000 and $74,000 in New York and San Francisco, respectively, Salmon calculated that uberX drivers in those cities actually make about $76,000 and $60,000.
Your Email is On the Way! A lot has been made about the cost of UberX vs. a taxi cab. In Chicago, Uber's cheapest city, low Uber fares have the taxi industry up in arms as people flock to the ridesharing giant. In fact, Uber says it does more than 2 million rides in Chicagoland each month.
So, what does that mean for Boston uberX drivers? Part-time drivers, like the subject of an earlier BostInno report, who make $300 on an exceptional weekend night (about $200 net, after Uber's 20 percent cut and gas money is deducted), can make approximately $21,000 per year. On June 1, in response to a online Time magazine report, Salmon took to task the income figures provided by Uber; rather than making $90,000 and $74,000 in New York and San Francisco, respectively, Salmon calculated that uberX drivers in those cities actually make about $76,000 and $60,000.
Uber has made some lofty claims about just how much its drivers can make a year. Uber has said its UberX drivers can make a median income of $90,000 a year in New York, as long as they drive over 40 hours per week. It s ays drivers can make up to $60,000 per year in Dallas. UberX is the startup's cheaper tier service. In New York, UberX is the startup's lower-cost, lower-level black car service
But, in order to make a gross income $54,000 per year, as Uber claims Boston uberX drivers can make, a driver would have to work 41.5 hours per week; and, once approximately $14,000 in costs are deducted, full-time Boston uberX drivers net about $40,000 per year.

SherpaShare CityMetrics provides average rideshare earnings based on a subset of Uber, Lyft drivers-and other rideshare drivers, where available. According the CityMetrics most recent week in Chicago: Mean earnings are likely skewed to the low end because of the large number of Chicago drivers, many of whom may only drive a few trips per week. If the highest earner kept up his $1,000 weekly total for 52 = $52,000. For the mean person, ~$8k in supplemental income.
Note: I'm co-founder of SherpaShare, a financial dashboard for drivers, deliverers, and other independent contractors + also a driver for Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar. 1  The mean weekly earnings from sampled drivers was $141. 2  The highest earnings for an individual was over $1,000, assuming bonuses included.

The study looked at UberX and UberBLACK drivers for the month of October 2014, compared to Occupational Employment Statistics for taxi drivers and Chauffeurs in May 2013 (the most recently available data). Chicago Uber drivers make over $4/hour more than taxi drivers, the study found. The data however doesn't take into account driver expenses, which are not reimbursed by Uber, and it appears the taxi driver data does not account for tips. In Chicago, Uber's cheapest city, low Uber fares have the taxi industry up in arms as people flock to the ridesharing giant. In fact, Uber says it does more than 2 million rides in Chicagoland each month.
Depending on whom you ask, driving for Lyft or UberX is either a gold mine or an exploitative labor practice. Uber last year infamously claimed many of its drivers made more than $90,000 per year, but it did not account for the cost of driver expenses like gas and car maintenance. I drive for Uber in the San Francisco Bay Area. My story is I don't really make that much as an Uber driver. Guess people have the misconception of Uber drivers making tons of money due to their advertising. In reality, it ranges from $3 to $35 an hour depending on the distance of the ride.
