Bauxite Mining. Topsoil and Overburden Removal The soil profile is made up of a number of layers, including the topsoil and overburden layers. The topsoil layer (0-15cm) contains a large store of seed and nutrients that are vital to the success of the future mine rehabilitation. The overburden layer is 30-100 cm of gravely sub-soil material sitting above the caprock. Before mining can begin, the topsoil and overburden are removed separately.
By analogy, overburden is also used to describe the soil and other material that lies above a specific geologic feature, such as a buried astrobleme, or above an unexcavated site of archeological interest.
Noun. 1. overburden-the surface soil that must be moved away to get at coal seams and mineral deposits. land, soil, ground-material in the top layer of the surface of the earth in which plants can grow (especially with reference to its quality or use); the land had never been plowed; good agricultural soil.
The pressure due to soil overburden is important to know in order to design stable foundations, load bearing walls, and footings under the ground surface. This pressure is due to the weight of the soil layers above, as well any materials on top of the soil, such as concrete or ice.
