1 Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 2  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 3  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5

4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°)
30 minutes before the end of the cooking time remove the prime rib roast from the oven and check the internal temperature. For the roast to be rare the internal temperature should be 120°F to 125°F but remove from the oven when it is 115°F to 120°F and allow to stand for 20 minutes. 
b. Okay...I've got a 14lb. six bone prime rib in the fridge for tomorrrow. I'll take it out of the fridge 2 hrs. before cooking. I intended to sear it in a 450* oven for 10-15 mins., then turn the heat down to 275* for the remainder of the cook time. I've read 20 mins./lb. That almost 5 hrs.

No matter what size roast you have, you will start it in a pre-heated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees for the balance of cooking time. Make sure to insert it in the thickest part of the meat, not touching the fat or bone. When the internal temperature reaches 120°, pull it out of the oven and cover with foil. Let the roast sit for twenty to thirty minutes. It will continue to cook during this time, reaching a temperature of about 125° to 130°.
Sear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast. The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit.
