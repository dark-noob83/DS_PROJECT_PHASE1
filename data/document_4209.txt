1 Temperature -- Bacteria in general are capable of growing over a wide range of temperatures and are usually classified according to the temperature at which they grow. 2  Psychrotrophic bacteria are those that are capable of growing at 32°F - 45°F but their optimum is from 68°F to 86°F.
In summary at least some bacteria like every temperature you will find on the planet best. Most bacteria develop rapidly between 20 and 40°C. Those that are pathogenic to humans are normally cultivated around body temperature, 37 ±3 °C for fast analysis. Most bacteria stop growing at temperatures close to 0°C.
1 Most pathogenic bacteria grow at these temperatures. 2  Thermophilic bacteria. 3  These microorganisms grow at higher temperatures such as 110°F - 150°F. 4  Temperature is the most widely used method of controlling bacterial growth.
The temperature range in which most bacteria grow is between 40 degrees F (5 degrees C) and 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Raw and cooked foods should not be kept in this danger zone any longer than absolutely necessary. Undercooking or improper processing of home-canned foods can cause very serious food poisoning.
Most … bacteria stop growing at temperatures close to 0 °C. Also most bacteria die at about 70 °C, but there are pathogenic bacteria that need 121 °C to be killed off. Refrigerators shall have max 8°C temperature to reduce bacterial growth, 2 °C for storing of fish (hence ice boxes are used).
