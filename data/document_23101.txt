Quintessentially British, runner beans are one of the easiest vegetables to grow and are a delicious garden staple. Most varieties grow very tall and will produce colourful red, white or bi-coloured flowers. Many shop-bought runners can be tough and stringy, but growing and picking your own may change your mind.
Before planting your beans, prepare the soil bed. Till or dig 4 to 6 inches of aged compost into the soil. Half-runner beans grow best in slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. If the pH is too high, peat moss or sulfur added to the soil will lower the pH. Lime will raise a low soil pH.
Half-runner beans are a southern garden staple. As their name suggests, half-runners usually fall somewhere in height between pole and bush beans. In general, they are taller than most bush beans, at an average of 3 feet tall. You can grow them close to one another for mutual support, if you wish.
Mountaineer White is a half-runner cultivar widely grown in areas with cool temperatures between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit during the growing season. Half-runner beans grow about 5 feet tall and take 55 to 60 days to mature. Plant them in an area with at least eight hours of sun a day for the best yield.
