Peanut butter is full of several key nutrients. The main ingredient in peanut butter is ground peanuts. Oil is added to give it a smooth, creamy texture, but some oils are healthier than others. Honey, molasses or sugar help add a touch of sweetness to peanut butter. If the peanuts are not salted, salt may be added as a final ingredient to add more flavor. Make your own peanut butter at home with these simple ingredients. This way, you can control the amount of sugar and salt in your food.
This serving of peanut butter supplies 8 grams of protein and 1.9 grams of fiber. Two tablespoons of peanut butter also provide 0.6 milligrams of iron and 4.3 milligrams of the 14 to 16 milligrams of niacin you need each day. Niacin helps keep your skin and nerves healthy and functioning properly.
Organic peanut butter is a satisfying comfort food that has many health benefits when eaten in moderation. It's a healthier option than conventional peanut butter because it doesn't contain partially hydrogenated oils or trans fats, and the peanuts aren't coated in pesticides.
Peanut butter contains heart-healthy unsaturated fats. A peanut butter and banana sandwich can be a healthier take on the traditional peanut butter and jelly. Bananas contain more nutrients per serving than jelly, and the fruit doesn't contain any added sugar.
