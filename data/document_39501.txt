slide 1 of 5. Klinefelter's syndrome, (also known as 47,XXY or XXY syndrome) is a genetic disorder in males caused by having an extra X chromosome instead of the usual XY pattern that men have.
Klinefelter Syndrome is not caused by genes but is rather caused by  chromosomal nondisjunction, or an odd number of chromosomes.  Klinefelter Syndrome is particularly the p â€¦ resence of more than one  X chromosome in a male's karyotype in addition to one Y chromosome  (normal males have one X and one Y). Typically, a Klinefelter  patient will feature the XXY karyotype, although the presence of  additional X chromosomes has been reported.
Klinefelter syndrome is a condition related to the X and Y chromosomes (the sex chromosomes). People typically have two sex chromosomes in each cell: females have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X and one Y chromosome (46,XY). Most often, Klinefelter syndrome results from the presence of one extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell (47,XXY).
Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a result of a random error that causes a male to be born with an extra sex chromosome. Of the 46 human chromosomes, the two sex chromosomes determine a person's sex. In females, both sex chromosomes are X (written as XX). Males have an X and a Y sex chromosome (XY).
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects males. Klinefelter syndrome occurs when a boy is born with one or more extra X chromosomes. Most males have one Y and one X chromosome. Having extra X chromosomes can cause a male to have some physical traits unusual for males. Many men with an extra X chromosome are not aware that they have it, and they lead normal lives. Klinefelter syndrome occurs in about 1 out of 1,000 males.
