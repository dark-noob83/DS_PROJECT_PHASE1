1 The level of oxygen in airplanes is about the same as the oxygen level at an elevation of 8000 ft (2400 m) . 2  This drop in oxygen can really affect people with COPD. 3  If you normally use oxygen or have borderline-low oxygen levels in your blood, you may need oxygen when you fly.
Hypoxemia (low oxygen in your blood) can cause hypoxia (low oxygen in your tissues) when your blood doesn't carry enough oxygen to your tissues to meet your body's needs. The word hypoxia is sometimes used to describe both problems.
Oxygen is a non-metallic element that constitutes for 21% of air. In humans, oxygen is primarily absorbed via the lungs and carried around the body in blood cells to provide the key element for cellular activity. The average level of oxygen in the blood is approximately 96% and if this oxygen consumption lowers over time, your health can be affected.
Hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen, describes a lower than normal level of oxygen in your blood. In order to function properly, your body needs a certain level of oxygen circulating in the blood to cells and tissues. When this level of oxygen falls below a certain amount, hypoxemia occurs and you may experience shortness of breath.
267 Followers. A. Many things can cause low oxygen levels in the blood. To name a few: Lung injury (collapsed lung); lung disease (COPD, lung cancer); pulmonary embolism; heart disease (congestive heart failure); anemias -- and that's just a handful I can think of off the top of my head.
A normal blood oxygen level should be 94% to 98% . However, as a result of not breathing for 30 seconds or more during sleep, your sleep apnea oxygen level would drop to 80% or less. Keep in mind that anything below 90% oxygen level is dangerous to your body and require intervention.
