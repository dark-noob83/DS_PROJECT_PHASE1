Posted on. (Answer #1). There are a number of themes that you can identify in this book. You should follow the link to read what eNotes has to say about the themes. To me, the major theme is that power corrupts people. I think that Orwell is trying to tell us that even people who start out very idealistic can become corrupted.
A theme is a central or underlying idea in literature. The writer may express insight about humanity or a world view. Before you attempt to identify the theme of a work, you must have first read the work, and you should understand at least the basics about the plot, characterizations, and other literary elements.
The theme of a short story differs from the moral of a story or fable in one significant way. Unlike a moral or lesson about how to behave, a short story theme is a general message about life or human nature that the author wants to convey.
I find that properly teaching students how to identify themes goes a long way toward meeting this goal. 1. Properly Define Theme: students need to know that theme is the life lesson of a story or the authorâ€™s message. 2. Prepare Students To Infer: students need to understand that in most stories (with the exception of fables), the author will not tell readers what the theme or lesson of the story is.
Identifying Themes and Literary Analysis Literary works are used to entertain, to teach a moral lesson, to convey meaning, or more importantly, to make the reader aware of some aspect of the human condition. Through their work, writers creatively share their ideas and express themes that are timeless and universal.
