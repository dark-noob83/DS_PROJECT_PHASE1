Drones are a fact of life, and those that can use this technology will. We are entering the first stages of a personal drone market in which legitimate private and commercial use, as well as law enforcement and military use, is certain to accelerate.
How to optimize the choice of your UAV's radio frequencies. 1. Introduction. As we make our UAV fly we use multiple radio frequency bands for different uses: RC control of the craft, eventual telemetry band, eventual video downlink band (FPV or camera monitoring), GPS. An issue we have all already encountered are interferences between used
A UAV is an airplane that does not have a pilot to operate it but uses software instruction to perform necessary tasks. The basic function of a drone is industrial data collection as well as military data collection. Drones are used for aerial surveys, pipeline inspection, etc.
1 1.3 GHz is quite close to the frequencies the GPS satellites transmit at, and it can degrade your GPS performance. 2  If you are using a 1.3 GHz transmitter, keep it as far from your GPS module as possible.
If you decide to add FPV (this is DIY), then you must add it using a 5.8GHZ system, which is readily available. The Basics of Radio Frequencies. You will notice the use of terms such as 2.4GHZ and 5.8GHZ when describing fpv quadcopter and drone aircraft. Here is what you need to know. 2.4 GHZ â€“ is the radio frequency that most quadcopters use for the connection between the ground transmitter and the aerial vehicle. You may remember that this is is also the frequency that computer wireless networks operate on.
