Metal roofing is the most expensive and can cost up to $30,000-$40,000 for large roof replacements. The quality of the roofing material will also determine the cost of roof replacement. For example, asphalt shingles can cost anywhere from $50 for average quality to $150 or more for the highest quality (per square). The following are figures for the average cost of roof replacement: 1  Asphalt: $700-$3,700. 2  Slate: $17,000-$84,000. 3  Wood shingles or shake: $7,000-$20,000. 4  Concrete tile: $8,000-$21,000. 5  Ceramic clay tile: $12

1 Do-it-yourself materials to install an asphalt shingle roof on an average one-story ranch-style home (with a gently sloping roof of 1,700-2,100 square feet) can run $680-$3,700, depending on the quality of the materials. 1 Roofing with synthetic slate tiles (recycled rubber or plastic molded to look like slate) is about $11,900-$18,900 for an average ranch house with a 1,700-2,100 square foot roof; or $21,000-$27,000 for a 3,000-square-foot roof.
1 Wood shingles or shakes are beautiful but require ongoing maintenance, can be prone to fires and don't last as long as other roofing materials. 2  Installing natural wood shingles or shakes on an average one-story, ranch-style home (1,700-2,100 square feet of gently sloping roof) costs around $6,800-$20,000 or more. 1 Roofing with synthetic slate tiles (recycled rubber or plastic molded to look like slate) is about $11,900-$18,900 for an average ranch house with a 1,700-2,100 square foot roof; or $21,000-$27,000 for a 3,000-square-foot roof.
The national average for a 3,000 square foot asphalt shingle roof is roughly $11,500. The actual cost varies. Like anything, urban areas are generally more expensive than rural areas. The average cost of a roof in New York, for example is close to $15,000. The same roof replacement in Georgia or the deep south will probably cost less than $9,000. The Midwest is also less expensive. Homeowners in Wichita, Kansas pay an average of $10,000. Even within the same general region of the country, prices vary drastically. The average cost of a new roof in the Carolinas hovers around $7,000 while Atlanta homeowners pay around $10,000.

Labor should be around 45 hours for my low pitch roof. Roofers make on average $14/hr.

I was quoted $11,470 for the Golden Warranty, $8800 without a warranty.
