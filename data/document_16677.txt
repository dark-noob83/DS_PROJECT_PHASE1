For example, a pallet of 48 cases of meals, ready to eat (MREs), is a wholesale shipment; it is also one of the modules. It is built on a 40-by-48-inch warehouse pallet and, depending on the ration cycle and days of supply, will meet the needs of a unit with a set number of soldiers. A break point was made by removing one layer (12 cases) of MREs, thus creating a second module of 36 cases.
One MRE = one meal. Except for the beverages, which require hydration (water), the entire meal is ready to eat. The MRE is nutritionally balanced and provides around 1,200 calories (13% protein, 36% fat, and 51% carbohydrates) and 1/3 of the United States Military Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamins and minerals.
