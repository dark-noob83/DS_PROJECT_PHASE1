Its visceral branches provide blood to organs, while its parietal branches supply blood to the tissues of the abdominal body wall. 1  The inferior phrenic artery is a parietal artery, the most superior branch of the abdominal aorta.
The peritoneum is a layer of serous membrane that constitutes the inner lining of the abdominopelvic cavity. This article will highlight the main anatomical features of the peritoneum and its subdivisions, the omenta, the mesenteries, the peritoneal ligaments and the epiploic foramen.
The parietal peritoneum covers the internal abdominal walls and is supplied by the regional neurovasculature. The visceral peritoneum encapsulates the individual abdominal organs and is supplied by the organ it is closest to. The peritoneal cavity is a theoretical space that exists between the two layers of the peritoneal mesothelium.
The peritoneum helps support the organs in the abdominal cavity and also allows nerves, blood vessels, and lymph vessels to pass through to the organs. The parietal peritoneum lines the abdominal wall and extends to the organs, whereas the visceral peritoneum covers the organs. The peritoneal cavity lies between these two peritoneal layers. It contains a thin layer of fluid that lubricates the peritoneal surfaces.
Although ultimately one continuous sheet, two types of peritoneum are referenced: 1  Parietal peritoneum is that portion that lines the abdominal and pelvic cavities. 2  Visceral peritoneum covers the external surfaces of most abdominal organs, including the intestinal tract.
Peritoneum. The peritoneum is a smooth, glistening, serous membrane that lines the abdominal wall as the parietal peritoneum and is reflected from the body wall to various organs, where, as visceral peritoneum, it forms an integral part as the outermost, or serosal, layer.
