When you get right down to the details, it's no wonder so may people go nuts for almonds! 20-25 almonds (approximately one ounce) contain as much calcium as 1/4 cup of milk, a valuable tool in preventing osteoporosis. Almonds are the best whole food source of vitamin E, in the form of alpha-tocopherol, which may help prevent cancer. The calcium found in almonds may lower risks of colon and rectal cancers. Almonds fiber content may also help protect against colon cancer. The folic acid in almonds may help reduce the risk of cervical cancers. Researchers in Finland have even linked almonds to a reduction in risk of lung cancers

Almond Milk. Almond milk is made from ground almonds and is lower in calories than other milks as long as it is unsweetened. Itâ€™s also free of cholesterol, saturated fat, and is naturally lactose free. Even though almonds are a good source of protein, almond milk is not. Almond milk is also not a good source of calcium. However, many of the brands available in the market are supplemented with calcium as well as vitamin D.
Commercial almond milk is fortified to be similar in nutrient content to dairy milk. Almond milk has just as much calcium and vitamin D as cow's milk and about 1/4 as much protein. The same serving size of sweetened almond milk has 60 calories, 25 of which are from healthy fat. Whole milk contains saturated fat, and even skim milk has some cholesterol. So although almond milk seems rather high in fat calories, its fat content is not unhealthy.
Lactose-free milk is processed to break down lactose, a natural sugar found in milk products. As with other milks, lactose-free milk is a good source of protein, calcium, vitamins, and minerals. The fat and cholesterol content of lactose-free milk varies, as it comes in 2 percent, 1 percent, and fat-free varieties. Even though almonds are a good source of protein, almond milk is not. Almond milk is also not a good source of calcium. However, many of the brands available in the market are supplemented with calcium as well as vitamin D.
Almonds and rice have even less calcium by nature. Each 8-ounce cup of plain almond milk contains a meager 2 milligrams of calcium, and less than 1 milligram is found in rice milk. Therefore, homemade or unfortified soy, almond and rice milk should not be used to replace cow's milk as a source of calcium. Fortification: Calcium and Vitamin D.
A. Almonds contain calcium in significant amounts, but by government definition, they do not provide enough per serving to qualify as a good source, and some of it may be chemically blocked from absorption. Food and Drug Administration definitions say that to be a good source of a nutrient, the reference amount of a food must provide 10 to 19 percent of the daily value. The daily value for calcium is 1,000 milligrams, and the reference amount for nuts is 30 grams, or about an ounce, Ms. Stark explained.
Each 8 ounce serving of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium. Soy milk comes in second at approximately 50 milligrams. Because calcium in almonds and rice are significantly lower compared with the previous two, milk made from these ingredients have a much lower calcium content. After the process, cow, soy, almond and rice milk are approximately equivalent in both calcium and vitamin D concentration. An average cup of fortified dairy and nondairy milk contribute to about 30% of your daily need for calcium and 25% to 45% of your need for vitamin D.
