A straight quarter-mile stretch of new woven wire fencing will cost $2,553.31, or just shy of $2 per linear foot. What about barbed wire? It's a little less expensive than a woven-wire fence to build and has about the same average lifespan of around 20 years, Edwards says. The estimated $1,947.75/quarter mile cost of a 5-wire barbed-wire fence takes into account the following:
