1 Four of these employees were mid-level, with an average salary of $80,000. 2  It costs, on average, $120,000 to replace each employee at 150% of their annual salary, for $480,000 total. 3  Two of these employees were senior, with an average salary of $120,000. 1 Six of these employees were entry level, with an average salary of $40,000. 2  It costs, on average, $16,000 to replace each employee at 40% of their annual salary, for $96,000 total. 3  Four of these employees were mid-level, with an average salary of $8
The costs to replace an employee vary by their earning level, so training costs also vary. The Sasha Corporation averaged the results of 15 studies that determined average costs to replace an $8 per hour employee, determining an average cost of $9,444.47 per turnover. Even when the 33 percent of estimates with the highest prices were removed from calculations, replacement costs were $5,505.80 per turnover.

For all jobs earning less than $50,000 per year, or more than 40 percent of U.S. jobs, the average cost of replacing an employee amounts to fully 20 percent of the person's annual salary, the liberal-leaning think-tank found in a study that looks at 31 corporate case studies. High turnover, lower-paying jobs (those under $30,000 a year) are slightly less expensive to replace, at only 16 percent of annual salary, but that still adds up quickly. For instance, 37 percent of hotel/motel and food services employees voluntarily quit a job in 2011.
But the estimates are clustered around the “typical” (median) values. Looking only at estimates of the cost of turnover for workers earning, on average, $75,000 per year or less, 17 case studies find a cost of turnover in the range of 10 percent to 30 percent. (see Figure 2).
