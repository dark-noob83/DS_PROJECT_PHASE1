While General Electric built the first electric toaster for the home in 1909, it was 10 years later when Minnesota mechanic Charles Strite created an easy-to-use toaster designed for restaurants. He received his patent for the slice toaster in 1921 and formed the Waters-Genter Company to manufacture his product. During the 1930s, toasters were luxuries; some cost up to $25 (the equivalent of $393 in 2010). Thirty years later, however, the toaster price had dropped, and most families were able to afford one.
