They are fossil fuels because they were formed from plants and animals that decayed, and then pressure, bacteria, and heat preserved them in the earth's crust for millions of years. Eventually, these decayed plants and animals went through a chemical change and became fossil fuels, such as coal.
Fossil fuels, however, were once alive! They were formed from prehistoric plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Think about what the Earth must have looked like 300 million years or so ago.
How Fossil Fuels were Formed. Contrary to what many people believe, fossil fuels are not the remains of dead dinosaurs. In fact, most of the fossil fuels we find today were formed millions of years before the first dinosaurs. Formation of Coal. Fossil fuels were formed from plants and animals that lived 300 million years ago in primordial swamps and oceans (top).
There is some confusion with the term fossil fuels. Fossils are not converted into fossil fuels. The term fossil fuels is used to describe naturally occurring carbon deposits (coal) and liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons (oil and gas). I will try to explain it in the most simple terms possible.
Fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas, are currently the world's primary energy source. Formed from organic material over the course of millions of years, fossil fuels have fueled U.S. and global economic development over the past century.
While the energy history of the United States is one of significant change, three fossil fuel sources—petroleum, natural gas, and coal—have made up at least 80% of total U.S. energy consumption for more than 100 years.
