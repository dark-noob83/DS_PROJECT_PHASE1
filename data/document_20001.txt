Hemoglobin A1c normal range. 1  A majority of the hemoglobin A1c tests which are performed to ascertain the normal range differ from laboratory to the other. 2  As per the opinion of medical experts, the hemoglobin A1c normal range is generally between 4 and 6 percent. Thus the hemoglobin A1c range test can be used to detect the levels of blood sugar occurring in the body for almost the past 3 months.
1 Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 2  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 3  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 4  Ferritin. 1 Hemoglobin. 2  Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 3  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 4  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 5  Ferritin.
Anemia is considered to be present if the Hb or the hematocrit (Hct) is below the lower limit of 2 standard deviations (-2SD) or the 95% confidence interval for the normal population. This definition of anemia results in 2.5% of normal individuals being classified as anemic. Hemoglobin is the main component of red blood cells and serves as the transporter for oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. Hemoglobin concentration (Hb) is usually reported as grams of hemoglobin per deciliter of blood (g/dL).
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter.

Hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) measurements are the laboratory tests used most commonly in clinical and public health settings for screening for anemia.
The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 17 to 22 gm/dL. 2  One (1) week of age: 15 to 20 gm/dL. 3  One (1) month of age: 11 to 15gm/dL. 4  Children: 11 to 13 gm/dL. 5  Adult males: 14 to 18 gm/dL. 6  Adult women: 12 to 16 gm/dL. 7  Men after middle age: 12.4 to 14.9 gm/dL.
Proper anemia screening requires not only sound laboratory methods and procedures but also appropriate Hb and Hct cutoff values to define anemia. The normal ranges of Hb and Hct change throughout childhood and during pregnancy, and are higher for men than women (1,2). Thus, criteria for anemia should be specific for age, sex, and stage of pregnancy.

Thus, criteria for anemia should be specific for age, sex, and stage of pregnancy. The anemia reference values for children, nonpregnant women, and men are derived from the most current nationally representative sample--the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1976-1980 (NHANES II).
Normal hemoglobin values are related to the person's age and sex. Normal values may vary slightly between test systems, and which groups of doctors have determined normal values for their group of patients; however, the value ranges are close (vary by about 0.5 g/dl) for almost every group. An example of normal ranges that is widely accepted by Family Practice physicians is as follows: 1  Birth: 13.5 to 24.0 g/dl (mean 16.5 g/dl). 2  Age 1-2 months: 10.0 to 18.0 g/dl (mean 11.2 g/dl). 3  Age 2-6 months: 9.5 to 14.0 g/dl (mean 12.6 g/dl).
