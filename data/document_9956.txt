The Ventricles CSF is produced mainly by a structure called the choroid plexus in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. CSF flows from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen (also called the foramen of Monro).
The right and left lateral ventricles are structures within the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid, a clear, watery fluid that provides cushioning for the brain while also helping to circulate nutrients and remove waste.
Overview. The ventricles of the brain are a communicating network of cavities filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and located within the brain parenchyma. The ventricular system is composed of 2 lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct, and the fourth ventricle (see the following images).
The lower two chambers of the heart are called ventricles. They are separated by a septum into the left ventricle and the right ventricle. The upper two heart chambers are called atria. Atria receive blood returning to the heart from the body and ventricles pump blood from the heart to the body.
Lateral ventricles. The largest cavities of the ventricular system are the lateral ventricles. Each lateral ventricle is divided into a central portion, formed by the body and atrium (or trigone), and 3 lateral extensions or horns of the ventricles. The central portion or the body of the ventricle is located within the parietal lobe.
Brain ventricle: One of the communicating cavities within the brain. There are four ventricles: two lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourth ventricle. The lateral ventricles are in the cerebral hemispheres. Each lateral ventricle consists of a triangular central body and four horns.
