According to the Institute of Medicine, men require 400 to 420 mg of magnesium daily while women require 310 to 320 mg. Pregnant or lactating women require slightly greater amounts, approximately 310 to 400 mg, per day. Children require 80 to 240 mg daily, while adolescents require 360 to 410 mg of magnesium. 
1-3 times a day or if using a calcium supplement containing 1,000 mg calcium and 500 mg magnesium this may meet your need.) 88 kilo male, athlete in training, some injury with athletic performance 10 mg. equals total intake 880 mg. (100-200 mg. 3-6 times a day.). Maximum daily intake of magnesium is probably 15 mg. per kilo of ideal body weight or 6.8 mg. per pound of body weight in rare cases, under medical supervision for short periods of time. Your body must be your guide.
Table 1 lists the current RDAs for magnesium [ 1 ]. For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for magnesium that is equivalent to the mean intake of magnesium in healthy, breastfed infants, with added solid foods for ages 7–12 months. Tap, mineral, and bottled waters can also be sources of magnesium, but the amount of magnesium in water varies by source and brand (ranging from 1 mg/L to more than 120 mg/L) [ 8 ]. Approximately 30% to 40% of the dietary magnesium consumed is typically absorbed by the body [ 2, 9 ].
Women should get at least 400 milligrams (mg) of magnesium a day, and men should get at least 333 mg a day. Current studies show that the average intake of Americans is less than 300 mg. We recommend that both men and women aim to get 400-500 mg of magnesium per day. It may be tough to get all the magnesium you need from food, so top up your daily intake with a multivitamin that contains at least 100 mg of magnesium.
In a recent study analyzing the diet of 564 adult Americans, both male and female, the average intake of magnesium was less than two-thirds of the RDA for men and less than 50% of the RDA for women. This means that men, on average, are getting under 200 mg. magnesium daily and women get under 150 mg. per day. 3-6 times a day.). Maximum daily intake of magnesium is probably 15 mg. per kilo of ideal body weight or 6.8 mg. per pound of body weight in rare cases, under medical supervision for short periods of time. Your body must be your guide.
Statistics on Magnesium Deficiency. With the current U.S. adult RDA of magnesium of 320-420 mg per day, the average American’s intake is only slightly more than half the minimum amount of magnesium required to function effectively. In fact, even this drastic figure may be an understatement. 
Recommended Dose and Limits. The daily recommended intake of magnesium for adult males between the ages of 19 to 30 is 400 mg and for their female counterparts, it's 310 mg. Adult men over age 31 need 420 mg, while females over age 31 need 320 mg daily. During pregnancy and lactation adult females are require 310 to 360 mg. 
Most Canadians consume far more sodium than is needed. The recommended amount per day is between 1500 mg (considered adequate intake) and 2300 mg (upper amount) for people 9 -50 years of age. For people over 50 years of age, an adequate intake drops to 1300 mg per day until 70 and then 1200 mg over 70 years of age. However, the average daily intake in the Canadian diet is about 3500 mg of sodium, although many Canadians eat well in excess of 5000 mg per day. Can I get too much sodium? Yes
Government guidelines suggest 420 milligrams (mg) per day for men, 320 mg for women. We recommend that both men and women aim to get 400-500 mg of magnesium per day. It may be tough to get all the magnesium you need from food, so top up your daily intake with a multivitamin that contains at least 100 mg of magnesium.
The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of magnesium for young adults is around 400 mg/day for men and 310 mg/day for women. For adults over 30, the RDA is 420 mg/day for men and 320 mg/day for women. We recommend that both men and women aim to get 400-500 mg of magnesium per day. It may be tough to get all the magnesium you need from food, so top up your daily intake with a multivitamin that contains at least 100 mg of magnesium.
