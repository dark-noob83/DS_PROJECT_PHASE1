What Is An Indemnity Agreement?  An indemnity agreement is an express, contractual promise by one party, the “indemnitor”, to pay for the liability of another party, the “indemnitee”.  An indemnity agreement can also include a promise to defend the indemnified party in a claim or litigation.  An indemnity agreement determines who will bear the loss.  Indemnity agreements are generally governed by the law of contracts.
When signed, this agreement releases the sponsor from any liabilities arising from injuries or harm to any participant. It is crucial that this type of release be memorialized in writing. Having a written Event Release and Indemnity Agreement will prove invaluable in the event of an accident or injury. Among others, this Event Release and Indemnity Agreement contains the following: Protect yourself and your rights by using our professionally prepared up-to-date forms. 5. Agrees that in the event that any provision of this Release and Indemnity is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision will not affect the remaining provisions of this Release and Indemnity which shall continue to be enforceable.
It is critical to understand that the limitation period in relation to an indemnity clause starts from the date on which the indemnifier refuses to honour the indemnity. The indemnified party would then have a further 6 years from that date within which to bring legal proceedings to enforce the indemnity. There are loosely six types of indemnity clauses, which provide a guide to their scope and operation, including: 1  Bare Indemnities – Party A indemnifies Party B for all liabilities or losses incurred in connection with specified events or circumstances, but without setting out any specific limitations.
While the events giving rise to an indemnity may be specified by contract, the actions that must be taken to compensate the injured party are largely unpredictable, and the maximum compensation is often expressly limited. 1 An indemnity guarantees compensation equal to the amount of loss subject to the indemnity, while a warranty only guarantees compensation for the reduction in value of the acquired asset due to the warranted fact being untrue (and the beneficiary must prove such diminution in value).
The limitation period is 6 years in the event that the indemnity is part of an agreement or otherwise it would be 12 years if executed as a deed. The limitation period for an indemnity claim will starts to run from the date the indemnified loss is established. However, non-signatories are not entitled to make claims under the indemnity unless there is an express intention for non-signatories third party to benefit from the indemnity, in absence of such express intention; it is presumed that only parties to the indemnity provision are the ones who can benefit themselves.
A costs inclusive limit of indemnity includes defence costs within the limit, thereby reducing the limit of indemnity available to settle a claim. For example, in the same instance above, the insurer would only pay a total of $1,000,000 leaving $500,000 unpaid by the insurer and consequently to be sourced elsewhere. A costs exclusive limit of indemnity is therefore the superior basis of cover.
An indemnity is an obligation by a person (indemnitor) to provide compensation for a particular loss suffered by another person (indemnitee). 1 An indemnity guarantees compensation equal to the amount of loss subject to the indemnity, while a warranty only guarantees compensation for the reduction in value of the acquired asset due to the warranted fact being untrue (and the beneficiary must prove such diminution in value).
Indemnities form the basis of many insurance contracts; for example, a car owner may purchase different kinds of insurance as an indemnity for various kinds of loss arising from operation of the car, such as damage to the car itself, or medical expenses following an accident. 1 An indemnity guarantees compensation equal to the amount of loss subject to the indemnity, while a warranty only guarantees compensation for the reduction in value of the acquired asset due to the warranted fact being untrue (and the beneficiary must prove such diminution in value).
For example, if a policy provides a limit of ‘$1,000,000 any one claim, and $2,000,000 in the aggregate’ (i.e. ‘one reinstatement of the limit of indemnity’), if a claim for $750,000 was compensated then the limit of indemnity would be reinstated to $1,000,000 for any subsequent claim. For example, in the same instance above, the insurer would only pay a total of $1,000,000 leaving $500,000 unpaid by the insurer and consequently to be sourced elsewhere. A costs exclusive limit of indemnity is therefore the superior basis of cover.
