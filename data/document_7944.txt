Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Co. (NYSE: SO), filed documents with the state of Georgia that said overruns at the Plant Vogtle expansion project are now pushing the price tag to more than $7.5 billion.
During the 1980s, Southern Company experienced massive cost overruns while constructing the first two reactors at Plant Vogtle. Original estimates for Plant Vogtle reactors 1&2 were under $1 billion each, but final costs skyrocketed to nearly $9 billion.
02/02/2015 | Thomas Overton. Southern Co. said in a regulatory filing on Jan. 30 that its two-unit expansion at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia may be delayed another 18 months, with its costs expected to rise at least $720 million.
The judge called it a highly choreographed 'race-to-the-courthouse'  of immense consequence. At stake is $900 million, and the question of who is to blame for delays and cost overruns at the first nuclear construction project in the U.S. in 30 years.
Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) subsidiary Georgia Power estimates that the 18-month delay in construction of the 2,400-megawatt Plan Vogtle nuclear expansion will cost a little more than $1 billion in construction costs and financing.
Southern Co. subsidiary Georgia Power owns 46% of the project. Its costs were originally estimated at $6.1 billion but have grown to $7.4 billion with the delays and overruns. Other owners are Oglethorpe Power Corp. (30%), Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7%), and the Dalton Utilities (1.6%).
Given all of the partners involved in Vogtle project, the cost overrun would break down as follows: Georgia Power ($400 million); Oglethorpe ($263 million); MEAG Power ($199 million); and the City of Dalton ($14 million). The $875 million in 2008 dollarswould be worth $913 million in 2011 dollars.
