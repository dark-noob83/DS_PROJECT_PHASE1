I recommend that most women can start with an 8 kg/18-lb kettlebell, while fit women can begin with a 12 kg/26-lb kettlebell. A male starting to work out should begin with a 16 kg/35-lb kettlebell, while a fit man can begin with a 24 kg/53-lb kettlebell. This is my opinion, based upon my experiences.
WOMEN. Women who are new to kettlebell training and lifting in general should start with an 18 pound or 8 kilogram kettlebell. This weight is ideal for a woman who is just beginning weight training whether it be in the gym or at home.
Kettlebell weight is most frequently measured in kilograms rather than pounds. They start at 4 kg and move up in 4-kg increments. The most widely used sizes for general fitness are 4 kg up to 24 kg. Most people should start with a kettlebell weight of between 8 kg and 16 kg. A beginner female should start with an 8-kg bell, as the 4 kg is not heavy enough to provide a solid weight lifting effect for most women. Women with more weight lifting experience and fitness can start with a 12-kg bell.
Generally, the best weight for unconditioned beginners of kettlebell training should range from 4 kg to 8 kg for women and 12 kg to 16 kg for men.
MEN. Men who are new to kettlebell training and lifting in general should start with a 35 pound or 16 kilogram kettlebell. This is the ideal weight for the average man, new to weights or with a bench press strength of under 200 pounds.
