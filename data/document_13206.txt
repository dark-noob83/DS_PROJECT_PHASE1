Hubby has had about 3 hernia surgeries: the one that was umbilibal, was a little detailed because they couldn't do lapascopic, he had too much scar tissue from another surgery, even then he was in the hospital only 48 hours and would have come home in 24 had they been able to do lapascopic.
A family member or friend will need to drive you home from the hospital. Your return to normal activities will depend on the severity and type of the hernia you will have repaired. In general, recovery from surgery for a ventral hernia takes longer than recovery from surgery for an inguinal hernia.
If the hernia has become trapped (strangulated) and part of the bowel damaged, the affected segment may need to be removed and the two ends of healthy bowel rejoined. This is a bigger operation and you may need to stay in hospital for 4-5 days.
Immediately after hernia repair surgery, you will wait in a recovery room for the effects of the anesthesia to wear off. This will take about an hour or two. In some cases, a patient may need to stay in the hospital overnight, especially for a ventral hernia repair.
Most people who have laparoscopic surgery can leave the hospital within 1 to 3 days after the procedure. You may need a hospital stay of 2 to 6 days if you have open surgery. Most people can return to normal activities in 4 to 6 weeks.

The operation usually takes about 30-45 minutes to complete and you'll usually be able to go home on the same day. Some people stay in hospital overnight if they have other medical problems or if they live alone. Read more about recovering from an inguinal hernia repair.
