Deciduous trees drop their leaves for a part of every year, usually during periods of dryness or cold winter weather. Their branches remain free of foliage until conditions improve. For the tree, this means that it can save energy by not working to keep the leaves green and healthy.
Throughout the eastern deciduous forest, mature trees range in height from 18 to 30 metres. Rolling hills characterise most of the area, but some parts are nearly flat and the Appalachian Mountain range, which extends from Labrador in Canada to Alabama in the United States, reaches around 900 metres.
LOCATION: Most temperate, deciduous (leaf-shedding) forests are located in the eastern United States, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and parts of Russia. Deciduous forests are broken up into five zones. The firstzone is the tree stratum zone.
Boreal (predominantly forest) - the largest forested area in Canada This region forms a continuous belt from Newfoundland and Labrador west to the Rocky Mountains and north to Alaska. The boreal forest is mostly coniferous, but includes a mix of deciduous trees such as white birch and trembling aspen. Boreal (forest and barren) - a sub-region north of the Boreal Forest Region. A colder climate and shorter growing season nurtures predominately spruce and larch (tamarack).
