1. Most laptop batteries start to fail in 1-2 years. This varies depending on your usage, of course, but the average laptop battery is good for around 400 recharges (a.k.a. cycles). After that, it starts to lose its capacity to hold a charge.
After the laptop has gone through a full single charge and the power plug is unplugged the average life of a laptop battery can be anywhere between one and six hours. This time is dependent on the battery, its capacity (mAH), what's being done on the laptop, and how old the battery is. Over time the laptop battery total capacity decreases, which means the battery will not last as long as it did when you first got the laptop and will continue to decrease over time.
A laptop computer battery should last between two and four years, or around 1,000 full charges. The total lifetime of battery life is dependent on the type of battery your laptop has, how you use the battery, how it's charge, and how well you take care of the battery.
The lithium-ion batteries used in most laptops have a typical lifespan of 300 to 500 charge/discharge cycles. Full discharge of your laptop's battery should be avoided to avoid shortening the lifespan. Under proper operating conditions, lithium-ion batteries will last two to three years.
After purchasing a new laptop computer or battery for your laptop, we recommend that the battery be charged for no less than 24-hours. A 24-hour charge makes sure the battery is fully charged and helps with the battery's life expectancy. Once it is fully charged, you should not discharge it fully, if possible.
Prolonged storage. To store a battery for long periods of time, its charge capacity should be around 40% and it should be stored in a place as fresh and dry as possible. A fridge can be used (0 C - 10 C), but only if the battery stays isolated from any humidity.
