A newborn's pulse rate is the number of times his heart beats per minute. This rhythmic beating occurs each time the ventricle of the heart contracts to pump blood through the cardiovascular system. A normal pulse rate indicates that the heart is functioning properly. 
Answer by Jane T. Confidence votes 153. The resting heart rate of a newborn is from 120 to 160, 0 to 5 months is 90-140, 6 to 12 months is 80-140 and 1 to 3 years is 80-130 beats per minute (taken from Related Link). 
My child's heart seems to beat very fast. Your child's heart rate normally will vary to some degree. Fever, crying, exercise, or other vigorous activity makes any heart beat faster. And the younger the child, the faster the normal heart rate will be. As your child gets older, her heart rate will slow down. A resting heart rate of 130 to 150 beats per minute is normal for a newborn infant, but it is too fast for a six-year-old child at rest. In a very athletic teenager, a resting heart rate of 50 to 60 beats per minute may be normal. 
Newborns have resting heart rates around 100 to 150 beats per minute, way higher than that of adults. In fact, a newbornâ€™s resting heart rate is in the ballpark of the target heart rate for an adult doing a heavy workout. 
Most adults have a resting heart rate of 60-100 beats per minute (bpm). The fitter you are, the lower your resting heart rate is likely to be. For example, athletes may have a resting heart rate of 40-60 bpm or lower. You should contact your GP if you think your heart rate is continuously above 120 bpm or below 40 bpm, although this could just be normal for you.
Tachycardia = Too fast. A heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute (BPM) in adults is called tachycardia. What's too fast for you may depend on your age and physical condition. 
Save. A heart rate is the number of times a heart beats per minute. According to the American Heart Association, a newborn's heart beats about 140 times a minute. As a child grows, the rate slows. A teenager's average resting heart rate is around 70 beats per minut
