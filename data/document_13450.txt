Stalagmites and stalactites contain calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Calcium carbonate is the basis of the cement industry. Calcium is classified chemically as one of the alkaline earth elements (that is, in Group 2 of the periodic table. The metal is rather reactive. It readily forms a white coating of calcium nitride (Ca 3 N 2) in air. Calcium is an essential constituent of leaves, bones, teeth, and shells. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the earth's crust and makes up more than 3% of the crust. Calcium does not occur as the metal itself in nature and instead is found in various minerals including as limestone, gypsum and fluorite.
Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a soft gray alkaline earth metal, fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the Earth 's crust. The ion Ca 2+ is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved ion in seawater by both molarity and mass, after sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate. Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature.
Calcium (Ca) And Chlorine(Cl) are the two constituent elements of the compound, Calcium Chloride (CaCl2). 7 people found this useful. Yes, calcium carbonate has three elements. Calcium carbonate is CaCO3. Ca is calcium, C is carbon, and O is oxygen. There are three of the oxygen, so the O is followed by a th … ree subscript.

The number of electrons in each of Calcium's shells is [2, 8, 8, 2] and its electron configuration is [Ar] 4s 2. About. Calcium Chloride is an excellent water soluble crystalline Calcium source for uses compatible with chlorides. Chloride compounds can conduct electricity when fused or dissolved in water. Chloride materials can be decomposed by electrolysis to chlorine gas and the metal.
The anhydrous form of calcium chloride may also be used for this purpose and can provide a measure of the moisture in concrete. Calcium chloride is used in swimming pool water as a pH buffer and to adjust the calcium hardness of the water. CaCl 2(l) → Ca (s) + Cl 2(g). Calcium chloride has a very high enthalpy change of solution. A considerable temperature rise accompanies its dissolution in water. The anhydrous salt is deliquescent; it can accumulate enough water in its crystal lattice to form a solution.
Calcium was named after the Latin term calx meaning lime, and is a reactive silvery metallic element found in Group 2 of the periodic table. It was first isolated in 1808 in England when Sir Humphry Davy electrolyzed a mixture of lime and mercuric oxide. 
Chemical properties. Calcium is a moderately active element. It reacts readily with oxygen to form calcium oxide (CaO): Calcium reacts with the halogens— fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine, The halogens are the elements that make up Group 17 (VIIA) of the periodic table. Calcium also reacts readily with cold water, most acids, and most nonmetals, such as sulfur and phosphorus
The colors are produced by heating metal salts, such as calcium chloride or sodium nitrate, that emit characteristic colors. The atoms of each element absorb energy and release it as light of specific colors. 
Calcium chloride can serve as a source of calcium ions in an aqueous solution, as calcium chloride is soluble in water. This property can be useful for displacing ions from solution. For example, phosphate is displaced from solution by calcium: CaCl 2(l) → Ca (s) + Cl 2(g). Calcium chloride has a very high enthalpy change of solution. A considerable temperature rise accompanies its dissolution in water. The anhydrous salt is deliquescent; it can accumulate enough water in its crystal lattice to form a solution.
