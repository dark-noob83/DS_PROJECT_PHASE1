1) Your costs match our costs-it's fair for everyone involved. 2) While a one-page fax will take about a minute to transmit due to 'handshaking' (the time the fax machines spend squealing before they start sending pages), longer faxes will generally take a lot less than a minute per page.
Also, even though we have thousands of fax lines, we only allow you to send one fax at a time. So if you send multiple faxes back to back, the second fax will not start until the first fax has been completed. In any event, for a normal fax page with text, we would estimate no more than a minute or two per page.
The density of information on each faxed page also effects the time it takes for a fax to complete. If you are receiving 10 pages with just text, that will take much less time than 10 pages with images or complex drawings.
