The above figure is an example of a hydrocarbon. 1  Hydrocarbons are compounds that are predominately composed of Hydrogen and Carbon atoms. 2  There are many different types of compounds that are predominately hydrocarbon in structure but have other functional groups.

Hydrophobic literally means the ‘fear of water,. Hydrocarbons are compounds that are made up of hydrogen and carbon molecules. Hydrocarbons have the ability to bond themselves together and form chains that holds different properties that repels water molecules. One good example of hydrocarbon is oil.
Hydrocarbons are molecules that consist of JUST carbon and hydrogen. they are mostly fuels, such as propane. (C3H8) Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic (meaning that they repel water …) is because they are polar.
Hydrocarbon molecules are strongly hydrophobic (water fearing), and it is this strongly hydrophobic layer of material that gives the cell membrane its water proof nature and allows it to act as a container for the cell and its contents.

Hydrocarbons are non polar by nature and will naturally repel polar water molecules. This is where the hydrophobic effect got its name. There are many types of hydrocarbons and they are classified into saturated hydrocarbons, unsaturated hydrocarbons, cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The importance of hydrocarbons lies in their ability to generate energy and is considered a valuable resource.
