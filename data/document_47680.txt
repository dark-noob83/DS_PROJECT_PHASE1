» Creation of the Committee. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law was created at the request of President John F. Kennedy in the summer of 1963 following a meeting of 244 lawyers in the East Room of the White House. During the summer of 1963 civil rights groups were demonstrating and taking other collective public actions to call attention to and to end discrimination and segregation in education, employment, voting participation and public accommodations throughout the South.
The committee was instructed to investigate the status of civil rights in the country and propose measures to strengthen and protect them. After the committee submitted a report of its findings to President Truman, it disbanded in December 1947. The far reaching effects that the committee had hoped for had little impact on the civil rights of black Americans in the late 1940s. Zinn argued that the President failed to use the power given to him by the 14th and 15th amendments to execute laws strong enough to combat discrimination.

President Kennedy introduced civil rights legislation, which ultimately became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on June 19, 1963, two days prior to the meeting in the East Room. During the summer of 1963 civil rights groups were demonstrating and taking other collective public actions to call attention to and to end discrimination and segregation in education, employment, voting participation and public accommodations throughout the South.
