The vertical distance between one contour line and the next is called the contour interval. Contour lines are drawn at specific intervals, such as every 10 feet, 20 feet or 30 feet. Each line represents a multiple of the scale chosen. Using the 10-foot scale as an example, each contour interval would represent a 10 feet change in elevation. The contour interval is printed on the map, usually in the margin.
Contour interval is the actual change in elevation represented by the space between two adjacent topographic rings. For example, if there is a contour interval of 20 feet, each topographic line on the map represents going either up or down by 20 feet of elevation (and sometimes it's hard to tell which). For convenience, many mapmakers include numbers every four or five lines to tell you what elevation is represented by that line.
The map has a contour interval of forty feet, which means that every place between the marked 6800 foot line and the next lowest line (which is 6760 feet, and not marked) has an elevation equal or greater than 6760 feet, but less than 6800 feet.
For example, if there is a contour interval â€¦ of 20 feet, each topographic line on the map represents going either up or down by 20 feet of elevation (and sometimes it's hard to tell which). For convenience, many mapmakers include numbers every four or five lines to tell you what elevation is represented by that line.
A contour line is a line drawn on a topographic map to indicate ground elevation or depression. A contour interval is the vertical distance or difference in elevation between contour lines. Index contours are bold or thicker lines that appear at every fifth contour line.
