1 When the reflex sight is in front of your eyes, you’ll see a red dot. 2  When the red dot is in the point where you want to send your bullet, switch to fire and engage the enemy. 3  You keep your eyes open and you keep your focus on the target. An AR-15 reflex sight is also often called as “ red dot” targeting system, because most red dot systems do fall in this category. However, the term “red dot” may not be entirely accurate since it’s not always a dot. It can be a chevron or a triangle, for example. It’s not always even red, either.

A red dot sight is a common classification for a type of non-magnifying reflector (or reflex) sight for firearms, and other devices that require aiming, that gives the user an aimpoint in the form of an illuminated red dot. Red dot sight reticles are measured in minutes of angle, or MOA. MOA is a convenient measure for shooters using English units, since 1 MOA subtends approximately 1.0472 inches at a distance of 100 yards (91.44 m). This is generally rounded to 1 inch at 100 yards, which makes MOA a handy unit to use in ballistics.
