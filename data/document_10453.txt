Most opiate painkillers are only available on prescription from a doctor or other prescriber. Some opiates at low doses, such as codeine, when combined with other analgesics like paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin are designed to be able to be bought over-the-counter in pharmacies. However, they all act on the opioid receptor in the body. Opiate painkillers are available either from doctors on prescription; or, in relatively low doses over-the-counter, at a pharmacy, combined with aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Perioperative pain in children can be effectively managed with systemic opioids, but addition of paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce opioid requirements and potentially improve analgesia and/or reduce adverse effects.

Abstract. Non-opioid analgesics, paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors are often given along with morphine as part of multimodal analgesia after major surgery. We were asked to undertake a systematic review comparing the relative effectiveness of paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors in reducing morphine consumption
Opiate/opioid painkillers are medicines with effects similar to opium. They act by stimulating opioid receptors in the brain and nervous system. There are a large number of opiate/opioid medicines including codeine, morphine, dihydrocodeine, methadone, buprenorphine and diamorphine (also known as heroin). However, they all act on the opioid receptor in the body. Opiate painkillers are available either from doctors on prescription; or, in relatively low doses over-the-counter, at a pharmacy, combined with aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol.
The proportion of positive studies was less with paracetamol, but was influenced by dose and route of administration. Despite availability of opioid for titration, a reduction in pain intensity by NSAIDs and/or paracetamol was reported in 16 of 29 studies. Evidence for clinically significant reductions in opioid-related adverse effects was less robust.

Codeine. Codeine is a weak opioid and is usually the first choice of drug if non opioid drugs are not enough to control your pain. A number of tablets combine codeine and paracetamol, for example co-codamol or co-dydramol. Opioids (pronounced oh-pee-oyds) were first made from the juice of the opium poppy. But many are now manmade in a laboratory. There are different types of opioid painkillers. Some are used for mild or moderate pain and others for severe pain.
See Prices. Norco (hydrocodone / acetaminophen) is an opioid / acetaminophen combination used to treat pain. Hydrocodone is an opiate and is considered a narcotic pain medicine. Acetaminophen is sold over the counter for pain and fever. Vicodin (hydrocodone / acetaminophen) is an opioid / acetaminophen combination used to treat pain. Hydrocodone is an opiate and is considered a narcotic pain medicine. Acetaminophen is sold over the counter for pain and fever. The combination offers better pain relief than the same doses of either drug alone.
Paracetamol is in a class of painkillers known as analgesics, and is more commonly known as acetaminophen or Tylenol. The over-the-counter form of this product is widely used by adults and children for relief of mild to moderate pain such as headache, muscle ache, inflammation and fever.
