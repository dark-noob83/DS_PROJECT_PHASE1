The more sophisticated the system, the more the cost. A residential or small commercial building with one zone using one furnace and air conditioning unit will cost in the $3 to $4 per square foot range.
General Costs. The typical cost for a 2,000-square-foot home with an existing forced-air system runs between $3,500 and $4,000, at the time of publication. A 1,500 square-foot home that is a new construction will run between $5,000 to $7,000. The need for additional duct-work increases the cost of the installation.
On average the systems cost between $6-$12 per square foot of the conditioned space. In addition, an indirect fired storage option which we install for domestic water heating using the same space heating boiler will run between $4,500.00-$7,000.00.
A mid-size veterinary clinic that treats dogs should have two zones requiring two furnaces and air conditioning units, and costing around $7.50 to $10.50 per square foot. Some projects require HVAC systems that cost $2
1 For a 1,000 square foot home, the cost of an HVAC system is $6,000 to $12,000, including a new furnace, air conditioning unit, and ductwork. 2  For larger homes and more complex setups, however, the price could be significantly higher.
1 A new furnace in a central heating system costs $2,500 to $7,500 or more. 2  If you don’t need ductwork, the cost of a new heating and cooling system can be significantly decreased. 3  In cases where new HVAC duct is required, however, you might pay $1,000 to $3,000.
1 For central air-conditioning, you’ll pay $3,000 to $5,000 and up for a 2,000 square foot home. 2  A new furnace in a central heating system costs $2,500 to $7,500 or more.
