The Benefits of RGP Lenses. Gas permeable contact lenses offer some outstanding benefits over soft lenses. For one, because GP lenses are made from a firm plastic material, they retain their shape when you blink, which tends to provide sharper vision than pliable soft lenses.
Rigid gas permeable contacts, also called GP or RGP lenses, have many advantages beyond healthy oxygen flow. RGPs lenses have helped slow down the development of nearsightedness in young and adult lens wearers. Generally, the advantages of GP hard contact lenses outnumber the disadvantages. Today’s contact lens wearers have several options, which is fantastic but also confusing. Knowing which contact lenses are right for you means understanding the different contact lens options available. Think about your lifestyle and your vision needs as you read about the variety of contact lense
- Using RGP lenses to correct myopia (orthokeratology). - Who should wear rigid gas permeable lenses. - Advantages over eyeglasses. Gas permeable (GP) contact lenses are also known as rigid gas permeables (RGP’s). Although today’s gas permeable lenses are made of a rigid material that is not flexible, they differ greatly from the original hard lenses of yesteryear. Hard contact lenses made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), were introduced in the 1930’s. Orthokeratology is the process of using special gas permeable lenses to temporarily correct/reduce myopia by reshaping the cornea. An eye health professional may refer to this process as corneal reshaping (CR) as corneal refractive therapy or vision shaping.
When you receive your rigid gas permeable contact lenses, your eye doctor should give you a set of care instructions. Always follow your doctor’s advice before anyone else’s. Here are some tips to help you care for and maintain your GP contacts: They are large (15 to 17 mm) in diameter to cover most of the eye’s surface, and are primarily used to manage complex eye conditions. Gas permeable contact lenses are generally worn during waking hours, although some materials are approved—but infrequently prescribed—for overnight wear.
Gas permeable contact lenses are also called RGP (Rigid Gas Permeable) contact lenses, and oxygen permeable lenses. GP designs are differentiated primarily by size. They are large (15 to 17 mm) in diameter to cover most of the eye’s surface, and are primarily used to manage complex eye conditions. Gas permeable contact lenses are generally worn during waking hours, although some materials are approved—but infrequently prescribed—for overnight wear.
On this page: Benefits of RGP lenses • Astigmatism, presbyopia, keratoconus • Downside of GP contact lenses. Gas permeable contact lenses are rigid lenses made of durable plastic that transmits oxygen. These lenses also are called GP lenses, rigid gas permeable lenses, RGP lenses and oxygen permeable lenses. GP contact lenses are rigid, but they shouldn't be confused with old-fashioned hard contact lenses, which are now obsolete. Gas permeable contact lenses offer some outstanding benefits over soft lenses. For one, because GP lenses are made from a firm plastic material, they retain their shape when you blink, which tends to provide sharper vision than pliable
Soft vs. RGP lenses. Below is a brief comparison of soft and rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses. A thorough eye examination and a better understanding of your specific vision requirements will help your Doctor of Optometry determine the best options for you. Soft contact lenses. Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) lenses have been around since the 1960’s. Newer RGP lenses offer the advantage of allowing more oxygen to pass through to the eye. They are often referred to as oxygen permeable lenses and are available in daily wear and extended wear options. Advantages. 1  Clear, crisp vision.
In contrast, most soft lenses provide relatively instant comfort. One disadvantage is the size of a gas permeable contact lens compared to a soft lens. Most GP lenses are much smaller and are designed to move on the eye with each blink. They are large (15 to 17 mm) in diameter to cover most of the eye’s surface, and are primarily used to manage complex eye conditions. Gas permeable contact lenses are generally worn during waking hours, although some materials are approved—but infrequently prescribed—for overnight wear.
