About 80% of those who do get treatment don’t get enough of it; they receive some impatient care, but are sent home before the recommended length of stay is up. Only about 10% of all sufferers are male. Statistics on anorexia show that between 1 – 5% of all female adolescents and young women suffer from anorexia. The average age of onset is 17. It is rare, but not unheard of, for children under the age of 10 to have the condition.

Statistics on Eating Disorders and Age. While eating disorders tend to peak between adolescence and early adulthood, the incidence and prevalence has shown an increase in all age groups. For instance, eating disorders are increasing rapidly among prepubertal girls. Disordered eating habits and concern with weight and body image are beginning at earlier ages -- even in girls as young as nine years of age. A recent study found that 70 percent of sixth-grade girls surveyed reported that they first became concerned about their weight between the ages of 9 and 11. Eating disorders are also becoming more common among elderly women. This is, in part, due to people maintaining the eating disorder into old age. Also, elderly women have been shown to initiate weight control practices, such as bingeing and purging
1 The prevalence of eating disorders is similar among Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, African-Americans, and Asians in the United States, with the exception that anorexia nervosa is more common among Non-Hispanic Whites (Hudson et al., 2007; Wade et al., 2011). Eating disorders are real, complex, and devastating conditions that can have serious consequences for health, productivity, and relationships. They are not a fad, phase or lifestyle choice. Eating disorders are serious, potentially life-threatening conditions that affect a person’s emotional and physical health.
