Argentine performance troupe Fuerza Bruta's internationally successful show, Wayra, (trans: Brute Force Wind) is serving up hell of a night out to their faithful fans here in New York City. Take it from us, the show has already gone down a storm in both London and its native Buenos Aires.
Fuerza Bruta is a postmodern theatre show that originated in Buenos Aires in 2005 and was created by Diqui James. It is also the name of the company that brings the show.
OVERVIEW From the creators of the smash-hit De La Guarda, Fuerza Bruta is an event where worlds collide, dreams are real and reality takes a back seat. The visuals are spectacular. The effects are stunning.
“Fuerza Bruta: Wayra,” at the Daryl Roth Theater, skips that part, or at least it did the other night. This latest bit of sensory-overload brand extension from Diqui James and Gaby Kerpel, of “De la Guarda,” is a shiny, ever-shifting kinetic spectacle bent on disorientation.
Give the gift of Broadway. Overview Story. Not a traditional, story-driven production, Fuerza Bruta (or “Brute Force,” in English) is a completely non-verbal performance the uses music, dance, acrobatics, aerial imagery and some awe-inspiring visual displays and set designs.
Celebrating 10 years worldwide, Fuerza Bruta is an uninhibited and unforgettable show you have to see to believe! This theatrical thrill ride combines euphoria-inducing live music and breathtaking aerial displays in a performance that's as exhilarating as it is addictive.
