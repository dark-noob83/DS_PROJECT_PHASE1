Elvis Singing Unchained Melody At Live Concert. In his final recorded performance, this footage was previously available in bootlegged form. In this high quality film of a concert in Rapid City, SD in 1977, Elvis masterfully plays the piano and sings the popular song Unchained Melody.
Elvis then announces that, I’d to sit at the piano because we are recording this live before performing his fourth live 1977 version of ‘Unchained Melody’ . After a false start Elvis comments, Hey. It sounds awfully dry fellows.
When Elvis Presley hit the road in June 1977, he was an absolute mess. He was only 42, but years of prescription drug abuse and horrifying dietary habits had left him bloated, depressed and near death. He had an enlarged heart, an enlarged intestine, hypertension and incredibly painful bowel problems.
Two days later, the cameras were still rolling when the tour hit Rapid City, South Dakota. It was another weak and sad night until Elvis sat down at the piano near the end to deliver a spellbinding rendition of Unchained Melody.. As guitarist Charlie Hodge held a microphone, Elvis dug deep and poured his heart into the song.
