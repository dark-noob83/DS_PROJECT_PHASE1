Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies are specific for the autoantigen TPO, a 105kDa glycoprotein that catalyses iodine oxidation and thyroglobulin tyrosyl iodination reactions in the thyroid gland. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (or simply anti-thyroid antibodies) are autoantibodies targeted against one or more components on the thyroid.
The presence of TPO antibodies in your blood suggests that the cause of thyroid disease is an autoimmune disorder, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease. In autoimmune disorders, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack normal tissue. Antibodies that attack the thyroid gland cause inflammation and impaired function of the thyroid. Your doctor may also order a TPO antibody test if you are pregnant and have an autoimmune disease, especially one that involves the thyroid, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease.
No such correlations were found in CC group. The correlations between QDTI and serum levels of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase in patients with BC show that the positivity of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase is probably accompanied with structural changes in the thyroid tissue.

Anti-TPO antibodies are the most common anti-thyroid autoantibody, present in approximately 90% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 75% of Graves' disease and 10-20% of nodular goitre or thyroid carcinoma. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (or simply anti-thyroid antibodies) are autoantibodies targeted against one or more components on the thyroid.
Thyroid peroxidase (TPO), an enzyme normally found in the thyroid gland, plays an important role in the production of thyroid hormones. A TPO test detects antibodies against TPO in the blood. Antibodies that attack the thyroid gland cause inflammation and impaired function of the thyroid. Your doctor may also order a TPO antibody test if you are pregnant and have an autoimmune disease, especially one that involves the thyroid, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease.
In the BC group serum levels of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase negatively correlated with feature RAW (multiple regression, beta coefficient -0.75, p=0.004) and positively with feature F2 (multiple regression, beta coefficient 1.44, p=0.04). Serum levels of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase correlate with quantitative descriptors of thyroid ultrasound images in patients with breast cancer.

Testing for thyroid antibodies, such as thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO), is primarily ordered to help diagnose an autoimmune thyroid disease and to distinguish it from other forms of thyroid dysfunction. Testing may be performed as a follow-up when other thyroid test results such as total or free T3, free T4, and/or TSH indicate thyroid dysfunction. One or more thyroid antibody tests may also be ordered to determine if a person with an autoimmune condition is at risk of developing
Measurements of anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) autoantibodies have higher sensitivity and equal specificity to anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) autoantibody measurements in the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease. In cases of neonatal hypothyroidism, the detection of anti-TPO or anti-Tg autoantibodies in the infant suggests transplacental antibody transfer, particularly if the mother has a history of autoimmune thyroiditis or detectable thyroid autoantibodies. The neonatal hypothyroidism is likely to be transient in these cases.
The most clinically relevant anti-thyroid autoantibodies are anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO antibodies), thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) and thyroglobulin antibodies. TRAbs are subdivided into activating, blocking and neutral antibodies, depending on their effect on the TSH receptor. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (or simply anti-thyroid antibodies) are autoantibodies targeted against one or more components on the thyroid.
