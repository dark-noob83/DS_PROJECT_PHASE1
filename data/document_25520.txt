One of the most interesting features of the temperate deciduous forest is its four changing seasons. And as the seasons change, so do the colors of the leaves of the deciduous trees. The average temperature of the forest is about 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The average rainfall here in the forest is 30 to 60 inches a year. I f you look at the graph to the left, you'll see that next to the rainforest, the temperate deciduous gets the second-most amount of rainfall per year. In the winter, this is seen as snow.
Health Issues. Location Deciduous biomes are located primarily in the eastern half of the United States, Canada, Europe, parts of Russia, China, and Japan. Climate The average temperature of the forest is about 50 degrees F. The average amount of rainfall in the forest is 30 to 60 inches a year. As the seasons change, so do the colors of the leaves of the deciduous. During the winter months water is generally not available to keep the leaves of some plants alive.
The average yearly temperature is about 10°C. The areas in which deciduous forests are located get about 750 to 1,500 mm of precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. During the fall, trees change color and then lose their leaves. This is in preparation for the winter season.
Following rainforests, temperate deciduous forests are the second-rainiest biome. The average yearly precipitation is 30 - 60 inches (75 - 150 cm). This precipitation falls throughout the year, but in the winter it falls as snow. The average temperature in temperate deciduous forests is 50°F (10°C). Summers are mild, and average about 70°F (21°C), while winter temperatures are often well below freezing. PLANTS: Trees and plants in deciduous forests have special adaptations to survive in this biome.
