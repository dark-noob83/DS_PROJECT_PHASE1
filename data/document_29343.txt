Marine protected areas (MPA) are protected areas of seas, oceans or large lakes. MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources.
In the United States, more than 10 percent of our land has been reserved as protected parks, wildlife refuges and wilderness areas, but the same level of care has yet to be given to our ocean, where less than 1 percent is protected. Underwater parks, called marine protected areas, strongly improve our ocean’s health.
A marine reserve is a highly protected type of MPA where removing or destroying natural or cultural resources is prohibited. These two terms are sometimes mistakenly used interchangeably. Marine reserves are rare in the United States, with about 3 percent of U.S. waters in these no-take areas.
A marine protected area is a “geographic area with discrete boundaries [like the boundaries of a piece of real estate or a park] that has been designated to enhance the conservation of marine resources” (Ocean Studies Board).
Definition of MPA. A marine protected area (MPA) is essentially a space in the ocean where human activities are more strictly regulated than the surrounding waters-similar to parks we have on land.
The majority of marine protected areas in the United States are multiple-use sites, meaning fishing, boating, surfing, diving, and other recreational activities are allowed. Marine protected areas (MPAs) in the U.S. come in a variety of forms and are established and managed by all levels of government.
MPAs act as safe havens for marine life. There are many different types of MPAs including national marine sanctuaries and national estuarine research reserves. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are areas of the oceans or Great Lakes that are protected for a conservation purpose. If you have ever gone fishing in central California, diving in the Florida Keys, or boating in Thunder Bay, you have visited one of these MPAs.
