Some motherboards come with a graphics card built in. This is called 'integrated Graphics' and can be very useful on systems that do not require powerful 3D graphics (for games or animation). If the model name has 'VGA' in the title it means the board has integrated graphics. Your choice of motherboard will be limited to one that is compatible with your chosen processor and memory. For example if you have chosen a socket775 processor with a 1333MHzFSB and some 800MHz DDR2 memory then you will need to look for a motherboard that has a socket775 and supports these FSB and memory speeds.
If you do want to play new, modern games (from 2007 onwards) you will need to buy a graphics card. Most, if not all of them go into the PCI slot on your motherboard and handle all graphics on the computer. Think of having two hands. Two hands can type a document on a computer with ease. The integrated graphics chip on the new will be far faster than what you have in your old PC. If you are unhappy with the performance of the new PC you may always add a graphics card later. If the integrated graphics uses 256 meg of the PCs memory make sure the new PC has at least, preferably 4 or more gig.
The GPU (graphics processing unit) was once soldered onto the motherboard, but “integrated graphics” is now integrated into the CPU itself. Intel CPUs come with integrated “Intel HD Graphics” or “Iris Graphics” hardware, while AMD CPUs come with their own brand of integrated graphics. AMD calls these APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) because they contain CPU and GPU hardware on a single chip. Modern integrated graphics should be fine as long as you don’t plan on playing PC games. If you want good performance in the latest 3D games — or even games a few years old — you should definitely skip the integrated graphics and buy a dedicated graphics hard from the likes of NVIDIA or AMD.
Report Abuse. Some motherboards have integrated video/audio, but not all of them. That's actually pretty easy to check out: just look for the video out jack in the outer side of the motherboard, or make a simple google search for the motherboard you're considering. Best Answer: No, not all motherboards come with onboard. I am not sure what model of the P55 your buying, but a quick read here: http://techreport.com/articles.x/17598 shows no onboard. You could always use a older card until the one you want comes out. Source(s):
These motherboards are not compatible with graphics-integrated processors, and thus, an external video card will always be required. Yes. These motherboards are compatible with CPUs that feature integrated graphics Relatively speaking, on a desktop, these graphics tend to not be very powerful. Thus, they are not optimal for graphics-intensive tasks such as gaming or video editing.
So in this specific case, you do need a seperate graphics card, and your onboard ports will do nothing at all. More generally, if an intel processor from sandy bridge generation or later has integrated video, its on chip. I plan on building a computer with Intel Xeon E3 1231v3 which has no GPU: Graphics Specifications. Processor Graphics: None. on a Gigabyte GA-Z97X-UD5H motherboard which has an onboard integrated graphics processor: Integrated Graphics Processor: 1  1 x D-Sub port, supporting a maximum resolution of 1920x1200@60Hz.
Now I will also agree that your question is mute, most PCs come with an integrated graphics card and most motherboards have a PCI-e slot or regular PCI slot where you can install your own graphics card....so search the net for that PC and see if find out if the motherboard has an extra slot for graphics. The integrated graphics chip on the new will be far faster than what you have in your old PC. If you are unhappy with the performance of the new PC you may always add a graphics card later. If the integrated graphics uses 256 meg of the PCs memory make sure the new PC has at least, preferably 4 or more gig.
Nope. All Intel mobos now do not include an onboard GPU. If you buy an 1155 socket cpu with an integrated GPU (HD2500, HD3000, HD4000), that would be the onboard GPU that uses the mobos video outputs. m. The Motherboard is the Gigabyte GA-B75M-D3H, Intel B75, S 1155, DDR3, SATA III - 6Gb/s, PCIe 3.0 (x16), D-Sub/ DVI-D/ HDMI, Micro ATX. Does this have onboard Graphics.
