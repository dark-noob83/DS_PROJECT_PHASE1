The plantar aponeurosis, also known as the plantar fascia, is a strong layer of white fibrous tissue located beneath the skin on the sole of the foot. Towards the front of the foot, at the mid-metatarsal level, it divides into five sections, each extending into a toe and straddling the flexor tendons.
When dissected, aponeuroses are papery and peel off by sections. The primary regions with thick aponeurosis are in the ventral abdominal region, the dorsal lumbar region, the ventriculus in birds, and the palmar and plantar regions. Their primary function is to join muscles and the body parts the muscles act upon, whether it be bone or muscle.
tendons are cord-like, whereas aponeurosis are sheet-like a tendon connect bone to muscle It forms in sheets, instead of the bands that connect muscle to bone.
: an aponeurosis that is given off as a broad medial expansion of the tendon of the biceps brachii at the elbow and that descends medially over the brachial artery to fuse with the deep fascia covering the origins of the flexor muscles of the forearm—called also lacertus fibrosus.
