An abnormal low level of neutrophilis cells is called neutropenia. The number of neutrophils cells in the blood is measured by the absolute neutrophil number count. The neutrophils normal range is considered to be between 2500 and 6000. A number of neutrophils lower than the neutrophils normal range also increases the chances of bacterial infections.
The Basophils should remain within the normal range, generally between 0% and 2%. Some clinicians believe that, as in the case of neutrophils, the absolute basophil count is more important than the percentage of basophils and should fall between 0 to 0.3 k/ul.
It is derived by multiplying the WBC count times the percent of neutrophils in the differential WBC count. The percent of neutrophils consists of the segmented (fully mature) neutrophils) + the bands (almost mature neutrophils). The normal range for the ANC = 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3). WBC count: 6,000 cells/mm3 of blood.
Absolute neutrophil count: The real number of white blood cells (WBCs) that are neutrophils. The absolute neutrophil count is commonly called the ANC. The ANC is not measured directly.
Absolute neutrophil count values can be normal and abnormal. Absolute neutrophil count normal range exceeds from 2,300/mm3 in healthy person but if it is above 1,000/mm3 then it is said to be safe for treating the patient through chemotherapy. The value of absolute neutrophil count below 1,000/mm3 is said to be abnormal as it extremely increases the risk of infections.
The normal range of the percentage of neutrophils is between 45% and 70%. More important than the percentage of neutrophils is the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) , which should fall between 1.0 to 8.0 k/ul.
Neutrophils Normal Range. Blood tests may include a blood differential test that has the purpose to measure the percentage of each type of white blood cell, including the Neutrophils. This test can also reveal whether there are any immature or abnormal cells.
