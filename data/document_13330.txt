In general, most American transit systems expect their buses to have a useful life of twelve years and 250,000 miles. Sydney, Australia, has a fleet plan that counts on a bus life expectancy of twenty-three years. Of course, buses are used for even longer in developing countries-in those countries, as long as the bus has not collapsed in a heap of metal it is good to go. Smaller Buses Can Have Useful Lives As Little As Seven Years.
Of they keep their buses for twenty years, however, they would only need to acquire (1000/20) 50 new buses every year. If a bus costs $500,000, then they have saved their capital budget ($500,000*33) $16,500,000 a year. In an era of transit budge starvation, that is truly significant savings. Sydney, Australia, has a fleet plan that counts on a bus life expectancy of twenty-three years.

In 1987, the average life of a Volvo was calculated to be 20.7 years. I have experience with Volvo models that have been run up to 350,000 miles on the original engine and eve … n the original automatic gearbox. That is an average of about 7.4 miles per gallon. Of course, that is an average across many sizes and styles of buses, and reflects the stop-and-go operation of these buses.
However, certain times of the year, depending on weather conditions, Hydrid Buses get the same 2.5 MPG as their diesel counterparts. Generally, a Hybrid Bus costs $150,000 more than a conventional bus, and has to be scrapped after a life span of 12 years.

Some states and a lot school districts have an absolute limit on how long a bus may be used. I think the age of a conventional (type C)school bus should be 14 years old before it is retired, and for a transit-style (type D) school bus, I think it should be 16 years old before it retires.

These buses were compared with nine standard diesel Orion V buses (Model Years 1994 and 1999) for bus usage, fuel economy and miles between maintenance calls. The evaluated buses were part of a 260 CNG bus order ($319,000 each) and a 125 diesel-electric hybrid bus order ($385,000 each) in 2003 and 2004. Results from the evaluation indicate that the hybrid buses offered on average, a 37 percent improvement in fuel economy over standard diesel buses. In addition, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) covers up to 80 percent of the purchase price of a standard diesel bus. Therefore a transit agency’s share of matching funds for a hybrid is $80,000 when compared to $60,000 for a conventional diesel.
The average price of a 40-foot hybrid bus typically ranges from $450,000 - $550,000 when compared to $280,000 - $300,000 for a conventional diesel bus. The price variation in hybrids is due to the order volumes and individual specifications of transit agencies. In addition, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) covers up to 80 percent of the purchase price of a standard diesel bus. Therefore a transit agency’s share of matching funds for a hybrid is $80,000 when compared to $60,000 for a conventional diesel.
