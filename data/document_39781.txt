The tentacles are very important to the snail. A snail have something called a radula in its mouth for grinding up its food. This radula is like a rough tongue, something like a file with rows of tiny teeth which it uses to scrap off leaves and flowers to eat.
A: A snail scrapes its food, rather than chews it like we humans do. A flexible structure called the radula in the snail’s mouth is lined with neatly organized rows and columns of tiny tooth-like projections. The snail moves its radula over the food, scrapes off bits of it, and swallows.
1 Snails and other gastropods feed by using a mechanism called a 'radula'. 2  The radula works to collect the food from the substrate surface, acting like a conveyer belt in order to bring the bits of algae into the back of mouth. 3  The radula may have hundreds of rows of teeth and over a hundred teeth per row.
How Garden Snails Digest Food. 1. A snail’s digestive system starts with its buccal mass, or its mouth, which is used to take in food. Snails have jaws inside their mouth to cut off bits of food. [1]. 2.
A snail have something called a radula in its mouth for grinding up its food. This radula is like a rough tongue, which it uses to scrap off leaves and flowers to eat. Snails eat mostly living plants as well as decaying plants.
When feeding. When a food source is located, the snail will begin to feed by first opening its mouth. The protractor muscles move the odontophore forward and the radula comes in contact with the food. The retractor muscle sets bring the odontophore and the radula backwards and the teeth scrape the surface.
