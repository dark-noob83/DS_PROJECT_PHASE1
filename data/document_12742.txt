That the ratio (iron atoms)/(oxygen atoms) is 4/6, or 2/3, and nothing else is an example of the law of definite proportions. If iron is heated in the presence of less oxygen, it is possible to synthesize another iron oxide, Fe 3 O 4, called magnetite. This is the magnetic loadstone known for centuries as a naturally occurring mineral. It is black in color, and its balanced net synthesis reaction is.
Ruthenium(IV) oxide. Osmium(IV) oxide. Iron(III) Oxide is one of the oxide compounds of iron, which has the chemical formula Fe 2 O 3. It has many different names and some of the most common names it is called is hematite, rust, ferric oxide, and colcothar.
Some compounds have been known for so long that a systematic nomenclature cannot compete with well-established common names. Examples of compounds for which common names are used include water (H 2 O), ammonia (NH 3), and methane (CH 4).
Best Answer: i think its ozone because when two atoms of oxygen combine with one atom of oxygen they form oxygen oxide i.e O2 + O = O3 (ozone) hope i helped have a great day and a bright future ahead:). Source(s): ϟ●•ƨƭλя FIяσ•●ϟ · 6 years ago.
About Oxides. Oxides are compounds that contain one or more oxygen atoms and one or more other atoms. Oxide compounds make up a large proportion of the earth’s crust – nearly all metals naturally occur as minerals in oxide and compound forms which require processing and treatment to obtain the pure metal.
Examples are CaO, Na2O etc. in Li2O, (oxide) where the oxygen has an oxidation number of -2, or in Na2O2, (peroxide)where each oxygen has the oxidation number -1, or even in KO2, where the o.n. of O2 is 2- (this is called superoxide).
