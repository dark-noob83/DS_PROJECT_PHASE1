The metalloids or semimetals are located along the line between the metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. The metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Polonium is often considered a metalloid, too. Properties of the Semimetals or Metalloids. The electronegativities and ionization energies of the metalloids are between those of the metals and nonmetals, so the metalloids exhibit characteristics of both classes. Silicon, for example, possesses a metallic luster, yet it is an inefficient conductor and is brittle.
Metalloids, by definition, have properties of both metals and non-metals. Although chemical and physical differences can vary throughout the group. But the two general characteristics are that metalloids often form amphoteric oxides and often behave as semiconductors.
The Metalloids, or semi-metals, are elements with properties intermediate between metals and non-metals. Elements in the Metalloids GroupThe Physical and Chemical Properties are the characteristics of a group, like Metalloids, which distinguishes it from the other groups in the Periodic Table. Refer to the article on Metalloids for additional information and facts about this group of elements.
At times, these elements are also referred to as semi-metallic elements. Owing to the distinct characteristics of metalloids, they lie between the metals and nonmetals in the period table. With the help of these distinct characteristics, a line is drawn in order to separate them from the nonmetals in the periodic table.
Metalloids are elements that occur in groups 13 to 17 of the periodic table. As their name suggests, metalloids possess characteristics of metals and nonmetals. Typical characteristics of metals include a shiny luster, some degree of malleability and an ability to conduct electricity or heat.
