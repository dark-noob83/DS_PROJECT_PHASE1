The first and second ventricles are contained within the cerebral hemispheres and have a complex shape due to the expansion of the cerebral hemispheres. These ventricles are called the lateral ventricles because they are side-by-side, separated in the middle by a thin partition called the septum pellucidum. 
The largest cavities of the ventricular system are the lateral ventricles. Each lateral ventricle is divided into a central portion, formed by the body and atrium (or trigone), and 3 lateral extensions or horns of the ventricles. The central portion or the body of the ventricle is located within the parietal lobe. Capillaries of the choroid arteries from the pia mater project into the ventricular cavity, forming the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle (see the image below). The choroid plexus is attached to the adjacent brain structures by a double layer of pia mater called the tela choroidea.
The lateral ventricles are cavities in each of the cerebral hemispheres containing cerebrospinal fluid. From these, the fluid flows into the third ventricle located between the right and left thalamus. 1 The Five Major Parts of the Brain At its most basic, the brain controls the body. 2  Electrical impulses are sent along the nervous system to and from the brain that regulate all movement. 3  The brain and the nerv…. 4  The Location and Function of the Cerebrum The cerebrum is the largest and most advanced part of the human brain.
Ventricles 1 and 2 are the two lateral ventricles (right and left), one located within each hemisphere of the cerebrum. Each lateral ventricle empties via an interventricular foramen (of Monro) into the third ventricle, a vertical slit located in the midline between the right and left halves of the thalamus. CEREBELLUM. Describe the cerebellum. The cerebellum is located in the inferior and posterior aspect of the cranial cavity, inferior to the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and posterior to the brain stem. The cerebellum is separated from the cerebrum by a fold of dura known as the tentorium cerebelli.
The cerebrum is a large part of the brain containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In humans, the cerebrum is the superior-most region of the central nervous system. Cerebral cortex [edit]. Surface of the cerebrum. The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of gray matter of the cerebrum, is found only in mammals. In larger mammals, including humans, the surface of the cerebral cortex folds to create gyri (ridges) and sulci (furrows) which increase the surface area.
Cerebellum. The cerebellum, the second largest portion of the brain, is located below the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. Three paired bundles of myelinated nerve fibers, called cerebellar peduncles, form communication pathways between the cerebellum and other parts of the central nervous system. Each cerebral hemisphere is divided into five lobes, four of which have the same name as the bone over them: the fontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the occipital lobe, and the temporal lobe. A fifth lobe, the insula or Island of Reil, lies deep within the lateral sulcus.

Overview. The ventricles of the brain are a communicating network of cavities filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and located within the brain parenchyma. The ventricular system is composed of 2 lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct, and the fourth ventricle (see the following images). Capillaries of the choroid arteries from the pia mater project into the ventricular cavity, forming the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle (see the image below). The choroid plexus is attached to the adjacent brain structures by a double layer of pia mater called the tela choroidea.
