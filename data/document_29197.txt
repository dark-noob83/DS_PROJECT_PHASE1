by Naveen. Crayfish vs Crawfish. Crayfish and crawfish are crustaceans living in freshwater with a great resemblance of the lobsters. However, their size is smaller compared to the lobsters. The two names crayfish and crawfish have reference to the same group of crustaceans of two superfamilies namely Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. However, the two names came in different times and those were coined by two different scientists.
Crayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, or mudbugs, are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills and are found in bodies of water.
Crayfish, also called crawfish or crawdad, are closely related to the lobster. More than half of the more than 500 species occur in North America, particularly Kentucky (Mammoth Cave) and Louisiana in the Mississippi basin.
There are three families of crayfish, two in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern-Hemisphere (Gondwana-distributed) family Parastacidae lives in South America, Madagascar and Australasia, and is distinguished by the lack of the first pair of pleopods.
