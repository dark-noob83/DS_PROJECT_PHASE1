A reasonable Lewis structure for the nitrate polyatomic ion, NO 3 − , is below. This Lewis structure shows two different types of bonds, single and double. Because it takes more energy to break a double bond than a single bond, we say that a double bond is stronger than a single bond.
First, though, sodium IS a metal and NO3 contains three N-O covalent bonds. A bond is simply the term used when two atoms share electrons. If you subtract the electronegativity of each of the two bonding atoms the resulting number will tell you what type of bond you have.
The potassium ion (K+) is ionically bonded with the nitrate ion (NO3-) , however Within the nitrate ion three oxygen atoms are bonded to a central nitrogen atom through covale … nt bonds.
Nitrate is a polyatomic ion, meaning atoms of oxygen and nitrogen are covalently bonded to each other (bonding due to the sharing of electrons), and the nitrate ion has a charge of (-1). If you look up nitrate on Wikipedia you can see a picture of the structure.
The NO single bond length in gaseous nitrates MONO 2 depends strongly on the substituent M. In ‘simple’ nitrates (M=SiMe 3, CH 3, H, halogens, or CF 3) this bond lengthens with increasing electronegativity of M from 1.383(5) A å In me SiONO siono 2 to.1(507) 4 a å in. fono 2

Potassium nitrate is a polar molecule where electrons are both lost and gained. One atom of oxygen gains an electron, while potassium and nitrogen lose an electron. The nature of the bond between nitrogen and oxygen is strongly covalent, with an electronegativity of 0.5.
Best Answer: How do you want it discussed? In terms of hybridization, bond types etc? Nitrate ion is a trigonal planar structure with 120° bond angles. It is one N=O bond and two N-O bonds. The N=O bond can alternate in the overall structure which gives rise to three possible resonance structures, with the N=O bond in different positions. The bonding itself is not difficult.
