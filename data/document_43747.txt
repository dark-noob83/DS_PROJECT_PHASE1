1 Amphiprotic substance: A molecule or ion that can behave as either a proton donor or a proton accepter. 2  Water is an example of an amphiprotic substance: 3  Can act as an acid (lose a hydrogen ion): 4  Can act as a base (gain a hydrogen ion): 5  The hydrogen carbonate ion (HCO3-)
Definition: Amphiprotic describes a substance that can both accept and donate a proton or H + . An amphiprotic molecule has characteristics of both and acid and a base and can act as either. It is an example of a type of amphoteric molecule. Examples: Amino acids are examples of amphiprotic molecules.
Amphoteric Substances. An amphoteric substance is an oxide of an element that can act as both an acid or a base. Common amphoteric substances are the oxides of the elements and beryllium, aluminum, zinc, tin and lead.
As amphiprotic and amphoteric are quite similar, the difference between amphiprotic and amphoteric too is quite confusing. Both of the terms, amphiprotic and amphoteric, are both related to acid â€“ base chemistry. Amphoteric substances behaves as an acid and as a base.
Amphiprotic substances. An amphiprotic substance is a substance that can donate or accept a proton, H +. For a substance to be amphiprotic it must. 1  contain a hydrogen atom which is able to be donated to another chemical species. 2  be able to accept a hydrogen ion from another species.
