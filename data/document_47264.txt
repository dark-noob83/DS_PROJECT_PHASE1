Re: Asphalt shingle overhang at drip edge. As a contractor, I do a lot of roofing. My practice, in line with the manufacturer's advice is to overhang the shingles 1/2 to 1 inch over the eave-starter on the eave's and to cut it flush with the eave-starter on the rakes. By installing eave-starter on the rake, most water is diverted away from the fascia. Re: Asphalt shingle overhang at drip edge.

Yes. Shingles should not extend more than 3/4 ” past the drip edge. If shingles overhang the edge of the roof by more than 3/4”, then they are not supported and may crack and break off. In addition, the wind resistance at the roof edge may be compromised. 
Even when old shingles are removed the new shingles should only hang over the edge of the roof edge metal about 1/2, otherwise you are covering too much of the guttering with the roofing. 1+3/8 shingle overhang is way too much, 2 is pathetic. The shingles should never hang over the metal roof edge more than 1/2. Source(s): General Contractor 30yrs. and counting. Tedruski · 6 years ago.

What ever amount of overhang is present, it can't be wrong if installed as per manufacturer's written installation instructions, usually located on every bundle of shingles these days, (and online).

Hi,if the roofer used an extended drip edge flashing the shingles should be even with the outer edge of the perimeter of the dripedge. However, if they used an L type metal flashing or no flashing at all, then the starter course and the shingles must be extended beyond the perimeter eve and rake edges 1/4 to 3/4 inch. So, on average, the shingles extend a full inch from the fascia, including the drip edge. This is what's under the shingle, what I think is the drip edge. The shingles extend 3/4 past the end of the upper lip of this piece. Hand gives perspective of about 2 1/2 inch clearance. Sorry I couldn't get better pictures.
The general consensus seems to be that shingles should extend over the drip edge by 1/4 to 3/4 of and inch depending on the roof pitch and area of the country. The camp is in the western mountains area of Maine, Oquossoc/Rangeley and I figured 1/2 shingle overhang would be right for the area. 2/ insert a second drip edge 1/4 to 1/2 away from the existing drip edge. 3/ insert a 3-6 inch section of single shingle between the drip edge top and the existing shingle to get the 1/2 inch past the drip edge. I'm not about the options so asking for advice. I'll add that the contractor obviously thinks the way it was done is fine. I asked a local roofer how he did the roofs he has done
