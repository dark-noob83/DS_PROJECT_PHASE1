Frequently Asked Questions about Polonium 210. Po-210 is a radioactive material that occurs in nature at very low levels. Po-210 results from the natural radioactive decay of uranium, which is commonly found in Sierra Nevada granites. Po-210 emits alpha particles, which makes it decay to form a stable isotope of lead.
polonium-a radioactive metallic element that is similar to tellurium and bismuth; occurs in uranium ores but can be produced by bombarding bismuth with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. atomic number 84, Po. 1. 
Polonium is pronounced as peh-LOW-nee-em. History and Uses: Polonium was discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie, a Polish chemist, in 1898. She obtained polonium from pitchblende, a material that contains uranium, after noticing that unrefined pitchblende was more radioactive than the uranium that was separated from it. Polonium-210 is a very strong emitter of alpha particles. A single gram of polonium-210 creates 140 Watts of heat energy and is being considered as a lightweight heat source for thermoelectric power for spacecraft. Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138.39 days. Polonium's most stable isotope, polonium-209, has a half-life of 102 years. It decays into lead -205 through alpha decay. Polonium-209 is available from Oak Ridge National Laboratory at the cost of about $3200 per microcurie
Believe it or not, polonium-210 is one of the radioactive materials found naturally in the human body because of low levels in our environment.1,2 Yet the same substance has found frightening use as a deadly poison capable of causing a painful death, and widespread terror. More detail and supporting information is in the body of this article. 1  Polonium-210 is a rare radioactive metal discovered by Marie Curie in the late 19th century. 2  It has a half-life of 138 days, decaying to lead.
Polonium was the first element discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie in 1898, while seeking the cause of radioactivity of pitchblende from Joachimsthal, Bohemia. It required several tonnes of pitchblende to produce very small amounts of polonium. Polonium is produced through decay of the small quantities of the bismuth isotope 210 Bi present in pitchblende (uranite, largely UO 2). However the quantities are very small. Uranium ores might contain about 0.0001 g of polonium in a tonne of ore.
Polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two metallic allotropes. The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis, with an edge length of 335.2 picometers; the beta form is rhombohedral. Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half-life of all its isotopes. 210 Po, 214 Po, and 218 Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus polonium can be found in uranium ores at about 0.1 mg per metric ton (1 part in 10 10), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium.
Polonium is a chemical element with symbol Po and atomic number 84, discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie. A rare and highly radioactive element with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to bismuth and tellurium, and it occurs in uranium ores. Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half-life of all its isotopes. 210 Po, 214 Po, and 218 Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus polonium can be found in uranium ores at about 0.1 mg per metric ton (1 part in 10 10), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium.
Polonium is a rare and highly radioactive element. It is found naturally in the atmosphere and in the earthâ€™s crust, though in miniscule quantities. Marie Curie discovered the element in the late 19th century and named it after her native country of Poland (in Latin: Polonia).
