Cook the roast in an uncovered pan in the oven at 175 C for 20 minutes per 500 g (350 F for 20 minutes per pound.) Leave butcher's string on when cooking. After cooking, each rib piece will carve like a pork chop. It may be bound with butcher's string. The roast may have anywhere from 3 to 8 ribs in it, depending on the size. A 4 rib roast will weigh about 3 pounds (1.4 kg); an 8 rib roast will weigh about 4 1/2 pounds (2 kg.). You can cook it whole as a roast, or cut between the ribs to make pork rib chops.
