The Cost Of Assisted Living. The average cost for living in an Assisted Living facility ranges between $60 and $80 per day ($1800 to $2400/month) for the basics. This cost covers room and board, basic utilities (electricity, heat, water, and garbage), basic housekeeping (fresh linens) and some meals. This is similar to what many seniors would pay in an Independent Living facility but is much less expensive than the $70-$300 per day ($2100 to $9000/month) for a Nursing Home.. Use the Senior Service by state (right toolbar) to get more detailed information about the cost of senior living in that state.
Just as the cost of real estate varies by geographic area, assisted living costs also vary nationwide. In the 2015 Cost of Care Survey conducted by Genworth Financial, assisted living showed an increase of 2.86% compared to the 2014 costs and the national median monthly rate is $3,600.
1 The facilities that the senior assisted living offers can affect the price, and this is the reason why the cost can range anywhere from $70 to $350 per day, while monthly rates can range from $2,100 to $10,000. 2  Amenities, geographical locations, and more can greatly influence the overall price tag. 1 The average daily cost of a semi-private room was $189. 2  According to the site AssistedSeniorLiving.net, the price to get the service can range anywhere from $70 to $300 per day while monthly rates can range from $1,800 for a lower end home, while higher end senior assisted living can cost $9,000.
@Marlene--first read the article. The ave. price of assisted living is around $3000, not $6000. Even for the $6000 in a SKILLED Nursing, you seem to be ignoring the cost of meds, keeping nurses and other caregivers on staff 24-hr/day, and the high acuity of some of the residents. 1 The average cost of living in a not-for-profit. 2  is $2,672.00 per month, or $32,064.00 annually. 3  The average monthly rate for. 4  is $4,270.00 per month or $51,240
The Census Bureau estimates that, on average, the per-diem rate for assisted living in a private room is about 60%-70% of the cost of a similar-sized room in a nursing home. That could mean a bill of between $50 and $120 per day, and a good-sized case of sticker shock for potentially millions of Americans. 
1 For example, the average assisted senior home in Alabama costs $2,800 while a home in California can cost more than $6,000 on average. 2  According to the American Association of Homes and Services, the average daily cost for a private room in a nursing home was $213 per day. 1 The average daily cost of a semi-private room was $189. 2  According to the site AssistedSeniorLiving.net, the price to get the service can range anywhere from $70 to $300 per day while monthly rates can range from $1,800 for a lower end home, while higher end senior assisted living can cost $9,000.
Assisted Living Costs by State. The Genworth 2015 Cost of Care Survey is the most comprehensive study of its kind. Genworth Financial surveyed approximatey 15% of assisted living communities. The monthly cost is for a one-bedroom unit in an assisted living facility. Genworth Financial notes that the costs of assisted living has gone up more than nursing homes, adult day care and home care. Many times, residents that would go into a nursing home can use an assisted living facility instead. They argue that the rise in cost is just a bit more than average inflation.
The national median monthly rate for a one-bedroom unit in an assisted living facility is $3,500, according to the 2014 Cost of Care Survey released in April by Genworth Financial Inc. of Richmond, Virginia. That's $42,000 per year, an increase of 1.45 percent over 2013. 
The average cost for a private one-bedroom apartment in an assisted living residence is over $3,000 per month, according to research compiled by several nonprofit senior living organizations, including the Assisted Living Federation of America. 
Again, costs vary by state, but the average monthly cost for an assisted living center in most states is between $1000 and $3000 per month. Monthly costs in Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont, Washington D.C. and Wyoming are higher than average, sometimes up to $5000 per month.
