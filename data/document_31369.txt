Heavy metal poisoning, or more properly metal toxicity is the toxic effect of certain metals in certain forms and doses on life. Some metals are toxic when they form poisonous soluble compounds. Certain metals have no biological role, i.e. are not essential minerals, or are toxic when in a certain form.
Share. Examples of heavy metals include lead, mercury and cadmium. Less commonly, any metal with a potential negative health effect or environmental impact may be termed a heavy metal, such as cobalt, chromium, lithium and even iron.
The most common heavy metal pollutants are arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead and mercury. There are different types of sources of pollutants: point sources (localized pollution), where pollutants come from single, identifiable sources.
Many metals, particularly heavy metals are toxic, but some heavy metals are essential, and some, such as bismuth, have a low toxicity. Most often the definition of “heavy metals” includes cadmium, lead, mercury and the radioactive metals. Metalloids (such as arsenic, polonium) may be included in the definition.
Introduction. The term heavy metal refers to any metallic chemical element that has a relatively high density and is toxic or poisonous at low concentrations. Examples of heavy metals include mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), thallium (Tl), and lead (Pb).
Toxic metals, including heavy metals, are individual metals and metal compounds that negatively affect people's health. Some toxic, semi-metallic elements, including arsenic and selenium, are discussed in this page. In very small amounts, many of these metals are necessary to support life.
