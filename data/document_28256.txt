Most likely she's going to get pregnant. When they are stuck together it is because the male dog has knotted and is ejaculating. So unless you have dog condoms or Plan B for dogs then most likely your dog will probably be pregnant. Source(s): Dogs all of my life. Dogs become stuck together as the male has a knot formation while having sex. This becomes swollen and closes up the vagina, thus the pair can become caught together during sex....this is a sexual adaptation which is there so it enhances the chances of the female dog getting pregnant.
There is no blood or urine dog pregnancy test that can be used, as the hormonal changes a dog goes through are relatively similar whether the dog is pregnant or not. Therefore, you have to rely on symptoms of dog pregnancy, at least initially. For about the first month, you likely will not see many outward dog pregnancy signs, as the changes inside your dog are microscopic. About 2 - 3 days after mating, the eggs are fertilized on their way to the uterus. At 10 or 11 days, the fertilized eggs implant themselves in the uterine lining.
You will have to keep her leashed, even when she is in your yard. There is an abortion shot that can be given to dogs. As a warning; it can cause cancer, metritis, and other diseases. Spaying your female is the only definate solution to pregnancy prevention. You can abort your dog's pregnancy, but you would need to talk to your vet about this option as early in the pregnancy as possible. If your dog is already pregnant and you want an abortion performed, talk to your vet today!

· just now. Report Abuse. Get her straight to your vet-NOW-for a shot to stop any pregnancy that's virtually bound to have happened. Provided you take her in today, now, you might get away without needing an emergency spay, which is dangerous because of her condition, the increased blood flow to that area.

Definitely take her to the vet first thing tomorrow morning. Dogs don't have recreational sex. The only time the male will mount the female is when she's in heat and capable of becoming pregnant. Or maybe I ought to say the only time the female will allow this to happen is when she can become pregnant. Get him neutered also, boy dogs will be boy dogs and will torture females unless they are neutered. Dogs do not get pregnant everytime, but there is a good chance that she will, that is why he stays inside so long, to help seal the deal. If she does get pregnant, get her spayed. As soon as possible
If your dog is pregnant, she'll handle most of the pregnancy on her own. Your primary job will be to: 1  Take her to the vet for an initial pregnancy exam to make sure her symptoms are related to an illness. 2  Provide her with the best nutrition you can. 3  Make sure she gets moderate exercise-nothing too strenuous or tiring. 4  You just want to help your dog stay toned and not become overweight. 1
