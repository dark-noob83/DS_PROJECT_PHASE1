When I owned my own boat, It cost me about $3000.00 a year in storage(dry storage), maintenance and insurance. Each launch and retrieve plus repairs was extra.

As you can see, the cost of slipping your boat varies from island to island. You can spend as little as $2,100.00 or as much as $21,000.00 per year for a boat slip … and you pay extra for metered water and electricity. Those figures do not include dues and fees associated with yacht club membership, if you decide to go that route. You can put your 28-foot boat in a slip, but you’ll pay 40-foot prices.

The Cost to Build a Boat Dock. The costs associated with dock construction are extremely variable. Prefabricated or assembled docks can be as cheap as $1,000 while high-quality permanent docks can cost between $50,000 and $75,000, depending on the difficulty of installation, water depth, climate, and other factors. They are installed in much the same way but often at a lower cost. This type is best suited for shallow water and clement weather. A prefabricated pipe dock will cost between $1,000 and $2,000, but that does not include installation. A budget in the neighborhood of $3,000 to complete the project should suffice.
