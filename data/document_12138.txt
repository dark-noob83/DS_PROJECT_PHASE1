Heart disease and angina. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that most often occurs when you do certain activities or feel stressed. It is caused by poor blood flow through the blood vessels of the heart muscle.
Not too painful this one! Soluble Fiber Eating foods rich in soluble fiber helps to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) which contributes to angina. Soluble fiber is found in fruit, vegetables, linseeds (flax seeds) and oats. Avocados Rich in vitamin E, eat one a week.
If you already have angina, making lifestyle changes also helps to prevent your symptoms getting worse and reduces your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. The best way to achieve this is to eat a healthy, balanced diet, try to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level, and avoid smoking.
Eating an unhealthy diet high in saturated fat and salt increases your risk of developing angina, and increases your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Eating a diet that includes lots of fibre, such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta, and plenty of fruit and vegetables can help to reduce this risk.

Eating foods that are high in fat and cholesterol will cause more frequent pain.
