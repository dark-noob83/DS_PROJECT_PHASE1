UK estate agents charge anywhere between 1.5% - 4% of the property's price in house-selling fees not forgetting the additional 20% for VAT. A typical estate agent's fee could total around £7,680 after VAT, in London the average House price is approximately £350,000 which could equate to commission as high as £16,800. Add to this a solicitor's conveyancing fees, which average around £1,000. 
Estate agents will often stress that they can’t budge from their standard percentage fee. Remember though, it’s not the average percentage fee but rather the total amount of fees throughout the year that matters to the business. Even 0.6% of £500,000 is £3,000 and that goes a long way in the current financial climate. So just beware that when the agent quotes you a fee of 1% of the £300,000 sale price, you will actually pay 1% of the sale price PLUS 0.175% of the sale price in VAT. So you are effectively paying the agent 1.175% and not 1%. As of 1 January 2011 when VAT rises to 20% this figure will be 1.2%. In real terms on a £300,000 property with a 1% fee this means that you will pay £3,600 and not £3,000. 3
1 Fees are often quoted excluding VAT, which is currently 20%. 2  So a 1% fee is 1.2% inc VAT, or £3600 on a £300,000 home and a 2.5% fee is 3.0% inc VAT, or £9,000 on a £300,000 home. 3  Estate agents should clearly state whether fees include or exclude VAT. 4  If the agent does not say upfront, be sure to check this point. Estate Agent fees vary, but 2% is a common rate of commission. Doesn’t sound much when you say it like that but work it out and that’s the 4 figure number you’re being asked to pay. We know, it hurts. And it’s made worse by the fact Estate Agents aren’t very transparent about their fees.
Russell Quirk, of eMoov, says the fees that estate agents earn vary and can be as high as 2.5 per cent of the sale price. The average is 1.6 per cent, so for a property which sells for £242,000, the typical price for a property sold in 2013, commission would be £3,872. Average high street estate agent fees would eat almost £4,000 of a typical home sale, whereas an online service could sell your home for just hundreds of pounds. Charges: Some estate agents charge more than lawyers or doctors according to EMoov.
