Spontaneous globe subluxation is a rare orbital complication and presents in a dramatic fashion. It is characterized by the anterior displacement of the eye, usually when the equator of the globe protrudes beyond the retracted lids.
Emergency physicians encounter globe luxation, anterior dislocation of the eyeball beyond retracted lids, in a limited number of clinical circumstances. The authors present a case of spontaneous luxation followed by a general discussion of luxation.

Sir, Spontaneous subluxation of the globe is a rare event. Luxation occurs when the equator of the globe is allowed to protrude anterior to the eyelid aperture. The orbicularis muscle then contracts, causing further anterior displacement and the globe is caught outside
