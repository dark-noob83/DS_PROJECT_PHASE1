'Characteristics' can refer to many traits, including appearance, personality, and behavior. The traits an individual exhibits are sometimes referred to as a phenotype. Phenotype is often related to genetic information, or genotype, but genes are not the only determining influences.
Histones are spools of proteins that surround the chromosome and control the switching on of genes. National Human Genome Research Institute. Changes made to the protein spools that surround chromosomes are passed down generations, proving that inherited traits are decided by more than just DNA, says a new study.
The question of how nature versus nurture influences human development has been an ongoing debate for a very long time and at present there is no clear winner, as both nature (genes) and nurture (environmental factors) seem to play a vital and important role in human development.
1 Dominant and Recessive Traits Heredity traits are physical or other characteristics that are passed down to people from their parents. 2  For example, if both of your parents have blue eyes, you will have bl…. 3  Genotypes Genotype is a word that is defined as the genetic makeup of an organism, a cell, or an individual.
GENES. A gene is a small piece of the genome. It's the genetic equivalent of the atom: As an atom is the fundamental unit of matter, a gene is the fundamental unit of heredity. Genes are found on chromosomes and are made of DNA. Different genes determine the different characteristics, or traits, of an organism.
