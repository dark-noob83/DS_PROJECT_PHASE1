Residual elements enter steel from impurities in ore, coke, flux and scrap; from these, scrap is considered to be the main source of residuals. The most commonly found residuals are Cu, Ni, Cr, Mo, and Sn. The acceptance limits of these residuals depend mainly on product requirements.
Residual Risk versus Secondary Risk. Risk management is an integral component of project management. Risk management includes not only managing identified risks but also the residual and secondary risks.
Risk identification and analysis should also include residual risks (those risks that remain after an action has been taken) and secondary risks (those risks that arise as a result of implementing a risk response). See all posts in our PMP Concepts Learning Series.
In return, producers agreed to pay residuals on all films made in 1960 and afterward, and the Guild accepted a payment of $2.25 million to form a pension and health plan. SAG and AFTRA members have been collecting residuals ever since.
Medical principles pertaining to the incubation period and its relation to the course of the disease; i.e., initial or acute manifestation, or period and course of secondary and late residuals manifested, will be considered when time of incurrence of venereal disease prior to or after entry into service is at issue.
Residual Risk. Residual risk is the risk that remains after a risk response has been taken. The degree of risk tolerance should be considered to ensure that the amount of residual risk is acceptable. If not, additional risk actions may need to be taken to try and further reduce the risk.
(1) Venereal disease. The residuals of venereal disease are not to be considered the result of willful misconduct. Consideration of service connection for residuals of venereal disease as having been incurred in service requires that the initial infection must have occurred during active service.
