Businesses must first establish an account with the credit bureau and then begin transferring consumer information to that service. To ensure that the business knows how to report information accurately, the various credit bureaus conduct inspections before signing a reporting contract with the business.
The top three credit bureaus used in business credit are Dun & Bradstreet, Business Experian, and Business Equifax. Ninety-nine percent of creditors will report to one of these three credit bureaus. The top credit bureau is Dun & Bradstreet, so we will discuss it first.
Businesses can make corrections directly with the credit-reporting bureau, but consumers are responsible for verifying information as well. If a consumer discovers inaccurate information, he should gather evidence that the report is inaccurate and contact the credit bureau as well as the business.
Business credit is known as trade lines and is reported by business credit bureaus. To register a company with the business credit bureaus, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, HSBC Business Credit USA, Experian and Equifax, you must complete the following steps. Step 1. Retrieve your tax ID number.
The three major credit-reporting bureaus—Experian, TransUnion and Equifax—collect credit information about consumers. To assist in the gathering of this information, businesses can report consumer activity to these bureaus, which let consumers request a copy of their credit report.
Step 3. Register your company with the business credit reporting bureaus. Go directly to the websites of Experian Business, Business Credit USA and Equifax Business and register your business' DUNS and/or Employer Identification Number with each agency. Include your business' legal name and corporate address in the registration application.
