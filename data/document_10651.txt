Meibomian Gland Dysfunction is one of the leading causes of Dry Eye syndrome and often is a precursor to Posterior Blepharitis or Meibomitis (Meibomianitis).
MGD, also termed posterior blepharitis, is the most common form of lid margin disease. In the early stages, patients are often asymptomatic, but if left unmanaged, MGD can cause or exacerbate dry eye symptoms and eyelid inflammation. The oil glands become blocked with thickened secretions.
Download PDF. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is thought to be the leading cause of dry eye disease. Despite the importance of MGD to eye health, many questions have persisted about its classification and treatment.
Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) or Blepahritis, is a condition causing inflammation of the eyelids. Each eyelid, both upper and lower contains over 20 meibomian glands that are responsible for producing the outer, oily layer of the tear film.
MGD, also termed posterior blepharitis, is the most common form of lid margin disease. In the early stages, patients are often asymptomatic, but if left unmanaged, MGD can cause or exacerbate dry eye symptoms and eyelid inflammation. The oil glands become blocked with thickened secretions.
What causes Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a chronic disease, usually caused by obstruction of the secretory Meibomian glands. The subsequent reduction of gland secretion results in a decreased amount of lipids in the tear film. This results in a faster evaporation of the tear film and thus an evaporative dry eye.
Meibomian Gland Dysfunction/Dry Eye /Blepharitis. Dry eyes are a very common but potentially debilitating condition. There are many causes of dry eye but by far and away the most common cause is Meibomian Gland Dysfunction.
