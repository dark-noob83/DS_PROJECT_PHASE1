A: The amount you need is tied to the number of calories you eat in a day. For healthy adults, the USDA recommends 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories consumed. So a person eating 2,000 calories a day should aim to get 28 grams of fiber daily.
So just how much fiber do you need? The national fiber recommendations are 30 to 38 grams a day for men and 25 grams a day for women between 18 and 50 years old, and 21 grams a day if a woman is 51 and older. Another general guideline is to get 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories in your diet.
The amount of fiber you need on a daily basis depends on your age and gender. The standard recommendation for fiber consumption suggests that you should consume a minimum of 25 grams of fiber per day.
For example, if you require 2,000 calories per day for healthy weight maintenance you should consume 28 grams of fiber each day, and if you need 3,000 calories you should eat 42 grams of fiber every day.
The average adult only eats 15 grams of fiber per day. Women need 25 grams of fiber per day, and men need 38 grams per day, according to the Institute of Medicine. Eating more plant foods -- vegetables, beans, fruit, whole grains, and nuts -- is the best way and is one of the major recommendations from the U.S. government's 2010 Dietary Guidelines.
1 Use whole-grain breads with at least 2-3 grams of fiber per slice for sandwiches. 2  Choose whole fruit over juice. 3  Whole fruit can have as much as twice the amount of fiber as a glass of juice. 4  Toss beans into your soups, stews, egg dishes, salads, chili, and Mexican dishes.
For example, eat 38 grams of fiber each day if you’re a man ages 19 to 50, 30 grams per day if you’re a man age 50 or older, 25 grams if you’re a woman ages 19 to 50, 21 grams if you’re a woman age 50 or older, 28 grams if you’re pregnant and at least 29 grams of fiber each day if you’re breastfeeding.
