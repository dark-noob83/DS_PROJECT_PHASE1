For moderate-intensity physical activity, a person's target heart rate should be 50 to 70% of his or her maximum heart rate. This maximum rate is based on the person's age. An estimate of a person's maximum age-related heart rate can be obtained by subtracting the person's age from 220. For example, for a 50-year-old person, the estimated maximum age-related heart rate would be calculated as 220 - 50 years = 170 beats per minute (bpm).
Heart rates are referred to in “beats per minute” or bpm. The “target” heart rate zone is between 65-85% of your maximum predicted heart rate. In order to calculate Heart Rate Training Zones, you first need to calculate your Maximum Heart Rate. 
Target Zone. The lower end of your target heart rate zone for moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is 50 percent of your maximum heart rate. For instance, if you are 30 years old and have a maximum heart rate of 190 then your lower limit is 95 beats per minute. The upper end of the range is 70 percent of your maximum. So if your maximum heart rate is 190 then the upper end of your range would be 133 beats per minute. Know Your Max. Your target heart rate zone for moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is based on your maximum heart rate. This rate varies based on your age, going down as you get older. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention you can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220.
A person's target heart rate zone is between 50 percent and 85 percent of his or her maximum heart rate, according to the AHA. Most commonly, maximum heart rate is calculate by subtracting your age from 220: 1  220 - Age. 2  For a 30-year-old person, for example: 220 - 30 = 190. For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the person’s physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm
Heart rate, also known as pulse, is the number of times a person's heart beats per minute. A normal heart rate depends on the individual, age, body size, heart conditions, whether the person is sitting or moving, medication use and even air temperature. Even emotions can have an impact on heart rate. For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the person’s physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA.
It's important to note that maximum heart rate is just a guide. You may have a higher or lower maximum heart rate, sometimes by as much as 15 to 20 beats per minute. If you want a more definitive range, consider discussing your target heart rate zone with an exercise physiologist or a personal trainer. To determine your desired target heart rate zone, use an online calculator. Or, here's a simple way to do the math yourself. If you're aiming for a target heart rate of 70 to 85 percent, which is in the vigorous range, you would calculate it like this: 1  Subtract your age from 220 to get your maximum heart rate. 2  Multiple that number by 0.7 (70 percent) to determine the lower end of your target heart rate zone
Target heart rates are based on age. They are usually expressed as a range, such as 108 to 144 beats per minute. The lower end of the target heartbeat range a€” â in this, case 108€” a â is half of the fastest heart rate that a typical person your age should have. during exercise 1 Compare this to your target heart rate. 2  If your actual heart rate is lower than the low end of your target range, you may want to exercise a little harder. 3  If it's higher than the high end of your target range, you should slow down a bit.
The normal resting adult human heart rate ranges from 60–100 bpm. Tachycardia is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 BPM is common and is considered normal.
