Six Extrinsic eye muscles attached to the exterior surface of each eyeball control eye movement and make it possible for the eye to follow a moving object. Summary of actions of each extrinsic eye muscle: Lateral rectus-moves eye laterally. Medial rectus-moves eye medially.
The actions of these two muscles are antagonistic: one muscle must relax while the other contracts to execute horizontal eye movements. Four other extraocular muscles working together control vertical eye movements and eye rotation around the mid-orbital axis (Figure 8.1, right).
For each eye, six muscles work together to control eye position and movement. Two extraocular muscles, the medial rectus and lateral rectus, work together to control horizontal eye movements (Figure 8.1, left). 1  Contraction of the medial rectus pulls the eye towards the nose (adduction or medial movement).
They act to control the movements of the eyeball and the superior eyelid. There are seven extraocular muscles – the levator palpebrae superioris, superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, lateral rectus, inferior oblique and superior oblique.
No, the human eye is an organ. However, each eye has six  muscles that control its movements: the  lateral rectus, the  medial rectus, the  inferior rectus, the  sup … erior rectus, the  inferior oblique, and the  superior oblique.
Central control of eye movement. It is worthwhile at this point to review the anatomy of the central pathways of the oculomotor system. Figures 4-5 and 4-6 schematically outline the major central pathways that are important to conjugate lateral gaze, conjugate vertical gaze and convergence.
