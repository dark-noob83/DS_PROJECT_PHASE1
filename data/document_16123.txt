The term  Molten Salt  is self-descriptive; it is melted salt (s). Another common name is Fused Salt (s). The simplest example of a molten salt would be to heat sodium chloride (table salt) to a red heat (greater than 801° C, or 1474° F) 1 upon which it would melt into a liquid. This liquid is stable, has a heat capacity similar to water (by volume) and flows much like water does.
Molten FLiBe (2LiF-BeF 2). Molten salt is salt which is solid at standard temperature and pressure (STP) but enters the liquid phase due to elevated temperature. A salt that is normally liquid even at STP is usually called a room temperature ionic liquid, although technically molten salts are a class of ionic liquids.
A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a type of nuclear reactor that uses liquid fuel instead of the solid fuel rods used in conventional nuclear reactors. Using liquid fuel provides many advantages in safety and simplicity of design. Generation IV roadmap published by US Department of Energy.
A non-electrical method of using molten salts to produce metals is used to produce titanium. Titanium oxide from various ores is reacted with chlorine and carbon (usually in the form of petroleum coke) to form titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) , which is a salt of titanium.
Electricity is run through molten sodium chloride (with a little calcium chloride salt added to lower the melting point of the sodium chloride). At one terminal chlorine gas is released (the anode) and at the other (the cathode) liquid sodium.
