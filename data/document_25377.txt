1 The 200-239 mg/dL range is termed borderline high. 2  Cholesterol levels higher than 240 mg/dL is considered high and counterintuitively, though this cholesterol level is no way near double to triple the desirable cholesterol level, the risk for vascular disease is almost doubled to tripled. Your risk for vascular related disease increases with higher serum levels of cholesterol. 1  Less than 200 mg/dL is considered desirable. 2  Levels considerably lower is not necessarily protective but places you at lower risk. 3 
These measures are: LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and cholesterol ratios. Before finding out your cholesterol levels, you need to have a blood test. After your blood test do not get too much alarmed if your total cholesterol level is higher than normal. You must understand the correlation of total cholesterol, LDL and HDL to the cholesterol ratio, which is explained below. All the numbers and measures below are expressed in mg/dL. 1. Total Cholesterol Levels. 1  Total normal levels of cholesterol should be under 200. 2  200 to 239 is borderline high; and 240 and higher is considered high.
LDL cholesterol sometimes is called “bad” cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.). HDL cholesterol sometimes is called “good” cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver.
In the United States, cholesterol levels are calculated in milligrams of cholesterol for each deciliter of blood. A result of under 200 mg per dL (5.2 mmol/L) is ideal. A level somewhere between 200 to 239 mg per dL (5.2 and 6.2 mmol/L) is within the edge line of high-risk class. LDL levels are therefore the very best gauge of risk of cardiac arrest. A low LDL cholesterol is much better. Lower than 100 mg per dL (2.6 mmol/L) is the ideal. Between 100 and 129 mg per dL (2.6 and 3.3 mmol/L) is close to ideal, while between 130 and 159 mg per dL (3.4 and 4.1 mmol/L) is borderline elevated.
Total Cholesterol. This is a measurement of all the cholesterol in your blood. Your risk for vascular related disease increases with higher serum levels of cholesterol. 1  Less than 200 mg/dL is considered desirable. 2  Levels considerably lower is not necessarily protective but places you at lower risk. 3  The 200-239 mg/dL range is termed borderline high.
2. LDL Normal Cholesterol Levels. 1  LDL normal levels of cholesterol, or bad cholesterol, should be under 130. 2  If it's between 160 and 189, it's high, and if it's 190 or more, it's very high. 3  You must focus on lowering LDL/Bad cholesterol. All the numbers and measures below are expressed in mg/dL. 1. Total Cholesterol Levels. 1  Total normal levels of cholesterol should be under 200. 2  200 to 239 is borderline high; and 240 and higher is considered high.
Your total cholesterol level is in the Desirable range, but your level of bad LDL cholesterol is High. This may mean that your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, is too low. It is best to have a high level of good HDL and a low level of bad LDL. Cholesterol levels should be measured at least once every five years in everyone over age 20. The screening test that is usually performed is a blood test called a lipid profile. Experts recommend that men ages 35 and older and women ages 45 and older be more frequently screened for lipid disorders.
1 Cholesterol levels higher than 240 mg/dL is considered high and counterintuitively, though this cholesterol level is no way near double to triple the desirable cholesterol level, the risk for vascular disease is almost doubled to tripled.

The simple equation to find out the ratio is: HDL/Total Cholesterol or LDL/HDL. Whereas the normal levels of cholesterol ratios of LDL to HDL should be less than 2.5. And remember that this is the best indicator of risk of heart disease and stroke. All the numbers and measures below are expressed in mg/dL. 1. Total Cholesterol Levels. 1  Total normal levels of cholesterol should be under 200. 2  200 to 239 is borderline high; and 240 and higher is considered high.
