Its location is the nucleus, and its mass is 1.67262 x 10-27 kg. Protons have an effective size of about 1.2 x 10-15 m, and the nucleus is r … oughly the cube root of the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) times that typical proton size, usually still on the order of 10-15 to 10-14 m in size. The charge on an electron is -1. The mass of the neutron is 1.67493 x 10-27 kg. The elementary charge is equal to 1.60218 x 10-19 Coulombs. The proton and electron each carry this charge, but the sign of the charge will be positive for the proton, and negative for the electron.
Protons and electrons are oppositely charged. Neutrons have no charge. This means the nucleus of an atom is always positively charged. An atom has a neutral overall charge because it has the same number of electrons as protons. Protons and neutrons have the same mass. Electrons have such a small mass that this can usually be taken as zero.
Best Answer: No protons and neutrons do not have the same electrical charge. A proton has a positive charge (+1) and a neutron has no charge (0). protons and neutrons are in the nucleus of the atom, electrons are orbiting the nucleus much like planets that orbit the sun; electrons each have a -1 charge. 
Protons and neutrons do not have the same mass. Their masses are quite close, but they are noticeably different. For some purposes it is okay to equate the neutron and proton mass, but it's just an approximation. Also, neutrons decay into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino. 
Atoms consist of electrons [electrons: Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons. ] surrounding a nucleus [nucleus: The central part of an atom. It contains protons and neutrons, and has most of the mass of the atom. ] that contains protons protons: Sub-atomic particles with a positive charge and a relative mass of 1. and neutrons neutrons: Uncharged sub-atomic particles, with a mass of 1 relative to a proton. . Neutrons are neutral, but protons and electrons are electrically charged. Protons have a relative charge of +1, while electrons have a relative charge of -1. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. In the periodic table atoms are arranged in atomic number order
The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than the mass of a proton. The neutron has no electric charge while the proton has a positive charge (+1 elementary charge). The ma … ss of a neutron and a proton are 1.67492729(28)×10−27 kilograms and 1.672621637(83)×10−27 kilograms respectively. The mass of the neutron is 1.67493 x 10-27 kg. The elementary charge is equal to 1.60218 x 10-19 Coulombs. The proton and electron each carry this charge, but the sign of the charge will be positive for the proton, and negative for the electron.
Protons and neutrons have nearly the same mass while electrons are much less massive. If we assume that a neutron has a mass of 1, then the relative masses are: Neutron = 1. Proton = 0.99862349. Electron = 0.00054386734. Said another way, protons are only about 99.86% as massive as neutrons while electrons are only about 0.054% as massive as neutrons. While relative masses are nice if you want to compare protons, neutrons and electrons to one another, it doesn't tell you what the actual masses of these particles are. In kilograms, the masses are: Neutron = 1.6749286*10 -27 kg. Proton = 1.6726231*10 -27 kg
Each proton and neutron has about the same amount of mass, measured in daltons, or atomic mass units (amus). Because the unit of measure is defined by one proton, 1 proton = 1 neutron = 1 dalton = 1 amu. Electrons do have some mass, but it is almost 2000 times less than the mass of a proton. They come in different kinds, called elements, but each atom shares certain characteristics in common. All atoms have a dense central core called the atomic nucleus. Forming the nucleus are two kinds of particles: protons, which have a positive electrical charge, and neutrons, which have no charge.
