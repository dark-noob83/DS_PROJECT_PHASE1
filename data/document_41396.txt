Sebaceous cysts can be present at birth or caused by skin trauma, swollen hair follicles, and high levels of testosterone. The primary symptom of a sebaceous cyst is a painless nodule or pale lump in the skin. Sebaceous cysts are very common. They are not cancerous and are generally not a serious condition. A sebaceous cyst is a type of cyst that forms in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. A sebaceous cyst is also sometimes called an epidermal cyst. It forms when a sebaceous gland, an oil-producing gland in the skin, becomes blocked. This creates a sac that fills with a fatty yellow substance that can resemble cottage cheese
A sebaceous cyst /sɪˈbeɪʃəs sɪst/ is a general term that is used to refer to either: 1  Epidermoid cysts (also termed epidermal cysts, infundibular cyst), or. Therefore technically speaking they are not sebaceous cysts. True sebaceous cysts (i.e. cysts which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum) are relatively rare and are known as steatocystomas or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex.
A. Many people often call any small, painless lump under the skin  sebaceous cysts .. But those are most often epidermoid cysts.. Sebaceous cysts are much less common and affect the sebaceous glands, the oil glands in the skin. Epidermoid cysts can be made up of a protein called keratin and fat. They usually appear on the face, neck, or upper body, especially the chest and shoulders.
The scalp, ears, back, face, and upper arm, are common sites for sebaceous cysts, though they may occur anywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. In males a common place for them to develop is the scrotum and chest. Therefore technically speaking they are not sebaceous cysts. True sebaceous cysts (i.e. cysts which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum) are relatively rare and are known as steatocystomas or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex.
The primary symptom of a sebaceous cyst is a small lump under the skin. The lump usually is not painful. In some cases, however, cysts can get inflamed and become tender to the touch. There may be redness and/or increased temperature of the skin on the area of the cyst. These cysts are closed sacs that can be found under the skin of the entire body, except for the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. A cyst usually is a slow-growing lump that can move easily under the skin. A foul odor may be noticed from the overlying skin.
Causes of a Sebaceous Cyst. Sebaceous cysts form out of your sebaceous gland—which produces the oil called sebum that coats your hair and skin. Cysts can develop if the gland or its duct, the passage where oil is able to leave, become damaged or blocked. This usually occurs due to a trauma to the area. Small cysts are typically not painful. Large cysts can range from uncomfortable to considerably painful. Large cysts on the face and neck may cause pressure and pain. Areas on the body where cysts are usually found include: 1  skin on the scalp. 2  face (most common site for cyst removal). 3  neck. 4  back.
However, the above types of cyst contain keratin, not sebum, and neither originates from sebaceous glands (epidermoid cysts originate in the epidermis and pilar cysts originate from hair follicles). Therefore technically speaking they are not sebaceous cysts. True sebaceous cysts (i.e. cysts which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum) are relatively rare and are known as steatocystomas or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex.
