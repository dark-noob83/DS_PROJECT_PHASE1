Every AA meeting is 1 hour long. It will have a set format and structure, so after your first meeting, you can expect mostly the same format every time. The only thing that will change is the topic of discussion. One of the traditions of AA is that members are all trusted servants, so no one governs the group.
Normally an hour-Most AA meetings are an hour too. When the meeting is a speaker meeting, they ususally last an hour and a half. My main problem wasn't alcohol.
Almost as important as the meeting itself is coming early and staying late. You get to meet and. the people this way, and the ones that do come early and/or stay late usually have a pretty good program. It doesn't take long-maybe 20 minutes either side of the meeting-but to me its worth it. After all I sure put my time in at the bar! The least I could do is put similar effort into AA.
Most meetings last one hour or 90 minutes. At the end of the meeting, the group members stand, join hands, and recite the Lordâ€™s Prayer or the Serenity Prayer, for those who care to join. With slight variations, this basic meeting format is the same throughout the world, varying only in language.
