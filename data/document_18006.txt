1 How It Works: A stylist applies a keratin hair-straightening product to your hair and then uses the heat of a flat iron to seal it in. 2  The process takes about 90 minutes or longer, depending on your hair's length.

How a Keratin Treatment Works. Basically, a stylist will apply a keratin product to your hair (there are many versions available to salons some containing more formaldehyde than others, more on that below) carefully avoiding getting the product on your scalp. The treatment remains in the hair as it's blow-dried and then flat-ironed. Popular brands included Brazilian Keratin Treatment, the Brazilian Blowout, Brazilian Hair Straightening. The word Brazilian (not to be confused with the Brazilian bikini wax, which happens further down the body) was the term that sold it.
Keratin Complex’s signature keratin works effectively on all hair types. Our unique Smoothing Therapy treatments contain high concentrations of keratin that penetrate throughout the hair structure, and then are sealed within the cortex to repair damage. 2 During application, the keratin treatment penetrates into the hair's cuticle. Hydrolyzed keratin strengthens keratin bonds from within, helps repair damage, and smoothes the hair shaft. 3 Keratin and additional conditioning agents help nourish and strengthen the hair, while restoring smoothness and shine.

Keratin treatments are a temporary but long lasting hair straightening and conditioning process, typically performed in a salon. Keratin treatments take about 90 minutes to 2 hours to complete in a salon, depending on the length of the hair. The effects usually last around 8 to 10 weeks. The keratin treatment gradually leaves the hair, and there is no sharp difference between treated areas and new growth. Subsequent keratin treatments are done just the same way as the first treatment.
Keratin treatments won't make your hair break, but the flat-ironing might. The hair breakage has nothing to do with the treatments and everything to do with the flat irons that are used to dry and seal the hair afterward, says New York dermatologist Neil Sadick, MD.

Keratin (/ˈkɛrətɪn/) is a family of fibrous structural proteins. Keratin is the key structural material making up the outer layer of human skin. It is the key structural component of hair and nails, and it provides the necessary strength and toughness for masticatory organs, such as the tongue and the hard palate.
