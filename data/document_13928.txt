You can use the Projection Calculator for width and height dimensions. For example, if you want an 8-foot (96 inch) wide screen, the Calculator tells you that the height of the 16:9 image will be 54 inches, and the height of a 2.39 image will be 40 inches. You can move the screen width slider back and forth, and the height numbers will change automatically.
Throw distance x width of screen in inches = distance from screen to projector lens. Throw distance is the distance from the screen to the projector. For example, if your screen is 87” wide and the throw distance of your projector is 1.3, the projector should be 113” (87x1.3=113”) from the screen. Remember to measure from the center of the projector’s lens straight to the screen, like the above image shows.
Report Abuse. You should place the projector at less 10 to 12 feet away. Keep in mind that projectors needs to be in a dark room to be effective. The lamps on a projector only last about 2,000 hours and the cost of replacing them starts at $50 to around $300. For a 120 screen you should also seat back around 10 feet away, you what to see the whole screen without moving your eyes. Pick up a copy of Home Theater Magazine May issue, it list just about every projector in the market today.
If your room's depth allows you to place the seats 12 feet from the screen, you would want a screen that is 8 feet wide (8 x 1.5 = 12), in order to replicate the same viewing geometry you prefer in a commercial theater. For example, if you want an 8-foot (96 inch) wide screen, the Calculator tells you that the height of the 16:9 image will be 54 inches, and the height of a 2.39 image will be 40 inches. You can move the screen width slider back and forth, and the height numbers will change automatically.
You may not be able to get to 120 inches from 10 feet, but you can still get much larger than 73 inches. And even at 73 inches I think your image will be better. Plus you can actually get a short throw lens for many projectors to get to that 120 inch magic number. Just keep in mind for seating your ideal position for sound will be about 7 feet from the wall you will be watching the picture on.
For example, you figured out that you can have a maximum screen width of eight (8) feet for the 16:9 screen you want to place in your room. You think eight feet might be a little too big, so you decide a 7 foot wide screen would work better. The projector you want has a throw ratio of 1.8-2.2:1. So, 7.5 feet * 1.8 equals 13.5 feet, and 7.5 feet * 2.2 equals 16.5 feet, as is indicated in the example below. Next, make sure your room is set up so that you can place a projector in that area (either using a ceiling mount, a stand or a coffee table). Step 5. Projector placement Part 2.
What should be the ideal distance of projector to be placed from the sceen? I am planning for 120 screen and a DLP Projector Optoma HD20 as it is cheaper than good LCD projector. 
If you were to replace that 16:9 screen with an eight foot wide 4:3 screen, you might suddenly feel like your 12 foot viewing distance is too close--for any given screen width, the 4:3 format is always a larger surface area than 16:9, and is thus more visually demanding. Keep in mind also that the screen's height will influence ideal viewing distance. Let's assume you have a 16:9 screen that is eight feet wide, and you find that 12 feet, or 1.5x the screen width, is a comfortable viewing distance.
