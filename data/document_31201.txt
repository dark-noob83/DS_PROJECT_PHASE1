Oceanic crust is the part of the Earth's crust that makes up the seafloor. It's thinner, denser, and simpler in structure than the continental crust. Oceanic crust is also younger, on average; from its birth at a mid-ocean ridge to its end at a subduction zone is no more than 250 million years.
Oceanic Zones. There are four major oceanic zones where plants and animals live in the ocean. The four major zones are intertidal zone, neritic zone, open ocean zone and benthic zone. These zones contain the largest ecosystem on Earth.
Marine Zone: are divisions of the ocean. Oceanographers divide the ocean into two basic parts; the pelagic or open ocean, and the benthic or sea floor. The pelagic is divided into five broad zones according to how far down sunlight penetrates:
Where two tectonic plates meet at a subduction zone, one bends and slides underneath the other, curving down into the mantle. (The mantle is the hotter layer under the crust.). Tectonic plates can transport both continental crust and oceanic crust, or they may be made of only one kind of crust.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The oceanic zone begins in the area off shore where the water measures 200 metres (656 feet) deep or deeper. It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the oceanâ€™s completely open water. The oceanic zone has a wide array of undersea terrain, including crevices that are often deeper than Mount Everest is tall, as well as deep-sea volcanoes and ocean basins. While it is often difficult for life to sustain itself in this type of environment, some species do thrive in the oceanic zone (Col).
