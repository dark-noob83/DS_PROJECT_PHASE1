INTRODUCTION Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed principally of calcium carbonate (calcite) or the double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (dolomite). It is commonly composed of tiny fossils, shell fragments and other fossilized debris.
Sedimentary Rocks in Devonian. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is comprised mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). The majority of the grains within limestones consist of skeletal fragments from marine organisms that have died and settle to the ocean floor.
Some limestones form due to chemical precipitation of calcite or aragonite within hot springs or cave systems. Limestones can also be found within lacustrine (lakes) and evaporite depositional environments. The characteristics of marine limestones change as you move from shallow-to deep-water
Limestone is a rock that is composed primarily of calcium carbonate. It can form organically from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal and fecal debris. It can also form chemically from the precipitation of calcium carbonate from lake or ocean water. Limestone is used in many ways.
Marble Characteristics. Marble is a rock widely used in buildings, monuments, and sculptures. It consists chiefly of calcite or dolomite, or a combination of these carbonate minerals. Marble is a type of metamorphic rock formed from limestone.

Supratidal Limestone: Limestone Deposition in Supratidal Environments. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is comprised mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The majority of the grains within limestones consist of skeletal fragments from marine organisms that have died and settle to the ocean floor.
Limestone is calcareous sedimentary rocks formed at the bottom of lakes and seas with the accumulation of shells, bones and other calcium rich goods. It is composed of calcite (CaCO3). The organic matter upon which it settles in lakes or seas, are preserved as fossils.
