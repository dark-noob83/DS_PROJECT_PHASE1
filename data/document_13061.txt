Some chemistry experiments can be conveniently carried out at room temperature. Room temperature (also referred to as ambient temperature) is a common term to denote a certain temperature within enclosed space to which human beings are accustomed. And, of course, the ambient temperature of a room is usually room temperature. Yet small temperature differences have large effects on many natural processes. Therefore scientists who do observe a distinction between the two specifications may be sticklers about which one to apply.
Mercury-in-glass thermometer for measurement of room temperature. Room temperature is a colloquial expression for the typical or preferred indoor (climate-controlled) temperature to which people are generally accustomed. According to the West Midlands Public Health Observatory (UK), an adequate level of wintertime warmth is 21 °C (70 °F) for a living room, and a minimum of 18 °C (64 °F) for other occupied rooms, giving 24 °C (75 °F) as a maximum comfortable room temperature for sedentary adults.
To my (midwestern-US-reared) mind, 72 degrees F is indeed normal room temperature. My initial guess would be that it's because Imperial measurements are a base 10 / base 12 hybrid, and 72 is divisible by 12, making 72 a natural point of reference. The Wikipedia article on Fahrenheit is related and interesting. 
Room temperature is 72 degrees Fahrenheit. (22.2 C) That seems a bit high for Europe-we prefer 68 degrees. (20 C). Room temperature in Kelvin ranges from 290 degrees to 295 degrees.  This is the equivalent of 64 to 73
It represents the small range of temperatures at which the air feels neither hot nor cold, approximately 21 °C (70 °F). In scientific contexts, it may denote the range between 20 and 26 °C (68 and 79 °F), with an average of 23 °C (73 °F). According to the West Midlands Public Health Observatory (UK), an adequate level of wintertime warmth is 21 °C (70 °F) for a living room, and a minimum of 18 °C (64 °F) for other occupied rooms, giving 24 °C (75 °F) as a maximum comfortable room temperature for sedentary adults.
By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Definition: Room temperature is a range of temperatures that denote comfortable habitation for humans. There is no 'exact' room temperature. Room temperature can be any temperature between 20 °C and 29 °C. 300 K can also be used as room temperature for easy calculations when using absolute temperature.
Room Temperature. 28 pages on this wiki. Room Temperature (RT) is generally defined as the ambient air temperature in whatever environment being used for a given procedure. More specifically, it is defined as 20-25°C (68-77°F), as some ambient temperatures, by nature, do not fall within this range.
Best Answer: Room temperature is a common term to denote a certain temperature to which humans are accustomed. Room temperature is thus often indicated by general human comfort, with the common range of 20 °C (68 °F) to 25 °C (77 °F), though people may become acclimatized to higher or lower temperatures. The term can also refer to a temperature of food to be consumed, which is placed in such a room for a given time. Source(s): The term 'room temperature' is an important matter in different sectors of science like Physics, Chemistry & even in Biology. But it is most important in chemistry. It is the base of standard temperature & pressure (STP). It is 25 degree celcius or 298 kelvin.
Room temperature is defined as the common range of 20 °C (68 °F) to 25 °C (77 °F). Room temperature in Kelvin ranges from 290 degrees to 295 degrees.  This is the equivalent of 64 to 73 degrees Fahrenheit.
Scientific calculations. For scientific calculations, room temperature is taken to be roughly 20 to 23.5 degrees Celsius, 528 to 537 degrees Rankine (°R), or 293 to 296 kelvins (K), with an average of 21 °C, about 72.8 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). And, of course, the ambient temperature of a room is usually room temperature. Yet small temperature differences have large effects on many natural processes. Therefore scientists who do observe a distinction between the two specifications may be sticklers about which one to apply.
