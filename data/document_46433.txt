• Remove the cup from its plastic bag. There should be 3 to 5 caterpillars in the cup, ¼ to 1 inch long. At least 3 should become healthy butterflies. • Do not remove the lid. The food on the bottom of the cup is all the caterpillars need. • Allow caterpillars at least 24 hours to become active.
At room temperature the Painted Lady butterfly remains in the egg stage for 4-5 days, in the larval stage for 12 to 18 days, and in the pupae stage for about 8-10 days. Painted lady butterflies may begin laying eggs within 4 days after they emerge.
The Egg (3-5 days). Adult female butterflies lay their eggs on plants that Painted Lady caterpillars like to eat, like thistle or hollyhock. The eggs are the size of a pin head, each one containing a caterpillar beginning to grow.
Life Cycle: Painted Lady butterflies undergo complete metamorphosis with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Egg-Mint green, barrel-shaped eggs are laid singly on the leaves of host plants, and hatch in 3-5 days. Larva-The caterpillar has five instars over 12-18 days. Pupa-The chrysalis stage lasts about 10 days.
• They will shed their final caterpillar exoskeleton and form a pupal exoskeleton: the chrysalis. • Within 2 days after all the chrysalises form, remove the lid from the cup, lift the paper gently, and transfer it to the butterfly house.
Eggs of the Painted Lady appear to be pale green in color. Caterpillars are grayish brown and darker at the ends. They have a yellow stripe running down the back of their body, and spikes along the back and sides of their body. Pupae can be a variety of colors including a metallic green, brown, or bluish-white.
To grow into an adult they go through 4 stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. Each stage has a different goal-for instance, caterpillars need to eat a lot, and adults need to reproduce. Depending on the type of butterfly, the life cycle of a butterfly may take anywhere from one month to a whole year.
