A pre-event massage can be performed anytime from two days until immediately before a sporting event. Right before the event is the most common time for this type of massage.
Pre-Event Timing. A pre-event massage is performed the day of the competition, usually between 30 minutes to 2 hours before competition. Some massage therapists suggest 1-2 hours before, but in general, you want to give the athlete at least 30 minutes from the end of the massage to the start of their
Post-Event Technique. The post-event massage is typically given anywhere from 30 minutes up to 24 hours after competition or activity. When working with runners after a marathon, I will focus on post-event techniques even up to 48 hours after their race, because of the damage they are doing to their muscles.
* pre-event sports massage -- a short, stimulating massage 15 - 45 minutes before the event. It is directed toward the parts of the body that will be involved in the exertion. * post-event sports massage -- given within an hour or two of the event, to normalize the body's tissues.
The main difference between a pre-event and inter-event massage is duration. While a pre-event massage is given for just 10-20 minutes, an inter-event massage should be even more brief (about 10 minutes). This type of sports massage should focus on just the main muscles stressed during the previous competition.
PRE-EVENT MASSAGE. The techniques used in pre-event massage should be both stimulating and warming. They are intended to loosen an athlete's tissues, create warmth, and also to create a durable state of hyperemia that will help sustain the athlete throughout the event or practice.
