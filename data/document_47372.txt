An alveolus (plural: alveoli) is a word used in anatomy for hollow cavities, which are empty areas within a body. Although there are many different types of alveoli in the body, the word alveoli is usually used to talk about small air sacs in the lungs of mammals. These are also called pulmonary alveoli. These alveoli are located at the ends of the air passageways in the lungs.
Medical Definition of ALVEOLAR. 1. : of, relating to, resembling, or having alveoli. 2. : of, relating to, or constituting the part of the jaws where the teeth arise, the air cells of the lungs, or glands with secretory cells about a central space.

The concentration of carbon dioxide is lower in the alveolus than in the red blood cells, so carbon dioxide leaves the red blood cells, enters the alveolus, and is exhaled. In an average human lung, there are 480 million alveoli. Their total surface area is around 75 square meters.
The oxygen exchange in the lungs takes place across the membranes of small balloon-like structures called alveoli attached to the branches of the bronchial passages. These alveoli inflate and deflate with inhalation and exhalation. The behavior of the alveoli is largely dictated by LaPlace's law and surface tension.
Alveoli are small air sacs in the lungs, as small as a grain of sand. There are billions of these in the lungs, and the purpose of these alveoli are to supply de-oxygenated blood with a supply of oxygen through gas exchange. They are well-equipped to do this, as well.
