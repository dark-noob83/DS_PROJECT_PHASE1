The average kWh usage level refers to the typical amount of energy your household consumes in a given month. Electric providers commonly charge different monthly rates and fees related to the usage level your household falls into. 500 kWh, 1000 kWh, or 2000 kWh. Don’t be caught off-guard. 
In the US typical household power consumption is about 11,700 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010. 
The average electricity consumption of a US family of four is in the neighborhood of 50 kWh per day, or 1,500 kWh per month. Similar figures apply for Canada. Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh, that translates into about $6 per day for electricity, or $180 per month. I’d like to know the average electricity consumption for a family of four in one year. We are using about 700 kilowatt hours a month and that seems high to me.
But most of us don’t live in perfectly average households. (The state that comes closest to matching the average monthly electricity usage is Ohio). Depending on whether a state is hot or cold, urban or rural, an average household can use as little as 531 kWh a month (Maine) or as much as 1,245 kWh (Louisiana). Costs vary state-by-state, too. Hawaiians pay the most for electricity ($203 a month) and New Mexicans pay the least ($75 a month). As for our Inside Energy focus states: 1  Colorado homes use 706 kWh and spend $81 per month.
To determine your current month average price per kWh, you will need your Electricity Facts Label (EFL) that provides the applicable pricing components for the TXU Energy plan you have selected, and an estimate of your current month's kilowatt-hour (kWh) usage (and demand (kW) for your business, if applicable). 
How much electricity does an American home use? In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. 
My average monthly electric bill is around $42.00 U.S. My average monthly usage is 240 kilowatt hours (kWh) The average price I pay is something like $10.6 / kWh I'm pretty efficient, but let's see.. A lot of the compact fluorescents are 27W jobs, and I'm getting more 13W ones to replace those energy hogs. I use less that 400 kWh per month and my bills are over one hundred dollars. My current bill has me using 371 kWh for 30 days and the bill is $122. Even if I subtract the sales tax and some of the state imposed surcharges that Con Edison passes on to the customer, my rate per kWh is 30 cents per kWh.
You are mixing up watts and kilowatts. 1000 watts = 1 kilowatt. The average North American home uses about 1000 watts at any given time, or 1 kilowatt. Electricity is sold in units of kilowatt hours, which is 1000 watts for 1 hour. Report Abuse. The average household in the United States uses about 8,900 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year.. there are 9000 hours in a year. so 9e3 kwatt-hour/9e3 = about 1kw average usage, averaged over time, is 1000 watts. At 10¢ per kw-hr, that is 10¢ per hour, or $2.40 per day or $900 per yea
Household electricity use: 6,000 kWh per household per year for 3 residents average per household. So the household use per capita is 2,000 kWh or about of per capita electricity from all applications. Household Natural Gas use: 400 therms per household x 30 give 12,000 kWh equivalent electricity. Since much of the electricity is generated by natural gas, it is not totally unreasonable to compare these two in kilowatt hours.
