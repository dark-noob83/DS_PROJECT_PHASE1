Triangle Centroid. The geometric centroid (center of mass) of the polygon vertices of a triangle is the point (sometimes also denoted) which is also the intersection of the triangle's three triangle medians (Johnson 1929, p. 249; Wells 1991, p. 150). The point is therefore sometimes called the median point.
The centroid of a triangle is the point where the three medians (segments that connect a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side) of the triangle intersect. In the picture below, point G is the centroid of triangle ABC.
The centroid of a triangle is the point through which all the mass of a triangular plate seems to act. Also known as its 'center of gravity' , 'center of mass' , or barycenter. A fascinating fact is that the centroid is the point where the triangle's medians intersect. See medians of a triangle for more information.
A centroid of a triangle is the point where the three medians of the triangle meet. A median of a triangle is a line segment from one vertex to the mid point on the opposite side of the triangle. The centroid is also called the center of gravity
The Centroid is a point of concurrency of the triangle. It is the point where all 3 medians intersect and is often described as the triangle's center of gravity or as the barycent. 1  It is formed by the intersection of the medians.
While in geometry the term barycenter is a synonym for centroid, in astrophysics and astronomy, barycenter is the center of mass of two or more bodies which are orbiting each other. In physics, the center of mass is the arithmetic mean of all points weighted by the local density or specific weight.
