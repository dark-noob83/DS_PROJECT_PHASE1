Complaint. My complaint with The Acri Company is both a product issue and costumer service issue. I have spent over $100,000, yes that is correct one hundred thousand dollars with this company. The issues that I have, started with stonework that I had installed. Both the stone and concrete cracked. We told 2 people from ACRI our requirements and they didn't provide us the requested product. Currently, **** **** declares that he didn't say how big the window would be. We paid $4500 for a window that extends to about 9 inches out from the house.

If you want to choke or sting, use No. 18, each has its own personality. 1. Acerate: ACER ate (as’ e rate) adj.Shaped like a needle; as, acerate leaves2
