A Stacy Wiegman, PharmD, Pharmacy, answered. Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate is the generic name for the brand name drug Symbicort. It is a combination of two medications, budesonide and formoterol, that work together to help prevent symptoms of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
DRUG INTERACTIONS. In clinical studies, concurrent administration of SYMBICORT (budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate) and other drugs, such as short-acting beta 2 -agonists, intranasal corticosteroids, and antihistamines/decongestants has not resulted in an increased frequency of adverse reactions.
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is a powder which is slightly soluble in water. Its octanol-water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 2.6. The pKa of formoterol fumarate dihydrate at 25°C is 7.9 for the phenolic group and 9.2 for the amino group.
One active component of SYMBICORT (budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate) is budesonide, a corticosteroid designated chemically as (RS)-11β, 16α, 17,21-Tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with butyraldehyde. Budesonide is provided as a mixture of two epimers (22R and 22S).
Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate is not a fast-acting medication and should not be used during an asthma attack. Instead, it is used twice a day on a regular basis to help prevent symptoms.
