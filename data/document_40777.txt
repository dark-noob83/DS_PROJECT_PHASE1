The adult human skeletal system consists of 206 bones, as well as a network of tendons, ligaments and cartilage that connects them. The skeletal system performs vital functions — support, movement, protection, blood cell production, calcium storage and endocrine regulation — that enable us to survive.
The skeleton is composed of fibrous and mineralized connective tissues that give it firmness and flexibility. It consists of bone, cartilage, tendons, joints, and ligaments. Bones are a major component of the skeletal system. Bones that comprise the human skeleton are divided into two groups.
The skeletal system supports and protects the body while giving it shape and form. This system is composed of connective tissues including bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. Nutrients are provided to this system through blood vessels that are contained within canals in bone.
The human body is a complex network of symbiotic systems. The skeletal system and the muscular system work together as the framework for the body as well as providing the pieces that allow for movement.
The skeletal (bone) system is the main system support system in vertebrates. It provides the rigidity for muscle and organ attachment; bones, tendons and muscles work togeth … er forming sets of levers that enable us to move.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. the bones within the skeletal system aid in the protection of your internal organs, and tissues such as: the brain, eyes, heart, and lungs, and also the spinal cord. The bones not only protect but support as a frame. Last but not least, your bones assists your body in movement.
Our musculoskeletal system is made up of muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, cartilage, joints and bursae. Our muscles work with the nervous system to contract when stimulated with impulses (messages through the receptor arc) from motor nerves. The muscles are attached to the bones with ligaments.
