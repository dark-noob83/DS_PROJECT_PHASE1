Fiber Optic Illumination. Fiber Optic Illumination is used to provide intense, cool illumination for a number of optical or imaging applications. Fiber Optic Illumination often consists of fiber optic illuminators integrated with one or more light guides that direct illumination towards a specific application.
This fiber optical light source can provide wavelength output according to the specific requirements including the 650nm red source, 1310nm/1550nm wavelength for the single mode fiber and 850nm/1300nm wavelength for the multimode fiber.
You are here: Fiber optic light source is a fiber optic test equipment to measure the fiber optic loss for both single mode fiber cable and multimode fiber cables; usually the fiber optic light source is used with the fiber optic power meters.
