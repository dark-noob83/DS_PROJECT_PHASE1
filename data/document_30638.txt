Cerium oxide is the polish of choice for glass. Before you can polish scratches out of glass, you must first determine how deep the scratches are. If you can feel a scratch as you run your fingernail across it, the scratch is too deep to be polished out with cerium oxide. You must first grind the scratch out.
Simple put the head into your drill, then mix some water with the powdered Cerium Oxide to make a paste and dip a polishing head into the paste and apply the compound to the stain or hairline scratches on the glass. This buffing action is what removes the stains and scratches.
Cerium oxide is an important component of glass polishing powders and phosphors used in screens and fluorescent lamps. It is also used in the flint (actually ferrocerium) of lighters.
Cerium is a chemical element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. It is a soft, silvery, ductile metal which easily oxidizes in air. Cerium was named after the dwarf planet Ceres (itself named after the Roman goddess of agriculture).
Cerium Oxide Polishing Compound use for polishing and removal of fine scratches and scuff marks in glass and mirror. Use Cerium Oxide with Felt Polishing Wheel to remove scratches and scuff marks in glass and mirror. Mix with water into a paste to create fast acting scratch remover.
Cerium oxide is used to color glass for lamps and stained glass, and is also used in lighters to start the fire. It is used in porcelain and glass cleaning powders, so Windex probably contains some cerium.
Cerium oxide (Ce 2 O 3 and CeO 2) is a component of the walls of self cleaning ovens and of incandescent lantern mantles. Cerium oxide is also used to polish glass surfaces. Ceric sulfate (Ce(So 4) 2) is used in some chemical analysis processes. Other cerium compounds are used to make some types of glass as well as to remove color from glass.
