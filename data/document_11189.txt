No you can not lose your virginity from fingering because when you get fingered, your finger is only in your virgina whole it doesnt quite have enough forse to break your hymen. Even if you did break your hymen your cherry still dont pop because your finger isnt as big nor as wide as an penis.
A virgin is someone who has not yet had sex. So no you can't lose your virginity by fingering yourself, but yes it can effect the hymen. However whether or not the hymen is in tact does not have anything to do with being a virgin. Source(s): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin#Loss...
one loses their virginity when there is vaginal penetration with a penis. some, however, believe virginity can also be lost through oral or anal sex. self satisfaction, however, through fingering yourself, keeps you a virgin. no, loosing your virginity involves sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex.
