Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and oats. A glutamate is a salt of glutamic acid, an amino acid found in many proteins (not just gluten, and as far as I'm awa â€¦ re gluten does not contain an unusual abundance of glutamic acid). 4 people found this useful. Priyadarshi Raj.
Bottom line: There may be other reasons to avoid MSG but gluten is not one of them. According to the International Glutamate Information Service (http://www.glutamate.org) monosodium glutamate (MSG) is gluten free.
It used to be isolated from protein sources that contained high amounts of glutamic acid (monosodium glutamate is a monosodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid). The protein source typically used was wheat gluten. In fact, glutamic acid was first isolated in 1866 from the wheat prolamin gliadin.
People diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called celiac cannot eat gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Even trace amounts of gluten can cause damage to the small intestine and profoundly uncomfortable symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating, skin rashes, brain fog and weakness.
BUT even if MSG is either isolated from wheat gluten or fermented using wheat starch as a starting material, keep in mind that MSG is the monosodium salt of the single amino acid glutamic acid. MSG is NOT gluten, or gliadin, or even a celiac-toxic chain of amino acids.
Monosodium glutamate is safe on the gluten-free diet. It is not to be confused with gluten. This is a case of mistaken identity. These substances have similar names but are different. So often, names are given to compounds by one discipline and they end up being similar to names given by another discipline.
We had a reader question about whether or not MSG (monosodium glutamate) is gluten-free. There is a lot of chatter on different sites about MSG, and MSG can come from a variety of sources like corn, sugar beets, molasses, and wheat.
