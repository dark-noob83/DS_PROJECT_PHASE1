The average electricity consumption of a US family of four is in the neighborhood of 50 kWh per day, or 1,500 kWh per month. Similar figures apply for Canada. Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh, that translates into about $6 per day for electricity, or $180
The math: ------. Simpler answer: Energy used per day is measured in watt-hours, or more usually kilowatt-hours, and a typical house might use 35 kilowatt-hours per day. That is equal to 1.458 kilowatt-hours per hour, in other words an average power of 1.458 kilowatts.
Divide the result by 1,000 to convert watts to kilowatts. So for example, if your large window fan is rated at 250 watts and you use it 5 hours a day, its kWh use per day is 250 (watts) * 5 (hours used per day) / 1,000 (to change watts into kilowatts) = 1.25 kWh per day.
In the US typical household power consumption is about 11,700 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.
How much electricity does an American home use? In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh.
Answer by Noah Modie. Confidence votes 192. As an electrical engineer for a power company I see on average a house that is 1600-2000 square feet and having electric appliances except for the furnace use an average of 1500Kwatt-hours per month making 50 Kwatt-hours per day and a total of 18,000 Kwatt-hours per year.
