n a loss of tooth substance in contact areas through functional wear and friction, resulting in broadening and flattening of the contacts and a decrease in the mesiodistal dimension of the teeth and the dentition as a whole. wear, occlusal, n attritional loss of substance on opposing occlusal units or surfaces.
Wear is related to interactions between surfaces and specifically the removal and deformation of material on a surface as a result of mechanical action of the opposite surface.
Wear is defined as to have on the body or to reduce the quality of the appearance by constant use. 1  An example of wear is to have on a pair of sunglasses. 2  An example of wear is to wear a hole in the elbow of a jacket.
Street Wear. Street wear is defined as west coast skateboarding styles. A lot of street wear companies are based out of the west coast and focus on the styles a classic skateboarder would wear. This includes fitted pants, normally classic vans, screen printed large tees, and flat billed hats.
Wear can also be defined as a process where interaction between two surfaces or bounding faces of solids within the working environment results in dimensional loss of one solid, with or without any actual decoupling and loss of material.
The definition of wear may include loss of dimension from plastic deformation if it is originated at the interface between two sliding surfaces.
