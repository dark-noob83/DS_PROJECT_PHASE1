In the Rajmahal Hills, at the head of the Ganges delta, 906 km (563 mile) from Allahabad, the river turns south and begins a descent of 455 km (283 mile) to the Bay of Bengal.
The Ganges has been declared as India's National River. Ganges is the source of sustainment of life in the great Indian plains and it is at Gangotri that the journey begins. River Ganges gets water from the melting snow of Nanda devi, Gurla, Mandhata, Dhaulagiri, Gesaisthan, Kanchenjunga and Mount Everest.
The Ganges River, also called Ganga, is a river located in northern India that flows toward the border with Bangladesh (map). It is the longest river in India and flows for around 1,569 miles (2,525 km) from the Himalayan Mountains to the Bay of Bengal.

Once the Ganges River flows out of India and into Bangladesh its main branch is known as the Padma River. The Padma River is joined downstream by large rivers like the Jamuna and Meghna rivers.
A major city on an arm of the Ganges Delta is Calcutta. Calcutta is  the 3rd most populated city in India.
