Glycolysis. Glycolysis, part of cellular respiration, is a series of reactions that constitute the first phase of most carbohydrate catabolism, catabolism meaning the breaking down of larger molecules into smaller ones. The word glycolysis is derived from two Greek words and means the breakdown of something sweet
The net effect of gluconeogenesis is the reversal of glycolysis. In gluconeogenesis, glucose is synthesized from smaller precursors. From the G and values, you learned in BB 450, you can have an appreciation for the difficulty a cell has in simply reversing a pathway.

Glycolysis (from glycose, an older term for glucose + -lysis degradation) is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C 6 H 12 O 6, into pyruvate, CH 3 COCOO − + H + . For simple fermentations, the metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate has a net yield of two molecules of ATP. Most cells will then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD + and produce a final product of ethanol or lactic acid.
Glycolysis is an oxygen independent metabolic pathway, meaning that it does not use molecular oxygen (i.e. atmospheric oxygen) for any of its reactions. However the products of glycolysis (pyruvate and NADH + H +) are sometimes disposed of using atmospheric oxygen. For simple fermentations, the metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate has a net yield of two molecules of ATP. Most cells will then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD + and produce a final product of ethanol or lactic acid.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Allosteric regulation of an enzyme. In biochemistry, allosteric regulation (or allosteric control) is the regulation of a protein by binding an effector molecule at a site other than the protein's active site. The site to which the effector binds is termed the allosteric site. Allosteric sites allow effectors to bind to the protein, often resulting in a conformational change involving protein dynamics. Effectors that enhance the protein's activity are referred to as allosteric activators, whereas those that decrease the protein's activity are called allosteric inhibitors.
CHEM464 /Medh,J.D. Glycolysis1 Glycolysis • The Glycolytic pathway describes the oxidation of glucose to pyruvate with the generation of ATP and NADH• It is also called as the Embden-Meyerhof Pathway• Glycolysis is a universal pathway; present in all organisms: from yeast to mammals. Glycolysis2 Step-wise reactions of glycolysis • Reaction 1: Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6 phosphate. • This reaction requires energy and so it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. • Enzyme: hexokinase. It has a low Km for glucose; thus, once glucose enters the cell, it gets phosphorylated.
Allosteric regulation is organized so that molecules (like ATP and citrate), which are consistent with a high energy state of the cell, turn off glycolysis. Acetyl-CoA is consistent with a high energy state, and it turns off glycolysis and turns on gluconeogenesis as well. Allosteric Regulators of Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis control enzymes.

Glycolysis occurs in most organisms in the cytosol of the cell. The most common type of glycolysis is the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP pathway) , which was discovered by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and Jakub Karol Parnas. For simple fermentations, the metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate has a net yield of two molecules of ATP. Most cells will then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD + and produce a final product of ethanol or lactic acid.
The second half of glycolysis is known as the pay-off phase, characterised by a net gain of the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADH. Since glucose leads to two triose sugars in the preparatory phase, each reaction in the pay-off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule. For simple fermentations, the metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate has a net yield of two molecules of ATP. Most cells will then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD + and produce a final product of ethanol or lactic acid.
