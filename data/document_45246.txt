If you think gold, or silver are the most expensive metals in the world because we call them “precious”, you are wrong. For starters, other precious metals like platinum and rhodium cost more despite the fact that their prices came down considerably in recent weeks.
Precious Metals The precious metals include: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium, gold, and platinum. Their precious nature derives from the fact they are very scarce and unique among commodities in the manner in which they are judged as a measure of wealth.
100 times rarer than gold... 150 times more expensive than silver. In fact it's the most expensive of all precious metals. Yet no matter its rarity or cost, this metal is absolutely vital to the rapidly recovering automobile industry.
Rhodium Prices. With such a limited supply, rhodium doesn't come cheap. It is the most expensive of all precious metals, currently trading at $2,725 an ounce. (To give you a better idea of its cost, that's over twice as expensive as gold and 154 times more than silver.).
To the left you see a logarithmic graph comparing the physical abundances, by weight in the earth’s crust, of what many would recognize to be the seven most precious or “noble” metals. Ir, Rh, Re, Au, Pd, Pt, and Ag stand for iridium, rhodium, rhenium, gold, palladium, platinum, and silver respectively. These figures are at best educated guesses, but according to most sources iridium is the clear winner.
Four elements that have been prolific in the early discussions are Rhodium (Rh), Silver (Ag), Iridium (Ir), and Gold (Au). The other four Precious Metals (Ruthenium, Palladium, Osmium, and Platinum) have also proven themselves to be important -- see, for example, Laurence Gardner s Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark [1].
The World Rhodium Market. Rhodium — along with platinum, palladium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium — is part of a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs) or platinum group elements (PGEs).
