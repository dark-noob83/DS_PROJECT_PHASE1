The summit craters represent the area of the volcanic activity where there is a persistant fumaroles activity, are the site of explosive events of various types as: strombolian activities, foutauns of lava, phreatic activities that continually change the morphology of the vulcano.
The glacier-capped summit of Ecuador's Cotopaxi volcano is truncated by two nested craters. The outer crater, seen here from the SE, is 800 x 550 m wide. A cone that grew inside this crater is cut by a smaller crater that is 250 m wide and 120 m deep.
Summit Craters. The summit craters represent the junction area of the volcanic activity through which breathes the persistent vent of Etna, and in more or less regular intervals, are the site of explosive events of various types as: Strombolian obstruction phreatic activities etc. that continually change the morphology.
Excursions » Summit Craters. The excursions to the summit craters of our “gentle giant” are perhaps the most ambitious destinations of Etna excursion enthusiasts. The beauty of this spectacular painting by the force of nature leaves fortunate hikers breathless and with memories that will remain with them forever.
A summit crater is a circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity.
You will then walk to the summit craters (central crater-new mouth) at circa 3,300 m. Following your visit, you will then begin your descent by passing the north east crater and then go in the direction of the spectacular Valle del Leone. You will then arrive to the Pizzi Deneri volcanological observatory.
Noun. 1. volcanic crater-a bowl-shaped geological formation at the top of a volcano. crater. caldera-a large crater caused by the violent explosion of a volcano that collapses into a depression. geological formation, formation - (geology) the geological features of the earth.
