A luxury home doesn't always necessarily mean thousands of square footage, towering great rooms and gilded toilets. Take these homes for example: to begin building one of these epic houses, all you need is $2,000. That $2,000 will buy you a shipping container. 
I have done a deeper research in the past a few days. Actually, to build one like this, it can cost as much as $180/ft. A 40 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 8 1/2 feet tall container could be expensive to build. But some sell it for $8000 to $12,000/each(40' container, but it looks unattractive)
Bigger shipping container homes cost as much as $215,000, which is still only a fraction of the price of some conventional homes. Those who buy a shell and opt to hire a contractor for the rest of the technical work are looking to spend $50 to $150 an hour. Dimensions. ISBUs are made of 100 percent Corten Steel, and there are a range of different sizes for them. However, the popular choice for shipping container houses are former sea containers that come in two standard sizes: 1  20 feet long, 8 feet wide and 8 feet tall, equaling to 160 square feet.
It took architect Patrick Partouche one year and eight 40-foot shipping containers to build his two-story, 2,200-square-foot Maison Container house in Lille, France, though it was assembled in just three days. The shipping containers were transported to the site by truck and assembled using a crane. As a home building material, these containers actually have a lot to offer. Because they are abundant, recycling them as a living space is both environmentally friendly and inexpensive (they typically run between $1,000 and $2,000 per container).
For a used 20-footer in good condition, the cost can range anywhere from $1,400 to $2,800. A 40 foot shipping container will cost $3,500 to $4,500. Depending on where it is bought, some containers come with building kits and plans for personal customization. Dimensions.

Estimating Container House Costs. You will also generally have to pay to ship the container to a location near your construction site and this can cost between $80 and $500, depending on weight of the container and how far it is shipped. New 20-foot storage containers are priced usually between $1000 and $4000, and some are higher in price. If you want a lot of customizing done, this can cost between $50 and $150 an hour. New 40-foot cubes and containers don't cost a lot more than the 20-foot models. New containers may sell for $1400-$4000, or $1400-$5800 for cubes.
You can also opt to buy a finished structural system for your storage container home. These are called SG Blocks. They retail for about $9000-$11,000 for each unit. The total cost for a large house to be built from containers is between $150,000 and $175,000, after any options or add-ons are completed. This is still less than half the price per square foot of a conventional home. If you want a lot of customizing done, this can cost between $50 and $150 an hour. New 40-foot cubes and containers don't cost a lot more than the 20-foot models. New containers may sell for $1400-$4000, or $1400-$5800 for cubes.
My 480 sq ft (external dimensions) shipping container cabin, fully furnished, cost nearly $36,000 ($75/sq ft) to build. The only construction extravagances in this build, at least to me, were the new (one trip) shipping containers and a purposefully overbuilt foundation. Even if you were fortunate enough to find three shipping containers for free, all of the other associated costs such as shipping, crane rental, welding, and reinforcement, would still be required. Due to this, the free shipping container scenario would still cost about $24,500 ($51/sq ft).
This can run the whole bill up to $15,000 or more. On the other hand, those who are experienced with construction can completely finish and furnish a home of steel for less than $10,000. Some handy folks even manage to do it for less than $4,000! Now, more than likely the container will need to be transported to you. Dimensions.

Builders today offer prefab container homes; there are also plans and kits that allow you to customize a container house. A large house built from shipping containers ranges in price from $150,000 to $175,000, about half the price per square foot of a conventional home. Steel containers typically cost from $1,400 to $4,000, and customizing a container home with electricity, plumbing, windows and other options can cost from $50 to $150 per hour.
