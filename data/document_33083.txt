The average cost of one day of futile treatment in the ICU was $4,004 per patient. The cost of caring for the 123 patients whose treatment was perceived as being futile, both in and out of the ICU, was $2.6 million, the researchers found.
The total cost for PICU care was $16,983,323. Average cost per admission was $12,342 +/- $22,313, and average cost per patient day was $2,264 +/- $868. The cost because of the PICU location (room cost) was 52.1% of all costs, and cost of laboratory studies was 18.3%.
Hospital and Surgery Costs. Total health care spending in America was approximately $2.7 trillion in 2011. A little over 31 percent of that amount, or $814 billion, was spent on hospital services. Hospital costs averaged $3,949 per day, and costs per stay averaged $15,734.
Respective cost per day values for non-ICU (ward) care were $232 and $281. Differences in cost per day were $1,152 for medical survivors and $1,220 for surgical survivors. The mean ratios of ICU to non-ICU cost per day for survivors were 6.2 for surgical cases and 7.2 for medical cases. The 95% confidence intervals for the difference mean cost per day between ICU and non-ICU cost per day were $1,201 and $1,356 for surgical survivors, and $1,154 and $1,294 for med
-Mean hospital costs were $34,257 dollars (+/- $40,559 dollars) with lower average costs in rural and small hospitals. Discontinuing mechanical ventilation continues to be one of the most challenging events in ICU management, and a significant portion of time spent on the ventilator (40%) is dedicated to weaning..
My ICU is about $6,000 per day as the basic charge. On top of that the patient will get billed for the intensivist's services and any other consulting physicians, any tests or procedures will also be billed separately.
Depending on the services the patient requires, and the length of stay, patients can expect to pay roughly $3000 to $5000 for a typical stay. If the stay is prolonged, and you require more care, expect to pay roughly $50,000 for one week of service.
The average cost for a day of futile treatment in the ICU was about $4,000, the researchers found. For the 123 patients perceived as receiving futile ICU care, total costs during the three months of the study amounted to $2.6 million for the five ICUs.
-A total of 44.6% had at least one major co-morbid condition; the most common co-morbidities included diabetes (13.2 %) and pulmonary disease (13.2%). -Daily incremental cost of mechanical ventilation for ICU patients is estimated at between $600 and $1500 per day.
