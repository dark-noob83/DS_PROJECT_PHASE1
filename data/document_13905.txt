Alum is a salt that in chemistry is a combination of an alkali metal, such as sodium, potassium, or ammonium and a trivalent metal, such as aluminum, iron, or chromium. The most common form, potassium aluminum sulfate, or potash alum, is one form that has been used in food processing. Another, sodium aluminum sulfate, is an ingredient in commercially produced baking powder.
Any form of aluminum sulfate could be called alum, including toxic versions of the chemical. However, the type of alum you find used for pickling and in deodorant is potassium alum, KAl(SO 4) 2 ·12H 2 O. Sodium aluminum sulfate is a type of alum that is used in commercial baking powder.
Alum powder is a crystalline powder that is most commonly used in pickling; it keeps pickles firm and crispy. THIS ALUM WILL NOT GROW CRYSTALS. Alum powder is often used to firm and crispen pickles by letting them soak in a sealed brine solution of water, vinegar, salt, spices, and alum powder for several weeks.
1 This is the type of alum that you find in the grocery store for pickling and in baking powder. 2  It is also used in leather tanning, as a flocculant in water purification, as an ingredient in aftershave and as a treatment to fireproof textiles. 3  It's chemical formula is KAl(SO 4) 2. Potassium alum is used most often, although ammonium alum, ferric alum and soda alum may be used for many of the same purposes. 1  purification of drinking water as a chemical flocculant. 2  in styptic pencil to stop bleeding from minor cuts. 3  adjuvant in vaccines (chemical that enhances immune response).
1 Shaving alum is a powdered form of alum used as an astringent to prevent bleeding from small shaving cuts. 2  The styptic pencils sold for this purpose contain aluminium sulfate or potassium aluminium sulfate. 3  Similar products are also used on animals to prevent bleeding after nail-clipping. Potassium alum is the common alum of commerce, although both soda alum and ammonium alum are manufactured. 1  Shaving alum is a powdered form of alum used as an astringent to prevent bleeding from small shaving cuts. 2  The styptic pencils sold for this purpose contain aluminium sulfate or potassium aluminium sulfate
