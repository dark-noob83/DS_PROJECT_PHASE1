For example, say your first cleaning job paid $600 for cleaning a 2,000-square-foot floor 20 times a month. This is a total of 2,000 x 20 square feet or 40,000 square feet. You should determine how much you were paid per square foot, so on your next job you know what to charge.
Move in and move out cleans are charged by the hour, $30 per hour per cleaner. To insure a home is ready for new occupants a detailed cleaning is needed, especially in kitchen and bathrooms. Vacancy cleaning prices based on $30 per hour per cleaner. 1  600-800 square feet: $90-120.
Divide the total number amount of money received by the total square feet cleaned. Using the above example, this amounts to $600/40,000 square feet, which is $0.015 per square foot. Determine the price for a new example client who wants a 3,000-square-foot floor cleaned 15 times a month.
1 One-time cleaning of a 900-square foot two-bedroom apartment with five rooms, costs $74-$200. 2  A 1,300 square-foot single-story home with seven rooms runs $95-$300. 3  A 2,200 two-story three-bedroom home with nine rooms averages $149-$400.
If we take that $.095 cents a square foot price of $2,375.00 dollars and apply your estimated production rate, it will tell you how much time it will take to clean. For example, if you estimate your productiom rate to be 3800 square feet per hour, then you will have about 6.5 man hours to clean the building per service.
The estimate varies as it may start as low as $0.019 per square foot or as high as $0.050 per square foot. For example, using a base price of $0.026 per square foot as assuming a home is 2,450 square feet, the cost of a weekly cleaning would be $63.70, and bi-weekly would be $75.00. Please note, this is just an example. Most homes fall within the $55.00 to $85.00 rage.
