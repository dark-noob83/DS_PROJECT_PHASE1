Students studying philosophy on the graduate level in the US should expect to spend the first two years completing a Master’s degree on the way to the PhD. Upon graduation at the end of four to six years, the student will have both a Master’s degree in philosophy and a PhD. The length of time it takes to graduate is usually dependent upon how long it takes the student to finish the dissertation. It is nearly impossible to acquire fulltime work in philosophy with less than a PhD, and jobs are exceptionally competitive. A master’s degree in philosophy will help a student obtain other jobs in law, ethics, or secondary school education, but will do little for university work.
Master of Philosophy is offered by many Universities in Australia, and are often the only option to undertake a master's degree in select schools. In the University of Western Australia, for example, the School of Mathematics offers the Master of Philosophy. In most UK universities, completion of a M.Phil. typically requires two years of full-time or five years or more of part-time study (being five or seven years from initially entering university) and the submission of a thesis comprising a body of original research undertaken by the candidate.
The system of academic degrees in the University of Oxford can be confusing to those not familiar with it. This is not merely because many degree titles date from the Middle Ages, but also because many changes have been haphazardly introduced in recent years. The DPhil is a research degree, modelled on the German and American PhD, which was introduced in 1914. Rather atypically, Oxford was the first university in the UK to accept this innovation. 1  Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsychol). 2  Doctor of Engineering (EngD).
M.Phil. in Economics. The MPhil is designed to provide training in economics at the graduate level. It is comparable to the first two years of a PhD programme at the best US universities. The MPhil provides a solid foundation for progressing to the DPhil (doctorate) programme at Oxford or elsewhere. The Department of Economics at Oxford University has around 300 graduate students, amongst whom are some of the finest aspiring economists from around the world.
The degrees in Science and Letters were added in the 19th century, and the degree in Philosophy was added in 1914. The higher bachelor's degree programme is generally a taught programme of one or two years for graduates. The DPhil is a research degree, modelled on the German and American PhD, which was introduced in 1914. Rather atypically, Oxford was the first university in the UK to accept this innovation. 1  Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsychol). 2  Doctor of Engineering (EngD).
The new degrees of DClinPsychol and EngD are professional degrees in the American model. The EngD is the only Oxford degree to use the Cambridge abbreviation format. The DPhil is a research degree, modelled on the German and American PhD, which was introduced in 1914.

In Norway, the degree of MPhil is a 'standard' Master's degree (120 ECTS credits) at a level equivalent to an MA or MSc. Upon completion, the MPhil qualifies for acceptance to a PhD program, but is most often taken as a stand-alone qualification. In most UK universities, completion of a M.Phil. typically requires two years of full-time or five years or more of part-time study (being five or seven years from initially entering university) and the submission of a thesis comprising a body of original research undertaken by the candidate.
The prerequisites required for a Master of Philosophy degree make it the most advanced research degree before the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D. or D.Phil.). An M.Phil. is in most cases thesis-only, and is regarded as a senior or second master's degree, standing between a taught Master's and a Ph.D. In most UK universities, completion of a M.Phil. typically requires two years of full-time or five years or more of part-time study (being five or seven years from initially entering university) and the submission of a thesis comprising a body of original research undertaken by the candidate.
The length of time you spend on your education depends on what level you are trying to reach. An Associate of Arts program in philosophy will take two years. A bachelor’s degree will take 4 years to finish. You will need to spend two additional years in the program if you wish to obtain a master’s degree and three to five years after that if you enter into a doctoral program. Because of the broad spectrum of jobs that can be obtained with a philosophy degree, this question is difficult to answer definitively. Those who enter the academic realm earn a median of $59,000 with the potential increase to over $90,000. The corporate sector often begins at $35,000 and increases with promotions.
Admission Requirements. To apply to a Ph.D. in Philosophy program, students typically must hold at least a bachelor's degree with a major or minor in philosophy and a minimum GPA. Students also usually must submit Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores and may need to send in a writing sample or recommendation letters. Length of Time Required. The average Ph.D. in Philosophy program takes 5-7 years to finish, but that time varies depending on the students' part-time or full-time enrollment status.
