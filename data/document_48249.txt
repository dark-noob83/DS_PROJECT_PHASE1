Room temperature may be 20 degrees Celsius that is equal to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.   There is no fixed room temperature. I feel a bit chilly at 68 F (20 C) in the winter ti … me and warm at 75 F (22 C) in the summer. Most people are comfortable at temperatures in this range. The average adult temperature is 36.8 degrees C (98.2 … degrees F). Older people will average a bit less. These values can also vary with time of day, with a typical individual range of 0.5 degrees C (0.9 degrees F) Temperatures can and will be markedly different with exposure to cold or hot environmental temperatures.
Mercury-in-glass thermometer for measurement of room temperature. Room temperature is a colloquial expression for the typical or preferred indoor (climate-controlled) temperature to which people are generally accustomed. Owing to variations in humidity and likely clothing, recommendations for summer and winter may vary; a suggested typical range for summer is 23 °C (73 °F) to 25.5 °C (78 °F), with that for winter being 20 °C (68 °F) to 23.5 °C (74 °F).
TEMPERATURE Room temperature ranges from 20°C to 25°C. Find the range of room temperature in °F. Use the formula, F  32  1.8C, to convert from the Celsius scale to the Fahrenheit scale. Source(s): temperature room temperature ranges 20 25 find range room temperature formu: https://biturl.im/5Dazw. Aubert · 2 months ago. Thumbs up. Best Answer: To convert from Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit (F) the formula is (1.8 x C) + 32 = F & C = (F - 32)/1.8 Therefore a room temperature of 20C = 68 F and a room temperature of 25 C = 77F.

These values can also vary with time of day, with a typical individual range of 0.5 degrees C (0.9 degrees F) Temperatures can and will be markedly different with exposure to cold or hot environmental temperatures.
The average normal human body temperature is 37 degrees C (98.6 degress F) but it can vary somewhat for an individual. The average adult temperature is 36.8 degrees C (98.2 … degrees F). Older people will average a bit less. These values can also vary with time of day, with a typical individual range of 0.5 degrees C (0.9 degrees F) Temperatures can and will be markedly different with exposure to cold or hot environmental temperatures.
Room temperature depends on whatever temperature the room happens to be, but the generally accepted temperature for room temperature is roughly 70ºF, or about 21ºC. To c … alculate Celsius from Fahrenheit you subtract 32 from the degrees Fahrenheit, multiply this number by 5, and then divide that number by 9. GB. 
TEMPERATURE Room temperature ranges from 20°C to 25°C. TEMPERATURE Room temperature ranges from 20°C to 25°C. Find the range of room temperature in °F.

1 The average human body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius. 2  A hot summer day in Sacramento would be close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38 degrees Celsius. 3  A comfortable room temperature would be around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or 21 degrees Celsius. 1 The range from freezing point to boiling point on this scale is 32 to 212 degrees. 2  The other scale is measured in degrees Celsius. 3  Sometimes it is called the Centigrade scale. 4  The range from freezing point to boiling point on this scale is 0 to 100 degrees.
Room Temperature. 28 pages on this wiki. Room Temperature (RT) is generally defined as the ambient air temperature in whatever environment being used for a given procedure. More specifically, it is defined as 20-25°C (68-77°F), as some ambient temperatures, by nature, do not fall within this range. Generally, protocols calling for steps to be performed at RT require that temperatures do not fall below 18°C (64°F), and do not exceed 27°C (80°F).
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) .
