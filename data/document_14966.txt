For example, if you qualify for a basic personal allowance of 10,600 you should be put on the standard tax code of 1060L. However, a code of BR (with no numbers) may also be used if you've started a new job and haven't completed a P46 form before your first pay day. Check them all! The best source to find your tax code is your PAYE Coding Notice (or P2). A copy of this is sent to both you and your employer around March, just before the start of each tax year. It tells them how to deduct tax, and explain to you how this code was arrived at.
Tax code BR. Stands for “Basic Rate” and indicates that all of your income is to be subjected to the basic rate of tax at the current rate. You will therefore receive no personal allowances but you will not be subjected to higher rates of tax. Your tax code is issued by HMRC to your employer, so that the right amount of income tax (PAYE) that can be deducted each month from your salary. Here are some examples of tax codes: 1  747L. 2  747P, 747V, 382Y.
Non-standard codes are used when usual tax free allowances do not apply. Where no allowances exist, code BR is used to tax at basic rate (20%), and code D0 is used to tax at higher rate (40%). If no tax is to be collected, code NT is used. If tax has to be collected on an income above PAYE earnings, a K code is used. This works as equivalent to a negative tax allowance. Between submitting a P46 and receiving the correct tax code from HM Revenue and Customs, an employer can apply the emergency tax code on a week 1 basis. In this case, tax will be calculated as if the employee is working in the first week of the tax year, and all previous earnings are ignored.
1 Code BR-The Basic Rate is used when all your income gets taxed at the basic rate currently at 20 percent. 2  HRMC most commonly use this code for a second job or pension receipts. You may find you have a tax code of two letters and no numbers and here's the explanation for those codes: 1  Code BR-The Basic Rate is used when all your income gets taxed at the basic rate currently at 20 percent.
If your tax code has ‘W1’ or ‘M1’ at the end. W1 (week 1) and M1 (month 1) are emergency tax codes. This means your tax is based only on what you are paid in the current pay period, not the whole year. These codes are sometimes known as ‘non-cumulative’. Which code you get depends on whether you are paid weekly or monthly. They appear at the end of your tax code, eg ‘577L W1’ or ‘577L M1’. Emergency tax codes are usually updated automatically after you’ve given your new employer your P45. You will always start a new tax year with a normal tax code, not an emergency one.

You will then pay too much tax if a BR code is used for your second employment/pension. Example: Josh has two jobs. He earns £100 per week in his main job and £90 per week in his second job. The tax code used for his first job is 1060L – giving him £204 per week tax free pay (1/52nd of £10,600). 1 You would need to contact HMRC, who should issue a tax code of DO so the second job is taxed at 40% rather than at 20%. 2  The position will be more complicated if your second job / pension should be taxed partially at the basic and partially at higher rates of tax.
1 This means that deducting tax at basic rate (a BR code) on any second employments at the basic rate may not be enough. 2  You would need to contact HMRC, who should issue a tax code of DO so the second job is taxed at 40% rather than at 20%. 1 You would need to contact HMRC, who should issue a tax code of DO so the second job is taxed at 40% rather than at 20%. 2  The position will be more complicated if your second job / pension should be taxed partially at the basic and partially at higher rates of tax.
