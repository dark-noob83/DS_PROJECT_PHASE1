Like most other medical professionals, gynecologists earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and may employ handfuls of workers in support positions. For a typical gynecologist's office, the expenses associated with testing supplies, technical equipment and fixed overhead costs can be significant. If you lack health insurance or carry a budget plan that doesn't fully cover gynecological exams, you should expect to pay at least $125 for a basic office visit that includes a pap smear and pelvic exam.
The best thing that you can do if you do not have any insurance is to go to the local Planned Parenthood or local Health Clinic. The office visit will cost anywhere from $80-$124 depending if you are a new or established patient and how long the doctor takes. The thing that gets expensive is the Pap Smear and all the other test that the doctor does. This is considered Lab Work and is usually billed by the lab company not the doctor. If you are going for a problem plan on at least $82 for the office visit and at least $100 for labs that they might have to run. Always ask if they have a payment plan, some do and it is worth getting just make sure you make your payments.
