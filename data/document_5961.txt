Report Abuse. There are many countries that currently allow Australian passport holders to enter without a visa-the Schengen Zone in Europe for instance (Western European countries) where Australians can stay for a total of 90 days out of every 180 days without a visa.
Report Abuse. There is no such thing as an EU passport, as the EU is not a country. All EU member countries issue their own passports. Apply to the embassy of the other country you are a citizen of (the High Commission if you are British). If you state why you are eligible for an EU passport I can give a more definite answer.
If you have a UK passport, you are a citizen and you can stay as long as you like and basically be treated the same as anyone who has lived there their entire life. I don't think you'll have any trouble leaving Australia on your Australian passport and entering the UK on your British one.
But If you use your British one, no.With an EU passport, most EU countries allow you to say un-registered for 3 or 6months (it depends on circumstances). However, as far as I can know-Note I am not sure about this-you can then continue into another schengen country for another 3-6months etc, and continue indefinitely.

You need to check each country and their requirements for entry. It also depends on your length of stay in any country. I did not require a visa for UK, USA, New Zealand, France, Germany or Poland on my Australian Passport, as long as my stay in each country was under a certain amount of time.
