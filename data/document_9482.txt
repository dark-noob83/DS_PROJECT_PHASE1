It reveals the average cost of residential energy as of October 2011. Using this data, we were able to calculate an estimated cost to charge all 3 battery-versions of the Model S. We can’t truly account for cost per mile, because that will largely depend on your driving habits and the type of driving you do. If you aren’t already aware, the 160, 230, and 300 mile ranges on the Model S are based on an estimated range for driving at 55mph. However, if your driving is mostly Highway at 65 or 70mph or you live somewhere with lots of hills, then your can expect less range and thus somewhat higher costs.
Many people quote an 85% charge efficiency for Tesla, and Tesla’s own charging calculator appears to assume a 91% charging efficiency which is quite different than the 82% actual charge efficiency I’ve measured and significantly worse than the average industry charging efficiency. The Mercedes fuel cost for 2417 miles would be roughly $282 (based on 33mpg and $3.85/gal). In that case the Tesla would have saved $139 in monthly fuel costs. The break even for the extra $18K invested in the Tesla is almost 11 years. He also didn’t mention how much the installation of the charging station costs.
Fuel efficiency for Tesla: 3 miles/kilowatthour. And here are the results: Cost of electricity to drive the Tesla 23,000 miles: $1,226. Cost of premium gas to drive BMW 7 Series 23,000 miles: $4,951. Money saved on fuel by driving Tesla: $3,724. Obviously, there are many factors that could change the result of these calculations. But most of the variables play in favor of the Tesla. 
Plug In America estimates that it will cost $2 to $4 to fully charge an all-electric car. For that price, the EVs that will be hitting the market soonest, like the Nissan LEAF, will travel about 100 miles (160.9 kilometers). Of course, your mileage may vary -- in a couple of ways. In Portland, Ore., where electric cars are gaining ground and the local utility is providing charging infrastructure, electricity runs about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The new Mini E, which is still in field trials, uses .22 kWh per mile, which translates to 22 kWh for 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) of driving.
That cost is almost 2-1/2 times higher than the 15.27 cents per KWH price in California; not that California is not a bargain state when it comes to residential electricity costs. If you aren’t already aware, the 160, 230, and 300 mile ranges on the Model S are based on an estimated range for driving at 55mph. However, if your driving is mostly Highway at 65 or 70mph or you live somewhere with lots of hills, then your can expect less range and thus somewhat higher costs.
The average EV uses about 300 watts in the summer and 400 watts in the winter per mile. That means a 10 mile drive will use about 3kW to 4kW. Multiply that by how far you drive per year and your electric rate and you'll know your cost. For example at $0.12 per kW, 10 miles would cost between $0.36 and $0.48. By using 15,000 miles as the average amount of miles a person will drive in a year, the annual cost of gasoline for the average car will be $2,135 per year, using the average cost of gasoline from 2011 through 2013.
In the table to the left, we show costs for a full charge for each of the 3 different battery capacities for the 2012 Tesla Model S. This cost is based on charging up your battery from zero to full. If you aren’t already aware, the 160, 230, and 300 mile ranges on the Model S are based on an estimated range for driving at 55mph. However, if your driving is mostly Highway at 65 or 70mph or you live somewhere with lots of hills, then your can expect less range and thus somewhat higher costs.

At my local utility's rate of 14 cents/kWh, that works out to a total fuel cost for the year of $530, or about 3.4 cents/mile. Contrast that to about $3,000 and 20 cents/mile for a comparable car like the Mercedes S Class. But the Model S actually used more electricity than the 5,074 kWh on the car's energy meter
First, some numbers. Fuel efficiency and cost. To cover 15,243 miles, I used 5,074 kWh of electricity, for an average of 333 watt-hours per mile. That's a bit better than the car's EPA-rated efficiency of 350 Wh/mi, and converts to precisely 3 miles per kWh. 2013 Tesla Model S electric sport sedan [photo by owner David Noland].
