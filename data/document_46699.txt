The Numbers. Stride length is measured from heel to heel and determines how far you walk with each step. On average, a man's walking stride length is 2.5 feet, or 30 inches, according to Arizona State University Extension. A woman's average stride length is 2.2 feet, or 26.4 inches, reports the school. In general, people with longer legs have a greater stride length than those with shorter legs.
For adult females, the average step length is about 26 inches and  the average stride length is around 52 inches. For adult males, the  average step length is 31 inches and â€¦ the average stride is 62  inches.
Calculating Your Stride Length. Rather than using average stride lengths, if you want to convert your pedometer steps into distance, calculate your actual stride length. Make a mark on the ground and place your toes at the mark. The first step you take is step one.
Average stride length: 2.2 feet for women and 2.5 feet for man or you can estimate stride length relative to your height (females: height x .413 equals your stride length; males: height x .415 equals your stride length).
The American College of Sports Medicine reports that there are approximately 2,000 steps in one mile, so the average step length is 2.6 feet or about 31 inches.
This means that for the average person, the approximate distance from the initial point of contact of your left heel and the initial point of contact of your right heel is about 32 inches. The average stride length, or two steps, is about 62 inches, or a little more than 5 feet.
While averages can be useful, it's fairly simple to find your own stride length. One way is to walk 10 steps, measure the distance from the starting and stopping point, then divide the number by 10. For example, if you travel 290 inches in 10 steps, you average 29 inches per step, which is about 2.4 feet. Another method is to step in a puddle of water, walk 10 steps and measure the stride length between three wet steps.
