Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease. It is zoonotic, which means that can be transmited from animals to humans. The bacteria is transmited through contaminated urine, especially in puddles or in standing water sources outdoors. Symptoms appear 3-20 days after exposure.
It is transmitted through contact with bodily secretions including saliva, urine, and feces. These secretions can become airborne when a dog coughs or sneezes. Dogs with distemper may salivate excessively which can transfer the virus to food dishes and water bowls.
