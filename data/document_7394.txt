Good question. Two entirely different cities. I prefer Vienna, DH liked Prague better. Vienna is more 'stylish', while Prague has more 'old world charm', IMHO. So perhaps Prague is a better contrast for you, after being in Paris. In Vienna, you can visit the gorgeous Hofburg complex, and maybe see the Lipizzaner stallions. In Prague, the old castle is bare bones, with little to see but the architecture and the view.
If I had the cash, I'd buy The Budapest castle first, then The Prague castle....Schoenbrunn is too stuffy. Of the three, I think I 'd be most like to live in Budapest because it is more down to earth than Vienna.
Best Answer: Prague is the most beautiful. Thou Budapest is the most cultural i think... in budapest you kinda get away from the more touristy end of things. Me and my friends did a couple days in each of those cities...
Both cities are great...Vienna is old but grand, Prague is old and still old. Both cities have a great nightlife but the Praguan one must be better, Vienna has more friendly people and more cosmopolitan feel to it.
Out of these cities I have been to Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava and they all were certainly nice. If I still had to say which one is the nicest I'd say Vienna was the most beautiful. But maybe that is connected with the fact that I was there in May, and visited the other cities in late autumn and in winter.
Budapest is also one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but you could spend less time there. It's not as mobbed with tourists as Prague and Vienna are, but there's not as much to see.
