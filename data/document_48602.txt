The mini-fridge I have states the following as it's maximum power usage: 120 Volts @ 60Hz, and 0.75A The formula for power (watts) is: W = V * I However this is an AC system so you are actually computing VA (volt-amperes), but the difference in this case is negligible. 
A fridge will use anywhere from 100 to 400 watts depending on size, an average modern fridge will use 180 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a refrigerator using 180 Watts for 24 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Cost Per Hour: 
On average, a standard model mini fridge uses roughly 230 kilowatt-hours per year, as much as many Energy Star rated full-sized refrigerators. The amount of energy a mini fridge consumes is due in large part to poor insulation and lack of cooling features. 
(Wattage x eight) ÷ 1000 = kWh per day. Where eight represents our presumed eight hours active time per day. Thus a 600 Watt unit – typical of older, larger refrigerators – would use 4.8 kilowatt hours daily, or 1750 per year; where a more modern 140 watt unit uses about 1.1 kWh daily, or approximately 400 per year. This is how many watts does a refrigerator use. No information is provided by the author. 
At 15 kWh, trading in a pre-1986 fridge for a new efficient one would save about $158 a year in electricity costs. And some older fridges are even worse than the average. One reader estimates her savings to be $238 per year for trading in her 1979 fridge for a 2004 model. Refrigerators are a big chunk of home energy use. In most homes the refrigerator is the second-largest user of electricity (13.7%), right after the air conditioner (14.1%). (Dept. of Energy) With most appliances you save energy by using them less, but you can't very well do that with your fridge.
My refrigerator has a 500 watt compressor that runs about one fifth of the time. I am paying $0.13 per kilowatt hour. Then multiply that by 365 to get annual consumption. For example, I plugged my Kill A Watt meter into my Maytag 18.5 refrigerator and left it in for about 3 days. After 74 hours and 53 minutes the Kill A Watt meter registered 3.96 kwh. Here’s how I determined the watts consumed by my refrigerator per year:
