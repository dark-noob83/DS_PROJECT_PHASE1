London on Christmas Day. Virtually everything is closed for business on Christmas Day in London. Some places, including banks, remain closed on Boxing Day (the day after Christmas). Almost all of London's attractions close for at least one day over Christmas, and many close from 24 to 26 December, as well as 1 January.
For the second year running, First Bus will run no services at all in the Glasgow area on Christmas Day or New Year's Day.
Share. For the second year running, First Bus will run no services at all in the Glasgow area on Christmas Day or New Year's Day. As far as I know, no other public transport operator will run any services either. So private car or taxi are the only options in Scotland's largest city for those who have to travel.
There are public holidays for Christmas Day and Boxing Day on the 25 and 26 December-as Boxing Day is a Saturday in 2015, there is an additional public holiday on Monday 28 December. New Year's Day (1 January) also falls on a Friday and this is a public holiday.
