Aprons. The apron is the area of concrete or asphalt that extends two to six feet out from the front of the garage. There are many homes in the twin cities area that are in need of an apron replacement. Sunken concrete or asphalt where the driveway meets the garage floor is a problem that can cause damage to the foundation.
If you decide to pour concrete, I would pour the apron a minimum of seven-inches thick. In my opinion, the concrete mix should be ordered at a design strength of 4,500 pounds per square inch which is slightly stronger than the industry minimum strength standard. It would be very wise to include a grid of half-inch diameter reinforcing steel in the concrete apron. This thick concrete driveway apron may withstand more abuse from heavy trucks than a traditional residential blacktop or asphalt pavement. PHOTO CREDIT: Tim Carter.
