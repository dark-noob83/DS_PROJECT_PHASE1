The 10 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Luxury Car Tax and Stamp Duty are all factors driving up the price in Australia for the base model car. The fully-optioned, performance-spec 85kWh Tesla Model S will come in at almost double the base price, topping out at around $200,000.

In Australia, the price of the Model S is higher than what is being charged for the car in the North America. The price of the Model S in North America is $81,000.
