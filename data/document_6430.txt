Researcher Daniel Casasanto found right-handers were more likely to chose the Fribbles on the right as the more intelligent, happy, honest and attractive. Lefties went for the Fribbles on the left. Whether you’re a lefty or righty, chances are you never thought your dominant hand played a role in the decisions you make. “Righties are more likely compared to lefties to gesture with their right hand when they’re talking about good stuff and lefties to gesture with their left hand when they’re talking about good stuff,” he said.

1 Also, left handed people do things differently then right handed people. 2  For instance, lefties tilt their heads to the left. 3  Use your phone with your left hand only. 4  Practicing 15 min a day makes left hand stronger. 1 Anything you usually do with your right hand start doing it with your left. 2  Keep writing the 'quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' because it uses every letter in the alphabet. 3  Use your right eye while using your left hand for writing. 4  Practice writing letters in the air.
The lefty-righty switch can also be used against switch hitters who are noticeably poorer from one side of the plate than the other, or in the somewhat rarer instance of a batter who does poorly against opposite-handed pitchers. The basic principle in these cases remains the same. This especially holds true for left-handed pitchers, as lefties are less common in a major-league lineup than righties. As a result, the most common use of the lefty-righty switch is when a right-handed pitcher is facing a left-handed batter.
(December 2009). In baseball, the lefty-righty switch is a maneuver by which a player that struggles against left-or right-handed players is replaced by a player who excels in the situation, usually only for the duration of the situation in question. This especially holds true for left-handed pitchers, as lefties are less common in a major-league lineup than righties. As a result, the most common use of the lefty-righty switch is when a right-handed pitcher is facing a left-handed batter.
Being a righty or a lefty could be linked to variations in a network of genes that influence right or left asymmetries in the body and brain. Each gene has the potential for mutation–the more mutations a person has in any one direction (toward right handedness or left handedness) the more likely they are to use that hand as their dominant hand, or so the researchers speculate.
1 If he is a lefty, show him that his left hand is the writing hand, and his right hand is the “helper” hand for positioning paper. 2  Or his left hand pours the milk, while right hold the cup. 3  Here are some more early signs that will help you determine if your child will be a righty or a lefty. 1 Here are some more early signs that will help you determine if your child will be a righty or a lefty. 2  And here are some additional great tips on how to raise a left-handed child that I’ve discovered in my recent research.
