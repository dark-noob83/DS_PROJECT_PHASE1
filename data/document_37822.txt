COMSOL Multiphysics is a powerful interactive environment for modeling and solving all kinds of scientific and engineering problems. The all-new version 4 provides a powerful integrated desktop environment with a Model Builder where you get full overview of the model and access to all functionality. COMSOL users are entitled to online support via the COMSOL knowledge base. To create an online account please visit the following link. To complete the registration, you will need to upload a current COMSOL license file. Please contact CRCSupport for this information.

Coarse mesh, fine mesh, mesh with maximum element size and distribution mesh are shown. Visit http://www.soft-hummingbird.com/. These Tutorials were created to get you going with COMSOL 4.2. The aim is to show basic principles, how to use the tools, how to extract data and so on.
COMSOL, Inc. This series of tutorial videos will teach you how to use COMSOL Multiphysics by guiding you through the entire process of creating and solving a multiphysics model. In COMSOL Multiphysics, the process of creating and solving a model is known as the workflow

Comsol Multiphysics Specialist Modules. In the main body of this review we’ve discussed Comsol in general terms, but it should be clear that the system is incredibly flexible in terms of what can be set-up and solved. All manner of physics can be pulled together to define your studies as and when required. While the heavy simulation tools used for FEA or CFD have been widely adopted, systems simulation is still a relatively niche technology. Al Dean takes a look at Comsol Multiphysics, which aims to change just that.
Easy Example: The Wrench | 79 2 From the Geometry import list, select COMSOL Multiphysics file. 3 Click Browse and locate the file wrench.mphbin in the Model Library folder COMSOL_Multiphysics/Structural_Mechanics. Double-click to add or click Open. 4 Click Import to display the geometry in the Graphics window. Adding Physics to a Model | 49 Now that you have added fluid flow to the model, you need to couple the heat transfer part of the Joule Heating physics interface to the fluid flow. 4 In the Model Builder, right-click Joule Heating.
Geometry is an interesting one as Comsol has links with the majority of mainstream design or engineering software. These ‘LiveLink’ tools allow integration with data, not only from SolidWorks, Pro/Engineer and Inventor but other common engineering tools such as Matlab.
