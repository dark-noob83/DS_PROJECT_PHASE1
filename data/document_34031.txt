According to a recent national survey, the average commission for car salesmen is $250 per vehicle sold. The average selling price per vehicle is about $1,000 over the invoice cost. And the average number of cars sold is 8 to 10 vehicles per salesman per month. (Some dealerships use sales teams.. In this method, one salesperson will give you the test drive, do the write-up, etc. and the team manager will close the deal. In this case, they share the commission.) So if you buy a new car for, say, $300 over the invoice cost, the salesman may earn only a $50 to $75
Lets say you forecast the salesman to earn $75,000 a year. Let's say your average sale is $5,000 and you expect the sales man to sell 200 jobs for a total of about 1 mil. Using quick math we see he will need to earn a 7.5% commission to earn $75,000. That works in my scenario, although I pay much higher at 11%, but it won't work in ALL scenarios. FOr example if you forecast the same $75,000 earnings for your salesman but your average sale is $250,000 and you will expect to do 5 jobs in a year, you will need to pay 6%.

At my dealership, you started at 22 percent for the first eight cars you sold. Then cars nine and 10 were 24 percent. And it went all the way up to a peak of 30 percent plus an additional $300 per car if you sold a total of 17 cars in that month.
