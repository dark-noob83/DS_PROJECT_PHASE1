From the mid-1940s through 1984, the state vote Republican more often than not. Democrats have won the seven elections since 1988, although the 2000 and 2004 races were extremely close. The 2008 election was not as close, as Barack Obama won by 56% to 42% over John McCain.
The three-way race in the Democratic primary for Wisconsin attorney general pits two county district attorneys against a veteran legislator from Milwaukee. And as the election draws near, all three candidates are doing their best to convince voters they have what it takes to be the state's top cop.
About Our Statistics. The Government Accountability Board produces statistics on voter turnout and the number of registered voters. Additionally, the G.A.B. produces reports of statistics prepared and reported by municipalities about elections, known as the GAB-190.
The more densely populated a place is, the more likely it is to vote Democratic, and vice versa. That correlation is about four times stronger among U.S. counties than it was 40 years ago, according to an analysis of presidential voting for this project by Charles Franklin of the Marquette Law School.
The Government Accountability Board calculates voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters -- the population age 18 and above -- as estimated by the Demographic Services Center of the Wisconsin Department of Administration.
The two elections before that, in 2008 and 2006, saw the opposite: Democrats picked up seats. And in doing so, they ran up a huge majority of the collective vote in Assembly races, more than 60 percent in both cases, according to research by Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal political group One Wisconsin Now.
The claim about a Democratic popular-vote advantage jumped out at us. After all, Republicans won 60 of the 99 Assembly seats on Election Day, giving them a 60-39 advantage next year, a margin nearly identical to the previous two years. (In the state Senate, control flipped from the Democrats to the GOP).
2010 Census Reapportionment: Wisconsin will remain at 10 electoral votes through the 2020 presidential election. Wisconsin gained statehood in May 1848. Primarily Republican through 1928, the state (like most) turned Democratic during the Great Depression and World War II.
Even at the time, voting rights advocates pushed back. If 1 to 2 percent of the vote in Wisconsin’s 2010 gubernatorial election were fraudulent, that would amount to 21,000 to 42,000 votes, or six to 12 fraudulent votes in the state’s 3,630 precincts, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel found.
