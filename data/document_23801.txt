The average in-ground swimming pool costs $21,919, according to home improvement site Fixr. And that’s for a pretty basic 32’ by 16’ model. (Eleven years ago, we spent about $24,000 on our pool plus that pavered patio.). But that’s just to build the thing. 
Understanding that this is a very rough figure, you can expect to pay $25,000-50,000 for an inground pool. Of course, that’s assuming a pool of average size, in an average city with the average cost of living, average extras, and average materials. Of course, you probably aren’t average. 
Pool Price Range. Estimate the cost of your new pool by size or construction style to get an idea of base price. Small pools costs between $20,000 and $30,000, while medium pools are priced between $30,000 and $40,000, according to BobVila.com. If you choose fiberglass, you'll need to shell out around $4,000 every five to 10 years for a new liner. Concrete pools also require major maintenance, with resurfacing needed roughly once each decade. Fiberglass pools last 25 years on average, and may be the best pool option in terms of long-term value.
1 Installation labor to replace an above ground pool liner can cost $200-$800 or more, depending on local rates and the size and shape of the pool. 2  For example, Edwards Pools in Ohio estimates its labor charges for replacing an above ground pool liner vary from $400 for an 18' round pool to $700 for a 18'x33' oval. 1 Replacing a vinyl liner in an in-ground swimming pool typically costs $700-$1,500 for just the liner, depending on the size and shape of the pool, the thickness (20-30 mil, but typically 28 mil) of the liner and any special colors or designs on the liner.

$1,500 - $5,000: Vinyl-lined Pools. The nationwide average is about $50 per square foot, which can be dramatically altered depending upon the location, the type of pool, and the customization added to a pool. A traditional in-ground swimming pool is often the most expensive part of a new landscape, but it is also the pinnacle of amenity. Consider a 20 by 30 foot rectangular pool the standard, averaging about 600 square feet of surface area. That area can be altered in shape without much change in cost, but if it is larger or smaller, then the difference in square footage will have a direct impact on the finished cost.
