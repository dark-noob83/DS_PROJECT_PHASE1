A finance degree is an academic degree awarded to students who have completed a finance-related degree program at a college, university, or business school.
An associate degree with a focus on finance can usually be earned in two years or less. A bachelor degree in finance can usually be earned in three to four years. A master's degree in finance can be earned in one to two years or less after completing a bachelor's program. Doctorate programs with a focus on finance take approximately four to six years to complete and require at least a bachelor's degree--though a master's degree is a more common requirement.
Potential jobs you can get: finance manager, controller or chief financial officer. Preferred qualifications: A bachelorâ€™s degree in finance, accounting or a related field with several years of experience working in the field. Addition credentials such as the CFA or an MBA are also recommended.
