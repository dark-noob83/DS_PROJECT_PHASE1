Other forms, like gamma-tocopherol or beta-tocopherol, do not provide the same level of protection. Vitamin E from natural sources is labeled as alpha tocopherol or d-alpha tocopherol-dl-alpha tocopherol indicates a synthetic, less effective product. Do not give cheap vitamin E supplements that contain high levels of vitamin A, since this could lead to an overdose of vitamin A and possibly vitamin A toxicity.
1 According to a recent study, men taking 400 IUâ€™s of vitamin E per day increase their risk of prostate cancer by 17 percent. 2  However, what media reports fail to address is the fact that the vitamin E used is a synthetic, petrochemically-derived form of vitamin E that has known toxic effects.
A: Vitamin E is a generic term for tocopherols and tocotrienols. Vitamin E is a family of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols and corresponding four tocotrienols. Vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin, has recently been in the news due to the controversy on the amount recommended for health benefits.
Vitamin E (Tocopherol) is a light yellow oil, a fat-soluble vitamin, that is actually a family of compounds, the tocopherols, found in nature. Alphatoxopherol is the most common and the most active of the seven currently described forms-alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta.
While it is uncommon to take in too much vitamin E, it is still possible. Vitamin E toxicity is usually caused by taking too many supplements. Vitamin E toxicity is not usually caused by getting too much vitamin E from food. In fact, most people get less than the recommended amount of vitamin E. High doses of vitamin E from supplements increase the risk of bleeding.
It is likely that patients with vitamin E toxicity have been using vitamin E supplements; obtain the dose and duration of vitamin E usage. Assess concurrent use of anticoagulants or aspirin. A nutritional assessment for vitamin K deficiency is useful in patients who present with bleeding or an elevated PT.
