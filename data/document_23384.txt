Glucagon is a peptide hormone, produced by alpha cells of the pancreas, that raises the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Its effect is opposite that of insulin, which lowers the glucose concentration. The pancreas releases glucagon when the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream falls too low. Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. High blood glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues.
The effects of glucagon are the opposite of the effects induced by insulin. The two hormones need to work in partnership with each other to keep blood glucose levels balanced.
Glucagon is a hormone produced in the pancreas. Glucagon is used to raise very low blood sugar. Glucagon is also used in diagnostic testing of the stomach and other digestive organs.
Glucagon is the generic form of the brand-name drug GlucaGen, a prescription injection drug that's identical to the glucagon hormone that occurs naturally in humans. Glucagon is used as an emergency medicine by people with diabetes to raise blood sugar levels that are dangerously low when they have hypoglycemia.
Overview. Glucagon is a hormone that is produced by the pancreas. It is often thought of as having the opposite effect of insulin. While insulin works to reduce high levels of glucose in the bloodstream, glucagon helps to ensure that glucose levels do not drop too low.
Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas when blood glucose is low. Blood glucose is low between meals and during exercise. When blood glucose is high, no glucagon is secreted from the alpha cells. Glucagon has the greatest effect on the liver although it affects many different cells in the body.
