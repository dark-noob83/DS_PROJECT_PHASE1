Before you can understand how carbon fiber can help solve the oil crisis, you have to understand what it is. Carbon fiber is a super strong material that's also extremely lightweight. Engineers and designers love it because it's five times as strong as steel, two times as stiff, yet weighs about two-thirds less. Carbon fiber is basically very thin strands of carbon -- even thinner than human hair.
9. Carbon fiber -- sometimes known as graphite fiber -- is a strong, stiff, lightweight material that has the potential to replace steel and is popularly used in specialized, high-performance products like aircrafts, racecars and sporting equipment. 8. Carbon fiber was first invented near Cleveland, Ohio, in 1958.
A few facts about carbon fibre. Carbon fibre is a lightweight yet strong substance. Many things from sports equipment like golf clubs and tennis racquets to sports cars use
Carbon fibre is a material that is made from very thin fibres having carbon atoms. These are bonded together in microscopic crystals, aligned parallel to the long axis of the fibre. It is this crystal alignment that makes carbon fibre so strong. Carbon fibre is used to make composite materials with plastics resins.
