Drivers who work for Ambassador Taxi make closer to $6.49 an hour while lease drivers with the company make an hourly wage of $8.81 an hour.

Shift drivers, who pay a garage or a lease driver a rental fee to drive a taxi also work about 77 hours a week but make only $2.83 an hour.
Unsurprisingly, we Uber drivers tend to be younger than the average U.S. worker, and much younger than the average taxi driver. A plurality of us are between 30-39 years old, compared with 22.5% in the regular work force and 19.9% among regular taxi drivers and chauffeurs. A majority (51%) of Uber drivers work 15 hours a week or fewer. Only 19% of us are really driving full-time (35 hours per week and more) compared with 81% of regular taxi drivers and chauffeurs.

2 Executive Summary The calculated average net hourly income of all Portland taxi drivers is $6.22. These low hourly wages are consistent with those found in recent studies in other U.S. cities. Drivers at non-driver owned companies typically work long hours—often 12-14 hours per day, 6-7 days per week—to be able to meet the required company payments, expenses, and provide income for their families. Taxi drivers work as independent contractors. The average weekly “kitty” payment for full-time drivers at non-driver owned companies is $500 per week compared to a high of $245 per week in the current fiscal year for the one driver-owned company.
