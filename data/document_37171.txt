economic impacts are expected to vary regionally for a medium increase in global mean temperature 2 3 c of warming relative to the average temperature between 1990 2000 market sectors in low latitude and less developed areas might experience net costs due to climate change near term climate change policies could significantly affect long term climate change impacts stringent mitigation policies might be able to limit global warming in 2100 to around 2 c or below relative to pre industrial levels
global annual mean surface air temperature change line plot of global mean land ocean temperature index 1880 to present with the base period 1951 1980 the dotted black line is the annual mean and the solid red line is the five year mean the green bars show uncertainty estimates this is an update of fig also available are tabular data our traditional analysis using only meteorological station data is a line plot of global annual mean surface air temperature change with the base period 1951 1980 derived from the meteorological station network this is an update of plate 6 b in hansen et al
the effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused directly or indirectly by human emissions of greenhouse gases there is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and that human activities are the primary driver near term climate change policies could significantly affect long term climate change impacts stringent mitigation policies might be able to limit global warming in 2100 to around 2 c or below relative to pre industrial levels
global warming is the unusually rapid increase in earth s average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released as people burn fossil fuels despite ups and downs from year to year global average surface temperature is rising by the beginning of the 21st century earth s temperature was roughly 0 5 degrees celsius above the long term 1951 1980 average nasa figure adapted from goddard institute for space studies surface temperature analysis
the world meteorological organization defines this time period as 30 years examples of climate change include increases in global surface temperature global warming changes in rainfall patterns and changes in the frequency of extreme weather events near term climate change policies could significantly affect long term climate change impacts stringent mitigation policies might be able to limit global warming in 2100 to around 2 c or below relative to pre industrial levels
global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century scale rise in the average temperature of the earth s climate system and its related effects multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming scientific understanding of global warming is increasing the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported in 2014 that scientists were more than 95 % certain that global warming is being caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and other human anthropogenic activities
global warming or climate change is a subject that shows no sign of cooling down here s the lowdown on why it s happening what s causing it and how it might change the planet printer friendly yes earth is already showing many signs of worldwide climate change average temperatures have climbed 1 4 degrees fahrenheit 0 8 degree celsius around the world since 1880 much of this in recent decades according to nasa s goddard institute for space studies the rate of warming is increasing
the global average land and ocean surface temperature shows a warming of 0 85 0 65 to 1 06 c in the period 1880 to 2012 based on multiple independently produced datasets earth s average surface temperature rose by 7002273890000000000 0 74 0 18 c over the period 1906 2005 scientific understanding of global warming is increasing the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported in 2014 that scientists were more than 95 % certain that global warming is being caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and other human anthropogenic activities
while many view the effects of global warming to be more substantial and more rapidly occurring than others do the scientific consensus on climatic changes related to global warming is that the average temperature of the earth has risen between 0 4 and 0 8 c over the past 100 years for only the third time on record coral bleaching is occurring across the globe and climate change is to blame king crabs arrive in antarctic with claws out for biodiversity september 30th 2015 the king crab could soon take over a whole new kingdom and it has global warming to thank for the conquest
