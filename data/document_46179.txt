So we have a +1 charge for sodium and a -1 charge for chloride. The charges are opposite but equal; therefore, there is a 1:1 ratio of sodium ions to chloride ions and NaCl is the formula of the compound. The name of this ionic compound is sodium chloride because it is made of sodium ions and chloride ions.
Lithium and Phosphate. Lithium is a Group IA metal, so its ion will have a +1 charge. Phosphate is a polyatomic ion with a -3 charge. The compound needs three lithium ions to balance the -3 charge of the phosphate, so the formula is Li 3 PO 4. Notice that we didn't do anything with the 4 subscript on the phosphate. That is part of the ion formula and doesn't have anything to do with determining the charge ratios.
Best Answer: Phosphorus in a compound usually doesn't have a charge, as in an ionic charge, because phosphorous only forms covalent bonds in compounds. If you dissolve Na3P in water it will dissociate to form sodium ions and phosphide ions. In that case phosphorous will have a charge of -3. Probably what you are thinking of is the oxidation number. Oxidation number is an arbitrarily determined number that is useful in explaining redox reactions and determining chemical formulas.
What is the charge of the ion that phosphorus would form? The phosphide ion, meaning phosphorous by itself not bound up in a poly-atomic ion, has a charge of -3 in ionic compounds.
