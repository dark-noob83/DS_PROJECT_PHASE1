Expert: Steve replied 7 years ago. To replace the rear main seal will require that the transmission first be removed for access to the rear of the engine; on this engine teh rear seal is a one piece design that is installed from the back.
How much would it cost to replace the rear main seal? I know a lot of stuff has to be removed to reach it, but the damn part is only $20 and I have a hard time thinking I'd really be paying $820 in labor. Also, I need to know if 162k miles sounds normal for such a repair.
