In former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia and Czech Republic) the first experimental television sets were produced in 1948. In the same year the first TV-transmission was performed. The first regular TV public transmission started on May 1, 1953. The satellite television dishes of the systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s were 10 to 16 feet (3.0 to 4.9 m) in diameter, made of fibreglass or solid aluminum or steel, and in the United States cost more than $5,000, sometimes as much as $10,000.
John Logie Baird, a Scotsman, invented the first fully working TV system in the United Kingdom. It was first demonstrated in 1925 in London and was the first system to be used … for public scheduled broadcasts in 1929. The system was electro-mechanical and used a rotating disc to deliver a picture. 
Before 1947 the number of U.S. homes with television sets could be measured in the thousands. By the late 1990s, 98 percent of U.S. homes had at least one television set, and those sets were on for an average of more than seven hours a day. The typical American spends (depending on the survey and the time of year) from two-and-a-half to almost five hours a day watching television. They could also choose between two 15-minute newscastsÑCBS NEWSCASTSñCBS Tv (news) 1948 With Douglas edwards AND'nbc S Camel News (caravan) 1948 With John Cameron (swayze who was required by the tobacco company sponsor to have a burning cigarette always visible when he was on). camera
During MTV's first few years on the air, very few black artists were included in rotation on the channel. The select few who were in MTV's rotation were Michael Jackson, Prince, Eddy Grant, Donna Summer, Musical Youth, and Herbie Hancock. Since the premiere of the short-lived FNMTV in 2008, MTV has used a revised, chopped version of its traditional logo during most of its on-air programming. This new logo was finalized and formally became MTV's official brand mark on February 8, 2010, when it debuted on MTV's website.
The invention of the television was the work of many individuals in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Individuals and corporations competed in various parts of the world to deliver a device that superseded previous technology. The satellite television dishes of the systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s were 10 to 16 feet (3.0 to 4.9 m) in diameter, made of fibreglass or solid aluminum or steel, and in the United States cost more than $5,000, sometimes as much as $10,000.
On January 12th, 1950, the general public was introduced to color television for the very first time when CBS demonstrated its “field sequential” color system on eight television sets in the Walker Building, in Washington [ 1 ]. According to NBC, there were only 2,860,000 color households in the United States as of January 1st, 1965 (though that was up from 1,620,000 on January 1st, 1964) [ 25 ]. By July 1st, the number stood at 3,600,000 and on October 1st it was at 4,450,000 color sets [ 26 ], [ 27 ].
The first sign language interpreters were hearing family members, friends, and coworkers. They were not formally trained. Their qualifications included knowledge of English, some sign language, and a willingness to step in. The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) the national professional organization for American Sign Language interpreters in the United States--was established in 1964 and incorporated in 1974. RID established interpreter certification standards and put into place a code of ethics for practitioner members. In the early 1970 s, interpreter training programs (ITP) were established that were generally six to eight weeks in duration. These programs focused primarily on settings in which interpreters might expect to work (religious, telephone, courtroom, medical)
Because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black and white television sets, for the hour the color special was on the air, viewers tuned to CBS in any of the five cities saw only a blank screen [ 3 ]. RCA demonstrated its “all-electronic” color system for the first time on October 9th, 1951. The test was also broadcast on WNBT, and because RCA’s system was compatible with existing black and white television sets, viewers were able to watch the demonstration (in black and white, of course) [ 4 ]. According to NBC, there were only 2,860,000 color households in the United States as of January 1st, 1965 (though that was up from 1,620,000 on January 1st, 1964) [ 25 ]. By July 1st, the number stood at 3,600,000 and on October 1st it was at 4,450,000 color sets [ 26 ], [ 27 ].
