The value of your inventory is a major factor in figuring your taxable income. The method you use to value the inventory is very important. Generally there are two methods for valuing inventory. These methods are cost or lower of cost or market.
If you must account for an inventory in your business, you must use an accrual method of accounting for your purchases and sales. To figure taxable income, you must value your inventory at the beginning and end of each tax year. To determine the value, you need a method for identifying the items in your inventory and a method for valuing these items. The rules for valuing inventory cannot be the same for all kinds of businesses.
The retail method allows resellers to calculate the value of cost of goods sold and year-end inventory values based on the retail value of each class of goods sold. The retail value of the year-end inventory is determined by subtracting sales revenue from the beginning inventory value.
Inventory Tax Exemption. Business inventory is exempt from state property taxes (0.10 mills in 2014, with full phase out reached in 2016). Almost all (89 percent) of Georgiaâ€™s counties and over 140 of the cities have adopted a Level One Freeport Exemption, set at 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 percent of the inventory value.
If you paid tax on your gross sales receipts, you would have a very high tax bill. By deducting the value-of-inventory figure, you reduce your taxable income by as much as 88 percent (assuming a 12 percent average markup for inventory). You only pay taxes on your profits. Keeping track of your inventory costs reduces your tax bill by helping you arrive at a profit figure.
You must value your inventory at the end of the year. The retail method of valuing inventory is to multiply your average markup percentage by the amount of inventory you have on hand. Note that this method only works if you have a consistent markup percentage. Value your year-end inventory at retail value.
