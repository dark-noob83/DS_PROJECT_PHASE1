July 5 1948 – The NHS is born. When health secretary Aneurin Bevan opens Park Hospital in Manchester (image right), it is the climax of a hugely ambitious plan to bring good healthcare to all. Prescription charges of one shilling (5p) are introduced and a flat rate of £1 for ordinary dental treatment is also brought in on June 1 1952. Prescription charges are abolished in 1965 and prescriptions remain free until June 1968, when the charges are reintroduced.
About the National Health Service (NHS). The NHS was launched in 1948. It was born out of a long-held ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth – a principle that remains at its core. With the exception of some charges, such as prescriptions and optical and dental services, the NHS in England remains free at the point of use for anyone who is a UK resident. That is currently more than 64.1 million people in the UK and 53.9 million people in England alone.
The creation of the National Health Service. The NHS was founded on 5 July 1948, bringing together hospitals, GPs, opticians, dentists and other services into an integrated and organised healthcare service for the whole population. 
The National Health Service in England was created by the National Health Service Act 1946. Responsibility for the NHS in Wales was passed to the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969, leaving the Secretary of State for Social Services responsible for the NHS in England alone. The NHS guarantees equal health care to all Britons. By the beginning of the 1950s, spending on the NHS was exceeding expectations, leading in 1952 to the introduction of a one-shilling charge for prescriptions and a £ 1 charge for dental treatment; these were exceptions to the NHS being free at the point of use.

The principle of a free health service for all, paid for out of general taxation, had been won. The people had come to love their free NHS so much that no one could take it away. Then and now: A history of the NHS. Life expectancy. When the NHS was founded in 1948, the life expectancy for men was 66, and for women, 71. Today those figures are 77.2 and 81.5. Deaths. Over the past 60 years, the proportion of all deaths caused by cancer has risen, from 16.9 to 27 per cent. 
The NHS is founded on 5 July 1948, following an official unveiling at Park Hospital (now Trafford General Hospital) in Manchester. 1,143 voluntary hospitals with some 90,000 beds and 1,545 municipal hospitals with 390,000 beds are subsumed within the new NHS. This interactive timeline brings 70 years of reform to the National Health Service to life, charting the evolution of this public institution from its inception in the post-war years through to the present day.
The history of the NHS is that of an organisation established after a century's discussion on the provision of health services to meet a long recognised need. It appeared at a time when Britain saw health care as crucial to one of the five giants that Beveridge declared should be slain during post-war reconstruction. One option for the NHS was to move care from a hospital to a community setting. Community nursing was examined and the Government established two reviews, of general practice and nursing in primary health care (Cumberlege).
All services are often referred to as the NHS, although only the English NHS is officially called the National Health Service. All of the services were founded in 1948, based on legislation passed in 1946, 1947 and 1948. The four publicly funded health care systems in the countries of the United Kingdom are referred to as the National Health Service (NHS).
The introduction of the polio and diphtheria vaccine is a key part of NHS plans. Before this programme, cases of polio could climb as high as 8,000 in epidemic years, with cases of diphtheria as high as 70,000, leading to 5,000 deaths. Prescription charges of one shilling (5p) are introduced and a flat rate of £1 for ordinary dental treatment is also brought in on June 1 1952. Prescription charges are abolished in 1965 and prescriptions remain free until June 1968, when the charges are reintroduced.
