Pygmalion –. Hello, this is Natasha, and I am dropping by with a story from Ancient Greece. It’s called Pygmalion and tells how a sculptor fell in love with his own statue. The island of Cyprus lies not far from the lands that we nowadays call Turkey and Syria.
The myth of Hades and Persephone is one of the well known Greek myths. Hades was the brother of Zeus and the god of the underworld. Persephone was the daughter of Demeter, the Goddess of nature. The myth of Hades and Persephone is one more myth of love and abduction in the Greek mythology.
The myth of Tantalus is about the punishment of Tantalus by the Gods and it is associated with many other myths in Greek mythology referring to heroes, that were punished by the Gods for their behavior or crimes.
The ancient Greeks told stories about their gods. These stories are called myths (short for mythology, or stories about gods.) Stories about the ancient Greek gods are still told today. Each storyteller told the stories in their own way, but whatever power and personality a god had was consistent from story to story.
