Call it a flare-up, an exacerbation, an attack, or a relapse. Whatever you call it, it's not something you expect. When you have relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), you can go days or years without major changes in your symptoms. Then, suddenly, things change.
1 Your symptoms last 24 hours or longer. 2  A relapse means a change in your brain, called a lesion.  3 If a symptom lasts less than 24 hours, it’s something transient that’s not related to a new lesion, says Edward Fox, MD, director of the MS Clinic of Central Texas. 4  Symptoms level off after a while and stop getting worse.
There is no easy answer to your question about flare-ups. Every single person who has MS experiences it differently, and every incidence that each person experience can be different from the last. I have had MS for 21 years. In that time I have had numerous exacerbations and a wide range of symptoms.
Overview. An exacerbation of MS (also known as a relapse, attack or flare-up) causes new symptoms or the worsening of old symptoms. It can be very mild, or severe enough to interfere with a person’s ability to function at home and at work.
There is no time frame for exacerbations (relapse, attack, flare-up). The can last from a couple of weeks to months. My severe exacerbations last approximately 6 weeks, mild ones last approximately 3 weeks...with or without steroids. 1985 dx'd RRMS. 5/09/2013:Secondary Progressive without Progression.
According to the NMSS, attacks or flare-ups of symptoms only qualify as exacerbations if: 1  they occur at least 30 days from an earlier flare-up. 2  symptoms last for 24 hours or longer.
