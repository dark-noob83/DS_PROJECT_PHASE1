Convert character to Date in R. up vote 4 down vote favorite. 3. I am relatively new to R, but this is the first time I have had to deal with date conversions. I read in my data from a CSV (using read.table()), but I shorted the data to highlight my issue. When read into R, the Date field is character. Simply, most of my dates get coerced correctly, except for a few instances. The example below will hopefully show you what is going on.
I have a dataset which is taken from text file with the help of read.csv. command but when I generate the data in R file it converts the Dates into. factor.So for the above problem, I use as.Date to convert the Dates from. factor form to date format using the following: z has Date as a column. *But during this operation I loose all my dates and I get NA's instead of. it.
Converting dates entered as strings into numeric dates in R is simple for a single string, similarly simple for a vector of strings if the date information is represented consistently, and a little trickier if the date information is not represented consistently.
Sometimes you need to explicitly convert factors to either text or numbers. To do this, you use the functions as.character() or as.numeric() . First, convert your directions vector into a factor called directions.factor (as you saw earlier): Use as.character() to convert a factor to a character vector: Use as.numeric() to convert a factor to a numeric vector.
