They should not be clothes of fame, pride, and vanity. Women & Men Dress in Islam 3 INTRODUCTION To some as a subject the Muslim women's dress and Muslim men's clothing may sound trivial.
Muslims generally observe modest dress, but the variety of styles and colors have various names depending on the country. Here is a glossary of the most common names of Islamic clothing for both men and women, along with photos and descriptions.
In Islam, however, it has a broader meaning. It is the principle of modesty and includes behaviour as well as dress for both males and females. The most visible form of hijab is the head covering that many Muslim women wear.
To this end Islam has a dress code for both women and men. Its purpose is to protect the society as a whole and promote modest dressing and behaviour. It creates a barrier between the sexes and allows us to conduct our lives with modesty, dignity and respect.
The word used most often in regard to covering is hijab. All qualified Muslim scholars throughout the history of Islam agree that fulfilling the conditions of the dress code is an obligation on all Muslim men and women.
You’ll see a great variety of Muslim clothing for women, men and kids in a dizzying array of colors, styles, cuts and fabrics that make up Muslim fashion, all coming together to encompass what we call Islamic attire and Muslim wear.
Hijab is the principle of modesty in Islamic culture, as well as the word used to define the veil Muslim women wear. A Muslim girl or woman has the right to interpret the modesty rules outlined in the Qur’an. As a result, there is not one right way for a Muslim girl or woman to dress modestly, but a multitude of right ways.
1. Wear the hijab if you are truly devoted to turning over a new leaf and becoming the best Muslim girl that you can be. The hijab is not just a piece of cloth that covers hair, it covers and protects your whole self, including your mannerisms, speech, your gaze and your heart.
