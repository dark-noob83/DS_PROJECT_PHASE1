In 2011, Medicare spent about $549 billion for benefit expenses; 24 percent of that amount — approximately $158 billion — was spent on inpatient hospital services. Approximately 36 million patients per year are admitted to U.S. hospitals, and Medicare pays 90 percent of the costs for almost 42 percent of them. A little over 31 percent of that amount, or $814 billion, was spent on hospital services. Hospital costs averaged $3,949 per day, and costs per stay averaged $15,734.
Dividing that by 300 Million people we come up with $3,333 per person, per year or $277 a month. 20% of health care costs are for ICU care, which typically make up 1% of the beds in an average hospital. Daily ICU costs range from $2,000 - $3,000 per day in the US. (1996 figure). Conversations with Dr. K have revealed something I didn't quite get, but is probably obvious to medical professionals. It ain't the procedure, it's the bed
-A total of 44.6% had at least one major co-morbid condition; the most common co-morbidities included diabetes (13.2 %) and pulmonary disease (13.2%). -Daily incremental cost of mechanical ventilation for ICU patients is estimated at between $600 and $1500 per day. -Mean hospital costs were $34,257 dollars (+/- $40,559 dollars) with lower average costs in rural and small hospitals. Discontinuing mechanical ventilation continues to be one of the most challenging events in ICU management, and a significant portion of time spent on the ventilator (40%) is dedicated to weaning..
The average cost of one day of futile treatment in the ICU was $4,004 per patient. The cost of caring for the 123 patients whose treatment was perceived as being futile, both in and out of the ICU, was $2.6 million, the researchers found. 
Aug 15, '09 by WalkieTalkie. I know that just for a patient (non-isolation) to occupy one of our ICU rooms, they are charged something like $900 a day. That doesn't include anything else but the room. My limited memory tells me that costs for the first two days in the icu average about 10k per day. After that it starts to decease,such that in most cases the last day in the icu is about 2k or so. If you do a search on google scholar you should be able to find the paper
Hospital and Surgery Costs. Total health care spending in America was approximately $2.7 trillion in 2011. A little over 31 percent of that amount, or $814 billion, was spent on hospital services. Hospital costs averaged $3,949 per day, and costs per stay averaged $15,734. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the total number of inpatient surgeries performed in 2009 was 48 million
The study population was similar to that of other studies of pediatric intensive care. The PICU was 86% efficient. The total cost for PICU care was $16,983,323. Average cost per admission was $12,342 +/- $22,313, and average cost per patient day was $2,264 +/- $868. The cost because of the PICU location (room cost) was 52.1% of all costs, and cost of laboratory studies was 18.3%. Respiratory therapy, pharmacy services, and radiology each accounted for between 6% and 8%
There's not really a set price, it can actually vary widely depending on the billing agreements between the facility and various payers. My ICU is about $6,000 per day as the basic charge. On top of that the patient will get billed for the intensivist's services and any other consulting physicians, any tests or procedures will also be billed separately. # 1 1. It cost significantly MORE for the pt to be in an ICU bed than a step down or floor bed. I have no problem taking care of the sick ICU pts that actually need to be in ICU, but when docs do this it is wasting money and wasting a bed. Sorry, just a rant Totally unrelated to the post, but $6000 bucks a day is A LOT!
