Barr Body Definition. A Barr body can be defined as a small dark stained mass of X chromosome, which is inactive and are found only in the female cells. It is present in the nuclei of all cells except the germ cells. It is also called as sex chromatin as it indicates the presence of sex hormone.

A Barr body represents an inactive X chromosome in a female’s somatic cell. Barr bodies are small, dark stained mass of inactive X-chromosomes in females within the nucleus. Mc.Barr” and “Bertram were the two scientists to observe the deeply stained chromatin body in the nerve cell of female cat in the year 1943.
Barr body testing is a test to determine the presence of multiple X chromosomes in a cell. When more than one X chromosome is present in a cell, only one X is allowed to remain active, and any excess X chromosomes are randomly inactivated and condensed. The condensed, inactivated X chromosome is called a Barr Body.

Definition. The Epstein-Barr virus test is a blood test, or group of tests, to determine the presence or absence of antibodies in the blood stream directed against proteins of the Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of infectious mononucleosis.
