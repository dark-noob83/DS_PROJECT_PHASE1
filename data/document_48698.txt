Shingles is a disease that affects your nerves. It can cause burning, shooting pain, tingling, and/or itching, as well as a rash and blisters. You may recall having chickenpox as a child. Shingles is caused by the same virus, the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Shingles follows a pattern: 1  The first sign is often burning or tingling pain; sometimes, it includes numbness or itching on one side of the body. 2  Somewhere between 1 and 5 days after the tingling or burning feeling on the skin, a red rash will appear. 3  A few days later, the rash will turn into fluid-fille

The characteristic rash of shingles rash starts as small blisters on a red base. New blisters continue to form for three to five days. The blisters appear along the path of individual nerves in a specific ray-like distribution (called a dermatomal pattern) and appear in a band-like pattern over an area of skin. Drugs that fight viruses (antiviral drugs), such as acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), or famciclovir (Famvir), can reduce the severity and duration of the shingles rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash). In addition to antiviral medications, pain medications may be given.
A. Even when there is no rash, the pain of shingles may be apparent. Before a rash is visible, the patient may notice several days to a week of burning pain and sensitive skin. When the characteristic rash is not yet apparent, it may be difficult to determine the cause of the often severe pain.

Drugs that fight viruses (antiviral drugs), such as acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), or famciclovir (Famvir), can reduce the severity and duration of the shingles rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash). In addition to antiviral medications, pain medications may be given.

Shingles is a disease that affects nerves and causes pain and blisters in adults. It is caused by the same varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox. After you recover from chickenpox, the virus does not leave your body, but continues to live in some nerve cells.

Most adults live with the virus in their body and never get shingles.
