Gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped, hollow structure located under the liver and on the right side of the abdomen. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile, a yellow-brown digestive enzyme produced by the liver. The gallbladder is part of the biliary tract.
1 Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder, often due to a gallstone in the gallbladder. 2  Cholecystitis causes severe pain and fever, and can require surgery when inflammation continues or recurs. 3  Gallbladder cancer: Although rare, cancer can affect
The gallbladder is an organ that is part of the human biliary system, which is involved with the production, storage and transportation of bile. Bile is a yellowish-brown fluid produced by the liver and used to break up and digest fatty foods in the small intestine.
1 Gallstones (cholelithiasis): For unclear reasons, substances in bile can crystallize in the gallbladder, forming gallstones. 2  Common and usually harmless, gallstones can sometimes cause pain, nausea, or inflammation. 3  Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder, often due to a gallstone in the gallbladder.
The gallbladder is a small storage organ located inferior and posterior to the liver. Though small in size, the gallbladder plays an important role in our digestion of food. The gallbladder holds bile produced in the liver until it is needed for digesting fatty foods in the duodenum of the small intestine.
In vertebrates the gallbladder (also gall bladder, biliary vesicle or cholecyst), is a small organ where bile (a fluid produced by the liver) is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. Humans can live without a gallbladder.
