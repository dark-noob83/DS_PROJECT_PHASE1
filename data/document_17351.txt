End-to-end Encryption. End-to-end encryption is the most secure means of encryption and can provide non-reputability. Most modern email clients have the Internet standard S/MIME encryption built in. Other end-to-end encryption solutions require a plug-in or other software to use.
Nonrepudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny something. Typically, nonrepudiation refers to the ability to ensure that a party to a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message that they originated.

Tweet. Policy Based Email Encryption Best Practices. Email encryption is the process of converting plain text (the original message and attachments) to cipher text, and serves two functions: (1) maintain confidentiality (2) establish non-reputability â€“ that is, the sender cannot disclaim the contents of the message.
Email nonrepudiation involves methods such as email tracking that are designed to ensure that the sender cannot deny having sent a message and/or that the recipient cannot deny having received it. This was first published in September 2008.
Signature schemes like PGP have the property of non-reputability. This means that once Alice has signed a message and sent it to Bob, she can not later say that she did not. This is because anyone can verify a signature without Alice's help, and without trusting Bob, but only Alice could sign the message.
Short for electronic mail, email (or e-mail) is defined as the transmission of messages over communications networks. Typically the messages are notes entered from the keyboard or electronic files stored on disk. Most mainframes, minicomputers, and computer networks have an email system.
