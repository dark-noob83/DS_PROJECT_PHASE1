What Zometa Is Used For: 1  Zometa is used as a support medication to treat symptoms of cancer such as hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) or to decrease complications (such as fractures or pain) produced by bone metastasis (spread of cancer to the bone). Side Effects of Zometa : Important things to remember about the side effects of Zometa: 1  Most people do not experience all of the side effects listed. 2  Side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset and duration. 3  Side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete.

Zometa (zoledronate) is a bisphosphonate medication used to treat cancer patients. It is taken intervenously (through an IV). The use of bisphosphonate medications, such as Zometa, Aredia and Fosamax, have been linked to an increased occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw, a painful and potentially disfiguring jaw bone condition. Zometa is used in the treatment of: 1  hypercalcemia of malignancy.
