Pulmonary Fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is one of a family of related diseases called interstitial lung diseases that can result in lung scarring. As the lung tissue becomes scarred, it interferes with a person's ability to breathe. In some cases, the cause of pulmonary fibrosis can be found.
The scar tissue on the lungs affects the lungs' function and is irreversible. Hemera Technologies/AbleStock.com/Getty Images. Occupational and Environmental Factors. Long-term exposure to toxins and pollutants such as silica dust or asbestos increases your risk of lung disease that can lead to scar tissue.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes scar tissue to grow inside your lungs. Usually, when you breathe in, oxygen moves through tiny air sacs into your bloodstream. From there, it travels to organs in your body. IPF scar tissue is thick, like the scars you get on your skin after a cut.
Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic lung disease involving the abnormal formation of fiber-like scar tissue in the lungs. In the early stages of the disease, the lungs can become inflamed, making breathing difficult.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the term used to describe chronic lung conditions that cause severe shortness of breath and block the airways in your lungs. Usually it refers to long-lasting bronchitis or emphysema. But it can also include asthmatic bronchitis (bronchial asthma).
If you have sarcoidosis, the increased inflammation in your body may cause flu-like symptoms. This inflammation can lead to scar tissue in your lungs while also making them function more poorly. Many people with sarcoidosis also have skin and eye damage in addition to lung disease.
