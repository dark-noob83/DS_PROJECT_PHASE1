Fixation. Definition. noun, plural: fixations. (biological technique) The use of a fixative to preserve histological, cytological, or microbiological specimen. (zoology) The determination of type, whether by designation, or indication.
All plants, including forage crops, need relatively large amounts of nitrogen (N) for proper growth and development. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the term used for a process in which nitrogen gas (N 2) from the atmosphere is incorporated into the tissue of certain plants.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In the fields of histology, pathology, and cell biology, fixation is a critical step in the preparation of histological sections by which biological tissues are preserved from decay, thereby preventing autolysis or putrefaction. Fixation terminates any ongoing biochemical reactions, and may also increase the mechanical strength or stability of the treated tissues. The broad objective of tissue fixation is to preserve cells and tissue components and to do this in such a way as to allow for the preparation of thin, stained sections.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. For other uses, see Fixation. In population genetics, fixation is the change in a gene pool from a situation where there exists at least two variants of a particular gene (allele) to a situation where only one of the alleles remains. Fixation can refer to a gene in general or particular nucleotide position in the DNA chain (locus). In the process of substitution, a previously non-existent allele arises by mutation and undergoes fixation by spreading through the population by random genetic drift and/or positive selection.
