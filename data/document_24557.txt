The nerves that control quiet respiration are the phrenic and intercostal nerves. The phrenic nerves, which leave the cord in the cervical region (C2-4) each supply one half of the diaphragm. The intercostal muscles receive their nerve supply from the thoracic segments of the cord.
During breathing, air moves into the lungs from the nose or mouth (called inspiration, or inhalation), and then moves out of the lungs during expiration, or exhalation. A free flow of air from the nose or mouth to the lungs and from the lungs to the nose or mouth is vitally important.
1. The Chemical Control of Respiration. Ultimately the respiratory process functions to bring oxygen to the cells of the body and to eliminate carbon dioxide from them. The production of carbon dioxide is ordinarily very closely linked to the consumption of oxygen.

When the lungs are inflated, there is an arrest of inspiration. When lungs are deflated, the opposite effect is observed. This reflex is called 'Hering-Breuver reflex '.
Diaphragm (muscle): The muscle that separates the chest (thoracic) cavity from the abdomen. The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration. Contraction of the diaphragm muscle expands the lungs during inspiration when one is breathing air in.
