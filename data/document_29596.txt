Manganese Uses. Manganese is a trace mineral that is present in the human body in very small amounts, primarily in the bones, liver, kidneys and pancreas, according to the University of Maryland Medical School.
Some of the health benefits of manganese include a benefit to healthy bone structure, bone metabolism, and helping to create essential enzymes for building bones. It also acts as a co-enzyme to assist metabolic activity in the human body.
Glucose Metabolism: Manganese aids in regulating glucose metabolism in the human body. This is one of the most important health benefits of manganese to provide proper resources to different body parts, which increases energy and functional efficiency.
