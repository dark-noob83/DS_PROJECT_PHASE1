Algae eaters are a great addition in a freshwater tank to help control and reduce unsightly and potentially damaging algae prorogation. They come in a variety of species, including shrimps, snails and algae-consuming fish. Certain algae-eaters prefer certain types of algae, so with a mix of species you can ensure that all or most of the algae presence can be controlled.
The types of algae that they attack are: aquarium glass algae, plant algae, and substrate algae. They will normally spend most of their time on the bottom of the fish tank grazing the surface of the substrate eating any left over food and algae.
Plecostomus are large algae eating fish from South and Central America. They are known in the aquarium hobby as Sucker Fish, Suckers, or even just Algae Eaters. There are many different types of Plecostomus and many of them require very different water parameters, food and cover.
Fish are only one type of animal that eats algae. There are many algae-eating snails, shrimp and clams that can be interesting additions to your tank. Florida flagfish (Jordanella floridae) are great additions to the aquarium that has a brush or beard algae problem.
The Amano shrimp is a very popular and active algae-eating species. They are ravenous eaters, consuming not only most algae, but eat dead plant castoff material (detritus) and clean the tank of leftover food.

Algae eaters are a must in any freshwater aquarium. There are many types of algae eaters: fish, shrimp, and snails. Pick one based on the size of your tank and the type of fish your are keeping. The last thing you want, is for your algae eater to be eaten. A commercial food diet should still be fed, along with the available algae in the tank.
