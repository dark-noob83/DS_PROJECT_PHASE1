If you mix 500 mL of 1.0 x 10 -8 M AgNO 3 with 500 mL of 1.0 x 10 -8 M NaI, then:a) AgI will precipitate. d) silver nitrate will precipitate.b) no precipitation will occur.
A 0.496 g sample of sodium propanoate, NaC3H5O2, is added to a 50mL sample of .265 M solution of propanoic acid. Assuming that no chane in the coume of the solution occurs chalculate the following. The concentration of the propanoate ion, C3H5O2- (aq) in the solution. Update: What exactly is cancentration is it the moles the molartty or what.
The propionate or propanoate ion is C 2 H 5 C O O âˆ’ (the conjugate base of propionic acid). A propionic or propanoic compound is a small salt or ester of propionic acid. In these compounds, propionate is often written in shorthand, as CH 3 CH 2 CO 2 or simply EtCO 2.
Propanoic acid, HC3H5O2, ionizes in water. A 0.496 g sample of sodium propanoate, NaC3H5O2 (molar mass: 96.07 g/mole) is added to a 50.0 mL sample of a 0.265 M solution of propanoic acid. Assuming that no change in the volume of the solution occurs, calculate the concentration of the propanoate ion, C3H5O2- in the solution. Get Answ

Propionic acid (from the Greek words protos, meaning first, and pion, meaning fat; also known as propanoic acid) is a naturally occurring carboxylic acid with chemical formula C H 3 CH 2 C O OH. Propionic acid is also useful as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals, especially polymers. Cellulose-acetate-propionate is a useful thermoplastic. Vinyl propionate is also used. In more specialized applications, it is also used to make pesticides and pharmaceuticals
