CFI Executive Director Michael Malbin has been compiling campaign finance vital statistics for many years. Included here are updated and downloadable (pdf) versions of tables that appear in the book Vital Statistics on Congress. The most recent edition of this book was released by Brookings Institution Press in 2013. 
Methodology: MapLight analysis of campaign contributions to members of the 113th Congress who won election in 2012, from January 1, 2011-December 31, 2012, based on latest available data from the FEC as of February 13, 2013. Data source for median home value and household income: U.S. Census Bureau. 
They’re definitely not the cheap seats, that’s for sure. The cost of winning a seat in Congress rose to a new all time high in the 2012 election cycle, according to a new analysis by MapLight.org of data from the Federal Elections Commission. Perhaps not surprisingly, the price of winning a seat in Congress has risen since the 2008 election cycle. Four years ago, the average amount raised by a winning Senator was $9,211,992, FEC data shows. Winning House members, by comparison, raised $1,471702 during the came cycle
Winning a House seat in 2012 cost the victor on average twice as much as it did a quarter-century ago: about $1.6 million, compared with about $753,000 in 1986. That increase is striking, given that most House races are not as competitive as they once were. Entrenched members of Congress are also urged to donate their unneeded campaign funds to other candidates or to the political parties to spend where they see fit. Senate seats were also more expensive than ever in 2012: the average cost was $10.4 million for victorious candidates.
The average price of winning or holding on to a six-year term in the U.S. Senate averaged $10,476,451 in the 2012 election cycle, MapLight said. Slightly less pricey, obtaining or being re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives cost an average of $1,689,580. Perhaps not surprisingly, the price of winning a seat in Congress has risen since the 2008 election cycle. Four years ago, the average amount raised by a winning Senator was $9,211,992, FEC data shows. Winning House members, by comparison, raised $1,471702 during the came cycle
In effect, that means that the winning Senate candidates needed to raise an average of $14,351 every day between Jan. 1 2010 and election day, 2012 in order to pull of a win, while the victorious House members raised $2.315 per day, MapLight found.

In 2008, the average cost of winning a House seat was about $1.1 million and $6.5 million for a Senate seat. And if you look at the total costs of elections, that’s increased substantially too. For example, take a look at past presidential election cycles. According to Maplight, a non-profit, non-partisan research organization that tracks money in politics, House candidates who won in 2012 raked in an average of $1,689,580 in campaign contributions. That’s about $2,315 each day. Those numbers climb substantially if you’re running for Senate. Candidates who won a seat in Congress’ upper chamber each raised an average of $10,476,451. That’s $14,351 per day. Of course, not all seats are created equally
Last year, winning Senate candidates spent an average of $10.3 million, according to the latest edition of Vital Statistics on Congress, which was released this week. That's a 62% increase, adjusted for inflation, since 1986. 1 Spending on winning Senate races has increased 62% in 2012 dollars since 1986. 2  The increase is more pronounced in the House, where winning a race there increased by 334%. 3  Biggest increase is in outside groups, which went from $9 miilion in 1986 to $457 million in 2012.
