Â©WILLIAM KARESH. Bird flu, cholera, Ebola, plague and tuberculosis are just a few of the diseases likely to spread and get worse as a result of climate change, according to a report released yesterday by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).yme disease: This bacterium-caused disease will spread as climate changes extend the ranges of the ticks that carry it. Plague: Changes in temperature and rainfall will affect rodent populations globally as well as the infected fleas they carry.
According to Maria Diuk-Wasser at the Yale School of Public Health, the onset of human-induced global warming is likely to increase the infection rates of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus by creating more mosquito-friendly habitats.nfection rates of diseases like malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus are likely to rise as a warming climate creates
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that climate change is responsible for at least 150,000 deaths per year, a number that is expected to double by 2030. The effects of global warming will cause dire health consequences: Infectious diseases. WHO states that global warming will also cause a major increase in insect-borne diseases in Europe. Countries like Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Turkey might already be in the danger zone for mosquito-borne malaria. However, the ability to tolerate temperature changes differs from region to region.
Thanks, Global Warming--Mosquito-Borne Diseases Are on the Uptick. Infection rates of diseases like malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus are likely to rise as a warming climate creates more mosquito-friendly habitats.
The effect of global warming depends on the complex interaction between the human host population and the causative infectious agent. From the human standpoint, changes in the environment may trigger human migration, causing disease patterns to shift. Crop failures and famine may reduce host resistance to infections.mportantly, significant economic and political stresses may damage the existing public health infrastructure, leaving mankind poorly prepared for unexpected epidemics. Global warming will certainly affect the abundance and distribution of disease vectors.
Wherever this combination has been used, malaria rates have drastically declined. Conclusion. Global warming is not promoting the spread of tropical diseases; bad policies are. Eliminate the policies that discourage economic growth, and regardless of the temperature incomes will rise and tropical diseases will decline.r. Epstein contends that if the earth warms another 4 degrees Fahrenheit, the malaria-bearing mosquito's domain will expand from 42 percent of the globe to more than 60 percent. Evidence Refuting a Link between Global Warming and Disease.
Scientific understanding of global warming is increasing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported in 2014 that scientists were more than 95% certain that global warming is being caused mostly by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and other human (anthropogenic) activities.
Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects.cientific understanding of global warming is increasing.

Malaria, dengue, plague, and viruses causing encephalitic syndromes are among the many vector-borne diseases likely to be affected. Some models suggest that vector-borne diseases will become more common as the earth warms, although caution is needed in interpreting these predictions. Clearly, global warming will cause changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Importantly, significant economic and political stresses may damage the existing public health infrastructure, leaving mankind poorly prepared for unexpected epidemics. Global warming will certainly affect the abundance and distribution of disease vectors.
