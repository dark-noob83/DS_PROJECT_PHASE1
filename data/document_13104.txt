10995. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), and the primary use of hexadecimal notation is a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values in computing and digital electronics. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble, which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, byte values can range from 0 to 255 (decimal), but may be more conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits in the range 00 to FF. Hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses.
Binary is base-2, octal is base-8, and decimal is of course base-10. Hexadecimal values are sometimes written with the prefix 0x (0x2F7) or with a subscript (2F7 16), but it doesn't change the value. In both of these examples, you could keep or drop the prefix or subscript and the decimal value would remain 759. The hexadecimal number system, also called base-16 or sometimes just hex, is a number system that uses 16 unique symbols to represent a particular value. Those symbols are 0-9 and A-F.
For example, the hexadecimal value F4240 is equivalent to 1,000,000 in decimal and 1111 0100 0010 0100 0000 in binary. Another place hexadecimal is used is as an HTML color code to express a specific color. For example, a web designer would use the hex value FF0000 to define the color red. The hexadecimal number system, also called base-16 or sometimes just hex, is a number system that uses 16 unique symbols to represent a particular value. Those symbols are 0-9 and A-F.
Hex System. Hex, or hexadecimal, is a number system of base 16. This number system is especially interesting because in our casually used decimal system we have only 10 digits to represent numbers. As hex system has 16 digits, the extra needed 6 digits are represented by the first 6 letters of English alphabet. 
You may already know that Binary (or Base 2) is what computers actually use to carry out calculations. Octal is Base 8, and Decimal, of course, is Base 10. And just as we have ten digits, 0 through 9, in the Decimal system, there are sixteen digits we could use for Hexadecimal (0-9 and six more). The Basics of Hex. 
Refers to the base-16 number system, which consists of 16 unique symbols: the numbers 0 to 9 and the letters A to F. For example, the decimal number 15 is represented as F in the hexadecimal numbering system. The hexadecimal system is useful because it can represent every byte (8 bits) as two consecutive hexadecimal digits. It is easier for humans to read hexadecimal numbers than binary numbers. To convert a value from hexadecimal to binary, you merely translate each hexadecimal digit into its 4-bit binary equivalent.
In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0 â€“ 9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble, which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, byte values can range from 0 to 255 (decimal), but may be more conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits in the range 00 to FF. Hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses.
Hexadecimal describes a base-16 number system. That is, it describes a numbering system containing 16 sequential numbers as base units (including 0) before adding a new position for the next number. 
Hexadecimal. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system. It is a different method of representing numbers than the base-10 system we use in every day practice. In base-10, we count in multiples of 10 before adding another digit. For example, 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12... and 98 - 99 - 100 - 101 - 102.... In base-16, or the hexadecimal number system, each digit can have sixteen values instead of ten. The values of a hexadecimal digit can be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. Therefore, the number 12 (in the common base-10 format) would be represented as C in hexadecimal notation.
