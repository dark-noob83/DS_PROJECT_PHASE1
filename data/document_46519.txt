Jack Scott, Canadian Born Italian Hillbilly. Jack Scott was born Giovanni Scafone Jr., on January 24, 1936 in Windsor Ontario, Canada. His father, an accomplished guitarist, gave Jack a guitar around the age of eight. At the age of ten, the family moved to Hazel Park, MI. At that time Jack already began signing and performing on a local radio station. Thus developed the melting-pot miracle: A Canadian born, Italian hillbilly who worshipped Hank Williams and who soon sparked his own teen age band, Scott played the guitar lead and vocals. His first album was entitled simply Jack Scott. This album contained 10 of Scott's own compositions.
Scott spent his early childhood in Windsor, Ontario (Canada), across the river from Detroit, Michigan (United States). When he was 10, Scott's family moved to Hazel Park, a Detroit suburb. He grew up listening to hillbilly music and was taught to play the guitar by his Mother Laura. As a teenager, he pursued a singing career and recorded as 'Jack Scott.' At the age of 18, he formed the Southern Drifters. After leading the band for three years, he signed to ABC-Paramount Records as a solo artist in 1957.
And then there is Jack Scott. A Canadian-Italian born Giovanni Dominco Scafone Jr. in Windsor, Ontario, he changed his name to Jack Scott by the age of 18, when he decided to pursue music as more than hobby. He formed a band called the Southern Drifters around 1954 and played with them around the area until signing with ABC Records in 1957.

Rock. Jack Scott sounded tough, like someone you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley unless he had a guitar in his hands. When he growled The Way I Walk, wise men (and women) stepped aside. But his principal pop success came with tears-in-your-beer country-based ballads -- What in the World's Come Over You and Burning Bridges were massive smashes on Top Rank in 1960, and he recorded an entire album's worth of Hank Williams covers for the firm the same year.
