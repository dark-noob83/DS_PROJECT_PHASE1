Visible light has frequencies ranging from 4*10 14 Hz to 8*10 14 Hz (400 THz to 800 THz) and wavelengths from 3.8*10 -7 m to 7.5*10 -7 m (380 nm to 750 nm). Red light has the lowest frequency (longest wavelength) and violet light has the highest frequency (shortest wavelength) of visible light.
The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm. In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430–770 THz.
Visible light falls in the range of the EM spectrum between infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV). It has frequencies of about 4 × 10 14 to 8 × 10 14 cycles per second, or hertz (Hz) and wavelengths of about 740 nanometers (nm) or 2.9 × 10 −5 inches, to 380 nm (1.5 × 10 −5 inches).
As the full spectrum of visible light travels through a prism, the wavelengths separate into the colors of the rainbow because each color is a different wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength, at around 380 nanometers, and red has the longest wavelength, at around 700 nanometers.
This visible light region consists of a spectrum of wavelengths that range from approximately 700 nanometers (abbreviated nm) to approximately 400 nm. Expressed in more familiar units, the range of wavelengths extends from 7 x 10 -7 meter to 4 x 10 -7 meter.
Ultraviolet Light Ultraviolet (UV) light is light with higher frequency (lower wavelength) than visible light. UV light has frequencies ranging from 8*10 14 to 3*10 16 Hz (800 THz to 30 PHz) and wavelengths from 10 -8 m to 3.8*10 -7 m (10 nm to 380 nm).
Expressed in more familiar units, the range of wavelengths extends from 7 x 10-7 meter to 4 x 10-7 meter. This narrow band of visible light is affectionately known as ROYGBIV. Each individual wavelength within the spectrum of visible light wavelengths is representative of a particular color.
The term infrared refers to a broad range of frequencies, beginning at the top end of those frequencies used for communication and extending up the the low frequency (red) end of the visible spectrum. The wavelength range is from about 1 millimeter down to 750 nm.
The frequency is the number of waves that pass a point in space during any time interval, usually one second. We measure it in units of cycles (waves) per second, or hertz. The frequency of visible light is referred to as color, and ranges from 430 trillion hertz, seen as red, to 750 trillion hertz, seen as violet.
