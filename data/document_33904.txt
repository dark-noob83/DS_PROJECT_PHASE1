Price (kWh): Enter the cost you are paying on average per a kilowatt hour, average price in North America is 10 cents. Incandescent light bulbs have an average lifespan of 1000 hours or 41.6 days running 24/7. While comparable CFL light bulbs last an average of 9,000 hours or 375 days running 24/7 and an LED light bulb lasts 50,000 hours or 2,083 days. Power Use (Watts): Enter the average power consumption of the device in watts. Incandescent light bulbs have an average lifespan of 1000 hours or 41.6 days running 24/7. While comparable CFL light bulbs last an average of 9,000 hours or 375 days running 24/7 and an LED light bulb lasts 50,000 hours or 2,083 days.
If we use the bulbs about 1000 hours per year, hours (kWh)you will continue to use the CFL bulb for 10 years. The incandescent bulb will have to be replaced every 9 months or 13 times in the 10 year period. 
A high-efficiency fluorescent bulb costs about $2-$5 and lasts about 8,000 hours. A 25-watt fluorescent bulb puts out roughly the same amount of light as a 100-watt incandescent light. If you were to leave a 100-watt bulb burning for 24 hours each day, 365 days per year, it would use 216 kilowatt hours per year. The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity varies across the country, but average cost (including all charges) is about 15 cents. Your light bulb therefore costs about $32.40 per year to operate (216 kWh X 15 cents).
Part I: The Cost of an Incandescent Bulb. An incandescent light bulb costs about 50 cents and lasts about 750 hours. If you were to leave a 100-watt bulb burning for 24 hours each day, 365 days per year, it would use 876 kilowatt hours per year. (1000 watts equals one kilowatt – “kilo” means a thousand.). The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity varies across the country, but average cost (including all charges) is about 15 cents. Your light bulb therefore costs about $32.40 per year to operate (216 kWh X 15 cents).
An average CFL bulb which provides 800 lumens will use only 13 to 15 watts compared to a similar incandescent bulb which uses 60 watts. Click calculate to find out the electricity cost of a single CFL light bulb running at 14 Watts for 5 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh, you can also modify the calculator. Cost Per Hour: Cost Per Day: Cost Per Month: Electricity usage of a CFL Light Bulb. A CFL light bulb is also known as a compact fluorescent lamp or a compact fluorescent light, they were made to replace incandescent light bulbs. CFLs use 1/3rd to 1/5th the electrical power of incandescent lighting and can last 8 to 15 times longer.
Click calculate to find out the electricity cost of a single incandescent light bulb running at 60 Watts for 5 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh, keep in mind you can edit the numbers in the calculator. Cost Per Hour: Cost Per Day: Power Use (Watts): Enter the average power consumption of the device in watts. Incandescent light bulbs have an average lifespan of 1000 hours or 41.6 days running 24/7. While comparable CFL light bulbs last an average of 9,000 hours or 375 days running 24/7 and an LED light bulb lasts 50,000 hours or 2,083 days.
Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs. Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat.
