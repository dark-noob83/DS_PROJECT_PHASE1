Diabetes mellitus, more commonly referred to as diabetes, is a condition that causes blood sugar to rise to dangerous levels: a fasting blood glucose of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or more. 
1 The doctor tests your blood sugar level after fasting for 8 hours and it’s higher than 126 mg/dL. 2  Oral glucose tolerance test. 3  After fasting for 8 hours, you get a special sugary drink. 4  Two hours later your sugar level is higher than 200. 5  Random check. And it's less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating. During the day, levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL. For some people, 60 is normal; for others, 90.
Answer: Now, in a normal individual we measure blood sugar under different circumstances. What we call fasting blood sugar or blood glucose levels is usually done six to eight hours after the last meal. So it's most commonly done before breakfast in the morning; and the normal range there is 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. 
A. At present, the diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes is based in an arbitrary cut-off point for a normal blood sugar level. A normal sugar level is currently considered to be less than 100 mg/dL when fasting and less than 140 mg/dL two hours after eating. But in most healthy people, sugar levels are even lower. During the day, blood glucose levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL. In some, 60 is normal; in others, 90.
Normally, the fasting blood sugar in adults is around 100 mg /dL or lower – according to WebMD. But if it is higher than 100 mg /dL, it is considered abnormal. If left untreated, it may rise higher than 130 mg /dL which then can be considered into a condition called hyperglycemia. It may point to a condition called pre-diabetes (the phase prior to diabetes – as the name suggests). The normal range of blood sugar levels means that you the level of sugar /glucose in your bloodstream is not too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia).

For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL. For some people, 60 is normal; for others, 90.
Sara: Your doctor wants test you for type 2 diabetes. A normal fasting blood glucose target range for an individual without diabetes is 70-100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 3.9-5.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). A person with prediabetes has a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl. If the blood glucose level rises to 126 mg/dl or above, a person has diabetes.&quot; and &quot;•An A1C 5.6% or below is normal. In prediabetes, A1C levels range between 5.7%-6.4%
A normal fasting blood glucose target range for an individual without diabetes is 70-100 mg/dL (3.9-5.6 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70–130 mg/dL (3.9-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). A person with prediabetes has a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl. If the blood glucose level rises to 126 mg/dl or above, a person has diabetes.&quot; and &quot;•An A1C 5.6% or below is normal. In prediabetes, A1C levels range between 5.7%-6.4%
