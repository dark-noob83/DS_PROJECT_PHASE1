You are about 5 inches too short to be a runway model but you can be a bikini model: Bikini models are usually curvaceous and fit. For women, usually the models can be shorter, around 5 ft 5 in-5 ft 8 in (1.65 m-1.73 m) and need to be in the range of 90–110 lb (41–50 kg). Apparently 5'4'' is pretty average so models that are like 5'9 + would be pretty scary lol But I reallllly want to be a model!! My mum says I look like Gemma Ward hehe and I really do have that 'model look' Is there a hope in the world... Source(s): tall model: https://tr.im/eOnFv. Kissiah · 2 months ago. Thumbs up.
Starting a Modeling Agency.... 5. Cancel. To be an editorial or fashion model, women will need to be between 5-foot-8 and 6 feet tall, while male models will need to be between 6 feet and 6-foot-2.
Though today the models are as tall as 5'9 and 6'0. But you have to be really thin and pretty. If you are all that then sure you can be a runway model. im 14 and want to become a runway model and i am 5'7 /170cm tall i want to know how tall i need to be so i can fufill my dreams and do you think i will grow taller??
When you see the incredibly tall and lean figures that grace the runways and editorials for the leading fashion houses and designers, these are the High Fashion models. They are generally required to be between 172cm to 180cm (5”8 to 5”11), with a dress size of 4-6 US (6-8 UK), with a typical bust size of 34. The age range can be from 14 to 25. For guys the age range is more flexible and they can start from the age of 16 until their late 40’s. They need to be between 180cm to 188cm (5”11 to 6”2), with an excellent physique and a chest size of 94cm to 106cm (37” to 42”) and 76cm to 81cm (30” to 32”) waist. Guys tend to have longer careers if they look after themselves
This depends on what kind of modeling you want to do. Fashion/editorial/runway models are required to be between 5'8-6'0 for females and 5'10-6'2 for males. Commercial/pri … nt models should be between 5'5-5'7 for females and 5'9-6'2 for males. If you are trying to do commercial/print, the minimum height is 5'5. For fashion and runway you should ideally already be 5'8 or 5'7 with the hope of growing taller in the … next few years.
At age 14, if you want to be a fashion/runway model, agencies will require you to be 5'8 but for younger models they typically will lower the height requirement to 5'6 or 5' … 7 since they know you will have a shot at growing taller as you get older. If you are trying to do commercial/print, the minimum height is 5'5. For fashion and runway you should ideally already be 5'8 or 5'7 with the hope of growing taller in the … next few years.

You have to be at least 5' 10 or 5' 11. Also, you have to be size 4 or 6. Runway model is not only about height but also about your clothing size. Size 4 is the average size for runway model. Designers prefer runway model to have longer legs than longer body because their designs are in 9 heads proportion. 4 heads are measured from upper body and 5 heads are measured lower body. If you want to be a runway model, you better start learning how to walk a straight line now.
You are JUST tall enough. Despite all the bad publicity, you still have to be painfully thin to be a model though. I'm 5'8and a UK size 8, US 4 and considered far too curvy to be a model! I'm not prepared to starve myself so never seriously considered it as a career option.
