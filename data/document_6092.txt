There is a distinct cause-effect relationship. The change in speed is the cause and the change in direction (refraction) is the effect. Flickr Physics Photo Laser light shown passing through a rectangular block of lucite. It enters the block along the normal line with an angle of incidence of 0°. There is no bending upon entering, nor upon leaving the block.
Longitudinal waves cause the medium to vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. It consists of multiple compressions and rarefactions. The rarefaction is the farthest distance apart in the longitudinal wave and the compression is the closest distance together.
1 Refraction: 2  is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with different densities. 3  amount of refraction depends upon: 4  density of the materials. 5  angle at which the light enters the material. 6  wavelength-causes colors of white light to separate when passing through a prism.

A mechanical wave is a wave that is an oscillation of matter, and therefore transfers energy through a medium. While waves can move over long distances, the movement of the medium of transmission —the material—is limited.
