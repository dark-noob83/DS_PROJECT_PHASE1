Making the world better, one answer at a time. The endocrine system controls the functions of the organs throughout the body. Mixed endocrine and exocrine glands are the pancreas, ovaries and testes they produce hormones but are also involved in other roles. Pure endocrine glands are the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal cortex, thymus and pineal their only function is to create hormones.
One of the mixed endocrine-exocrine organs is the pancreas. It has a mixture of the two tissues. The larger, exocrine part has clusters of secretory cells that form sacs known as acini. The smaller endocrine tissue is known as the islets of Langerhans, which go throughout the entire pancreas. The other endocrine organs that are mixed glands are the ovaries and the testes.
5. Locate the following endocrine glands (organs) on a diagram: hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, adrenals, pancreas, ovaries, and testes. 6. Name the three endocrine glands (see above) that are actually divided into two endocrine glands with different functions.
A mixed gland is a gland that produces endocrine and exocrine secretions. The pancreas is an example of a mixed gland because it secretes hormones into circulation, such as insulin and glucagon, while also releasing an exocrine secretion, pancreatic juice. 1  The Endocrine System Review-Image Diversity: endocrine pancreas.
