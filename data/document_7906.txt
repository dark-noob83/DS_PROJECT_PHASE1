The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day. You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label. The Nutrition Facts label shows total carbohydrates, which includes starches, fiber, sugar alcohols, and naturally occurring and added sugars. It may also list total fiber, soluble fiber and sugar separately. You may also be able to find nutrient calculators online or find information on a manufacturer's website.
Carb amounts play a major role in setting your carb boluses. It is best to make gradual changes in how many carbs you eat and adjust your insulin gradually as you go. Fill in the blanks below to determine how many grams of carbohydrate you need each day by hand or use our interactive Carb and Calorie Estimator.
Measure the number of servings of each food item you consume. Use measuring cups or a scale to calculate how many servings of each food item you consume. Step 5. Multiply the amount of fat, protein and carbohydrates in one serving of every food item you consume by the number of servings you ate. Set targets for fat, protein and carbohydrate intake. A balanced diet will consist of between 20 to 35 percent calories from fat, 10 to 35 percent from protein and 45 to 65 percent from carbohydrates, the Institute of Medicine states.
Divide both numbers by 4 because carbohydrates contain 4 calories in each gram. As an example, for a 2,000-calorie diet, you’ll need 900 to 1,300 calories from carbohydrates every day. After dividing by 4, you’ll convert the calories to grams, which is 225 to 325 grams of carbs. Step 3. Multiply the average number of calories you consume in a day by 45 percent. This is the minimum percentage of your calories that should come from carbohydrates, according to the publication Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010..
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of c
Exactly how many carbohydrates you need depends on a number of factors which include: Factors that influence your recommended carbohydrate intake include: 1  Body weight: More specifically, the amount of muscle. 2  The greater your muscle mass, the more carbohydrates you need. 
The Carbohydrate Calculator estimates the percentage of carbohydrates you will need each day. Carbohydrates are not essential nutrients – the human body can obtain all its energy from protein and fats. However, the brain and its neurons generally cannot burn fat and need glucose for energy. You need 1,361 Calories/day to lose 1 kg per week. You should take 145 (40%) - 272 (75%) grams of carbohydrate for your energy needs. (55% = 200 grams, 65% = 236 grams). You need 2,861 Calories/day to gain 0.5
1 So if you weigh 140 pounds, you need 56 grams of protein a day. 2  For an active lifestyle, multiply by 0.4 to 0.6. 3  So if you weigh 140 pounds, you need 56 grams to 84 grams of protein a day. 4  For an athlete who's building muscle or for a young athlete, you need 0.6 to 0.9 grams per pound. Calculate your level of activity. Your level of activity determines the number of calories you should consume in a day. Because protein makes up a portion of those calories, your activity level also determines how much protein you should eat.
The Institute of Medicine recommends a minimum of 130 grams of carbohydrates per day, which is the average minimal usage of glucose that the brain uses on a daily basis. You need 2,361 Calories/day to maintain your weight. You should take 252 (40%) - 472 (75%) grams of carbohydrate for your energy needs. You need 1,361 Calories/day to lose 1 kg per week. You should take 145 (40%) - 272 (75%) grams of carbohydrate for your energy needs. (55% = 200 grams, 65% = 236 grams). You need 2,861 Calories/day to gain 0.5
