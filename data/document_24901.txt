Healthgrades Editorial Staff. Peripheral vascular disease is a condition in which the blood vessels in the lower extremities (feet, legs, or thighs) are narrowed, restricting blood flow. 
Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD; Peripheral Artery Disease [PAD]). Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a problem with poor blood flow. It affects blood vessels outside of the heart and brain and gets worse over time. Parts of the body, like the brain, heart, arms, or legs, may not get enough blood. The legs and feet are most commonly affected. PVD is often found in people with problems with the arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary artery disease). That is because atherosclerosis, which causes coronary artery disease, affects arteries throughout the body. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque on the walls of the arteries.
PVD may result from a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood to the legs and arms. The most common cause is atherosclerosis. Click Image to Enlarge. Other causes of PVD may include injury to the arms or legs, abnormal muscles or ligaments, or infection.

Peripheral Vascular Disease Overview. Peripheral vascular disease, also called PVD, refers to any disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. The term can include any disorder that affects any blood vessels. It is, though, often used as a synonym for peripheral artery disease. PVD is the most common disease of the arteries. The build-up of fatty material inside the vessels, a condition called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, is what causes it.

The most common cause of PVD is peripheral artery disease, which is due to atherosclerosis. Fatty material builds up inside the arteries and mixes with calcium, scar tissue, and other substances. The mixture hardens slightly, forming plaques. These plaques block, narrow, or weaken the artery walls. It is, though, often used as a synonym for peripheral artery disease. PVD is the most common disease of the arteries. The build-up of fatty material inside the vessels, a condition called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, is what causes it.
1 Peripheral artery disease is due to atherosclerosis. 2  This is a gradual process in which a fatty material builds up inside the arteries. 3  The fatty material mixes with calcium, scar tissues, and other substances and hardens slightly, forming plaques of arteriosclerosis. Risk factors for peripheral vascular disease (and atherosclerotic disease of all arteries throughout the body): 1  Positive family history of premature heart attacks or strokes. 2  Older than 50 years. 3  Overweight or obesity. 4  Inactive (sedentary) lifestyle. 5  Smoking. 6  Diabetes. 7  High blood pressure.
Peripheral vascular diseases (PVDs) are circulation disorders that affect blood vessels outside of the heart and brain. PVD typically strikes the veins and arteries that supply the arms, legs, and organs located below your stomach. These are the blood vessels that are distant from the heart. They are known as peripheral vessels. In PVD, blood vessels are narrowed. Narrowing is usually caused by arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up inside a vessel. It is also called “hardening of the arteries.” Plaque decreases the amount of blood and oxygen supplied to the arms and legs
