Back in March 2010, I wrote a post called Beware of “Who Viewed My Profile” Apps on Facebook. It’s still one of my top five viewed posts, with more than 4,400 page views in the past month alone. So it’s obviously a topic of great interest to people.
No. Facebook doesn't let you track who views your profile or your posts (ex: your photos). Third-party apps are also unable to do this. If you come across an app that says it can show you who's viewing your profile or posts, please report the app. More info. Get help for mobile apps and browsers.
I've been told by a few of my fb friends to I could check who has been looking at my profile. But now your telling me NO I CAN'T. My question to you is why the xxxx not. With the crazy ppl out there. I'm only on Facebook because I have grandkids and framily all over this planet.
Technically, you can track which IP addresses have viewed your page. But to track specific people is against the site's rules. Though there is software that can be used, using it is against the site's rules. So currently, there is no way to track who views your Facebook profile without breaking Facebook's rules.
Someone told me that you could see who has viewed your profile page, I haven't heard of this before and I was wondering there was an option that you could do that?
Bad news, I'm afraid. There is *no* way that you can find out who has been looking at your Facebook profile. The only people who might have the data is Facebook itself, and it doesn't seem interested in providing the functionality.
If you block your ex, he can’t see your Facebook profile. However, he can see if you comment on other people’s posts if you’re mutual friends. Also, if someone tags you in a post or shares one of yours, he might be able to see it. But he won’t be able to go to your Timeline and see what you’ve posted directly.
