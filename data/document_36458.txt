Best Answer: I'm not sure what you mean by 'animal care assistant'. I used to be a zookeeper, and that's a minimum-wage or at least low-paid job (at least it is in the UK, where I live-you don't say where in the world you are, but things might be different in another country). I am looking forward being an animal care assistant at the zoo. And I want to know how much do they get paid each hour. Add your answer. Source. Submit Cancel.

The median annual wage for nonfarm animal caretakers was $19,690 in May 2012. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $16,490, and the top 10 percent earned more than $32,500. The median annual wage for animal trainers was $25,270 in May 2012. Overall employment of animal care and service workers is projected to grow 15 percent from 2012 to 2022, faster than the average for all occupations. Employment growth coupled with high job turnover should result in very good job opportunities for candidates for most positions.
