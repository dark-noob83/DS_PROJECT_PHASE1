The Range of the Indian And Asian Elephants-Indian elephants are found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, while the Asian elephant's habitat extends across Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Malaysian peninsula, Borneo, and into China.
Size: Asian elephants live in large blocks of forest near water sources and grasslands, habitat that has been greatly reduced in the last half century. They inhabit India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Bangladesh, and southern China.
Elephant Natural Habitat. Elephants are able to survive in a variety of different locations because of the huge variety of food sources that they consume. Many people assume that elephants that are in the wild only live in the grasslands.
When elephants can freely roam though in their natural habitat they actually do lots of good for the environment. They clear away trees and plants so that new forms of vegetation can grow there. It is due to humans clearing away their natural habitat though that they are struggling out there in the wild.
