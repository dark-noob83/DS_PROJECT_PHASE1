lardon. n. 1. (Cookery) a strip or cube of fat or bacon used in larding meat. [C15: from Old French, from lard]. (ˈlɑr dn).
Lardon, also called lardoon, larding needle or larding, is a small strip or cube of pork fat (usually subcutaneous fat) used in a wide variety of cuisines to flavor savory foods and salads. In French cuisine, lardons are also used for larding, by threading them with a needle into meats that are to be braised or roasted.
You won't believe these 10 facts about people. A lardon is a cube of meat which is usually high in fat and used to add flavor to many dishes. Generally, bacon is used to make lardons, but general pork lardons are also common. When cooked, a lardon will reduce in size as a result of the fat melting out of it.
Narrow strips of fat used to lard meats and used to flavor dishes such as quiches or salads or rendered with onion as a base for soup of pasta sauces. The French also use the term lardon to refer to bacon that has been diced, blanched and fried. Plural: Lardons. Season: available year-round.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines lardon as one of the pieces of bacon or pork which are inserted in meat in the process of larding, giving primacy to that process.
