Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a rare, inherited disease in which the light-sensitive retina of the eye slowly and progressively degenerates. Eventually, blindness results.
Retinitis pigmentosa is the leading cause of inherited retinal degeneration-associated blindness. The disease process begins with changes in pigment and damage to the small arteries and blood vessels that supply the retina. There may be atrophy or damage to the optic nerve as well.
Retinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease in which there is damage to the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye that converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain.

What Is Retinitis Pigmentosa. Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) refers to a group of diseases which cause a slow but progressive vision loss. In each of them there is a gradual loss of the light-sensitive retinal cells called rods and cones. Most forms of RP are inherited or genetic, though its signs do not necessarily appear in every generation.
