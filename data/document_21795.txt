(Yahoo! file photo). UPDATE (4 November, 740am) The taxi driver who claimed to be earning $7,000 a month is reportedly singing a different tune. According to The Straits Times, the cabby said on Saturday that he only made that much in May, and typically his earnings range from $4,000 to $5,000 a month. For example, he said, driving for eight hours a night on a good day, he can take home about $158 after fuel and rental. In a month of 25 days of work, his income can come to about $3,000. Even if a driver does two shifts of 16 hours, he would get about $5,400.
With the Taxi fare increase i am considering ditching my job to drive cab again.... I have done my sum... be a OMO .. rent from SMRT ...then I will zoom in on peak hours will drive from 7 am to 1 pm then go home rest then 5 pm to 11 pm drive 6 hours a day ... I think make about $100 a day no problem ba .. rent from SMRT cos rate is $78 per day or maybe smart also 70 ++ drive for about 25 days a month the rest of days will rest or just recover rental need to drive for at least 6 hours also unless can get someone to take over !!
One more thing-do not get into an accident. If I am right, taxi driver also do not have to pay tax. cancer81 wrote: oh one more thing to add... normally taxi drivers who earn that much also drive on weekends. which kinda makes it a 24/7 job. the going rate for rent is like 140 a day (you pay in advance). Fuel you can get it cheaper at the depot (less than a dollar iirc). if you like make a profit of more than 200 dollars a day for 30 days...

For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Taxi Driver in the United States is $33,065 so 50% of the people who perform the job of Taxi Driver in the United States are expected to make less than $33,065. Source: HR Reported data as of October 2015. Median $33,065. 
Depends how they are willing to work. Some taxi driver drive like cannot see passengers waving for taxi then will earn lesser.

He shared about a fellow taxi driver who had just started out three months ago, and while that cabby does earn $6,000 a month, he drives from 7:30am to 2:30am, six days a week.

1. I was told by someone who drove a Taxi that you can earn between $150 (day shift) to $230 (night shift) a day after paying the Taxi rental & fuel these days.2. So if we base on the average taking of $190 per day X 30 days, you get $5700 monthly. If base on $230 daily, you will get $6900 monthly.3. 1.
