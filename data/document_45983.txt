n. 1. (General Physics) the electrical property of a material that determines the resistance of a piece of given dimensions. It is equal to RA/l, where R is the resistance, A the cross-sectional area, and l the length, and is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is measured in ohms.
The electrical resistance of a circuit component or device is defined as the ratio of the voltage applied to the electric current whichflows through it: Whether or not a material obeys Ohm's law, its resistance can be described in terms of its bulk resistivity.
Electrical conductivity or specific conductance is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity, and measures a material's ability to conduct an electric current.
Definition of RESISTIVITY. 1. : the longitudinal electrical resistance of a uniform rod of unit length and unit cross-sectional area: the reciprocal of conductivity. 2. : capacity for resisting: resistance. ADVERTISEMENT.

Resistivity Calculation. The electrical resistance of a wire would be expected to be greater for a longer wire, less for a wire of larger cross sectional area, and would be expected to depend upon the material out of which the wire is made (resistivity).
Electrical resistivity (also known as resistivity, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is an intrinsic property that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the flow of electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows the movement of electric charge.
