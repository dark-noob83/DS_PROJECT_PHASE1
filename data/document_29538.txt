Coastal Landforms (Features of Erosion). Land forms on the coast are created or formed as a result of wave processes such as corrasion/abrasion, hydraulic, solution and attrition. These processes erode the coast and the material is transported and deposited along the coastline.
Coastal Features. Wave action leads to the formation of many features along the coast. Some of these coastal features are formed as a result of erosion by waves whereas others are formed by the deposition of material along the coast by waves. Let us examine these coastal features in turn.
Shorelines constantly change due to the pounding of waves that erode coastal structures. Learn about shoreline features that are formed through coastal erosion, such as wave-cut cliffs, wave-cut platforms, sea arches and sea stacks.
One of the shoreline features that is created by erosion is a wave-cut cliff, which is a steep rock face created by the eroding action of waves. As waves continue to hit the cliff, it retreats farther inland, leaving behind a wave-cut platform, which is a somewhat flat area found at the base of a wave-cut cliff.
1 Cliffs are formed when destructive waves attack the bottom of the rock face between high and low water mark. 2  The area under attack is eroded using the major processes of coastal erosion. 3  Points of weakness, such as faults and joints are attacked most, and eventually a wave-cut notch is gouged out.
