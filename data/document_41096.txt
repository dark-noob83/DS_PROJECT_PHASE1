Supplement. In the Operon Model, the promoter is the gene segment that serves as the initiation site where RNA polymerase binds to and initiates the transcription of certain genes. Conversely, in the presence of a repressor protein, this segment binds with the repressor.

a class of enhancers which are gene-specific sequences that increase transcription. promoter region. the non-coding nucleotide sequence at the transcription start region that is characterized by the presence of a number of conserved or consequence sequences.
Promoter sequences are DNA sequences that define where transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase begins. Promoter sequences are typically located directly upstream or at the 5' end of the transcription initiation site. RNA polymerase and the necessary transcription factors bind to the promoter sequence and initiate transcription. Promoter sequences define the direction of transcription and indicate which DNA strand will be transcribed; this strand is known as the sense strand.
The promoter region of DNA is found upstream of a particular gene that codes for whichever protein the cell is trying to produce. The promoter allows an enzyme called RNA Polymerase to attach to the DNA and begin to synthesize RNA, which in turn goes on to code for a protein.
