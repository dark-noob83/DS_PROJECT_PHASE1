The degree of a polynomial is a very straightforward concept that is really not hard to understand. Definition: The degree is the term with the greatest exponent. Recall that for y 2, y is the base and 2 is the exponent. Example #1 : 4x 2 + 6x + 5. This polynomial has three terms.
The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its terms when the polynomial is expressed in its canonical form consisting of a linear combination of monomials. The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of the variables that appear in it.
Degree of Polynomial. The degree is the value of the greatest exponent of any expression (except the constant) in the polynomial. To find the degree all that you have to do is find the largest exponent in the polynomial. Note: Ignore coefficients -- coefficients have nothing to do with the degree of a
Description. degree(p) returns the total degree of the polynomial p. degree(p, x) returns the degree of p with respect to the variable x. If the first argument f is not element of a polynomial domain, then degree converts the expression internally to a polynomial of type DOM_POLY via poly (f) .
To determine the degree of a polynomial that is not in standard form (for example), one has to put it first in standard form by expanding the products (by distributivity) and combining the like terms; for example is of degree 1, even though each summand has degree 2.
In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.
For example, the polynomial has three terms. (Notice, this polynomial can also be expressed as .) The first term has a degree of 5 (the sum of the powers 2 and 3), the second term has a degree of 1, and the last term has a degree of 0. Therefore, the polynomial has a degree of 5 which is the highest degree of any term.
