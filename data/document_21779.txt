Wave Speed. A wave is defined as a disturbance which is moved medium; for example, the wave of the ocean moves in medium water and we can see the movement of wave crest from one side to the other side in a given time period. The motion of objects is described in terms of speed which shows the fastness of the object. 1. Group Velocity: It is the velocity with which the amplitude of the wave travels in the medium. It is given by the formula; $V_{G}$=$\frac{d\omega}{dk}$. So, it can also be defined as the rate of change of the angular frequency of the wave with respect to the angular wave number of the wave.
A wave can be transverse or longitudinal. Transverse waves occur when a disturbance creates oscillations that are perpendicular to the propagation of energy transfer. Longitudinal waves occur when the oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy propagation. In other words, the velocity of the constituent waves of the wave packet travel at a rate that varies with their wavelength, so some move faster than others, and they cannot maintain the same interference pattern as the wave propagates.
The wave propagation speed is the speed by which the wavefront of the wave passes through a medium. The wavefront is the locus of the same phase point in the wave. It is also known as Velocity factor (VF) . The velocity factor has different equation for different medium. 1. Group Velocity: It is the velocity with which the amplitude of the wave travels in the medium. It is given by the formula; $V_{G}$=$\frac{d\omega}{dk}$. So, it can also be defined as the rate of change of the angular frequency of the wave with respect to the angular wave number of the wave.
In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through space or mass. Frequency refers to the addition of time. Wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, which may or may not displace particles of the medium â€”that is, with little or no associated mass transport. In other words, the velocity of the constituent waves of the wave packet travel at a rate that varies with their wavelength, so some move faster than others, and they cannot maintain the same interference pattern as the wave propagates.
A wave can be described as a disturbance that travels through a medium from one location to another location. Consider a slinky wave as an example of a wave. When the slinky is stretched from end to end and is held at rest, it assumes a natural position known as the equilibrium or rest position. And in the case of the stadium wave, the medium through which the stadium wave travels is the fans that are in the stadium. Particle-to-Particle Interaction. To fully understand the nature of a wave, it is important to consider the medium as a collection of interacting particles.
The Speed of a Wave. A wave is a disturbance that moves along a medium from one end to the other. If one watches an ocean wave moving along the medium (the ocean water), one can observe that the crest of the wave is moving from one location to another over a given interval of time. The speed of wave B must be ________ the speed of wave A. a. one-ninth b. one-third c. the same as d. three times larger than See Answer Answer: C The medium is the same for both of these waves (the same container of nitrogen gas).
In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain. 
wave speed. English Collins Dictionary-English Definition & Thesaurus &nbsp. phase speed, velocity n (Physics) the speed at which the phase of a wave is propagated, the product of the frequency times the wavelength. This is the quantity that is determined by methods using interference
In the case of a wave, the speed is the distance traveled by a given point on the wave (such as a crest) in a given interval of time. In equation form, If the crest of an ocean wave moves a distance of 20 meters in 10 seconds, then the speed of the ocean wave is 2.0 m/s. On the other hand, if the crest of an ocean wave moves a distance of 25 meters in 10 seconds (the same amount of time), then the speed of this ocean wave is 2.5 m/s. The faster wave travels a greater distance in the same amount of time. The speed of wave B must be ________ the speed of wave A. a. one-ninth b. one-third c. the same as d. three times larger than See Answer Answer: C The medium is the same for both of these waves (the same container of nitrogen gas).
