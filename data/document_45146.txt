IVIG is an expensive therapy and ultimately, insurers and hospitals question the use of this drug for desensitization. Is it cost-effective? Data do exist in this regard Currently, a four dose course of IVIG for a 70 kg person at 2 g/kg would cost $25 000-$26 000. However, one must compare this to the cost of maintaining patients on dialysis, which is the only other option. In the IGO2 study, the calculated cost savings was ~$300 000/patient transplanted versus those who remained on dialysis for the 5 years of the study. There were more than 300 infusions in each arm of the study using Gamimune N 10% versus placebo. Adverse events were similar in both arms of the study (24 IVIG vs. 23 placebo). The most common adverse event in the IVIG arm was headache (52% vs. 24%, p = 0.056).
1 A single IVIG infusion costs approximately $3,000 for a child and 10,000 for an adult. 2  The cost of IVIG is low for children because only a few grams are used. 3  A BioRx.net brochure states that the cost of IVIG is generally estimated to be about $100 per gram to administer. 1 According to an article at KevinMD.com, the cost of giving IVIG to a patient once every 2 weeks is estimated at $2,000 to $5,000.
As shown, the total cost for the IVIG treatment arm over the 5 year duration of the model is estimated to be $124,065. This compares with $2,196 for the corticosteroid treatment arm, resulting in an incremental cost of IVIG compared to corticosteroids of $121,869. Over 5 years, IVIG was estimated to have 3.962 QALYs compared to 3.785 for corticosteroids. A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a Markov model to compare IVIG to corticosteroids for the treatment of CIDP. The population entering the model are assumed to be 54 years of age and weighing 75 kg.
1 A BioRx.net brochure states that the cost of IVIG is generally estimated to be about $100 per gram to administer. 2  Depending on the dose, a course of IVIG therapy can cost between $1,500 and $15,000 per month. 1 According to an article at KevinMD.com, the cost of giving IVIG to a patient once every 2 weeks is estimated at $2,000 to $5,000.
Why is IVIG so expensive? IVIg is obtained from plasma, donors are paid then the plasma is sent to a processing centers for mixing, antibody removal, chemical treatment and filtration to remove viruses. This is followed by the products to be freeze dried. All this ends up for IVIG to be priced at $ 48 to $ 68 a gram. A single IVIg infusion costs about $3000 for a child and 10,000 for an adult. For a child the cost of IVIg is low because only a few grams are used. The price of IVIg in India is $25 a gram. In Pakistan IVIg costs 20 a gram. IVIg can be bought from China at 45-10 A Gram. In USA a sucrose IVIg can be bought for $60 and non Sucrose IVIG for $70 with all supplies and nurse.
They are also assumed to receive 1 g/kg maintenance doses at weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12, resulting in a total cost of $27,307.50 for the initial model cycle. In subsequent twelve week cycles, patients are assumed to have four 1 g/kg IVIG maintenance treatments, resulting in IVIG costs of $18,205. A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a Markov model to compare IVIG to corticosteroids for the treatment of CIDP. The population entering the model are assumed to be 54 years of age and weighing 75 kg.
Over the 5 year time horizon, the model estimated the incremental costs and QALYs of IVIG treatment compared to corticosteroid treatment to be $124,065 and 0.177 respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained of IVIG was estimated to be $687,287. A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a Markov model to compare IVIG to corticosteroids for the treatment of CIDP. The population entering the model are assumed to be 54 years of age and weighing 75 kg.
1 The cost IVIG, according to CIDPUSA Foundation, a foundation dedicated to autoimmune and neuromuscular diseases, is $48 to $68 a gram. 2  A single IVIG infusion costs approximately $3,000 for a child and 10,000 for an adult. 3  The cost of IVIG is low for children because only a few grams are used. 1 According to an article at KevinMD.com, the cost of giving IVIG to a patient once every 2 weeks is estimated at $2,000 to $5,000.
My first IVIG treatments in 2005 cost $7500 a day which was a ripoff from the clinic I was going to but my insurance paid that. My insurance paid $27,000 for 250grams in an outpatient setting and that was late 2005. In early 2006 my insurance paid the same for 150 grams in a hospital.
