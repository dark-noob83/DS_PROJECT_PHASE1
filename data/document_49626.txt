The Autonomic Nervous System is that part of PNS consisting of motor neurons that control internal organs. It has two subsystems. The autonomic system controls muscles in the heart, the smooth muscle in internal organs such as the intestine, bladder, and uterus. 
The somatic nervous system consists of nerves that go to the skin and muscles and is involved in conscious activities. The autonomic nervous system consists of nerves that connect the CNS to the visceral organs such as the heart, stomach, and intestines. It mediates unconscious activities. Afferent, or sensory, neurons carry impulses from peripheral sense receptors to the CNS. They usually have long dendrites and relatively short axons. Efferent, or motor, neurons transmit impulses from the CNS to effector organs such as muscles and glands.
There are things called neurons that have parts called dendrites and axons. The dendrites of a neuron are branching, tubelike extensions of the cell body that form a pattern resembling the limbs of a tree. For example, the axons that extend from the spinal cord to the muscles in the feet may be 75 to 100 centimetres long. The structures commonly called nerves are actually bundles of axons lying next to one another in a cordlike formation.
Answer by Cowleya. Confidence votes 10.3K. In terms of the nervous system, muscles and glands are given the generic term effector organs. Impulses are picked up from receptors, which then travel to the brain, which sends orders along the motor neurons to these effector organs. 
Organs of the nervous system can be divided into the central nervous system (CNS), made up of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), made up of peripheral nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body. 
The axon, also called the nerve fibre, is a tubelike extension of a neuron cell body. The axon is specialized to carry messages. An axon of one neuron may have enough branches to make contact with as many as 1,000 other neurons. Most axons in the central nervous system are less than 1 millimetre long. For example, the axons that extend from the spinal cord to the muscles in the feet may be 75 to 100 centimetres long. The structures commonly called nerves are actually bundles of axons lying next to one another in a cordlike formation.
The glands are controlled directly by stimulation from the nervous system as well as by chemical receptors in the blood and hormones produced by other glands. By regulating the functions of organs in the body, these glands help to maintain the bodyâ€™s homeostasis.
