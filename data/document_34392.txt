If growing ginseng in the woods, look for walnut trees, poplar trees, cohosh, ferns and Solomon's seal. These plants indicate a favorable environment for ginseng.
Ginseng expert, Bob Beyfuss, explains the best forest types to look for when growing ginseng. While ginseng does not like a lot of nutrients, it does prefer calcium-rich soils. Bob identifies many different plants within the understory that signify whether the site is good for

Used in herbal medicine for thousands of years, high quality ginseng roots still fetch hundreds of dollars per pound, and patient growers can harvest large quantities using the wild-simulated growing method.
Zones 3-8 are appropriate for growing ginseng. Ginseng does not grow in the warmer portions of the US and it requires deciduous forest canopy with 70% to 80% shade to grow. These habitat requirements tend to be the most limiting factors of ginseng horticulture.
Go where the ginseng grows. Ginseng is native to eastern hardwood forests of North America, from southern Canada (Ontario and Quebec), west to South Dakota and Oklahoma, and south to Georgia. 1 Ginseng is also commercially grown outside its natural distribution in Oregon and Washington.
American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a native perennial plant and an important forest crop. It grows on well drained, rich soils under northern hardwoods. Much of New York State has the potential for growing ginseng, and it can be an important source of income for many New Yorkers.
