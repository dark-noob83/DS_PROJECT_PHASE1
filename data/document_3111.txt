AEG or GBB Airsoft guns. For years now, the Airsoft marketplace has been accepting new products that can inspire innovation immediately after viewing the product. In the past few years, we’ve seen the rise of the GBB (Gas Blow Back) rifle, as well as the PolarStar Electro-pneumatic gearbox and rifle collection. As a sport, airsoft thrives and survives off new products and ideas, and these new items will always challenge the accepted principles that are in place today.
Without more clarification, I can only assume that you're talking airsoft. GBB for airsoft stands for Gas BlowBack. I have never seen this term used in relation to firearms. That doesn't mean that it is not. I would assume that the definition would be the same.
