A packet of plain oatmeal contains about 19 grams of carbohydrates and 2.8 grams of fiber, which corresponds to 16.2 grams of net carbs. Net carbs refer to the total carbs minus the fiber -- which is indigestible -- and is the figure you should use when tracking your carb intake on a low-carb diet.
Oatmeal Starch Content. Most of oatmeal, about 84 percent by weight, is made up of water. However, starch is the next major component at 12 percent. Each 1-cup serving of cooked oatmeal contains 27.14 grams of starch. This is about 98 percent of the 28.08 grams of carbohydrate in oatmeal. Oatmeal only contains trace amounts of sugar, as well as 2 percent fat and 3 percent protein by weight.
Granola is a high-carbohydrate, whole-grain snack food and breakfast food. Today the ingredients are typically rolled oats, honey or other sweetener, nuts, and perhaps dried fruits. The mixture is stirred while baking, resulting in a fairly loose consistency.
Like most carbohydrate foods, oatmeal comprises some of all three types of carbohydrates -- starch, fiber and sugar -- so it is both a starch-and a fiber-containing food. Starch is a type of complex carbohydrate, since it is made up of a number of sugar molecules bound together.
Oatmeal does not turn into starch, because it is already mostly starch. In a serving of 1/2 cup of dry old-fashioned oats, 22 g of the 27 g of total carbohydrates are starches. Starches correspond to a chain of glucose, or sugar, linked together.
Tips for Carbohydrate Counters Starchy foods are one of the main sources of carbohydrate in our diet—along with milk, fruits, and sweets. For most grains and starches, ½ cup or 1 oz contains 15 g of carbohydrate. A few exceptions are 1 cup of winter squash and pumpkin and ⅓ cup of rice has about 15 grams.
