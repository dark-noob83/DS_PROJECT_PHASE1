Normal blood levels of DHEA-sulfate can differ by sex and age. Typical normal ranges for females are: 1  Ages 18 - 19: 145 - 395 micrograms per deciliter (ug/dL). 2  Ages 20 - 29: 65 - 380 ug/dL. 3  Ages 30 - 39: 45 - 270 ug/dL. 4  Ages 40 - 49: 32 - 240 ug/dL. 5  Ages 50 - 59: 26 - 200 ug/dL. 6  Ages 60 - 69: 13 - 130 ug/dL.

DHEA levels begin to naturally decline by the age of 30. While normal levels for women in their 20s fall between 65 and 380 µg/dL, for women in their 30s and 40s, the average normal range is 45 to 270 and 32 to 240 µg/dL, respectively.
According to the National Institutes of Health, normal blood levels of DHEA depend on age, and within each age group there is a significant range. For women, DHEA levels tend to peak during late adolescence, when the normal blood concentration ranges from 145 to 395 micrograms per deciliter.
4. DHEA. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, is a precursor to the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone. Blood levels of DHEA peak in one’s twenties and then decline dramatically with age, decreasing to 20-30% of peak youthful levels between the ages of 70 and 80.
