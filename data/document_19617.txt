Let’s start with an example: Say at age 55 you could begin a pension paying $700 per month, or at age 62, $1,303 per month, or you could begin receiving $1,737 per month if you wait to age 65 to begin collecting. For the purpose of simplicity, the example will not factor in taxes or any cost-of-living adjustments. The question comes up often: I’m ready to retire at age 55, and I can begin collecting my pension right away.
The earliest date you can take your pension is aged 55. A male with a fund worth around £100,000 at age 55 would receive a pension of around £5,352 a year for the rest of his life. If he lives to 85, the total paid out would be £160,560 gross. The pension is subject to tax. Even if you lived to be 100, you would still benefit by taking your pension sooner rather than later. In either case the pension saver can take 25% of their fund as an initial lump sum free of tax, but the pensions paid would reduce by 25%.
At age 70, your first option is still ahead of the other two. So, if you were to die before age 71, the first option, collecting at age 55, works the best, because you would have collected a total of $126,000 by that point, versus $125,095 for the age 62 option and only $104,225 with the age 65 option. The question comes up often: I’m ready to retire at age 55, and I can begin collecting my pension right away.
You will be able to choose to have your pension paid at any time from age 55 to age 75. You can choose to take your pension earlier than your Normal Pension Age, anytime from age 55, but if you do, it will be reduced as it’s being paid earlier. If you take it later than your Normal Pension Age it is increased because it is being paid later.
Not until you reach retirement age. Typically that's 65, though many pension plans allow you to start collecting early retirement benefits as early as age 55. If you decide to start receiving benefits before you reach full retirement age, the size of your monthly payout will be less than it would have been if you'd waited. 
Hold off until you are age 70 and your benefit will be 25% to 30% more than the payout you would have received at full retirement age. So the difference between taking early retirement and waiting until you are 70 can be a benefit that is more than 50% higher. 
Well, during the time that you’re not taking your pension payments, your employer has control over the money in the pension fund, and they’ve got it invested, so it’s growing over that 7 or 10 years (between age 55 and either 62 or 65). The question comes up often: I’m ready to retire at age 55, and I can begin collecting my pension right away.
The amount also varies according to your age when you begin receiving your pension. You can start receiving a retirement pension as early as age 60, but the amount will be lower than if you wait until you reach normal retirement age, that is, age 65. If you stop working earlier, you will have to wait until you turn 60 to start receiving it. 
You can start taking your CPP retirement pension at any age between 60 and 70. (You can start taking it after age 70, but there would be no reason to do that, and you would lose benefits.). If you start taking your pension the month after you turn 65 years of age, you will get 100% of your benefit. If you start taking your pension before that age, it is reduced; after that age, it is increased. For example, in 2015, if you start taking your pension at age 60, it will be reduced by 34.8%. If you start taking it at age 70, it will be increased by 42%
Taking money from your pension. Whether you have a defined benefit or defined contribution pension scheme, you can normally start taking money from the age of 55. You could use this to help top up your salary if you are still working, to enable you to work fewer hours or to retire early. There are also some circumstances when you may be able to take money from your pension even earlier than 55, such as if you’re in poor health or in a profession where retirement is lower than normal, for example a professional athlete or if you have a protected pension age lower than 55.
