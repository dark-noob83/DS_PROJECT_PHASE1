You are only charged a small marketing fee or no fee. The buyer pays the agent's fee on completion of the sale.

Best Answer: I'm a social housing officer, working in local authority housing.

dont do it. i live in private rented because i couldnt get a council place. the council will never give you all the rent towrads the house so you will have to pay some yourself. (i have to pay 200 a month myself from my benefits) and then when your husband does go back to work they will only make you pay more yourself. It isn't up to the council to house you adequately just because you keep having more children. Because we've always wanted a large family and don't see why the size of the house should stop us. My last baby was not exactly planned but i'm keeping the baby as i don't do abortions.
