As a combination of Virgo and Scorpio, Vesta is a prognosticator of devotion on one hand and fanaticism on the other.

The primary asteroids that are used in a birth chart include Ceres, Juno, Pallas Athena and Vesta. Another cometary body that is large enough to be used in birth charts is Chiron, which is found between Saturn and Uranus. The asteroids were all named after the female family of Jupiter. Ceres his sister, Juno his wife, Pallas Athena his daughter and Vesta another sister. Much of the feminine is left out of astrology aside from Venus and the Moon. The asteroids help add the feminine back into the astrological chart.
