1 Calcium Ion• Participate in several reaction that lead to the formation of fibrin during blood clotting process.• About 47% of the calcium in the blood plasma is free, and 53% occurs in a complex form.• The level of total Calcium in the blood is normally 8.5-10.5 mg/dL. 2  16.
Macro-minerals Calcium(Ca) Needed for bone and tooth formation; heart function and blood coagulation; muscle contraction. Dark leafy vegetables, sesame seeds, oats, navy beans, almonds, millet, sunflower seeds, canned sardines/salmon. Phosphorous(P) Works together with calcium and must be balanced to be effective.
Calcium is a very important vitamin involved in blood clotting because calcium ions are used in the thrombin. The thrombin is a product of prothrombin, calcium ions and thromb … oplastin. When thrombin is added with fibrinogen (which is inactive) it creates fibrin, which forms the clot.
Function in biology. Minerals help in bone and tooth formation, blood coagulation and muscle contraction. Vitamins release energy from the food, develop red blood cells, help in blood clotting and help in maintaining healthy skin, eye, and hair. Nutritional requirement for the human body. Only some minerals are required by the human body for nutrition.
