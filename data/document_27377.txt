However, what most humans do not realize is to a dog, a hug is not affection at all. To a dog, a hug symbolizes a social status ranking as dominance and an invasion of space—lower members of the pack give space to the higher members to show respect. The position of the body is also meaningful to a dog. A stranger runs over, asserting dominance on a dog they have just met and the dog's reaction is to communicate to this being that they do not wish to be dominated.

The normal body temperature for a dog falls within the range of 100°F to 102.5°F (about 38°C to 39.2°C). If your dog's temperature is outside of this range, you should contact your veterinarian. Body temperature over 104°F or under 99°F indicates an emergency situation. In general, the most accurate way to measure a dog's body temperature is rectally. However, some ear thermometers made especially for dog's ears can be considered somewhat accurate. In a pinch, temperature can be measured in the axillary region (underarm) and one degree can be added to the final reading. Be aware that this measurement is approximate and NOT considered very reliable.

Not even the owner can always predict what the dog's reaction will be. The proper way to greet a dog is to turn your body sideways, no eye-to-eye contact, and allow the dog to smell you.
