Find the radius and diameter of the circle. radius = __________ diameter = __________4. The circumference of a circle is 592 mm. Find the radius and diameter of the circle. Round answers to the hundredths. radius = __________ diameter = __________5
So we can write the formula for the circumference of a circle as: C = π d. However, the diameter is equal to 2 × radius, (2r), so we can also write this formula as: C = 2 π r. It does not matter which of these formulae you use. But you must be careful to use the correct length for the formula (the radius or diameter). 
Leave your answers in terms of pi. 1. 2. 3. Area = Circumference = Area = Circumference = Area = Circumference = Directions: Find the Sector Area of the shaded part and Length of the Arc defined by the radii and the central angle given. Give your answer in terms of and a simplified fraction. 
Diameter: Circumference: All about Circles-Tutorial. The distance all around a circle is called the Circumference and is referred to in formulas as C. The distance from one side of the circle to the other is referred to as the Diameter of a circle and is identified as a d in formulas. The Radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to the outside edge. Thus the diameter of the circle is twice the size of the radius of a circle. The Area of a circle refers to the number of square units within the circle. If you know the area, diameter or the circumference, you will be able to use this tool to determine the missing value
Find the area of a circle with a radius of 3.25 in. 9. Round to the nearest tenth. Find the area of a circle with a diameter of 6.8 meters. D. 18.5. 2. Round to the nearest tenth. Find the circumference of a circle with a radius of 51.25 inches. 3. Round to the nearest tenth. Find the circumference of a circle with a radius of 30.9 centimeters.
Using the Equation with the Radius. Let's see the two ways we can use the equation of the circumference using the radius. The first way is if we are asked to find the circumference given the radius of the circle. For example, our problem has given us a radius of 6 inches. We will use the equation for the circumference using the radius. We will plug in our radius of 6 inches into the r variable. We will also replace the pi with 3.14.
