If you own a dog that is always active, it can really wear you down. There certainly is, but it's very uncommon. Hyperactivity in dogs is a genuine medical condition which is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion: every other possible cause of your dog's symptoms needs to be eliminated before you can say your dog is hyperactive. Many people confuse the term hyperactive with overactive.
As awareness of ADHD increases in children, I’m sometimes asked if dogs can suffering from the same attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. There are rare cases when evidence does seem to support a diagnosis of canine ADHD. However many common conditions can be confused with combined hyperactivity and lack of attention. For it to be a case of 'Dog ADHD', both attention deficit and hyperactivity must be present at the same time. Here are a few examples of dog behaviours that aren't strictly speaking ADHD but might well seem to be. For a dog with ADHD, these parameters are reduced.

Dealing with Canine Hyperactivity. With worldwide recognition of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD) in children, many people are now wondering whether their overly boisterous, easily distractible dogs are suffering from a similar disorder. If your veterinarian tells you that hyperactivity in dogs is commonplace, he or she may be confusing ADHD with over-activity or hyper-reactivity, which are different. Some of the conditions that can be confused with hyperactivity include:
ADHD is in fact extremely rare in dogs. In most cases, a dog that appears to be hyperactive is actually bored, attention seeking or anxious. Many first (or even second) time owners don’t realize that dogs are clever animals that need something to do with their brain, and a way to use up their often boundless energy. 1.

Yes, they can. It is sometimes mistaken as being crazy, or being too rambunctious and dogs have been given away because of this misunderstanding. Medication can be given to at least lessen this behavior and calm the dogs down. Some breeds, however, such as Border Collies, are naturally hyper. These dogs simply need lots of exercise
Hyperactivity Is Not Always ADHD. Dogs can indeed have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but the condition is highly uncommon in them. When pets become hyperactive, there often is an underlying cause that, if fixed, can reverse the problem. For example, hyperactivity is a symptom of an overactive thyroid. Meanwhile, dogs who don't get enough attention or physical exercise frequently resort to boisterous behaviors that can appear to be hyperactivity. Some dogs act hyperactive because doing so has gotten them desired acknowledgement from humans in the past. Typical Signs of Canine ADHD. If your dog gets plenty of interaction with humans, receives enough exercise and isn't nervous or anxious about something, then hyperactive behavior could possibly indicate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
