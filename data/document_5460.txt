Agate is a type of chalcedony quartz that forms by filling a cavity in a rock. When extracted, the layers that have formed resemble that of tree rings. Varieties of agate are formed by the differences in shape and color of these bands.
Agate is the name given to a group of silicate minerals that are made up primarily of chalcedony. Chalcedony is a member of the quartz family of minerals.
Agate is the banded form of the mineral Chalcedony, which is a microcrystalline variety of Quartz. Agate is the most varied and popular type of Chalcedony, having many varieties on its own.
Agate is a variety of chalcedony formed from layers of quartz which usually show varicolored bands. It usually occurs as rounded nodules or veins. Often tiny quartz crystals form within the stone and add to the beauty and uniqueness of individual stones.
Agate is a banded microcrystalline form of the mineral Quartz, and does not occur in visible crystals. It occurs in nodules, in massive form, as botryoidal, mammilary, and stalactitic formations, as smooth rounded pebbles, as amygdules, and as the linings of geodes.
Agate is a common semiprecious silica mineral that has long been used as a gem and ornamental. Agate is the most common variety of chalcedony which is a form of quartz. Agate is, in fact, identical with quartz in composition and physical properties.
