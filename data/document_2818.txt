1 Wash and dry the hydrometer. 2  Repeat step 6 for bottles with the sugar solutions, and then the sodas. 3  Now it’s time to analyze your data. 4  Using the sugar solutions as guides, calculate how many grams of sugar are in each soda and what the percentage of sugar is for each soda.
If the jar weighs 7 ounces, add 7 to the amount of sugar in the can of soda: 7 + 35 = 42. Spoon sugar one teaspoon at a time into the glass jar until the scale reads 42 ounces. Take a good look at how much sugar is in the glass jar. Pour the same amount of water into the measuring cup as there was soda earlier.
How much sugar in soda? By Marshall Brain http://youtube.com/watch?v=F10EyGwd57M http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2156528875761294002 In the video, we looked at a can of soda and we measured out how much sugar there is in the can. For example, the can of soda in the video contained 39 grams of sugar.
Not every sugar packet is the same size, but almost all of the sugar packets you'll see in the United States contain 4 grams of sugar. And those 4 grams of sugar have 15 calories. That means there's 10 packets of sugar in a can of soda. And at 15 calories per packet, that means that all 150 calories are from the sugar.
So how much sugar is there really in that can of Coke or Pepsi you’re drinking? Probably a lot. Watch this science experiment video and see a few different ways you can find out the amount of sugar you’re drinking in your soda or fruit juice. The answers might surprise you, luckily there’s always water as an alternative.
