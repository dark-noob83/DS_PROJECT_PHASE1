Dubbed ''the French medical solution to permanent weight loss'', the Dukan diet is the ultimate in prescriptive eating, with just 72 foods to choose from in the first phase. Carbs are the enemy, even if they come dressed as fruit and veg.
You can do it if you follow the Dukan Diet's rules, claims French general practitioner and nutritionist Pierre Dukan, who created the diet in 2000. Lean protein, oat bran, water, and a daily 20-minute walk are at the heart of the plan. The theory is that limiting carbohydrates forces your body to burn fat.
The Dukan diet was designed by Dr. Pierre Dukan, a nutritionist and eating behavior specialist having 35 years of experience in clinical nutrition. The Dukan diet is very similar to the system of HyperProtein. This diet offers a 4-bit phase protein and calorie and has the advantage of reducing the appetite.
Every plan has to start somewhere, and the Dukan Diet kicks off with the Attack Phase. It lasts 5-10 days depending on your current weight and progress-you might want to refer to the official true weight calculator for a more accurate estimate that's specifically tailor made for you.
The Dukan Diet is a protein based nutritional approach designed by Pierre Dukan, a French nutritionist and dietician. The Dukan Diet, or Dukan method proposes a healthy eating plan which is based on how primitive man used to eat when we were hunter-gatherers. It includes 100 foods, of which 72 are animal sourced and 28 come from plants. And you can eat as much as you like, as long as you stick to those 100 foods.
The Dukan diet is a low-calorie and high-protein diet developed by Pierre Dukan, a French doctor who had vast experience helping obese people lose weight. The diet has been popular in France for several years already and is now getting worldwide acceptance.
