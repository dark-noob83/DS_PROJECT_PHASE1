The diffraction grating is an immensely useful tool for the separation of the spectral lines associated with atomic transitions. It acts as a super prism, separating the different colors of light much more than the dispersion effect in a prism. When light of a single wavelength, like the 632.8nm red light from a helium-neon laser at left, strikes a diffraction grating it is diffracted to each side in multiple orders. Orders 1 and 2 are shown to each side of the direct beam.
Diffraction Grating is optical device used to learn the different wavelengths or colors contained in a beam of light. The device usually consists of thousands of narrow, closely spaced parallel slits (or grooves). The intensity of the diffraction fringes at screen behind the grating 10/1 is rather small because of small width of slits in this grating. For Row 4 the period of all gratings is the same and equal to 10 pixel, while the widths of the slits are different and equal to 1 - 5 pixels.
When the spacing between lines on a diffraction grating is similar in size to the wavelength of light, an incident collimated and coherent light beam will be strongly diffracted upon encountering the grating. Upon passing through the line grating, the light beam is diffracted into a bright central band (zeroth-order) on the detector screen, flanked by several higher-order (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) diffraction bands or maxima.
Diffraction Grating. A diffraction grating is the tool of choice for separating the colors in incident light. The condition for maximum intensity is the same as that for a double slit. However, angular separation of the maxima is generally much greater because the slit spacing is so small for a diffraction grating. Displacement y = (Order m x Wavelength x Distance D)/(slit separation d).
A large number of parallel, closely spaced slits constitutes a diffraction grating. The condition for maximum intensity is the same as that for the double slit or multiple slits, but with a large number of slits the intensity maximum is very sharp and narrow, providing the high resolution for spectroscopic applications. When light of a single wavelength, like the 632.8nm red light from a helium-neon laser at left, strikes a diffraction grating it is diffracted to each side in multiple orders. Orders 1 and 2 are shown to each side of the direct beam.
Diffraction Grating. When there is a need to separate light of different wavelengths with high resolution, then a diffraction grating is most often the tool of choice. This super prism aspect of the diffraction grating leads to application for measuring atomic spectra in both laboratory instruments and telescopes. When light of a single wavelength, like the 632.8nm red light from a helium-neon laser at left, strikes a diffraction grating it is diffracted to each side in multiple orders. Orders 1 and 2 are shown to each side of the direct beam.
In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described as the interference of waves according to the Huygensâ€“Fresnel principle. These characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as visible light, X-rays and radio waves.
A diffraction grating is a optical material or device that is usually designed to break up white light into the various colors of the visible spectrum. Blaze angles are used to concentrate a diffraction grating output on a certain band region of the light spectrum. This is done to obtain a maximum resolution in a particular band of light known as the Blaze wavelength.

In optics, a diffraction grating is an optical component with a periodic structure, which splits and diffracts light into several beams travelling in different directions. The emerging coloration is a form of structural coloration. This technique is called blazing. The incident angle and wavelength for which the diffraction is most efficient are often called blazing angle and blazing wavelength. The efficiency of a grating may also depend on the polarization of the incident light.
