The Original Foucault's Pendulum Experiment. To prove that the Earth rotates, Leon Léon foucault carried out the pendulum experiment at The meridian of The Paris observatory In february. 1851
If the Foucault's pendulum is used at 30º south latitude, it will twist by 180º per day and will complete a full rotation in two days. Thus, with the help of a Foucault pendulum, we can conclusively prove that the Earth rotates about its axis.

Here, we shall find out how the Foucault pendulum proves that the earth rotates. However, before that, let's examine a few important concepts in physics, that form the basis of this experiment. In conclusion, the Foucault pendulum is one the simplest and most elegant ways to prove Earth's rotation.
The Foucault Pendulum is named for the French physicist Jean Foucault (pronounced Foo-koh), who first used it in 1851 to demonstrate the rotation of the earth.
The first dynamic demonstration that the Earth rotates was the Foucault pendulum. As the Earth rotates the inertia of a pendulum keeps it in as close to the same plane as it can. This is a consequence of Newton's Laws of Motion. At the poles what happens is simple: The pendulum swings and the Earth rotates underneath.
