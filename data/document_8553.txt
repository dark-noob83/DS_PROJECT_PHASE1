As with humans, advanced years often bring changes in a dog's ability to hear, see and move about easily. Skin condition, appetite and energy levels often degrade with geriatric age, and medical conditions such as cancer, renal failure, arthritis and joint conditions, and other signs of old age may appear. 1 Under this system, a 6-year-old dog would be described as having an age of 6 human years or 40–50 (depending on the breed) dog years. 2  The other common system defines dog years to be the actual calendar years (365 days each) of a dog's life, and human years to be the equivalent age of a human being.

Socialization should begin as soon as you get your puppy and often this means at 7 weeks of age. Puppies naturally accept new people, other species and introduction to new situations during the socialization period which occurs between 7 and 14 to 16 weeks of age. Some training can begin as soon as the puppy can open its eyes and walk. Young puppies have short attention spans but you can expect them to begin to learn simple obedience commands such as “sit,” “down,” and “stay,” as young as 7 to 8 weeks of age. Formal dog training has traditionally been delayed until 6 months of age. Actually, this juvenile stage is a very poor time to start. The dog is learning from every experience and delaying training means missed opportunities for the dog to learn how you would like him to behav
The aging profile of dogs varies according to their adult size (often determined by their breed): smaller dogs often live over 15–16 years, medium and large size dogs typically 10 to 13 years, and some giant dog breeds such as mastiffs, often only 7 to 8 years. 1 Under this system, a 6-year-old dog would be described as having an age of 6 human years or 40–50 (depending on the breed) dog years. 2  The other common system defines dog years to be the actual calendar years (365 days each) of a dog's life, and human years to be the equivalent age of a human being.
Age. As a general rule, dogs mature to full-size around 12 to 18 months, with some large breeds taking up to two years. When a dog matures does factor into when the dog begins to calm down -- but dogs of many breeds don't calm down when they become adults. The Labrador retriever, for instance, is hyperactive for years; then he mellows considerably around age 6.
