Medical Definition of EMISSIVITY. : the relative power of a surface to emit heat by radiation: the ratio of the radiant energy emitted by a surface to that emitted by a blackbody at the same temperature. ADVERTISEMENT.
Emissivity is defined as the ratio of the energy radiated from a material's surface to that radiated from a blackbody (a perfect emitter) at the same temperature and wavelength and under the same viewing conditions. It is a dimensionless number between 0 (for a perfect reflector) and 1 (for a perfect emitter).

Emissivity Definition. Emissivity is a measure of the thermal emittance of a surface. It is defined as the fraction of energy being emitted relative to that emitted by a thermally black surface, known as a black body.
What is Emissivity. All objects and materials do not radiate infrared (thermal) energy equally. Emissivity is a term describing the efficiency with which a material radiates infrared energy. A blackbody has an emissivity of 1.00 and no other material can radiate more thermal energy at a given temperature. An object with an emissivity of 0 emits no
