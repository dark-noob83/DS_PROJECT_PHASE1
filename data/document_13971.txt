They are often the largest teeth in a mammal's mouth. Most species that develop them normally have four per mammal, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower, separated within each jaw by its incisors; humans and dogs are examples. In most species, canines are the anterior-most teeth in the maxillary bone. Narwhals provide an extreme example, where one canine tooth, usually the left, erupts into a long spiral horn up to nine feet (2.7 metres) long. The four canines in humans are the two maxillary canines and the two mandibular canines. In mammalian oral anatomy, the canine teeth, also called cuspids, dog teeth, fangs, or (in the case of those of the upper jaw) eye teeth, are relatively long, pointed teeth. However, they can appear more flattened, causing them to resemble incisors and leading them to be called incisiform
The biggest mistake dog owners can make with their dogs is to treat them like humans. The human race is such a kind, compassionate species that we tend to look at our canine companions as little humans, when in reality, they are canines and have a very different thought process. To happily coexist with man’s best friend, we need to understand our canines and satisfy THEM, rather than only satisfying ourselves. Dogs do not live in the past or the future, as humans do. They live for the moment. Because a dog lives in the present, it is much easier to rehabilitate a dog than a human.
Incisors, canines. premolars and molars are the four classes of teeth in mammals. Mammals have canine teeth but the teeth are often modified to specialized patterns by sexual selection and social functions. Only rodents and bovine species have lost canines as a class of teeth. Artiodactyls (bovines) have them only in the lower jaw where they are small and like an incisor while rodents have lost them completely. http://www.earthlife.net/mammals/teeth.h... http://www.mnh.si.edu/mammals/pages/how/...
A dog is an animal and does not possess the same reasoning skills as a human. Dogs do have emotions, but their emotions are different than those of humans. They are simple creatures with instincts, and their emotions lack complex thought process. To happily coexist with man’s best friend, we need to understand our canines and satisfy THEM, rather than only satisfying ourselves. Dogs do not live in the past or the future, as humans do. They live for the moment. Because a dog lives in the present, it is much easier to rehabilitate a dog than a human.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Humans have canine teeth because it is a basal distinguishing trait for mammals. Mammals all share the specialized dentition, with canines as one class of teeth, that appeared in the ancestral synapsids in the late Permian through the Triassic periods.

Artiodactyls (bovines) have them only in the lower jaw where they are small and like an incisor while rodents have lost them completely. http://www.earthlife.net/mammals/teeth.h... http://www.mnh.si.edu/mammals/pages/how/...
It is a well known fact that dogs have not only a better sense of smell than humans, but have senses that humans do not have or are not in touch with. For example dogs can sense fear.

Humans don't have true canines, we couldn't catch and kill animals with ours like cats and dogs can. The fact that we have an appendix, even though it doesn't work anymore, points to a time when humans could digets all veggie protein including grass. Canines are for tearing meat. We would also eat insects and fruit-just whatever was there that was edible. The appendix is now thought to play a role in immunity. Animals who are vegetarians, but not ruminates, have large ceca (huge sacks that branch off of the intestine and where bacterial fermentation takes place).
People from all kinds of backgrounds, including scientists, cooks and students, have posited that human tooth and jaw design is geared towards consuming meat. One of the most common arguments made for humans to eat meat is that we have canine teeth. While we do have canine teeth, human canines are nothing compared to the canine teeth exhibited by carnivores. Human canines are blunt and wider; carnivorous canines are often inches or more in length. However, this does not mean that all creatures with canine teeth strictly eat meat. 
Actually, humans are omnivores, i.e. we eat just about anything. Of course, that doesn't mean you have to eat meat (or vegetables for that matter), just that the human animal, and its anthropoid ancestors and relatives are omnivores. So that's why we have this mix of teeth-they're designed for meat and for veggies. Canines are for tearing meat. We would also eat insects and fruit-just whatever was there that was edible.
