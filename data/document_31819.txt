Basketball courts come in different sizes and colors. In the NBA, the court is 94 feet (29 m) by 50 feet (15 m). Under International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules, the court is minutely smaller, measuring exactly 28 metres (92 ft) by 15 metres (49 ft). † The FIBA three-point line is 2.95 ft (0.90 m) from the sideline in a zone starting at the baseline and ending when it crosses the 22.1 ft (6.75 m) arc. The 21.65 ft (6.60 m) measurement applies only at a point where a line parallel to the baseline intersects the long axis of the court and the center of the basket.
