4. Lake Superior contains 10% of all the earth's fresh surface water. 5. There is enough water in Lake Superior (3,000,000,000,000,000--or 3 quadrillion-- gallons) to flood all of North and South America to a depth of one foot. 6. The deepest point in Lake Superior (about 40 miles north of Munising, Michigan) is 1,300 feet (400 meters) below the surface. Sudden changes in winds or barometric pressure around Lake Superior can produce seiches, a phenomena which results in water levels rising or falling as much as six feet along a coast in a short period of time. 19. Water in Lake Superior is retained, on average, 191 years. GEOLOGY, FLORA AND FAUNA, CLIMATE, etc. 1.

Similarly, prolonged high water levels in the Great Lakes (highstands) have been linked to climate variability. In its geologically short life (less than 10,000 years), Lake Superior has been about 450 feet (137.16 m) higher than it is today. Lake Superior's surface water temperature in summer has warmed twice as much as the air above it since 1980. Per decade since 1980, surface water temperature in summer has increased about 2 °F (1 °C), while regional air temperature has increased 1 °F (0.5 °C). ,
Climate Change and Lake Superior. With field data in hand and computers crunching numbers, it's becoming obvious that Lake Superior is responding to global climate shifts as clearly as anywhere on Earth. Lake Superior's surface water temperature in summer has warmed twice as much as the air above it since 1980. Per decade since 1980, surface water temperature in summer has increased about 2 °F (1 °C), while regional air temperature has increased 1 °F (0.5 °C). , Lake Superior's ice cover is diminishing
