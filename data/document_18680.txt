Crest (usually written CREST) is a UK-based central securities depository that holds UK equities and UK gilts as well as Irish equities and other international securities. It was named after its securities settlement system, Crest, and has been owned and operated by Euroclear since 2002. It is also an electronic trade confirmation system (ETC) (using Trax). When parties to a transaction make a deal, they both electronically confirm their sides of the transaction via electronic transfer. Both parties are required to submit confirmation details to Crest.

Background. CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome is a member of the heterogeneous group of sclerodermas, and its name is an acronym for the cardinal clinical features of the syndrome. In 1910, Thibierge and Weissenbach described the first case report of what was later called CRST (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome in English by Winterbauer who, in 1964, described a series of 8 patients with the features that make up the abbreviation CRST.

A Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail Advisory Council was appointed and held its first meeting in 1970. Rogers served as a member along with the co-founder of the American Hiking Society, Louise Marshall; a California trail equestrian, Charles Vogel; and Oregon Obsidian, Larry Cash. The PCT has a rich history that stretches back nearly a century. Beginning in the early 1930s, Clinton C. Clarke pushed forward the idea for the trail while battling a government system that couldn’t fathom the idea. The story of the PCT continues to this day.
