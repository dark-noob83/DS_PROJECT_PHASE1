The normal range for an adult urinary output is between 400 to 2,000 mL of urine daily -- with a normal fluid intake of about 2 liters per day. Values for normal urinary output may vary slightly between laboratories. A urine output of 500 mL per day is generally considered adequate for normal function.
For a male OR female, drinking about 2 liters of fluid a day, the normal urine output should be 800 to 2,000 milliliters a day. Urine output below 500 milliliters a day is c â€¦ onsidered a low urine output and is a sign of disease.
The normal range for 24-hour urine volume is 800 to 2000 milliliters per day (with a normal fluid intake of about 2 liters per day). The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests.
The expected urine output for an adult is 0.5ml/kg/hr. This roughly equates to 30-40ml per hour in an average sized adult. For children, it is closer to 1ml/kg/hr.
Confidence votes 334. The expected urine output for an adult is 0.5ml/kg/hr. This roughly equates to 30-40ml per hour in an average sized adult. For children, it is closer to 1ml/kg/hr. Text books recomend an adult should be 0.5 - 1 ml/kg/hr.
If we were to base the normal urine output to an average adult person, then we could expect to have a result that is 0.5ml/kg/hr. This would give us a rough estimation of about 30 to 40 ml per hour. For children, the output rate is about 1ml/kg/hr.
If we were to total the urine output in a day, then we could expect to have at least 1.5 liters per day. Nevertheless, it is more advisable to have more fluid intake in order to increase the volume of our output. As for women, an output of 2 liters is considered normal while men can even go as much as 3
