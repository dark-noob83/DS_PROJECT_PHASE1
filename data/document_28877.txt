A DNA molecule (deoxyribonucleine acid) is made of two chains of several thousands of linked nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a deoxyribose and a nitrogenous base (Fig. 1). The four nitrogenous bases that occur in DNA are: adenine (A) , guanine (G) , thymine (T) and cytosine (C) (Fig. 2).
A DNA molecule consists of two long polynucleotide chains composed of four types of nucleotide subunits. Each of these chains is known as a DNA chain, or a DNA strand. Hydroge â€¦ n bonds between the base portions of the nucleotides hold the two chains together (Figure 4-3). As we saw in Chapter 2 (Panel 2-6, pp.
Nucleotides that form the strands of the DNA structure are complex molecules which consist of both a phosphate moiety and a nucleobase (adenine, guanine, cytosine or thymine) joined to a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose). In RNA, the five-carbon sugar ribose replaces deoxyribose.
The nucleotides connect the two strands through hydrogen bonds. Because each nucleotide has a unique complimentary nucleotide, each strand contains all the information required to synthesize a new DNA molecule. The double stranded structure also makes the molecule more stable.
Why does a DNA molecule consist of two strands? The primary function of DNA is to store and transmit genetic information. To accomplish this function DNA must have two properties.
DNA is a long molecule made up of twisted strands of the bases A, T, C and G. Genes are sections of the DNA and each gene has the code for creating a specific protein. The sequence of bases in the gene controls which amino acids are created and joined to make a specific new protein or enzyme molecule.
Each DNA molecule consists of two strands of nucleotides twisted together in a long spiral called a double helix. DNA is made up of four different types of nucleotide: A, C, G and T. Each DNA molecule contains multiple genes.
