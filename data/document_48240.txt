The coast redwood is a long-lived tree; an individual trunk may live for 1-2,000 years, but since most of their reproduction is vegetative (root-and stump-sprouting), a genetic individual may live tens of thousands of years.
Although redwoods hold the title for tallest tree, they are not the oldest. Bristlecone pine trees live longer than redwoods, with the oldest one approximately 5,000 years old. However, redwoods are a long-lived tree species, living hundreds and sometimes thousands of years.
Redwoods. These tallest of trees reach heights of more than 350 feet (107 meters). The tallest tree in the world is named Hyperion, which reaches 379.7 feet (115.7 meters). Redwoods can achieve a diameter of 24 feet (7 meters), and 1.6 million pounds (725,700 kg). These giants can live to be 2,000 years old and have graced the planet for more than 240 million years.
Coast redwoods can live longer than 2,000 years. A mature redwood forest is composed of trees 500-1,000 years old on average. The trees in this redwood grove areapproximately 65 years old. Coast redwoods can grow three to ten feet per year.
