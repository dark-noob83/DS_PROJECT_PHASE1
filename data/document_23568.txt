Best Answer: Your puppy will need 4 sets of shots until he's 4 months old. A set every 3 to 4 weeks. It costs about $45 each time. At 4 months he will then get his Rabies for the first time as well. Then he'll need a booster when he turns a year old. Then boosters every year after that and rabies booster every 3 to 5 years. Sounds like your first dog, dont give your own shots, you give the dog too much, they need shots all their lives, take the puppy to the vet the first time, ask the vet for the next dosage and have him show you how to do it, this is better than killing or hurting your puppy..
