Try opening that and click on the scan features. There is likely a tab that says where do you want to store the images, what quality, what file type ect. After you set that up......when you are scanning, you will just have to use the buttons on your printer.
1. Scan your document. Prepare to scan the document by smoothing out any creases in the paper and erasing stray marks. If it's very old or in bad shape, the scanner may have difficulty capturing the text in a readable state. Scan the document in any of the major formats, including PDF, JPG, or TIFF. 1  Newer scanners may come with software that will automatically convert the document into an editable format. 2  If you have Office 2003 or 2007 installed, use the Microsoft Office Document Scanning program to perform the scan.
5 Select a folder in which the scanned copy of the document should be saved by using the browse function. Because all scanning software does not automatically launch the scanned document, select a common folder that is easy to remember.
The printer has been very reliable when used with my E-machines Desktop. When I DO get it to scan an Item, it does not tell me where it is stored. I have previous scans saved in my Pictures folder, but cannot make this happen anymore. HP CD is 7 years old, so Iwent online and got updated software downloaded. I can scan a picture or document, but it doesn't state where this item is stored at.
Editing a scanned PDF doc with Acrobat. Another question I got asked was how to edit a PDF doc, especially one that has been scanned in. The short answer is: Yes, you can edit a PDF doc with Acrobat, provided it has not been protected.
