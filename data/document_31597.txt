The average human body temperature is 98.6º F or 37º C, but it can vary somewhat. Average adult temperature is 98.2º F (36.8º C). Older people average a bit less. These values can also vary with time of day.

Normal human body temperature, also known as normothermia or euthermia, depends upon the place in the body at which the measurement is made, the time of day, as well as the activity level of the person. Nevertheless, commonly mentioned typical values are:
Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6°F (37°C). Some studies have shown that the normal body temperature can have a wide range, from 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).
The normal body temperature has long been thought to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, but there are several factors that affect body temperature. Normal body temperature varies by person and can also increase or decrease as a person ages, changes environment, changes diet or alters medication.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below
Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures. The range for normal human body temperatures, taken orally, is 7002309950000000000♠36.8±0.5 °C (7002309927777777777♠98.2±0.9 °F).
Human Body Temperature. Human body temperature is generally considered to be 37C, but there are accepted variations within that, depending on factors such as activity levels, age, or even the time of day that are still quite normal, and indicate good health.
Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period.
