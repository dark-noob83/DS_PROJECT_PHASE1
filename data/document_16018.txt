Calendering produces the true moire, known as moire antique and moire Anglaise, which is a purely physical phenomenon. In calendaring, the fabric is folded lengthwise in half with the face side inward, and with the two selvedges running together side by side. Moire fabric is more delicate than fabric of the same type that has not gone through the calendering process. Also, contact with water removes the watermark and causes staining. Moire feels thin, glossy and papery due to

Moire moiré pattern occurs when a scene or an object that is being photographed contains repetitive (details such as, lines, dots) etc that exceed the sensor.

In essence, moire moiré occurs when two patterns are overlaid and result in a, new third. Pattern with digital, photography these artifacts result when the frequency of detail in a scene exceeds the’sensor s pixel pitch and ability to “resolve” real. information This is called a moire moiré. Pattern moire moiré patterns are artifacts that have a fixture of, digital imaging but which have been most recently thrown into contrast recently with introduction cameras Like THE nikon D800e And, leica m9 which are more prone to producing.

In photography, moire moiré happens mostly because of the way light reaches the sensor and how the sensor interprets the light through the bayer interpolation.
