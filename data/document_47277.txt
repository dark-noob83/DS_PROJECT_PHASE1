So the $2 million turns into $1.7 million quickly. Then there are agent and manager fees (how else is he going to get ad sponsorships?)â€”take off another hundred grand there and you get $1.6 million, on which Kyle pays taxes from tour winnings. After taxes, he keeps something like $900k. Which would be great. Expected Lifetime Earnings: $13,463,354. Let's do some real math here, because what you hear in the media is often completely distorted in terms of how much money pro athletes, especially golfers, make. Forget about Tiger numbers, at least for now. You're not Tiger.

The Facts. A PGA tour caddy can make several arrangements with a player concerning his salary.

There are several benefits to being a PGA Tour caddy in addition to the salary. Caddies often get paid to travel to exotic locations and stay in five-star resorts.
