Sand dunes are formed on the coast when waves carry sand onto the shoreline and the wind blows it into drifts. The sand gets trapped on plants such as Sand Couch and Marram Gr … ass and the embryo dunes start to grow. Marram Grass is one of the most important dune plants.
Dune growth and movement is the result of sand flow on and around a dune during periods when the wind is strong enough to move sand (for dry sand this threshold is about 15 mph). Dunes are constantly changing shape in response to changes in wind velocity or direction.
Crescentic dunes are the first dune type to form. They occur transverse to the wind where sand is abundant and the wind blows from one main direction (Lancaster, 1996). Crescentic dunes are those relevant to this experiment because the set up will favor the forming of this type.
Although no more than a pile of wind-blown sand, dunes take on a remarkable range of sizes and shapes, depending on the amount of sand available, the size of the sand, and the prevailing wind directions. Over time dunes can grow, shrink, or move in the direction of prevailing winds. Dunes can be created and destroyed by either nature or humans. Dunes can roll over trees and buildings, or be washed away by storms.
The slipface is on the dune's concave side. These dunes form under winds that blow from one direction, and they also are known as barchans, or transverse dunes. Some types of crescentic dunes move faster over desert surfaces than any other type of dune.
winds that blow in a steady direction can move a dune. such wind will consistently pick up sand from one side and deposit it to a other side. this causes the entire dune to s … lowly move in the direction if the wind.

A sand dune is an accumulation of loose sand grains piled up by the wind. Dunes are most likely to form where winds are strong and generally blow from the same direction. Some of the most extensive dune fields are found in the world's great deserts like the Sahara.
