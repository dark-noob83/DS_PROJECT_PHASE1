J. J. Thomson. CHF Collections. In 1897 the British physicist Joseph John (J. J.) Thomson (1856–1940) discovered the electron in a series of experiments designed to study the nature of electric discharge in a high-vacuum cathode-ray tube, an area being investigated by numerous scientists at the time.
Specific Charge Experiment. J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897 showed us that the atom can be split into even smaller parts. His discovery was the first step towards a detailed model of the atom. Enter this section to see how Thomson measured this invisibly small particle.
1 Electron was discovered by J. J. Thomson in Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) experiment. 2  Electrons are negatively charged particles with charge-to-mass ratio \(-1.76×10^8\) C/gm. 3  The charge of an electron was measured by R. Millikan in Oil drop
J.J. Thomson's experiment and the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. The first is the experiment of Joseph John Thomson, who first demonstrated that atoms are actually composed of aggregates of charged particles. Prior to his work, it was believed that atoms were the fundamental building blocks of matter.
The Discovery of the Electrons [edit]. The Electron was discovered in 1896, by the British physicist J. J. Thomson, using a cathode rays while doing discharge tube experiments. Thomson also determined e/m, ratio of the charge e to the mass m of the material particle which constituted these rays.
The Electron Discovery Experiment. Towards the end of the 19th century Joseph J.Thomson (1856-1940) was studying electric discharges at the well-known Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge, England. Several people had been studying the intriguing effects in electric discharge tubes before him.
Thomson's result was. e/m = 1.8 10-11 coulombs/kg. The particle that J.J.Thomson discovered in 1897, the electron, is a constituent of all the matter we are surrounded by. All atoms are made of a nucleus and electrons.
