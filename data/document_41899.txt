Open (simple) prostatectomy has 3 different approaches: retropubic, suprapubic, and perineal. Simple retropubic prostatectomy is the enucleation of a hyperplastic prostatic adenoma through a direct incision of the anterior prostatic capsule. In the retropubic (Millin) prostatectomy, the patient is placed on the operating room table in the supine position in mild Trendelenburg. In the suprapubic approach, place the patient in a supine position on the operative table, with the umbilicus over the break of the table.
Open prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. It is done under a general or spinal anesthetic. Usually, an incision is made through the lower abdomen, although sometimes the incision is made between the rectum and the base of the penis.
