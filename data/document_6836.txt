Weimar Constitution of 1919. the constitution of Germany drawn up by the Weimar Constituent Assembly of 1919. The constitution was adopted on July 31, 1919, and became effective on Aug. 11, 1919. The Weimar Constitution formalized the replacement, which had taken place as a result of the November bourgeois democratic revolution, of the semiabsolutist monarchy by a bourgeois democratic parliamentary republic.
After Germany lost the First World War, the Kaiser fled and a new democratic government of Germany was declared in February 1919 at the small town of Weimar. It was too dangerous to make a declaration in Berlin where there had just been a revolt by a Communist group called the Spartacists.
The Weimar Republic. After Germany lost the First World War, the Kaiser fled and a new democratic government of Germany was declared in February 1919 at the small town of Weimar. It was too dangerous to make a declaration in Berlin where there had just been a revolt by a Communist group called the Spartacists.
At the end of the First World War, the Kaiser was kicked out of Germany, and in 1919 the Weimar Republic was set up. Before 1914, the government of Germany had been a military autocracy; after 1919, it was a parliamentary democracy.
I am most grateful to have his kind permission to include it on the web site. Weimar Germany was the name given to the period of German history from 1919 until 1933. It got its name from the fact that the constitution for the post war republic was drawn up at the town of Weimar in South Eastern Germany. The town was chosen for the constituent assembly because it was peaceful compared to revolution torn Berlin and as a signal to the Allied peacemakers in Paris.
