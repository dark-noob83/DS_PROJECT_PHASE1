The three-base sequence on a tRNA molecule is known as an anti-codon. This matches up with the codon (another 3-base code) on the mRNA to ensure that the correct amino acid is added to the chain (protein) being created.

During initiation, the small ribosomal subunit binds to the start of the mRNA sequence. Then a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the amino acid methionine binds to what is called the start codon of the mRNA sequence. The start codon in all mRNA molecules has the sequence AUG and codes for methionine.
Translation is the final step on the way from DNA to protein. It is the synthesis of proteins directed by a mRNA template. The information contained in the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA is read as three letter words (triplets), called codons.
