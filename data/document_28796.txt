It is the sole living representative of its family (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), though a number of related species have been found in the fossil record. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_billed_platypus.
Most farm ducks are of a species called Pekin. It is harder to tell a male from a female with the Pekin ducks because they look almost the same. Pekin ducks have white or cream coloured feathers and orange coloured bills. They do not fly and do well in captivity. They are also excellent for egg and meat production.
Platypuses are both bizarre looking and unusually adapted. They belong to a sub-group of mammals that lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young (monotremes). When the first platypus was shipped to Britain from Australia, people thought it was a joke and that someone had sewn a duck's bill to a mammal's body.
A group of ducks is called a badelynge, bunch, brace, flock, paddling, raft or team. Also, one might call it a dover of ducks. If it's a group of ducklings (i.e., they've re â€¦ cently hatched and are being looked after by their mother), it is called a brood. + 224 others found this useful.
Vertebrates and invertebrates aren't kingdoms at all, they are phyla (singular phylum). The duck billed platypus is a vertebrate because it has a backbone. It belongs to the animal kingdom. The other kingdoms are plants, fungi, protists, monera.
