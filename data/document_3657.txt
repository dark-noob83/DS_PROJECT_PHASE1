Ancient Minerals magnesium flakes are dry flakes of magnesium chloride hexahydrate and other trace minerals, in a convenient and economical form for utilization in baths and foot soaks. Ancient Minerals magnesium flakes are approximately 47% magnesium chloride by weight.Where Do Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes Come From?Ancient Minerals magnesium flakes are extracted from the Ancient Zechstein Seabed in Europe, 1600 to 2000 meters deep in the interior of the Earth.
Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.
(Redirected from MgCl2). Magnesium chloride is the name for the chemical compounds with the formulas MgCl 2 and its various hydrates MgCl 2 (H 2 O) x. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water.
A very exciting addition to the magnesium family is a product loosely referred to as magnesium oil. It’s not actually an oil at all, but a super saturated solution of magnesium chloride. Magnesium oil can be sprayed or rubbed on the body, and is readily absorbed through the skin.

Magnesium Chloride is recognized by many medical professionals as the “Master Magnesium Compound” for both dietary and topical uses, due to its high potency and efficient action. Magnesium is undeniably therapeutic to the human body, yet much is left unsaid about the type and quality of various forms of magnesium.
Most magnesium comes from seawater which is composed of 0.13 percent of the element in the form of magnesium chloride. It can also be found in natural minerals such as dolomite and magnesite in the form of magnesium oxide.
