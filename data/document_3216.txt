If a circle has a diameter of 4, its circumference is 3.14*4=12.56 If you know the radius, the diameter is twice as large. Calculating the Circumference of a Circle. The circumference of a circle is the distance around the outside of the circle. It could be called the perimeter of the circle. How to find the circumference of a circle: The circumference of a circle can be found by multiplying pi (π = 3.14) by the dia
1. Write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle using the diameter. The formula is simply this: C = πd. In this equation, C represents the circumference of the circle, and d represents its diameter. That is to say, you can find the circumference of a circle just by multiplying the diameter by pi. Plugging π into your calculator will give you its numerical value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14.
The circumference (C) of a circle is its perimeter, or the distance around it. The area (A) of a circle is how much space the circle takes up. Both can be calculated using the radius or diameter of the circle and the value of pi.
To calculate the circumference of the circle we have to multiply 2 times the value of Pi times the value of the radius, 4. Therefore the circumference of this circle is 25.12. Now you know how to calculate the circumference of a circle using either the radius or the diameter.
The number is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The value of is approximately 3.14159265358979323846...The diameter of a circle is twice the radius. Given the diameter or radius of a circle, we can find the circumference.
How to find the circumference of a circle: 1  The circumference of a circle can be found by multiplying pi (π = 3.14) by the diameter of the circle. 2  If a circle has a diameter of 4, its circumference is 3.14*4=12.56. 3  If you know the radius, the diameter is twice as large.
