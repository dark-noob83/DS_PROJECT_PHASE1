Any rock that forms from the cooling of magma is an igneous rock. Magma that cools quickly forms one kind of igneous rock, and magma that cools slowly forms another kind. When magma rises from deep within the earth and explodes out of a volcano, it is called lava, and it cools quickly on the surface. Rock formed in this way is called extrusive
Magma is a mixture of molten rock and gases below the surface of the Earth that may erupt from a volcano as lava. It may also cool and solidify below the surface. The rocks that form from magma are crystalline and fit into a general category called igneous rocks.
Crystals are generally formed when magma or molten rock cools and solidifies. Rapid cooling of the molten rock generally results in the formation of small crystals, like when … magma reaches the surface. However, if they cool down slowly, then large crystals are formed. Keeping heat applied allows more growth on the crystal over time. In that logic, larger crystals grow underground.
Igneous rocks: Rock that forms when hot molten rock (magma or lava) cools andfreezes solid. Can be intrusive (formed deep in the earth) or extrusive (formed atthe surface of the earth).Magma: Molten rock beneath the Earth’s surfaceMagma chamber: A space below ground filled with magma.

Igneous Rocks. Igneous rocks form when molten rock cools and becomes solid. Molten rock is called magma when it is below the Earth s surface and lava when it is above. Igneous rocks are divided into two groups, based on where the rock forms. Igneous rocks that form below the Earth s surface are called intrusive igneous rocks (or plutonic).
