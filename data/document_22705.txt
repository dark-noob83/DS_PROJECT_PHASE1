3 answers. If replaced the battery in my Craftsman lawn tractor. When I tried to start it barely turns over and will not start the tractor. 2 answers. I have a craftsman lawn tractor model 917.289070 I hooked the new battery up backwards and jump started it it ran fine. Now it wont start.
When replacing the battery on my son's Kawasaki Vulcan 500, I accidentally hooked up the battery backwards. I had purchased an EverStart battery from Wal-Mart and the orientation of the main battery terminals was backwards from the original battery. Anyway, it blew the main fuse located in the left hand side side cover. 
This means if you then installed a good battery correctly, you should be able to start and run the vehicle. But as the motor needs power for the spark of the motor and for the lights and the fan, your battery will get used up and the car will die.

Hooked up battery backwards... duh. ...and I'm not an idiot but i feel like one. I recently bought a 2007 sportsman 800EFI. The original battery needed replacement so i went with aftermarket (big mistake). The poles were reversed and i wasn't paying very close attention, hooked it up backwards and turned the key.

It sparked when I hooked the negative cable to the positive side but didn't realize anything was wrong until it wouldn't start. Discovered my screw up and reinstalled the battery right and nothing. Battery still has a charge, but it will not power anything lights, fan, or ignition
