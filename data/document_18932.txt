Infrared thermography is equipment or method, which detects infrared energy emitted from object, converts it to temperature, and displays image of temperature distribution.
The American Cancer Society does not recommend thermography as a replacement for mammograms. Thermography may be used to supplement information from a mammogram and help identify cancers that are close to the skin. Still, thermography can't find cancers that are deeper in the breast and it can't detect small cancers.
Mammograms should not be entirely avoided. If abnormalities appear in a thermography or other tests, mammography and other radiation technologies such as the CAT scan are necessary. Used in conjunction with a thermal scan, mammography’s detection rate increases from 84% to 95%.
Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation, as are radio waves, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and microwaves. Infrared (IR) light is the part of the EM spectrum that people encounter most in everyday life, although much of it goes unnoticed. It is invisible to human eyes, but people can feel it as heat.
Thermography, also called thermal imaging, uses a special camera to measure the temperature of the skin on the breast’s surface. It is non-invasive test that involves no radiation. Thermography is based on two ideas: 1  Because cancer cells are growing and multiplying very fast, blood flow and metabolism are higher in a cancer tumor. 2  As blood flow and metabolism increase, skin temperature goes up.
