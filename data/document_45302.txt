She noted that the largest stars are the coolest. So even though Eta Carinae is the most luminous star we know of, it’s extremely hot – 25,000 Kelvin – and so only a mere 250 solar radii. The largest stars will be the cool supergiants. For example, VY Canis Majoris is only 3,500 Kelvin. A really big star would be even cooler. At 3,000 Kelvin, a cool supergiant would be 2,600 times the size of the Sun.
The largest known star is VY Canis Majoris [See related questions] This is the largest star known to man, but there could possibly be far larger stars. It is a red hypergian … t in the constellation Canis Major. The star is 3 billion km away from earth.
The largest known star is VY Canis Majoris [See Link] which has a diameter about 2,100 times larger than that of our Sun; this means about 9,300,000,000 Suns would fit inside (gaseous bodies like stars do not really have a definite 'surface'). See link for pictorial representation against our own Sun.
But that’s nothing. The largest known star is VY Canis Majoris; a red hypergiant star in the Canis Major constellation, located about 5,000 light-years from Earth. University of Minnesota professor Roberta Humphreys recently calculated its upper size at more than 1,540 times the size of the Sun.
This red hypergiant star is by far the largest known. It has an estimated radius between 1800 and 2100 times the radius of our Sun. With this size it would reach nearly to the orbit of Saturn if placed in our solar system. The star is located roughly 4,900 light-years from Earth in the constellation Canis Majoris.
