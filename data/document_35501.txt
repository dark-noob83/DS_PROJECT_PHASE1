even though australia is the smallest of the accepted continents australia is still more than 3 5 times larger than greenland there has to be a line in the sand between small continent and the world s largest island and traditionally that line exists between australia and greenland even though the world lacks official definitions a continent it should be concluded that australia is a continent and greenland is an island on a related note i will here state my objection to including australia as part of a continent of oceania continents are land masses not regions
also a lot of people are getting this wrong australasia and oceania are not countries they are regions australasia is a region of oceania which comprises of melanesia the country of australia and new zealand oceania comprises of melanesia micronesia polynesia and the country of australia new zealand is not part of the continent of australia it is part of its own microcontinent zealandia 
today i found out why greenland is an island and australia is a continent there are several different ways of thinking about how many continents there are with models ranging from 4 to 7 continents however in most english speaking countries as well as other nations around the world the 7 continent model is taught using this model the continents of the world in order of size descending are asia africa north america south america antarctica europe and australia
australia is the most isolated and remote continent of the 7 continents and has been least influenced by migrations of people plants and animals this had led to australia having a wide variety of animals and plants which are unique in the world such as the kangaroo koala dingo wallaby and wombat 
geographically australia is a continent not an island as a landform it could be considered an island as it is entirely surrounded by water and not joined onto any other la nd mass for this reason it is often referred to as an island continent australia is too big to be formally classified as an island geographically australia is a continent not an island as a landform it could be considered an island as it is entirely surrounded by water and not joined onto any othe r land mass for this reason it is often referred to as an island continent
australia is in the continent of australia it is both a continent and a country note contrary to erroneous opinion it is not in the continent of either aus tralasia or oceania neither of these is a geographical continent but rather they are both political regions it is sometimes referred to as an island continent because it is one of only two continents in the world completely surrounded by water australia is part of the geographic region of oceania which by definition is not actually a continent australia is the smallest of the seven continent
