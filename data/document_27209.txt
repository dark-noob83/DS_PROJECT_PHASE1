Appropriate fertilization is also a part of how to care for a dracaena. Feed every two weeks in spring and summer with a balanced houseplant fertilizer. Reduce fertilization to once a month during fall. When growing a dracaena plant, stop feeding during winter months, as the plant benefits from a period of dormancy.
Dracaena houseplant varieties D. fragrans and D. deremensis have cultivars that can reach from 6 to 10 feet, so height control by pruning canes of older plants is useful when growing a dracaena plant. New foliage will sprout just below the cut in a few weeks. Propagate the removed cane for another plant.
1 If you want to propagate your dracaena and grow another, cut off a branch in the spring or summer and plant it. 2  You should have a new dracaena shooting within a week or so. 3  If you dracaena develops brown or droopy branches, cut the tips of these off with scissors.
The lucky bamboo grown in it's native country (West Africa) can grow up to 5ft tall (or much more), and as a house plant up to approximately 2 or 3 feet. There are various cultivars of this plant and some of the most interesting are the twisted stalk types which are trained by specialist growers.
Easy to care for because of its low light and water needs, it features green, thin leaves with red and yellow strips along the edges; these grow from a thin cane that can reach heights of 15 feet (or 5 meters). The best way to grow dracaenas is to buy a small one from a nursery and plant it in a simple pot. After that, the necessary care is very simple. As the plant ages, it will continue to grow and sprout new branches and leaves up to 2 feet or 2/3 of a meter long, while lower leaves may fall off naturally.
When growing a dracaena plant, locate it in brightly filtered light, such as through a sheer curtain in front of a sunny window. Room temperatures of 60-70 F. (15-21 C.) are best during the day, with night temperatures about 10 degrees cooler.
