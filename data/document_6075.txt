$26.95. Frits are important components of most ceramic glazes. A frit is a type of ceramic glass that predominantly consists of silica, diboron trioxide, and soda. This combination of raw materials are industrially melted and rapidly cooled, making them insoluble.
A frit is a ceramic composition that has been fused in a special fusing oven, quenched to form a glass, and granulated.
Frit is used in a variety of industries. For example, in the ceramic whiteware industry it is used as a glaze component. In the glass decorating industry, it is used as a flux in the formulation of ceramic colors. In the abrasives and refractory industries, frit is employed as a bonding agent.
Ceramic Frits. Frit is a ceramic composition formed by fusing inorganic materials into a glass by heating them in smelters and quenching them in water. This process, known as “fritting” was developed to render any soluble and/or toxic components insoluble and/or nontoxic.
Frits form an important part of the batches used in compounding enamels and ceramic glazes; the purpose of this pre-fusion is to render any soluble and/or toxic components insoluble by causing them to combine with silica and other added oxides.
Frit 3110 primarily consists of sodium and is used as a component in both earthenware and stoneware glazes. This frit is a good choice to use in glaze recipes that require a high alkaline frit. Ceramic Frits are important components of most ceramic glazes and predominantly consist of silica, diboron trioxide, and soda.
