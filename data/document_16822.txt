Transformer temperature rise is defined as the average temperature rise of the windings above the ambient (surrounding) temperature, when the transformer is loaded at its nameplate rating. Dry-type transformers are available in three standard temperature rises: 80C, 115C, or 150C. Liquid-filled transformers come in standard rises of 55C and 65C. These values are based on a maximum ambient temperature of 40C. That means, for example, that an 80C rise dry transformer will operate at an average winding temperature of 120C when at full-rated load, in a 40C ambient environment.
The total maximum temperature allows for a maximum ambient of 40 [degrees] C. If the ambient temperature is below this, the transformer will run cooler; if above, it will run too hot, unless a special lower temperature rise design is used. Impregnation.
Our transformers are designed in a way that does not allow impermissible temperatures. The insulating materials have at least class E conforming to IEC 85, mostly class F (155 deg C) & class H (180 deg C) and on request even higher temperature classes.
In that case, temperature rise is a rough indicator of transformer efficiency. For example, a transformer with an 80C temperature rise uses 13-21% less operating energy than a 150C rise unit.
Figure 1: Simple transformer representation A transformer is rated at the power output the transformer can continuously deliver at rated voltage and frequency, without exceeding the specified temperature rise. This temperature rise is based, in part, on the thermal limitations of the core, winding, and insulation.
It is designed to operate at full load in a maximum of 50 degrees C ambient temperature. Higher temperatures will require derating of the transformer. ------------------------------------------------------------------------.
