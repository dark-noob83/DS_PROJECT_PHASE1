In general, cooking the pork tenderloin over high heat for about 20 to 27 minutes per pound brings it to the required 145 F while preserving its inner juiciness. Whether pan-cooking the tenderloin on a stovetop, broiling it in an oven or cooking it on an indoor electric grill, the technique remains the same. Cook Pork Tenderloin to 145 F. According to the USDA, pork tenderloin must be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. After cooking, remove the meat from the heat and rest it for at least 3 minutes, which raises its temperature a bit more.
Swirl to coat the bottom. Roast the pork for 10 minutes: Set the pork in the pan. (It's fine if your pork tenderloin is a little long for the pan; just bend it to fit as we did here.) Return the pan to the oven. Roast for 10 minutes. Flip the pork, reduce the heat, and roast another 10 to 15 minutes: Flip the pork to the other side. The pork is done when its internal temperature registers 140°F to 145°F in the thickest part of the meat (20 to 25 minutes total). Rest for 10 minutes before serving: Transfer the pork to a cutting board, tent with foil, and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
Roast the tenderloin at 450 F for 10 to 15 minutes to aid browning, then reduce the oven to 325 F. Roast the tenderloin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part shows an internal temperature of 140 F. Remove the tenderloin from your oven and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest for 10 minutes before carving, which gives its internal temperature time to rise to 145 F, the temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for food safety. Rub or spray your tenderloin lightly with oil, and season it with salt and pepper or other flavorings as you wish.

Broil the tenderloin for 10 to 12 minutes, or 8 to 10 minutes for medallions, turning once midway through that time. An instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into the thickest part of the tenderloin should read 140 F, or 145 F if they're medallions. Rub or spray your tenderloin lightly with oil, and season it with salt and pepper or other flavorings as you wish. The tenderloin can be broiled whole, cut into individual 4- to 8-ounce portions, or sliced into medallions of 1 1/2 to 2 inches' thickness.
