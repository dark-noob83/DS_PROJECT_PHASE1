Sprinting uses the same muscles as running, but requires that they are considerably more limber for short bursts of speed while avoiding injury. Running is powered by the legs, hips and glutes, so training the same muscles with a focus on speed will prepare you for sprinting. While training, avoid raising on the toes or pumping too high with the arms. Allow the primary muscles used for running to provide the power to sprint. The quadriceps are the muscles at the front of the thighs. These muscles raise the leg and propel the runner forward. Muscles throughout your body work in coordinating pairs.
Speed work such as sprinting isn't the primary method for muscle growth, but it does speed up the hypertrophy process. So think of sprinting as a secondary technique for size, one that can get us to our size destination much faster. 1 – Speed Work Prevents Fat Gain. Speed training creates a huge metabolic disturbance and is one of the best methods for losing or maintaining fat stores. According to the many DEXA scans I've run on athletes and clients, body fat stores rapidly decrease and muscle size increases once sprinting is employed.
The hamstrings are the muscles located at the back of your thigh, and the quadriceps are the muscles located in the front of your thigh. This is known as a hip extension. When the foot strikes, the hamstrings and quadriceps co-contract to stabilize the knee during ground contact; then, as the leg pushes off, the hamstrings help with forward propulsion. These muscles also assist in stabilizing the body while sprinting.
Here's what you need to know... 1  Sprinting isn't the primary method for muscle growth, but like all speed work, it can quickly get you bigger. 2  A few sprint workouts during mass phases can greatly reduce bodyfat accumulation and also increase insulin sensitivity so you get even leaner in the process. 1 – Speed Work Prevents Fat Gain.

Sprinters typically have more definition to the tone in their legs and abs than distance runners. This is because sprinting targets six specific muscle groups: hamstrings, quadriceps, glutes, hips, abdominals and calves. Sprinting is a total body workout featuring short, high-intensity repetitions and long, easy recoveries. To sprint means to race or move at full speed, according to Health and Fitness Solutions. This is known as a hip extension. When the foot strikes, the hamstrings and quadriceps co-contract to stabilize the knee during ground contact; then, as the leg pushes off, the hamstrings help with forward propulsion. These muscles also assist in stabilizing the body while sprinting.

Glutes. The glutes, or muscles of the backside, are some of the largest muscles in your body. Sprinters use them to assist in propulsion and to support the work of the quadriceps and hamstrings. When sprinting, you may find that the glutes work less than the legs. The quadriceps are the muscles at the front of the thighs. These muscles raise the leg and propel the runner forward. Muscles throughout your body work in coordinating pairs.
These muscles are vital to sprinting more than regular running, because the muscles of the calves control foot flexion when running. Sprinters should be prepared to spring off the next foot during each stride before impact to minimize time on the ground. Strong, elastic calves support the additional speed of a sprint. The quadriceps are the muscles at the front of the thighs. These muscles raise the leg and propel the runner forward. Muscles throughout your body work in coordinating pairs.
Rating Newest Oldest. Sprinting works quads, hamstrings, glutes and calves. They all need to be strong or balance each other because if one is weaker than the other then you could injure the weaker one due to the strain/pressure put on it by the stronger muscle.
