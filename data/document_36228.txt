1 And Rhizopus nigricans use the food source for reproductiona and growth. 2  The spores which can freely floats in the air are able to germinate under the temperature of 15c-30c. 3  Also, Rhizopus n...igricans could spread at fast speed in moist environment such as bread and ripe fruits.
Rhizopus species are among the fungi causing the group of infections referred to as zygomycosis. Zygomycosis is now the preferred term over mucormycosis for this angio invasive disease. Rhizopus arrhizus is the most common cause of zygomycosis and is followed by Rhizopus microsporus var. rhizopodiformis.
Genus: Rhizopus. Rhizopus nigricans is a member of Rhizopus since it is a rot causing fungus. Species: Rhizopus stolonifer(nigricans). Rhizopus nigricans earned this scientific name because it is black and usually grows on bread and its spores float in the air.
There are multiple species of Rhizopus, but Rhizopus stolonifer earned this species name because it is a black mold that grows on bread and its spores float around in the air. Rhizopus stolonifer also uses rhizoids as a way to anchor itself to the vast array of substrates it can come in contact with.
Background Info: Also known as Rhizopus stolonifer. Rhizopus is closely related to Mucor and inhabits the same ecological niches. R. nigricans is one of the most common members of the Mucorales and has a world-wide distribution, although most commonly occurring in warmer areas.
Rhizopus stolonifer is more commonly known as black bread mold. Rhizopus specifically means any rot causing fungi. This type of mold also has a synonym name of Rhizopus nigricans.
Class: Zygomycetes. The Zygomycetes all have chitenous cell walls in a coenocytic mycelium and they lack motile spores. Order: Mucorales. Rhizopus stolonifer is a member of the Mucorales because it is fast growing, with wide hyphae, that lack septa or is coenocytic, and grow within a substrate.
