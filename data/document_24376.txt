Internal analysis by AHAM indicates that there is a general correlation between water and energy on an industry shipment-weighted basis (AHAM, 2005). For instance, in 1993, the energy per cycle for dishwashers averaged about 2.6 kWh/cycle along with a hot water use of about 10 gallons (38 liters). By 2004, with new energy standards (DOE, 2003) the numbers had fallen to about 1.8 kWh/cycle with typical water use of about 6 gallons (23 liters). 
Newer dishwashers use an average of 3-4 gallons of water. More Info: A new Energy Star qualified dishwasher uses 4 to 6 gallons of water per cycle, while other models can use from six to 16 gallons depending on the age and model. As of August 2009, Energy Star qualified dishwashers must use 5.8 gallons of water per cycle or less. 
A pre-1994 dishwasher uses an extra $40 worth of energy a year and wastes more than 10 gallons of water per cycle compared to a new ENERGY STAR model. Dishwashers. More than 60 percent of American kitchens have a dishwasher, and 93 percent of newly built homes include them. According to the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, dishwashers account for 2.5 percent of the energy used in a typical household.
A dishwasher made before 1994 wastes more than 10 gallons of water per cycle, according to Energy Star. Over its presumed lifetime of 10 years, an Energy Star dishwasher will save at least 1,600 gallons of water over older models. Do the math by multiplying that number and your water rate and you’ll see the savings. When Consumer Reports tests dishwashers, it measures how much water and energy each model uses in addition to how well it cleans and how quiet it is. Our top-rated dishwasher, the KitchenAid KDTM354DSS, $1,080, uses only four gallons of water per wash although most of our other top picks use five or six.
Another online list of energy-efficient dishwashers is maintained by the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE). Appliances on the CEE list use less than 295 kWh/yr and 4.25 gallons of water per cycle (equivalent to the Energy Star requirements). The Energy Star standard for dishwashers is more stringent; it requires standard-sized dishwashers to use no more than 295 kWh/year and no more than 4.25 gallons of water/cycle.
Electricity usage of a Dishwasher. A dishwasher is a household appliance used to wash your cutlery, dishes and other kitchen utilities. Modern dishwashers are energy efficient and do not use a lot of water. Dishwashers use between 1200 and 2400 watts of power, with an average dishwasher using 1800 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a dishwasher using 1800 Watts for 1 hour a day @ $0.10 per a kWh
An older model dishwasher will use approximately 10 to 15 gallons (37.8 L to 56.7 L) of water per load. A family of four using a standard dishwasher will generate about 150 loads per year, consuming 1,800 gallons (6,800 liters) of water annually. New, ENERGY STAR® dishwasher will use less than 5.5 gallons (20.8 L) of water per load.
Efficiency standards have made dishwashers much more efficient. Today's dishwashers use less than half as much energy and water as those made before 1994. Since almost 60 percent of the energy a dishwasher uses goes toward heating water, models that use less water also use less energy. Dishwashers. More than 60 percent of American kitchens have a dishwasher, and 93 percent of newly built homes include them. According to the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, dishwashers account for 2.5 percent of the energy used in a typical household.
Water use, energy use, and carbon footprint. The average dishwasher uses 6 gallons of water per cycle; the average Energy Star-rated dishwasher uses 4 gallons per cycle, and their energy use ranges from 1.59 kWh per load down to 0.87 kWh per load. For a while, when it comes to green impacts, the prevailing wisdom has been that built in dishwashers beat hand-washing dishes, in a runaway. By the numbers, according to one study at the University of Bonn in Germany, the dishwasher uses only half the energy, one-sixth of the water, and less soap, to boot.
