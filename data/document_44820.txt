Share. By Alison Doyle. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for workers in the United States at the end of September 2014 was $790 per week or $41,080 per year for a 40 hour work week. Wages were 2.5% higher than at the same date for the previous year.
To determine the national average wage index for 2013 at a level that is consistent with the national average wage indexing series for prior years, we multiply the 2012 national average wage index of 44,321.67 by the percentage change in average wages from 2012 to 2013 (based on our tabulated wage data).

Determination of the National Average Wage Index for 2013. To determine the national average wage index for calendar year 2013, we multiplied the 2012 national average wage index of 44,321.67 by the percentage change in average wages from 2012 to 2013, as measured by annual wage data we tabulated.
Another measure is a median. For our wage data, the median wage (or net compensation) is the wage in the middle.. That is, half of the workers earned below this level. The table below shows that the median wage is substantially less than the average wage.
