List with Go Northwest! In 1882, Norwegian immigrants established the fishing and farming community of Poulsbo on the Kitsap Peninsula in Washington State. Looking out at Liberty Bay, it is easy to see how this portion of the Puget Sound reminded city founder Jorgen Eliason of the fjord by historic Paulsbo, Norway.
Poulsbo is a city in Kitsap County, Washington, United States and is the county’s fourth largest city as well as being one of the main suburbs in the area of Kitsap.
