References. This blood test measures an enzyme called aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Enzymes are chemicals that help the cells of your body work. AST is found in red blood cells, liver cells, and muscle cells, including the heart. It is released into the blood when these cells are damaged. This enzyme is also called serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or SGOT. The AST level is measured to check the liver, kidneys, heart, pancreas, muscles, and red blood cells. This test is also done to check medical treatments that may affect the liver.
AST (aspartate aminotransferase), or SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) as it is also referred to, is one of the many enzymes (proteins) that reside in the cells of your body and assist in the chemical reactions taking place in your body.
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST). Guide. An aspartate aminotransferase (AST) test measures the amount of this enzyme in the blood. AST is normally found in red blood cells, liver, heart, muscle tissue, pancreas, and kidneys. AST formerly was called serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Low levels of AST are normally found
AST (SGOT) is primarily found in the muscles, liver, and heart. As such, these enzymes will be within the normal range on a blood test. However, if there is any injury or damage to your muscles, liver, or heart, these enzymes spill into the bloodstream and will be reflected in the blood report as being elevated.
The SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transminase) test, also known as an AST test, measures the amount of a protein enzyme called glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase occurring in your blood. This enzyme is normally found in the liver, heart muscles, muscles and red blood cells.
