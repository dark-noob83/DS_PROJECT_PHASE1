If one guy charges $15 an hour there’s a pretty good chance that he is only worth $15 an hour (if that). If someone has the courage to charge $100 an hour I’d be willing to bet that he is probably worth that much. I personally charge $50 an hour when I bill hourly, which I don’t like to do, [Update – I don’t bill hourly anymore, just flat rate.] because I can make $100 an hour or more as a handyman when I charge flat rate. The “handyman” trade is one that really has no standards. That is especially true when it comes to pricing
1 Expect to pay about $30-$50 an hour for an independent handyman in rural or less expensive areas and $40-$60 an hour in more urban locations or regions with a higher cost of living. 2  These rates are just average estimates, and will vary considerably by region and by individual worker. $75 is the going rate in most large cities. With that being said, getting multiple projects completed will cost roughly $65 per hour. There is usually a charge for material pick-up also; however you can avoid this charge by shopping for materials and picking them up yourself.
This question gets asked so many times. The problem is there are so many answers. I’ve seen ads on craigslist for handymen charging $15 a hour (which I think is ridiculous) and I’ve also seen handymen charging up to $100 an hour or more. I personally charge $50 an hour when I bill hourly, which I don’t like to do, [Update – I don’t bill hourly anymore, just flat rate.] because I can make $100 an hour or more as a handyman when I charge flat rate.

Compared to many complex home services, handyman services are quite affordable. Most handymen charge by the hour, with costs ranging from $20 to $50 per hour. This can increase if you need the handyman to paint walls or carry out more extensive repairs. These more complicated jobs tend to cost up to $80 or more. Some tasks will be charged per project, rather than by the hour. 
1 There's often a $150-$350 minimum charge and there can be a $30-$100 trip charge (if the worker needs to go buy materials). 2  A professional handyman company usually has several employees, providing a wider range of skills, and screens employees for experience and reliability. $75 is the going rate in most large cities. With that being said, getting multiple projects completed will cost roughly $65 per hour. There is usually a charge for material pick-up also; however you can avoid this charge by shopping for materials and picking them up yourself.
Most handymen will charge a fixed fee per job/project. Hourly rates are typically between $25 and $75 per hour depending on the skills needed (e.g. electrical contracting). Fixed fee jobs are typically between $45 and $1500. 
1 Depending on the skills needed, rates run $60-$125 an hour for a professional handyman company. 2  There's often a $150-$350 minimum charge and there can be a $30-$100 trip charge (if the worker needs to go buy materials). $75 is the going rate in most large cities.

There is usually a charge for material pick-up also; however you can avoid this charge by shopping for materials and picking them up yourself.
So as far as I understand, a handyman should charge between $25-$75 per hour, and yes I realize that is a huge spread. But at the bottom end, anyone charging less than $20-$25 is probably not up to par as far as skills go. And on the high end, some great workers will charge upwards of $80-$100 per hour.
By the Hour. A handyman who works independently will usually charge around $60 to $65 an hour on average. Depending on where you live the actual price range can run from $55 to $75 for an independent operator. A handyman who is part of a larger business can charge up to $125 an hour or more. 1 If a flat rate job is $150 and the handyman gets the job done in an hour, you’ve paid him $150 an hour. 2  However, if the flat rate job is $150 and complications cause the job to take four hours, you’re paying $37.
