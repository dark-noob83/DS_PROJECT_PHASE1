To prepare this roast pork loin recipe, we first rub a boneless pork loin with a simple blend of garlic and seasonings, and then roast it to perfection. Note that the final target temperature for this pork loin roast is 140° to 145°F, which is medium. The interior will have a lovely rosy color.
Marinate the tenderloin. A marinade is similar to a brine, but instead of water you soak the pork in a mixture of vinegar, oil and spices. Make a marinade with 1/2 cup olive oil (118 ml) and 1/2 cup (118 ml) vinegar. Mix in a teaspoon of each of your favorite spices.
