0. Sales commissions are split a lot of ways. A real estate agent who lists a property for sale traditionally is paid a percentage of the home’s selling price, and the listing agent typically offers roughly half of that commission to an agent who brings a buyer into the transaction. The 6% ****real estate agent commission on a house sales price may also vary a little less, a little more depending on the region. Commission splits between listing and selling agents can also vary, i.e., 2%, 3%, or 4%.
In other words, the 162,560 real estate agents nationwide earned a mean hourly wage of $24.97. The lowest ten percent of real estate agents earn an average $20,700, while the top ten percent make an average of $95,540 annually. For real estate agents employed within a real estate office, the average real estate agent salary is right around normal at $52,870. However, real estate agents employed within the federal government see an annual average paycheck of $75,930, and those employed in residential building construction earn $54,090. Although it depends on which industry the agent is employed in, there are certain states that pay higher for this occupation.
Real estate agents make their money by arranging home sales and taking a cut of the sale price, usually in the range of 5 percent to 6 percent. When you're selling a home, this can cost you a substantial amount of money come closing time, since it's the sellers who typically pay the commission. In just about every case, it's the seller who pays the commission. So if you sell a house for $200,000 and your agent charges a 6 percent commission, you'll have to fork over $12,000 worth of the sale price. Typically, the seller's agent and the buyer's agent split the commission 50-50, so in this case each agent would get $6,000. This split is negotiable, though
Based on the customary 6 percent sales commission split 50-50 between firm and agent, however, a rental payout generally amounts to less money than a sales commission. For example, if an agent with an exclusive sells a $500,000 apartment, that generates a 6 percent gross commission of $30,000. 
If agents are paying a 35 percent fee (or more) to a third-party (including the real estate company) who referred a consumer work with them, that could mean a 4 percent total commission rather than a 6 percent total commission for a real estate transaction. The 6% ****real estate agent commission on a house sales price may also vary a little less, a little more depending on the region. Commission splits between listing and selling agents can also vary, i.e., 2%, 3%, or 4%.
Salary. Real estate agents work for brokers on a contract basis, which mean their earnings are a portion of the commission from every property they sell. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics May 2012 record, the mean annual salary for real estate agents is $51,930. However, real estate agents employed within the federal government see an annual average paycheck of $75,930, and those employed in residential building construction earn $54,090. Although it depends on which industry the agent is employed in, there are certain states that pay higher for this occupation.
Most real estate agents make money through commissions – payments made directly to real estate brokers for services rendered in the sale or purchase of real property. A commission is usually a percentage of the property's selling price, although it can be a flat fee. To illustrate, let's assume an agent takes a listing on a $200,000 house at a 6% commission rate. The house sells for the asking price, and the listing broker and the buyer's agent's broker each get half of the commission, or $6,000 each ($200,000 sales price x 0.06 commission ÷ 2).
Some companies charge additional fees in their listing contracts. If the agent does not charge the customer the fee, some companies take that additional fee out of the agent’s commission. $10,417 – $195 (approx. example of additional fee) = $10,322. The 6% ****real estate agent commission on a house sales price may also vary a little less, a little more depending on the region. Commission splits between listing and selling agents can also vary, i.e., 2%, 3%, or 4%.
