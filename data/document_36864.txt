Lower Calorie Needs. Sedentary people burn fewer calories throughout the day, which means they must consume lower-calorie diets to avoid weight gain. A sedentary woman between 19 and 30 years of age burns 1,800 to 2,000 calories daily, while a sedentary woman between 31 and 51 burns about 1,800 calories per day. Sedentary men in the two age categories burn between 2,400 and 2,600 calories and between 2,200 and 2,400 calories, respectively. An active woman between the ages of 19 and 30 burns about 2,400 calories per day, while an active woman between 31 and 51 burns about 2,200 calories. Active men in the two age groups burn about 3,000 and 2,800 to 3,0
More specifically, sedentary men ages 19 to 30 need 2,400 to 2,600 calories; 31- to 50-year-old men require 2,200 to 2,400 calories; and sedentary men over the age of 50 need 2,000 to 2,200 calories each day to maintain a healthy body weight. Moderately Active Men. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 estimates that the average moderately active man needs 2,200 to 2,800 calories each day to maintain a healthy body weight (Page 14).
Specifically, sedentary men ages 19 to 30 burn 2,400 to 2,600 calories daily; sedentary males between the ages of 31 and 50 burn 2,200 to 2,400 calories; and sedentary men older than 50 burn about 2,000 to 2,200 calories each day. Sedentary Men. Sedentary men burn more calories than sedentary women because they are generally bigger and have more lean body mass. The USDA reports that sedentary men burn — and therefore should consume -- 2,000 to 2,600 calories each day to maintain a healthy body weight.
The number of calories you need to eat each day depends on several factors, including your age, size, height, sex, lifestyle, and overall general health. As an example, a physically active 6ft 2in male, aged 22 years, requires considerably more calories than a 5ft 2ins sedentary woman in her 70s. 1 Recommended daily calorie intakes in the US are 2,700 for men and 2,200 for women. 2  Eating a big breakfast could help with weight reduction and maintenance. 3  When food is eaten may matter as much as what and how many calories are eaten.
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute suggests that sedentary women weighing less than 165 pounds generally need 1,000 to 1,200 calories daily to effectively lose weight, while women weighing 165 pounds or more and most sedentary men often require 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day for weight loss. Depending on gender and age, adults who don’t exercise but are at a healthy body weight generally need somewhere between 1,600 to 2,600 calories daily to maintain their weight, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010.
Sedentary Women. Sedentary women generally burn 1,600 to 2,000 calories per day, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Page 14), and should consume the same number of calories for healthy weight maintenance. Sedentary Men. Sedentary men burn more calories than sedentary women because they are generally bigger and have more lean body mass. The USDA reports that sedentary men burn — and therefore should consume -- 2,000 to 2,600 calories each day to maintain a healthy body weight.
The number of calories your body burns in a sedentary state is determined by your basal metabolic rate, or BMR. Calculate your BMR with the following formula for men from DietNation: 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in year). Example. A 6-foot-tall, 28-year-old sedentary man weighing 200 pounds would calculate his BMR as follows: 66 + (6.23 x 200) + (12.7 x 72) - (6.8 x 28) = 2,150 BMR. Then multiply the BMR by 1.2 to calculate 2,580 calories needed each day.
More specifically, sedentary women require 1,600 to 2,000 calories a day, while sedentary men need about 2,000 to 2,600 calories daily to maintain their current weight. As a general rule, calorie needs for healthy weight maintenance in adults decrease with age. Depending on gender and age, adults who don’t exercise but are at a healthy body weight generally need somewhere between 1,600 to 2,600 calories daily to maintain their weight, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010.
Calories per Pound. Sedentary individuals need to consume about 13 calories per pound of their body weight on a daily basis, notes Harvard Medical School. For example, if you’re sedentary and weigh 125 pounds, you’d need to eat about 1,625 calories daily. Depending on gender and age, adults who don’t exercise but are at a healthy body weight generally need somewhere between 1,600 to 2,600 calories daily to maintain their weight, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010.
