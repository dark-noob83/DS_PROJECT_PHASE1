State-based proposals for out-of-state health purchases before federal health reform: Eighteen states considered laws to allow this policy prior to health reform; of those, 14 states had cross-border health insurance bills filed in the 2008-2010 sessions.
What you may wish to ask is your insurance company is if they cover it in this other state and if you can simply go there -- i.e., get a pre-qualification/pre-approval before you cross borders -- I don't think establishing residency is your answer.
A: Yes. 1  If you live in a State that is part of an inter-state compact, you can purchase coverage in a neighboring State. 2  These interstate markets will continue to provide basic consumer protections, access to essential benefits, and other insurance reforms that are included in health reform.
It depends. If you are enrolled in a health plan that has varying levels of coverage, i.e., 100% coverage in-network and 80% out-of-network, and you choose to see the out-of-network physician, then yes, the doctor or hospital can bill you the remaining 20%. There are many variables in insurance plans.
You can use your health insurance in another state, it just depends on whether it will be considered in or out of network. If it is an emergency, most companies will treat it as an I network claim. If it is for a random MD visit, then it will most likely be treated as out-of-network.
There will be a network of doctors that accept your insurance. If you have an HMO policy that network is local and therefore it is doubtful you'll find any doctors that will accept it out of state. If you have a PPO or one of the other types of policies you may be able to access the network in other states if a network is available.
