Water actually freezes when it gets to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius), but the time it takes to get there may be different. If you put boiling water in the freezer along with cold water, the cold water would reach the freezing point of 0 C much more quickly, but it does not make the transition to ice until a force acts upon it.

While many newer freezers are frost-free, older styles require periodically removing ice the old-fashioned way: removing the contents and melting, scraping or cussing the ice.
Of course, you also want to ensure you leave the freezer door shut as much as possible, so cold air doesn't escape. So resist the temptation to check it every hour from the moment you plug it in. Wait at least 6 hours before you take your first peek, but a good time frame to expect is 12-24 hours.
