DNA structure. DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). The order of these bases is what determines DNA's instructions, or genetic code. Similar to the way the order of letters in the alphabet can be used to form a word, the order of nitrogen bases in a DNA sequence forms genes, which in the language of the cell, tells cells how to make protein
DNA is a nucleic acid; alongside proteins and carbohydrates, nucleic acids compose the three major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. According to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G), hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10 37, and weighs 50 billion tonnes.
Transcription is the name given to the process where the information in a gene in a DNA strand is transferred to an RNA molecule. The coding strand and the template strand of DNA. The important thing to realise is that the genetic information is carried on only one of the two strands of the DNA. TRANSCRIPTION-FROM DNA TO RNA This page takes a simple look at the structure of RNA and how the information in DNA is used to make messenger RNA. It is designed for 16 - 18 year old chemistry students, and if you are doing biology or biochemistry, you will probably need more detail than this page gives.
Nucleotides is the name given to the 4 bases that make up DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. Adenine always pairs with Thymine, and Cytosine always pairs with Guanin … e. A nucleotide consists of a 5 carbon ring, a sugar (deoxyribose or ribose) and a phosphate group. These are actually the names of the nitrogenous bases that nucleotides contain. A nucleotide is made up of a Deoxyribose Sugar, a Phosphate Molecule, and a Nitrogenous Base. We refer to them though by the name of their nitrogenous base.
The nucleotides used to build DNA are Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine. For RNA, there is no Thymine; it is replaced with another nucleotide called Uracil. These are actually the names of the nitrogenous bases that nucleotides contain. A nucleotide is made up of a Deoxyribose Sugar, a Phosphate Molecule, and a Nitrogenous Base. We refer to them though by the name of their nitrogenous base.

The bases on one strand pair with the bases on another strand: adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. DNA molecules are long — so long, in fact, that they can't fit into cells without the right packaging. To fit inside cells, DNA is coiled tightly to form structures we call chromosomes. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). The order of these bases is what determines DNA's instructions, or genetic code.
The basic unit of structure for a DNA molecule is the nucleotide. A nucleotide is composed of a phosphate, a deoxyribose sugar molecule, and a nitrogen-containing base (A, T, C, or G). The instructions carried on DNA are used to make proteins from amino acids in the cytoplasm. Constructing a DNA Model. Introduction: DNA is a complex molecule that is found in all living organisms. Constructing DNA models is a great way to learn about DNA structure, function and replication. DNA contains the genetic information for the reproduction of life
First isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869 and with its molecular structure first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. According to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G), hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10 37, and weighs 50 billion tonnes.
