Thanks for the replies. The roof is basically flat at present. Is there no way to put some kind of rafter system mounted on the outside perimeter of the mobile home and fasten the metal roof to it. This is just a seasonal trailer that we use in the summer.
This family has discovered that putting a new mobile home roof and insulation in place on their old mobile home pays off in more ways than one. It's estimated that the typical mobile home gives up between 15% and 22% of its heat through the ceiling.
Report Abuse. Go to a Truss Builder in your area, or you can probably find one thru Home Depot or Lowe's. All they would need is the length of your trailer and what pitch you want the roof to be, to determine how many trusses you will need. ((The pitch is how many inches the roof goes UP in one foot length.
