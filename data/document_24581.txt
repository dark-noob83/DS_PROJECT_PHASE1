Report Abuse. Capacitor is a little like battery.Capacitor and battery both store electrical energy. Capacitor has two terminals.In side the capacitor the two terminals connect to TWO metal PLATES separated by a non-conducting substance. Capacitors are energy storing devices. A capacitor is an electrical device that can store energy in the electric field between a pair of closely spaced conductors (called 'plates'). When current is applied to the capacitor, electric charges of equal magnitude, but opposite polarity, build up on each plate.
1 There are two major types of interference-suppression / AC line filter safety capacitors; namely, type X and type Y. The purpose of these capacitors is to reduce radio frequency interference and to ensure safety from shock and fire. 1 In AC/DC (radios that do not use power transformers) radios where a line filter capacitor is connected between the hot and ground side of the power line, that capacitor is known as an across-the-line capacitor. 2  Across the line capacitors serve to keep RF noise disturbances from affecting the receiver.

Noise is suppressed due to frequency properties of a capacitor or an induction coil.Let's consider how a capacitor filter suppresses high-frequency noise. The capacitor is connected between the signal track and the grounding point of the device. How Capacitor Filter Suppresses High-Frequency Noise Electromagnetic noise filters are designed to suppress high-frequency noise generated by the signal source or caused by the external electromagnetic field.
Filter capacitors are capacitors used for filtering of undesirable frequencies. They are common in electrical and electronic equipment, and cover a number of applications, such as: 1  Glitch removal on Direct current (DC) power rails. 
Re: belt sander repair, suppression capacitor-ELECTRONICS EXPERTS. The capacitor is a noise/interference supression capacitor and is in parallel as you have correctly noted. If it failed, it would either fail 'short' and the fuse would blow, or it would fail open, and the sander would still work. Re: belt sander repair, suppression capacitor-ELECTRONICS EXPERTS. Even better if I can get one for 25p from a maplins shop over the counter (no delivery) and I've just found that Maplin do have 'em-probably not in shop though.
belt sander repair, suppression capacitor-ELECTRONICS EXPERTS. My belt sander gave out today. Having fixed my washing machine over and over by buying an 8p resistor, I opened up the sander, thought I'd have a go. First to check was the switch and power in.

1 The capacitors that filter out interference from the 110-120 volt AC (alternating current) power coming from your wall plug go by a number of names. 2  The general term for these capacitors is AC Line Filter Capacitor or AC Interference Suppression Capacitor. 1 In AC/DC (radios that do not use power transformers) radios where a line filter capacitor is connected between the hot and ground side of the power line, that capacitor is known as an across-the-line capacitor. 2  Across the line capacitors serve to keep RF noise disturbances from affecting the receiver.
I'm building a digital power base for a Scalextric slot car track using the schema provided here (you might have to click the Powerbase Circuit tab). Now, my question is, what type of capacitors should be used for C7 and C8 (the right-most ones next to U3 & U4). What is said about the caps in the text is only Output protection is provided by suppression capacitors C7 & C8 , but nothing about their type.
