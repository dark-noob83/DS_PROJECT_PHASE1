I hadn’t known that, while they are “normal lab values” for blood tests, there are also “FUNCTIONAL” or “OPTIMAL” values which actually tell you far more about your thyroid. My TSH, T3, T4 and other basic thyroid levels have ALWAYS been in the “normal” range. However, when I was sick, they were not in the OPTIMAL ranges. Below is a list of functional/optimal ranges for thyroid markers.
TSH Range. The function of thyroid stimulating hormone (or TSH) is to regulate the normal levels of thyroid hormones in the body. It is a peptide hormone secreted by the thyrotrope cells of anterior pituitary gland. The TSH activates the thyroid gland to produce both Triiodothyronine(T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones. 1 A TSH level count ranging between 0.5 and 3mIU/L confirms thyroid disorder. 2  The normal TSH range for newborns ranges from between 1 – 39 mIU/L. 3  The normal TSH levels for children ranges from between 0.7 – 6.4 mIU/L.
Speaking roughly, normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are in the range of 0.4 to 4.0 mIU/L. However, each laboratory and test manufacturer identifies its own normal TSH range. This is based on the test, the equipment being used, and the patients being tested. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has proposed a range of 0.3 to 3.0 for normal TSH levels.
1 The range of normal TSH levels for full term newborns is higher, as it can range from between 1.3 and 16 micro units per ML of blood. 2  The TSH range gradually reduces to 0.9 to 7.7 micro units per milliliter after 30 days. 3  The TSH narrows to 0.6 to 5.5 micro units per milliliter in school going children. 1 A TSH level count ranging between 0.5 and 3mIU/L confirms thyroid disorder. 2  The normal TSH range for newborns ranges from between 1 – 39 mIU/L. 3  The normal TSH levels for children ranges from between 0.7 – 6.4 mIU/L.
Normal TSH Level. The normal thyroid level for TSH for labs in UK is 0.5 to 5.5 mIU/L (milli-international units per liter). Labs in the U.S. followed the same reference scale until 2003. In spring 2003, the scale was revised to new standards, which specified 0.3 to 3.3 mIU/L as normal TSH level. Normal thyroid hormone level for T3 depends upon the type of test to be conducted. If your physician has asked you to undergo a test called 'Total T3', you should expect the normal range to be between 80 to 220 points. Thyroid level below 80 indicates underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism, while high thyroid levels, i.e. above 220 indicate overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism
It gets converted in T3 inside the liver. Again, for determining the level of T4, two types of tests are to be conducted. Normal thyroid levels for 'Total T4' are between 4.5 to 12.5 pg/ml. While, normal levels for 'Free T4' are within the range of 0.7 to 2.0 pg/ml. Normal thyroid hormone level for T3 depends upon the type of test to be conducted. If your physician has asked you to undergo a test called 'Total T3', you should expect the normal range to be between 80 to 220 points. Thyroid level below 80 indicates underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism, while high thyroid levels, i.e. above 220 indicate overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism
Results. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems. The normal values listed here-called a reference range-are just a guide. These ranges vary from lab to lab, and your lab may have a different range for what's normal
1 An under active thyroid presents with a TSH ranging from 2mIU/L or more than that. 2  A TSH level count ranging between 0.5 and 3mIU/L confirms thyroid disorder. 3  The normal TSH range for newborns ranges from between 1 – 39 mIU/L. 4  The normal TSH levels for children ranges from between 0.7 – 6.4 mIU/L. 1 A TSH level count ranging between 0.5 and 3mIU/L confirms thyroid disorder. 2  The normal TSH range for newborns ranges from between 1 – 39 mIU/L. 3  The normal TSH levels for children ranges from between 0.7 – 6.4 mIU/L.
