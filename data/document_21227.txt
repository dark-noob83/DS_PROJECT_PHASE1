Swirl the pan so it is lightly covered with the olive oil. Cook the chicken breasts for 1 minute without moving: Turn the heat to medium. Add the chicken breasts. Cook for just about 1 minute to help them get a little golden on one side (you are not actually searing or browning them).
Get out a large enough baking pan to fit all of the chicken thighs you plan to cook. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter to the pan. Spread it out evenly, so that your chicken will not stick to the pan. This will get your chicken brown and crispy.
Toss the chicken with the baking sauce. Spread the chicken in the baking dish. No need to grease the dish. Just lay the chicken inside. Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165Â°F. Boneless, skinless thighs cook quickly. Check after 20 minutes, and if they are not quite up to temperature, put back in the oven and continue cooking and checking the temperature in 5-minute increments.
Place the chicken underneath a piece of plastic wrap. Use a small mallet (metal or wood) and gently pound the chicken thighs. Make sure that each of the thighs is of equal thickness, around 1/2 inch-3/4 inch. This will not only make your chicken more tender, but will allow you to cook the chicken evenly.
1. Prepare a marinade the day before you plan to bake your chicken breasts or thighs. The marinating process adds flavor and moisture to baked chicken. 1  Place 2 tbsp. ( 2 26 ml) of balsamic or red wine vinegar in a resealable plastic bag. 3  Add 2 to 3 tsp. ( 4 1.4 to 2.1 g) of dried herbs.
