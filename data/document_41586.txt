Motor nerves or motor neurons are a type of cell located in the central nervous system (CNS) that have axons extending outside the CNS to directly or indirectly control muscle contraction. Read on to learn more about motor neurons, and the role they play in your body.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Motor neuron In vertebrates, motor neurons (also called motoneurons) are efferent neurons that originate in the spinal cord and synapse with muscle fibers to facilitate muscle contraction and with muscle spindles to modify proprioceptive sensitivity.
Overview. Transport of materials up and down the length of the motor neuron is an important cellular process that may play into the damage seen in ALS. Neurons normally move cellular materials along their axons, to keep nerve cell messages flowing, and to maintain the health of the whole nerve cell itself.

The neuron (nerve cell) is the fundamental unit of the nervous system. The basic purpose of a neuron is to receive incoming information and, based upon that information, send a signal to other neurons, muscles, or glands. Neurons are designed to rapidly send signals across physiologically long distances.
Confidence votes 231. The main function of a motor neuron is to convey output signals to muscles for joint control. This involves 'upper motor neurons' in the brain relaying signals to 'lower motor neurons' in the spinal cord, which in turn relay signals to skeletal
