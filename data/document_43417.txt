Ribosomal RNA is a molecular building block for ribosomes. Under this system, organisms are classified into three domains and six kingdoms. The domains are Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The kingdoms are Archaebacteria (ancient bacteria), Eubacteria (true bacteria), Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. The Archaea and Bacteria domains contain prokaryotic organisms. These are organisms that do not have a membrane bound nucleus.
Organisms are classiﬁ ed into domains and kingdoms based on speciﬁ c characteristics. Take a look at the pictures below and read the characteristics in the boxes. Decide how you would classify each organism into a domain and a kingdom based on this information.
Scientists classify living organisms into groups based on their characteristics like number of cells, whether there is a nucleus in those cells, how the organisms get their energy, and how they reproduce. The most basic groups that scientists use to classify living organisms are Domains and Kingdoms. .
One widely used taxonomic system designates five or six such groups: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes (often divided into bacteria and archaea). Other systems divide organisms into domains (eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea) that replace or rank above kingdoms. 5. One of the three main divisions (animal, vegetable, and mineral) into which natural organisms and objects have traditionally been classified.
Common Taxonomic Divisions. The scientific system of classification divides all living things into groups called taxa (singular, taxon). Plants are in the kingdom of Plantae. Other kingdoms include Fungi, Protista (one-celled organisms including yeasts, bacteria, and protozoans), and Animalia (animals).
-Proposal of three domains based on three basic types of cells as determined by ribosomal nucleotide sequence. -Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea-Cells in the three domains also differ with respect to many other characteristics.
