Setup. We like simple setups and the Wireless Booster puts a tick in the box on this front. Simply plug it in near to your router, turn it on, press the WPS button on your current Sky Broadband router, press the WPS button on your the new wireless booster and wait for a couple of seconds. That's it-all done. You can then unplug the Wireless Booster and place it in any room in your house you like-as long as it is still in range of your router.
