Their favorites are apples, bananas, and carrots. The life span for giraffes in captivity isn’t increased much though. In the wild they can live from 15 to 25 years. In captivity that increases from about 32 to 40 years. The biggest change here is that the young have a better chance of living to adulthood. In the wild approximately half of them will be killed in their first year of life by predators. This means that they do things in captivity that the won’t do normally in the wild. For the giraffes it has to do with the use of their tongues all the time. This is often due to the fact that they are given toys and other objects for stimulation due to the lack of environment that they have to roam around in.
1. Premature Deaths. Orcas in the wild have an average life expectancy of 30 to 50 years—their estimated maximum lifespan is 60 to 70 years for males and 80 to over 100 for females. The average age of death for orcas who have died at SeaWorld is 13 years old. © Free Morgan Foundation.
1 In the wild, male orcas live to an average of 30 years (maximum 50-60 years) and 46 years for females (maximum 80-90 years). 1 127 of these orcas are now dead. 2  In the wild, male orcas live to an average of 30 years (maximum 50-60 years) and 46 years for females (maximum 80-90 years).
Female giraffes weigh between 1,600 and 2,600 pounds and grow to be 16 feet tall. POPULATION: Giraffe populations are relatively stable. LIFESPAN: Healthy giraffes live about 25 years in the wild. RANGE: Giraffes can be found in central, eastern and southern Africa. HABITAT: Giraffes live in the savannas of Africa, where they roam freely among the tall trees, arid land, dense forests and open plains.
At least 151 orcas have been taken into captivity from the wild since 1961 (including Pascuala and Morgan). 1  127 of these orcas are now dead. 2  In the wild, male orcas live to an average of 30 years (maximum 50-60 years) and 46 years for females (maximum 80-90 years). 1 127 of these orcas are now dead. 2  In the wild, male orcas live to an average of 30 years (maximum 50-60 years) and 46 years for females (maximum 80-90 years).
Only 25 to 50% of giraffe calves reach adulthood; the life expectancy is between 20 and 25 years in the wild and 28 years in captivity. The giraffe browses on the twigs of trees, preferring plants of the Mimosa genus; but it appears that it can, without inconvenience, live on other vegetable food. LIFESPAN: Healthy giraffes live about 25 years in the wild. RANGE: Giraffes can be found in central, eastern and southern Africa. HABITAT: Giraffes live in the savannas of Africa, where they roam freely among the tall trees, arid land, dense forests and open plains.
Zoo females only live 19 years—about half the life span of the Myanma timber elephants, which, on average, survive until 42. What's more, the team discovered that Asian elephants bred and born in captivity died earlier than those imported into zoos from the wild. That really surprised us, Mason said. For African elephants, the median life span is 17 years for zoo-born females, compared to 56 years in the Amboseli National Park population. For Asian elephants, the results are much more worrying because they are the rarer of the two species, Mason said. Enlarge Photo.
Orcas in the wild have an average life expectancy of 30 to 50 years, and some make it much longer. They swim up to 100 miles a day, and eat fresh fish. They live in pods with family members, and maintain complex relationships with others. Wild. The largest of the big cats, tigers can weigh up to 850 pounds. Territorial and solitary, but also social animals, they often live and travel across a habitat that can span across 7.7 square miles for female tigers, to 23 to 39 square miles for male tigers.
Wild Or Captivity. Lions live for about 10-16 years in the wild. While in captivity they live for as long as 20-25 years old. This is because in captivity they are entertained and fed properly.
