An artesian well is simply a well that doesn’t require a pump to bring water to the surface; this occurs when there is enough pressure in the aquifer. The pressure forces the water to the surface without any sort of assistance.
An aquifer provides the water source for an artesian well. This is the layer of permeable rock, such as limestone or sandstone, that absorbs water from an inlet path at high elevation, such as the top of a mountain. The water source might be fed by snowmelt or precipitation.
An artesian well is a water source that is generally at the bottom of a mountain or hill where the hill above collects water in the soil and this accumulated water has h … ydrostatic pressure and force which results in the water rising from the ground at the bottom of the hill or higher area.
An artesian or flowing well in Georgia. Pressure on the aquifer pushes water up the well without the need for a pump. Credit: USGS. Chemically and physically, artesian groundwater is not different than other groundwater, but it comes to the surface differently.
Drawing of an artesian well. An artesian aquifer is an underground layer which holds groundwater under pressure. This causes the water level in the well to rise to a point where the pressure is equal to the weight of water putting it
An artesian well is a pumpless water source that uses pipes to allow underground water that is under pressure to rise to the surface. This type of well seems to defy gravity because the pressure that builds up between layers of rock gets relieved when the water finds a path to the open air.
An aquifer is a geologic layer of permeable and porous rock such as sandstone or limestone and that provides the water source for the artesian well. The aquifer absorbs and stores water and in an artesian well the porous stone is sandwiched between a top and bottom layer of impermeable rock such as shale or clay.
