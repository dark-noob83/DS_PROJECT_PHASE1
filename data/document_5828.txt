Nicostone. The Natural Choice For a modern take on beautiful natural stone, take a closer look at Nicostone by Nicolock. A cost-effective, longer-lasting alternative to natural stone, this product line embodies an elegance born of an earlier time while taking advantage of modern high-grade manufacturing technology. Pennsylvania Stone replicates the look and feel of natural stone but is economically priced and easily installed. Because each piece is hand cast in molds made from real stone, no two are alike and every detail is captured in the finished product.
