Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or sex steroid-binding globulin (SSBG) is a glycoprotein that binds to the two sex hormones: androgen and estrogen. Other steroid hormones such as progesterone, cortisol, and other corticosteroids are bound by transcortin. SHBG is found in all vertebrates apart from birds.
Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is a protein that binds to and transports sex hormones, like testosterone and estrogen, through the bloodstream. It safeguards these hormones so that they are not eliminated by the body too quickly.
SHBG carries these three hormones throughout your blood. Although SHBG binds three hormones, the hormone that's critical in this test is testosterone. SHBG controls the amount of testosterone that your body tissues can use. Too little testosterone in men and too much testosterone in women can cause problems.
When SHBG is bound to testosterone or estrogen, these hormones cannot exert their effects on the body. In this state, they are not active or not bioavailable. When not bound to SHBG or other protein carriers, these sex hormones are active or bioavailable. In this state, they can
This test measures the level of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in your blood. SHBG is a protein made by your liver. It binds tightly to three sex hormones found in both men and women: estrogen; dihydrotestosterone, or DHT; and testosterone.
SHBG and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is a protein that binds to both testosterone and estradiol. Its amount can vary widely in patients, and if the SHBG is either low or high, the amount of active (bioavailable) testosterone can vary widely.
The sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) test may be used to help evaluate men for low testosterone and women for excess testosterone production. It may be ordered in conjunction with other tests to evaluate the status of a person's sex hormones.
