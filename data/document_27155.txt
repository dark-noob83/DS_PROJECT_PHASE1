Preparing Confit. To make a classic duck confit, you'd first season duck legs with salt, brown sugar, garlic and fresh herbs such as thyme and other spices. Then, the duck is simmered in duck fat and water for a few hours. The water will slowly cook off while the fat remains.
Confit d'oie is preserved goose and confit de canard is preserved duck. The meat in these dishes is moist and delicate. Because the preparation method also creates a salty taste, it is wise to serve confit with something sweet or soure.
Once you get this confit recipe down, you'll realize that you can actually confit anything. We love to confit garlic in olive oil (which leaves you with soft, delicious garlic and garlic-infused olive oil), cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, fish -- if fat is flavor, to confit is to make something flavorful.

Confit (pronounced cone-FEE) is a technique for preserving meats such as duck, goose or pork that involves cooking the meat in its own fat, and then storing the meat in this fat in a covered container.

Duck or goose confit (con-fee) is one of the most luxurious of foods in French cuisine. Gently cured duck legs bathed in their own fat and slowly cooked to falling-off-the-bone perfection. Then the skin is crisped in a pan or oven, giving you the sinful combination of silky meat and crackling skin.
