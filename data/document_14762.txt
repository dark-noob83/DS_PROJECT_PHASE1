Home prices of $55, $66, $72, $80, $84, $92, $110, $118, and $328 per square foot combine to produce an average of $112 per square foot, which is probably a reasonable figure for many areas of the country. However, the difference between the lowest figure and the highest is very substantial. 
Generally, turnkey costs will start at around $70 a square foot for a starter home in ideal conditions. An average level of finish will be more like $90-100. At $110-120 we are building a custom finish. For example, a $5,000 well will cost $1 per square foot on a 5,000 s.f. house and $2 a s.f. on a 2,500 s.f. house. Since houses with low square footage of finished space still tend to have garages, porches, and all the other site costs, the cost per square foot tends to be higher.

Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price. The cost per square foot is often higher for a small home than that of a larger home. When building a larger home, the cost of expensive items (such as a furnace or kitchen) is spread over more square footage.
An average commercial steel building costs between $16 and $20 per square foot, including building package (I-Beams, purlins, girts etc.) , delivery, foundation and the cost of construction.

Rich, Thank you for your question. That is a fairly small size for an office building, which puts upwards pressure on the price per square foot. While the chart would suggest a cost in the neighborhood of $160 per square foot, the small square footage could easily push you up into the $200 per square-foot range. The data for this year indicates a $15-$30 per square foot or approximately 13% increase in construction cost over last year, depending on region. Note that over twenty stories starts getting into more unique building characteristics that will drive costs in various ways
In other words, you have to have a foundation, so it might as well be a basement if the climate is suitable for one. The cost for the basement is only $10 or $15 more for a basement than a crawl space, so you are essentially getting your basement footage for $10 or $15 per square foot. 
The median cost for this commercial building type hovers around $100 per square foot. Because of the new trends in fast food being more boutique and less assembly line, the cost for a typical fast food restaurant is on the rise. Assuming the existing conditions do not present any code concerns (ADA, fire, egress, etc.), and is a good core and shell building, with reasonably easy access to necessary utilities, then the finish cost for office space will range between $25-$50 per square foot, depending on the level of finish you are looking for.
