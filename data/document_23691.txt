The principle is quite simple: the membrane acts as a very specific filter that will let water flow through, while it catches suspended solids and other substances. There are various methods to enable substances to penetrate a membrane. There are two factors that determine the affectivity of a membrane filtration process; selectivity and productivity. Selectivity is expressed as a parameter called retention or separation factor (expressed by the unit l/m2·h).
There are a number of ways that the filtration membrane can be damaged. Congenital proteinuria is a rare, inherited form of kidney disease. Congenital proteinuria is caused by genetic mutations that disrupt key structural proteins in the slit diaphragm. , but are retained in the plasma. Also, small molecular weight substances that are. will not be filtered. It is the structure of the filtration membrane that prevents proteins from being filtered.

Patrakka J, Tryggvason K. The glomerular filtration barrier is composed of glomerular endothelial cells, the glomerulus basement membrane and the podocyte cell layer. The filtration barrier is a target of injury in several systemic and renal diseases, and this often leads to progressive renal disease and kidney failure
The kidney's glomerular filtration barrier consists of two cells–podocytes and endothelial cells–and the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a specialized extracellular matrix that lies between them. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is the extracellular matrix component of the selectively permeable glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) that separates the vasculature from the urinary space.
Glomerular Filtration. The first step in renal processing involves the filtration of plasma in the glomerulus. Glomerular filtration is a process of bulk flow: water and low molecular weight substances move from the lumen of the capillary, across the filtration membrane, and into Bowman s space. , but are retained in the plasma. Also, small molecular weight substances that are. will not be filtered. It is the structure of the filtration membrane that prevents proteins from being filtered.
Membrane filtration can be divided up between micro and ultra filtration on the one hand and nano filtration and Reverse Osmosis (RO or hyper filtration) on the other hand. When membrane filtration is used for the removal of larger particles, micro filtration and ultra filtration are applied. There are two factors that determine the affectivity of a membrane filtration process; selectivity and productivity. Selectivity is expressed as a parameter called retention or separation factor (expressed by the unit l/m2·h).
the process by which glomerular filtrate is formed, involving the balance of pressures across the walls of the glomerular capillaries. inherent filtration. attenuation of the primary x-ray beam as a result of its passage out of the x-ray tube through the insulating medium and tube window. filtration membrane. the membrane which stretches across the filtration slits in the renal corpuscle. filtration pressure. the net driving force which pushes fluid into tissue spaces and out of vascular sites; the net result between capillary osmotic pressure and intravascular hydrostatic pressure
