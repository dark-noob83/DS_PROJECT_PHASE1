Answer by Floris bag. Confidence votes 50. The average size of a human cell varies quite a lot. a single nerve cell can be up to a meter long while a cheek cell averages about 50 micrometers or .05 mm. the average cell though is between 10 micrometers and 100 micrometers.
The different types of cell present in the human body varies in their size. The length of the neuron could be more than a feet.The size of a cheek cell is estimated to be around 30 - 50 microns. So based on the location and function the size of the different cells present in the body varies.

(Answer #1). The average size of an animal cell is ~10 to 50 microns (a micron is 10^-6 meter). A cheek cell would fall apx. in that range, probably 30-50 microns. Cell size varies greatly in multi-cellular animal cells, though--the egg cell size of some animals is quite a bit larger--think of an ostrich egg, which is a single cell.
