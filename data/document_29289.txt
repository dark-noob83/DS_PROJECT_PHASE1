In this particular case, this was a penny auction meaning that the price per bid went up by $ 0.01. Therefore, a final auction price of the $0.35 translates to 35 bids. At an average cost per bid of $0.8, it means that Beezid ended up making $28 for this product. Nobody knows the profit margin for this item at a retail price equivalent to $34.95. Therefore, even if Beezid lost, it was likely a very small loss. The cost of each bid ranges from $0.6 to $0.9. At Beezid, one can purchase an item at almost 60% or less, off the retail price. This is the issue that whistleblowers on the Internet have with Beezid. They simply cannot understand how it is possible for you to acquire an item at about 50% less than
Beezid gets between $0.60 and $1.00 every time someone bids, and every penny of the sale price represents one bid. That means that if something sells for $17.82, people used up 1,782 of their bids, netting Beezid a minimum of $1069.20 before you even count the auction price. So that doesn't say scam to me either. They are moving the bid for free 50 bidpacks every 20-30 minutes. They usually go for $20-$35 which is 40 to 70 cents per bid – one of the cheapest cost per bid packs out there. Beezid gives away a huge amount of bids, so the average cpb is around 45 cents.
The way bonus bids work on Beezid, is that for every 5 regular bids that you place in an auction, a bonus bid is converted to a regular bid. If you take full advantage of the promotion code in this example, and buy a 500 bid pack, you end up getting 1000 bids and 250 bonus bids, for $300. In addition to buying bids, there are two kinds of auctions on Beezid in which you can win bids. First, there are “bid for free” auctions for 50 and 100 bid packs. If you are the high bidder, you win the bids, and it does not cost you to place your bids in these auctions.
There are several different packages with bids totalling 30, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 and the brand new limited time 2000 bid pack.

Beezid is a penny auction website where you have to buy bids in advance of the auctions. The items that you can buy are the hottest and trendiest electronics, home items, gift cards and more.

If Beezid is charging .80 per bid (total cost per bid when you buy bid package B = 50/bids for $40) and the sale price reaches $100, they (Beezid) will have made $8,000 on bids + $100 + shipping/handling from the winner. 50 bids + 250 bonus bids for $35.51. So as you can see I purchased 300 normal bids + 800 bonus bids for a grand total of $129.31, which if you exclude the bonus bids is about $10 extra for a 100 more bids over the standard 200 bids for a $120.00 pack.

It's a penny auction website. How it works is you purchase bid packs (example, $50 for 100 bids), which allows you to place 100 bids. When you bid on an auction, it increases the price by 1 cent. The last person to bid on the auction when it ends, gets to purchase the item for that price. 100 bids is $50 US dollars Im pretty sure. You get to bid on any idem's 100 times, but you have to pay $50 dollars. So if your lucky you win something thats worth 300 dollars for say 24 dollars. But you also payed that 50 to get the bids.
Confidence votes 2. It depends on which bid pack you purchase. They range from $27 for 30 bids to $550 for 1000 bids. For example, if you purchase a bid pack for $27 for 30 bids, you'll receive an extra 25 bids totaling 55 bids. That comes out to be only $.49 per bid.
