1 Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. 2  More than 140,000 people die each year from stroke in the United States. 3  Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. 1 Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. 2  Each year, approximately 795,000 people suffer a stroke. 3  About 600,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent attacks. 4  Nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65.
During 1999--2003, a total of 3,442 deaths resulting from exposure to extreme heat were reported (annual mean: 688). For 2,239 (65%) of these deaths, the underlying cause of death was recorded as exposure to excessive heat; for the remaining 1,203 (35%), hyperthermia was recorded as a contributing factor. Deaths among males accounted for 66% of deaths and outnumbered deaths among females in all age groups (Figure. 65 years. Approximately 70% of these heat-related cardiovascular deaths occurred among persons with reported chronic ischemic heart disease. External causes (e.g., unintentional poisonings) were documented as the underlying cause of 345 (29%) deaths in which hyperthermia w

Heat-Related Deaths --- United States, 1999--2003. Heat-related illnesses (e.g., heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat syncope, or heatstroke) can occur when high ambient temperatures overcome the body's natural ability to dissipate heat (1). Approximately 70% of these heat-related cardiovascular deaths occurred among persons with reported chronic ischemic heart disease. External causes (e.g., unintentional poisonings) were documented as the underlying cause of 345 (29%) deaths in which hyperthermia was a contributing factor.
U.S. Statistics. 1  Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. 2  More than 140,000 people die each year from stroke in the United States. 3  Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. 1 Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. 2  Each year, approximately 795,000 people suffer a stroke. 3  About 600,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent attacks. 4  Nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 300 heat-related deaths a year. Between 1979 and 2003, excessive heat exposure killed 8,015 Americans, according to the CDC. That's more people than the number who died from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes and floods combined. It's unclear how many deaths in the United States can be directly attributed to the recent heat wave. Most of the heat-related deaths reported in the news media occurred in older adults, who are at highest risk of heatstroke.
Most of those who died were unmarried or living alone, and 72 percent were male. According to CDCâ€™s Environmental Tracking Network from 1999 to 2009 three states, Arizona, California, and Texas accounted for approximately 40 percent of all heat-related deaths in the United States. An analysis of 2012 data indicates that deaths are on the rise. In a 2-week period in 2012, excessive heat exposure resulted in 32 deaths in four states, four times the typical average for those states for the same 2-week period from 1999-2009. More than two thirds of the deaths (69 percent) occurred at home, and 91 percent of those homes lacked air conditioning
1 Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease, killing nearly 380,000 people annually. 2  In the United States, someone has a heart attack every 34 seconds. 3  Every 60 seconds, someone in the United States dies from a heart disease-related event. 1 About 720,000 people in the U.S. suffer heart attacks each year. 2  Of these, 515,000 are a first heart attack and 205,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack. 3  In 2011, about 326,200 people experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the United States.
In the 40-year period from 1936 through 1975, nearly 20,000 people were killed in the United States by the effects of heat and solar radiation. In the disastrous heat wave of 1980, more than 1,250 people died. And these are the direct casualties. No one can know how many more deaths are advanced by heat wave weather-how many diseased or aging hearts surrender that under better conditions would have continued functioning.
