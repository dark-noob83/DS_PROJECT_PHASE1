Elements of the respiratory system include the nose, the mouth, the pharynx, the larynx, the trachea, the bronchi, the lungs, and the muscles used to breathe in and out. Although many people associate the nose with the sense of smell, it can actually also be considered one of the organs of the respiratory system.
Advertisement. The main function of respiratory system is to allow gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide) with different parts of the body. The different organs of the respiratory system are nose, pharynx, epiglottis, larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs. These organs carry out the process of respiration.
The primary function of the respiratory system is to allow the lungs to take in atmospheric oxygen through inhalation and dispose of the waste products the body does not need through exhalation. Inhalation is an active motion that causes the diaphragm to contract.
Respiratory System. Several organs of the respiratory system are responsible for the process of breathing. The nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs work together to allow gas exchange to occur at the cellular level.
Functions of Organs in Respiratory System. Respiration begins when oxygen enters into the body through the nose and the mouth. The oxygen then travels through the trachea and pharynx where the trachea divides into two bronchi.
The different organs of the respiratory system such as nose, larynx, trachea, bronchi, etc. carry out the process of respiration/breathing. All these organs play an important role in supplying oxygen to the body and allowing its smooth functioning.
