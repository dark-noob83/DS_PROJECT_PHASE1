Installed prices for PV systems in 2012 fell by a range of roughly $0.30 per Watt (W) to $0.90/W, or 6 to 14 percent, from the prior year, depending on the size of the system. Wide Variability in PV System Pricing Observed. The study also highlights the significant variability in PV system pricing. For example, among PV systems less than 10 kW in size and completed in 2012, 20 percent of systems had an installed price less than $4.50/W while another 20 percent were priced above $6.50/W.
Because of the enormous scale of its projects, the segment sees system prices that are nearly $2 per watt cheaper than the residential segment. Turnkey installation prices for fixed-tilt PV systems fell from an average of $1.77 per watt in the first quarter of 2014 to $1.55 per watt in the fourth quarter. The report notes significant variance in system pricing in the utility-scale segment, ranging from as high as $2.10 per watt or as low as $1.40 per watt. However, by the end of 2014, residential rooftop PV system installed prices averaged $3.48 per watt, down from $3.83 cents per watt in the first three months of 2014. This represents the largest absolute decline across any of the market segments.
Among systems of 10 kW or smaller (Figure 5), median installed prices range from a low of $4.9/W in Texas to a high of $7.6/W in Washington, D.C. For systems 10–100 kW in size, median installed prices range from $5.0/W in Florida and Nevada to $7.2/W in Texas (SEIA and GTM 2012). California, which dominates the overall data sample, is a relatively high cost state, which pulls installed price statistics for the entire country upward. In comparison, the total installed price of systems of 10 kW or smaller fell by $5.65/W (a further reduction of $2.03/W beyond module price changes), owing to additional reductions in non-module costs over that period. Module prices dropped by $2.52/W from 2007 to 2011
Generally, Solar PV systems that generate electricity from sunlight cost between $2.50 to $7 per installed watt. Typically, the larger the system, the lower price per watt. Large commercial systems are typically well below $4 per watt. Residential systems, because of their smaller size are usually somewhat higher. For example, in Ohio a 5 kW residential system with an average monthly production of about 530 kWh would cost approximately $19,000 or about $3.77 per watt.
$2.00 $3.00 $4.00 $5.00 $6.00. For this analysis, all residential and small commercial systems are modeled using the median cost of solar systems under 10 kW in size. For large commercial customers, the authors use the median average solar cost for systems between 10 and 100 kW in size. System Performance by Climate Zone. The amount of electricity generated by PV systems varies by climate zone based on the weather patterns and insolation (amount of solar radiation) in each region. Table 13 summarizes the results of the average consumer savings analysis for 2014, 2017 and 2020. The results are divided by PV cost scenario (lower cost or higher cost solar) and customer type (residential, small commercial, and large commercial).
In its 2014 edition of the Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published prices in US$ per watt for residential, commercial and utility-scale PV systems for eight major markets in 2013. 
installation for large utility-scale projects. • Reported system prices of residential and commercial PV systems declined 6%–7% per year, on average, from 1998–. 2013, and by 12%–15% from 2012–2013, depending on system size. • Median reported prices also vary widely across states for large commercial systems. (i.e., a difference of $2.79/W between the lowest-and highest-priced states), though. some caution is warranted given small sample sizes for individual states.
However, system prices continued to fall, despite the lack of installation growth. Driven by significant reductions in balance-of-system costs, the cost for a medium-scale commercial system averaged $2.25 per watt by the end of 2014. This is down from $2.53 per watt in the first quarter of 2014. However, by the end of 2014, residential rooftop PV system installed prices averaged $3.48 per watt, down from $3.83 cents per watt in the first three months of 2014. This represents the largest absolute decline across any of the market segments.
The report indicates that the median installed price of PV systems completed in 2012 was $5.30/W for residential and small commercial systems smaller than 10 kilowatts (kW) in size and was $4.60/W for commercial systems of 100 kW or more in size. Wide Variability in PV System Pricing Observed. The study also highlights the significant variability in PV system pricing. For example, among PV systems less than 10 kW in size and completed in 2012, 20 percent of systems had an installed price less than $4.50/W while another 20 percent were priced above $6.50/W.
