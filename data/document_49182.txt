And she has a 32 percent chance -- almost one out of three -- that she'll live only another 15 years to 80.
In actuarial science and demography, a life table (also called a mortality table or actuarial table) is a table which shows, for each age, what the probability is that a person of that age will die before his or her next birthday ( probability of death ).
