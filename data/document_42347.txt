Apart from being a trademark of Project Mayo, DivX is the name given to a video codec (a piece of software encoding and decoding video) and is based on the MPEG-4 compression format. MPEG-4 is a new standard of video compression that is both high quality and low bitrate.
This site covers encoding to the two most advanced MPEG-4 levels: MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) and MPEG-4 Advanced Video Codec (AVC). DivX 4.0+, XviD and NeroDigital are all MPEG-4 ASP codecs, NeroDigital AVC and x264 are MPEG-4 AVC codecs.
1. I'm used to use VirtualDub to encode a video to AVI container with DivX-codec (and MP3 for audio). Now I'm planning to use ffmpeg to encode videos to MP4 container with h264-codec. What I've figured out is that I need to use libx264 and one of those presets to make anything work.
The DivX codec uses lossy MPEG-4 Part 2 compression, also known as MPEG-4 ASP, where quality is balanced against file size for utility. It is one of several codecs commonly associated with ripping, whereby audio and video multimedia are transferred to a hard disk and transcoded.
What is the Xvid codec: The Xvid Codec (formerly capitalized differently: XviD) is a video encoding and decoding (playback) codec designed to compete with the popular DivX codec.
Whichever codec you chose is really up to you. If simplicity is your goal, Auto Gordian Knot offers you easy DivX, and XviD encoding. Gordian Knot is a semi-automated solution for DivX3/5/6, XviD and x264, and you'll find some lengthy and complex guides on DivX3 and XviD encoding as well. NeroDigital is only available within Nero's Recode2 application.
