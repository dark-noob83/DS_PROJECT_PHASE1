Protective cells (glial cells) surround many nerve processes. Such protective cells, which make up about 90% of nervous tissue cells, are called neuroglia when they occur in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and Schwann cells when they occur in the peripheral nervous system.
The 2 types of cells are neurons (nerve cells), which transmit information electrochemical impulses and neuroglia (glial cells), which protect and support neurons.
2. peripheral nervous system (PNS) - nerves extending toward or away from CNS and ganglia (aggregations of nerve cell bodies outside CNS). Nervous tissue consists of two major types of cells, 1. neurons-responsible for conduction, propagation, and reception of nervous impulses.
Nervous tissue consists of two main types of cells: neurons and neuroglia. Nerve cells, or neurones (also written neurons). that move information around the body. Neuroglia are also known simply as glia and have various functions in support of nerve cells but. themselves.
Nerve Tissue. Although the nervous system is very complex, there are only two main types of cells in nerve tissue. The actual nerve cell is the neuron. It is the conducting cell that transmits impulses and the structural unit of the nervous system. The other type of cell is neuroglia, or glial, cell.
