Email. Print. The endothelium is a thin membrane that lines the inside of the heart and blood vessels. Endothelial cells release substances that control vascular relaxation and contraction as well as enzymes that control blood clotting, immune function and platelet (a colorless substance in the blood) adhesion.
Endothelial cells form the inner lining of a blood vessel and provides an anticoagulant barrier between the vessel wall and blood. In addition to its role as a selective permeability barrier, the endothelial cell is a unique multifunctional cell with critical basal and inducible metabolic and synthetic functions.
Introduction to Endothelial Cells. Endothelial cells (Fig.1) line the inside of every blood vessel in the body. They form a one-cell-thick layer called the endothelium, which is also found on the inner walls of the heart chambers and lymphatic vessels (which carry excess blood plasma around the body). The endothelium is very extensive.
Endothelial Cell Functions. Endothelial cells perform a variety of essential functions in the body. One of the primary functions of endothelium is to act as a semi-permeable barrier between body fluids (blood and lymph) and the organs and tissues of the body.
Main Function of Endothelial Cells. The main job of endothelial cells is to provide a barrier between the blood and the rest of the body tissues. Blood must be contained inside the transporting vessels, but substances need to move in and out of it in a controlled manner.
Endothelial cells are epithelial cells that form a thin layer of simple squamous epithelium known as endothelium. Endothelium makes up the inner layer of vessels such as arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. In the smallest blood vessels, capillaries and sinusoids, endothelium comprises the majority of the vessel.
