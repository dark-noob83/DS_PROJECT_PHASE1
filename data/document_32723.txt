Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of a cell. The PDA comes next (in aerobic organisms), which is in the mitochondrial membrane. After that is the TCA Cycle (also known as the Krebs Cycle and the Citric Acid Cycle). Then is the ETC. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose eventually into fructose and then pyruvate. All of these answers are easily found online.
Glycolysis a. occurs in the mitochondria b. reults in the production of pyruvate c. occurs in the cytoplasm d. occurs in the mitochondria and results in the production of pyru … vate *e. results in the production of pyruvate and occurs in the cytoplasm Answer is E. 3 people found this useful. 1  Alcohol Fermentation Alcohol fermentation is familiar to humans because it's used in the process of making bread, beer and wine.
Glycolysis occurs in all living cells. Fermentation follows glycolysis in anaerobic conditions. Fermentation is not part of aerobic cellular respiration. Fermentation occurs in the cytoplasm. The purpose of fermentation is to prevent the accumulation of pyruvate, and to prevent the depletion of the NADox pool.
