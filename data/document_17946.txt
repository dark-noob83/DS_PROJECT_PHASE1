• This includes pressure on A&E departments, where unnecessary visits have been estimated to cost over £100 million a year, and on primary care, where there are an estimated 51 million unneeded visits a year. • The annual cost of unnecessary or missed GP, A&E and outpatient visits is estimated at £1 billion a year. 7. COST INFORMATION There is however one serious issue which would need to be tackled for Healthcare Statements to be optimally effective. This is that the NHS – with a total budget of £125 billion a year and 1.7 million staff – still has a surprisingly weak understanding of its own costs and cost structures.
All rights reserved. ** It costs £68 to assess each patient at A&E, while the addition of a simple test could cost £126 http://www.bury.nhs.uk/news-and-media-centre/press-releases/2010/11112010.aspx. *** Average nurses salary is £21,176 (band 5 level) and Specialty A&E Doctor salary is from £36,807. An analysis by The Co-operative Pharmacy of A&E attendances over four years has revealed that each year two million* Britons visit A&E Departments unnecessarily, costing the NHS £136 million** - the equivalent of employing almost 6,500 nurses or 3,700 doctors***.
Figure 2: Revised average cost for ‘real’ A&E attendances Some spread in the costs shown in Fig 2 is to be expected given the proximity of community-run minor injury units to some acute sites and the higher costs incurred in newer private Finance Initiative (PFI) hospitals. British Journal of Healthcare Management 17(1): 16-22. Please use this to cite. Page 6 of 11 lies in a fairly tight cluster between £80 and £140 per attendance and this is far less than the A&E data alone which ranges between £36 to £206 (as per the appendix).
This research finds that binge drinking increases the average number of daily injury-related A&E attendances by 8%, the daily average of road accidents by 17%, the average daily number of arrests for all alcohol-related incidences by 45%, and increases the number of police officers on duty by around 30%. The research estimates that binge drinking increases: 1  The average number of daily injury-related A&E admissions by 8% (equivalent to 2,504 additional daily admissions nationally). 2  The daily average of road accidents by 17% (equivalent to 82 additional accidents per day
6. The average cost per A&E attendance is a good indicator of overall case mix and should lie in the range £95 to £108. 7. This figure of £95 to £108 appears to indicate that the 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11 tariffs were all too low as the weighted average of £117, £87 and £59 will be much lower than £95 to £108.

By comparison the average cost of A&E attendances in Scotland ranges between £80 to £130 (middle 75%) where over 50% of hospitals admit more than 80% of patients via A&E (Audit Scotland 2010).

A trust with costs equal to the national average will score 100, with higher cost trusts scoring above 100 and lower cost trusts scoring below 100. For example, a score of 110 suggests that costs are 10% above the average whilst a score of 90 suggests costs are 10% below the average. The costs included in the schedules are the average of the actual reported costs. We have not removed unavoidable cost differences due to geographic location, which are reflected in the market forces factor (MFF) index. (See Annex D for a discussion of the MFF).
According to Department of Health paper “Reference costs 2011/2012”, published 8th November 2012, the average cost of an A&E attendance is £108 (£101 for 2010/11). 
Figure 1 shows trends in attendances in English NHS A&E units over the past 26 years. The topline trend shows that for 15 years – from 1987/8 to 2002/3 – attendances were essentially unchanged at around 14 million per year. But in 2003/4 they jumped – by nearly 18 per cent – to 16.5 million, and rose to 21.7 million by 2012/13. In terms of waiting times and heat in waiting rooms/ A&E itself, attendances are important, but in terms of overall heat in acute system, pressure on beds and overall costs, admissions and bed days are surely the important issue rather than attendances. I know KF has done lots on this too.
