Two main systems are implicated in food intake regulation: neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pro-opiomelanocortin. alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone is a tridecapeptide cleaved from pro-opiomelanocortin that acts to inhibit food intake.

The existence of Y3 is probable. 1  Neuropeptide Y, NPY, consists of 36 amino acids and has an orexigenic effect. 2  It is present in the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic fibers where its distribution follows that of norepinephrine). MCH, melanin-concentrating hormone, is an orexigenic cyclic neuropeptide of 19 amino acids mainly found in the hypothalamus. MCH two acts on two types of receptors called MCH-1R and MCH-2R, present in various parts of the brain.
The distinction between neuropeptide and peptide hormone has to do with the cell types that release and respond to the molecule; neuropeptides are secreted from neuronal cells (primarily neurons but also glia for some peptides) and signal to neighboring cells (primarily neurons). Both neuropeptides and peptide hormones are synthesized by the same sets of enzymes, which include prohormone convertases and carboxypeptidases that selectively cleave the peptide precursor at specific processing sites to generate the bioactive peptides.
The members of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of biologically active peptides, NPY, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), are expressed by cell systems at distinct levels of the gut–brain axis. Consisting of 36 amino acids, NPY, PYY and PP share the PP fold (hairpin fold) tertiary structural motif. In a traditional view, the gut–brain axis uses 3 major information carriers for the communication between the gut and the brain (Fig. 1): neural messages carried by vagal and spinal afferent neurons, immune messages carried by cytokines, and endocrine messages carried by gut hormones.

Peptides 18(3) 445–457, 1997.—Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is the most abundant peptide present in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous system. NPY exhibits a variety of potent central and peripheral effects including those on feeding, memory, blood pressure, cardiac contractility and intestinal secretions. Classical pharmacological studies have shown that NPY effects are mediated by four different receptor subtypes, Y-1, Y-1-like, Y-2, and Y-3.
The neuropeptide Y family consists of homolous proteins including neuropeptide Y itself, NPY, present in neurons, peptides YY, PYY like the PYY 3-36, present in pancreas, intestine and neurons and a pancreatic polypeptide, PP, present in pancreas. MCH, melanin-concentrating hormone, is an orexigenic cyclic neuropeptide of 19 amino acids mainly found in the hypothalamus. MCH two acts on two types of receptors called MCH-1R and MCH-2R, present in various parts of the brain.
Since the initial isolation of neuropeptide Y (NPY) by Tatemoto and Mutt in 1981 139 and 140, numerous investigators of various disciplines have concentrated their efforts in studying the evolution, molecular biology, chemistry and pharmacology of this hormone. NPY exhibits a variety of potent central and peripheral effects including those on feeding, memory, blood pressure, cardiac contractility and intestinal secretions. Classical pharmacological studies have shown that NPY effects are mediated by four different receptor subtypes, Y-1, Y-1-like, Y-2, and Y-3.
They are neuronal signaling molecules that influence the activity of the brain in specific ways. Different neuropeptides are involved in a wide range of brain functions, including analgesia, reward, food intake, metabolism, reproduction, social behaviors, learning and memory. Both neuropeptides and peptide hormones are synthesized by the same sets of enzymes, which include prohormone convertases and carboxypeptidases that selectively cleave the peptide precursor at specific processing sites to generate the bioactive peptides.
