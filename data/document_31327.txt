when writing tags it is important that the rssi value is high so that the tag has sufficient power rssi filtering is used for ensuring that the rfid reader is close enough to the rfid tag to complete the writing operation
according to 802 11 1999 received strength signal indicator rssi is a phy layer measure of the energy observed by the antenna used to receive the current ppdu in other words the relative strength of the physical rf carrier signal as communicated to the mac layer
the rssi value can also be used to determine in what direction a tag is moving as the rfid tag moves closer to the rfid reader the rssi value increases when the rfid tag moves away from the rfid reader the signal gets weaker the rssi value only tells us the distance to the tag not where it is going
i am little bit confused about rssi concept and snr signal strength one more thing that what is technical specification of signal strength and snr and rssi for 802 11 a b g and n
the rssi value is an indicator of signal strength in praxis used for estimating distance by applying rssi filters one can optimize rfid reading and writing conditions for specific applications so that only tags within a certain distance are registered authors hanna oestman Ã¶stman toni heijari
measurements of the rssi value can be used to analyse the tag reading and writing conditions the optimal condition is to be able to use as little power as possible for achieving a strong enough signal to perform the rfid actions in question different actions require different power outputs and rssi settings
tags rssi snr dbm wi fi depending on your os and application wifi signal strength is represented either as quality in percentage or an rssi value in dbm i e 70db rssi is usually expressed in decibels from 0 zero to 120db and the closer it is to zero the stronger the signal is
rssi is a radio frequency rf term and stands for received signal strength indicator it is a measure of the power level that a rf device such as wifi or 3g client is receiving from the radio infrastructure at a given location and time for instance the power level a laptop is detecting from a nearby ap
