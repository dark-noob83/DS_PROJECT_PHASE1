It’s unlikely that they climb high block walls; however, many harmless non-venomous snakes can and do climb walls and shrubs. On the other hand, rattlesnakes are adept at swimming and will take to water readily in order to pursue food, mates and refuge, and to escape harassment.
Snake Crawls up a Wall. 02.10.2008 - Many people ask me about the climbing capability of snakes. In particular, people want to know if snakes can get up into their attic. The answer is that yes, some species of snake are excellent climbers, and can climb walls. But not just any wall. The snake must have something to grab ahold of and push off of. Not even a rough surface will do-snakes can't stick to walls the way insects, rats, and lizards often do. The only times I've seen snakes climb walls are brick walls. I've seen this a few times. The gaps where the brick meets the soffit also provide entry holes to allow the snake in.
Depends on the wall. Yesterday, I watched a tree snake (here in Australia) climb a wall that had small protrusions here and there. They weren't much more than rough mortar, but it angled its way up the wall curving from one to another.
The below snake videos show how easily a snake can climb a wall. The use of a glue trap to catch this snake in an attic cost this particular client a lot of money… while still on the glue traps, the snake managed to fall down into a wall. The entire house smelled like dead fish rotting.
1 Any untextured material is best because snakes cannot climb smooth surfaces as they cannot get a grip. 2  Make the fence to a minimum height of three feet. 3  Take care with corners, so as not to create a bellyhold (snake for toehold) on the fence. 4  Bury the fence to a minimum of 12 inches (30.5 cm) under the ground.
