Roast the asparagus bundles. Preheat the oven to 450ºF (230ºC). Place the asparagus on the flat top of a broiler pan with slots to allow the bacon to drain. When the oven is heated, place the asparagus in the oven and let it roast for about 10 minutes, slightly longer if the asparagus spears are thick.
1 Wrap one-half strip bacon around each asparagus spear, leaving tip and end exposed. 2  Lay on a cookie sheet with sides. 3  Bake in a preheated 400 degree Fahrenheit oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bacon is cooked.
1 Place the baking sheet in the oven (with the oven rack on the upper middle slot), then turn it on to 400 degrees. 2  The bacon wrapped asparagus should be in the oven during the preheat phase. 3  Bake for a total time of 20-25 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp. 4  Serve immediately.
1 Wash and trim asparagus spears. 2  Cut bacon strips in half crosswise. 3  Wrap one-half strip bacon around each asparagus spear, leaving tip and end exposed. 4  Lay on a cookie sheet with sides. 5  Bake in a preheated 400 degree Fahrenheit oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bacon is cooked.
Repeat with remaining ingredients. To grill, place bundles on hot grill and cover. Cook 10 to 12 minutes until bacon is crisp and asparagus bundles are tender. For oven preparation, place bundles on slotted broiler pan. Bake 12 minutes.
