Elastic Energy. Elastic energy is a type of potential energy that can be stored. One of the key aspects of elastic energy is that the material used to create the energy always returns to its original form. An example of elastic energy is a rubber band.
Energy is broadly categorized into two forms-potential and kinetic energy. Potential energy is the stored energy or the definite energy of a position, while kinetic energy is the energy associated with moving objects. All the different types of energy fall in either of the two categories.
Chemical Energy. Chemical energy is the energy that is stored in chemical form, in the bonds of atoms and molecules. Coal, biomass, petroleum products are some examples of stored chemical energy. For instance, when we burn wood or coal, the stored chemical energy gets converted into thermal energy.
Energy exists in many different forms. Examples of these are: light energy, heat energy, mechanical energy, gravitational energy, electrical energy, sound energy, chemical energy, nuclear or atomic energy and so on. These forms of energy can be transferred and transformed between one another. This is of immense benefit to us.
Nuclear Energy. Another type of energy is nuclear energy. This is when a reaction that involves changes in the nuclei of atoms releases energy. One example is in the sun where hydrogen nuclei combine together to make helium in a process known as fusion. This combining of nuclei
