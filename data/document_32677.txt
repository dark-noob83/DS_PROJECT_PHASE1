An individual cat's temperature may range between 100 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit and still be considered normal. Disease -- or prolonged exposure to heat or cold -- can send a cat's temperature above or below the normal range. Usually, a mild fever is a normal part of a cat's natural disease-fighting system. That's because the average body temperature for a cat is 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit -- about 38.6 degrees Celsius -- (a good three degrees warmer than ours).
Cat Temperature-Normal Range, Fever & More. Normal body temperatures in cats range between 100 - 102.5°F (37.7 - 39.1°C). The body regulates its temperature (known as thermoregulation) by a number of measures and for a number of reasons. Cats do sweat a little through their paws. Cat has high temperature: There are two causes of a high temperature in cats. Fever (pyrexia) or hyperthermia. Fever (pyrexia) is usually the result of an infection. The body increases the internal temperature in order to fight off the
Pyrexia in Cats. The normal body temperature for cats falls in the range of 99.5-102.5 Fahrenheit. Fever, referred to medically as pyrexia, can be defined as a higher than normal body temperature in cats – a body temperature of at least 103.5 ° F (39.7° C).
But you can’t tell if your cat has a fever by feeling for a warm, dry nose, as many people believe. The only way to know for sure -- with either a human or a cat -- is to take its temperature. A normal temperature in cats ranges from 100.4º to 102.5º Fahrenheit. A fever in cats occurs when temperatures rise above 102.5º F. Although fevers may be helpful in fighting disease, a fever higher than 106º F can damage organs. 
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . 
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally. 
1. Body Temperature. Feline normal body temperature range is 100.5 - 102.5 Fahrenheit (38 - 39.2 Celsius). A body temperature below 100 or above 103F warrants a call to your veterinarian. Cats may become stressed in the veterinary office (or car ride to the office), creating a higher-than-normal body temperature temporarily. Gauging body temperature by the moistness of the nose is not reliable.
Cat has low temperature: This is known as hypothermia and may be caused by the external temperature being too low and once again, thermoregulation being unable to maintain the body temperature at safe levels. It can occur if your cat is in the cold for a period of time. Cats do sweat a little through their paws. Cat has high temperature: There are two causes of a high temperature in cats. Fever (pyrexia) or hyperthermia. Fever (pyrexia) is usually the result of an infection. The body increases the internal temperature in order to fight off the
A. In general, the normal body temperature for animals is higher than for humans. The normal rectal temperature of a cat is 100° to 102.5°F. The normal temperature of a kitten at birth is 97°F. The temperature gradually increases with age until it is 100°F at 4 weeks of age.
1. Body Temperature. Canine normal body temperature range is 100.5 - 102.5 Fahrenheit (38 - 39.2 Celsius). A body temperature below 100 or above 103F warrants a call to your veterinarian. Body temperature in dogs is most often measured rectally, ear thermometers can also be used, but it can be difficult to get an accurate reading.
