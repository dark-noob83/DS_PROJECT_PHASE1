A Limnic eruption is a rare natural disaster. It is when carbon dioxide suddenly erupts from deep lake water, suffocating wildlife, livestock and humans.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Lake Nyos, silty after a limnic eruption. A limnic eruption, also referred to as a lake overturn, is a rare type of natural disaster in which dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2) suddenly erupts from deep lake water, suffocating wildlife, livestock and humans. Such an eruption may also cause tsunamis in the lake as the rising CO 2 displaces water. Scientists believe earthquakes, volcanic activity, or explosions can trigger such an eruption.

Limnic eruptions are a rare, but potentially deadly class of natural disaster, in which toxic gases are rapidly expelled from a saturated lake. The resulting cloud killed 37 people who were living near the lake. At Lake Nyos, in 1986, a similar disaster occurred, in this case killing between 1,700 and 1,800 people, and uncounted numbers of livestock and other animals.
Today I learned about something called a Limnic eruption. To describe it briefly, this extremely rare natural disaster occurs when massive amounts of Carbon Dioxide are suddenly released from the deep, dark, depths of a lake. There are only two Limnic eruptions on record, both in Cameroon-The first one, in 1984, choking 37 people to death, and the second one, in 1986, disposing of a staggering 1800 people and various animals. A few weeks ago, I read and studied Albert Camus' novel, The Plague.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. A Limnic eruption is a rare natural disaster. It is when carbon dioxide suddenly erupts from deep lake water, suffocating wildlife, livestock and humans. Limnic eruptions may also cause tsunamis in the lake as the rising carbon dioxide displaces water. Damages of volcanic eruptions: 1) Volcanic ashes and gases cause air pollution. People and animals are killed as they breathe difficultly. 2) Lava flows and destroy houses and … farmland or even bury the whole city.
The only recorded instances of this phenomenon come from Cameroon, occurring at Lake Monoun in 1984, and Lake Nyos two years after, although there is fossil evidence suggesting similar events in Eocene Germany, 47 million years ago. The resulting cloud killed 37 people who were living near the lake. At Lake Nyos, in 1986, a similar disaster occurred, in this case killing between 1,700 and 1,800 people, and uncounted numbers of livestock and other animals.
A second, deadlier eruption happened at neighbouring Lake Nyos in 1986, this time releasing over 80 million cubic meters of CO 2 and killing around 1,700 people and 3,500 livestock, again by asphyxiation. Due to the nature of the event, it is hard to determine if limnic eruptions have happened elsewhere. Such an eruption may also cause tsunamis in the lake as the rising CO 2 displaces water. Scientists believe earthquakes, volcanic activity, or explosions can trigger such an eruption.
