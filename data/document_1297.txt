Examples of reservoirs are the ocean, the atmosphere, the biosphere, the soil carbon, the carbonate sediments, and the organic carbon sediments.. The fluxes between them describe the rate at which atoms move from one reservoir into another.

Carbon can be found in the earths oceanic and continental crust in different types of stones as well as in the soil from the decay of organic matter.
The carbon cycle describes the exchange of carbon atoms between various reservoirs within the earth system. The carbon cycle is one of a number of geochemical cycles and since it involves the biosphere it is sometimes referred to as a bio-geochemical cycle.
The oceans store much more carbon than the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere (plants and animals). Even more carbon, how­ever, is stored in the lithosphere, i.e. the rocks on the planet, including limestones (calcium carbonate, CaCO 3).

Large reservoirs with small fluxes in and out (called input and output) are not very reactive. Small reservoirs with relatively large fluxes in and out are very reactive-as far as carbon is concerned, the atmosphere is such a Reservoir.
