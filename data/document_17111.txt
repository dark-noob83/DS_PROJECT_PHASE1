Aid isn't unconditional, however. If you fail to meet certain requirements, you may still need to repay money disbursed and may lose financial aid support for the following quarter or semester. Not passing a class isn't an excuse for reneging on your obligation to repay certain types of aid. If you've used FAFSA loans to pay for college classes during a particular semester, it doesn't matter whether you pass the class or not. Either way, you still need to repay the loans. If you've used FAFSA grants to pay for college classes, these don't need to be repaid even if you didn't pass the class.
FAFSA is just the application for student aid and has nothing to do with your grades. It is entirely possible you could lose some of the aid you received if you fail a class. But unless you have a grant or scholarship that is completely based on your GPA, I don't think one failed class will cost you anything.
