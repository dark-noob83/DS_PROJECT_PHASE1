A rare “medicane” formed in the Mediterranean Sea and is producing strong winds and rain in southeast France. Tropical storm Sean could become a hurricane.
The modern Mediterranean Sea was formed when the Atlantic Ocean overflowed a precipice (situated between Morocco and Gibraltar) around fifty times the height of Niagara Falls, flowing for an entire century before the desolate basin was filled.

The Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean surrounded by the Mediterranean region and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Anatolia and Europe, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.
The Mediterranean Sea is one of the world's chief trade routes. It is about 2,200 miles long and has Europe to the north, Asia to the east and Africa to the south. Some earth scientists believe that the Mediterranean Sea was formed by what they call the desert theory.
The conclusion belongs to a new study. Geologists studying how the Mediterranean Sea formed now propose that the large body of water that separates Europe from Africa must have been created when waters from the Atlantic Ocean breached the strait of Gibraltar.
At first, the sea was formed around 5.6 million years ago, due to a large-scale flood, but the waters were separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar, so, in the hundreds of thousands of years that followed, the water spreads dried out almost completely. But the sea was saved due to tectonic activity.
