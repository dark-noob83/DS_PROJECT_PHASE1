Space Accommodations. Initially, space tourism will offer meager accommodations at best. For instance, if the International Space Station is used as a tourist attraction, guests won't find the posh surroundings of a hotel room on Earth. It has been designed for conducting research, not entertainment.
The term accommodation space means any space in a Vessel that is open to the passengers and crew. Accommodation space can be any public space such as a hall, dining room, mess room, lounge, corridor, lavatory, cabin, office, hospital, cinema, game room and pantry that contains no cooking appliances.
Accommodation Space. Accommodation space is the area available for sediment to be deposited, usually the space between the sedimentary surface and sea level. This concept is very important because it provides the intellectual context for connecting depositional environments to relative sea level change.
The accommodation space not filled with water is filled with sediment. The rates of change of tectonic subsidence, eustatic sea level, sediment thickness and water depth are linked to one another through the accommodation space equation:
The accommodation space equation represents a simple volume balance, with the terms on the left controlling the amount of space that can be occupied by sediments or water and the terms on the right describing how much water or sediment fills the accommodation space. As written, the equation is an approximation.
