Simple Mendelian Genetics in Drosophila. Lab objectives : 1) To familiarize you with an important research organism, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. 2) Introduce you to normal wild type and various mutant phenotypes. 3) To help you understand the connection between presence or absence of a genetic trait in an individual and the ratio of that trait in a population.
Product Description. Drosophila melanogaster. These are flies exhibiting standard/normal characteristics. Wild-type flies have red eyes, a grayish body, and long, full wings. All mutants deviate, with respect to one or more characteristics, from wild-type flies. Drosophila are shipped with carefully-formulated medium in 4 x 1  shatterproof plastic vials. Vials include netting and foam plugs.
The wild-type, Oregon R strain of Drosophila is the standard red eye fruit fly. This culture is suitable as a parental strain, used along with one of the mutant strains to construct a heterozygous F 1 generation and a subsequent F 2 generation for study.
