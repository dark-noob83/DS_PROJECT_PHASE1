A powertrain warranty covers all or part of the powertrain of a vehicle, which is made up of the engine, transmission and drivetrain. Essentially, the powertrain is the system that powers the car, and then transfers that power to the transmission, then finally to the wheels of the car.
The powertrain provides power to the car. Power is made by the engine, then transferred to the driveshaft through the transmission. The driveshaft, in a rear wheel drive car, turns the gears in the rear, which in turn turns the axles and finally, the wheels. The rear and the axles are also part of the drivetrain.
A vehicle’s powertrain – the “go parts” – consists of the engine, transmission, and drivetrain (the components that get the engine’s power to the wheels and down to the ground).
In a motor vehicle, the term powertrain or powerplant describes the main components that generate power and deliver it to the road surface, water, or air.
Sometimes powertrain is used to refer to simply the engine and transmission, including the other components only if they are integral to the transmission. A motor vehicle's driveline or drivetrain consists of the parts of the powertrain excluding the engine and
Powertrain of a modern automobile, comprising engine (with exhaust system), transmission, drive shaft, suspension and the wheels.
The powertrain of a car consists of many components, including the engine, transmission, driveshaft and any of the internal workings of the engine. Powertrain management is a function of the electronic control module (ECM). Depending on the car, the ECM may also be called the powertrain control module (PCM).
