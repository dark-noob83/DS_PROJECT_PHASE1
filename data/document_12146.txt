A temperature of over 101 F. (38.33 C.) is considered high for an adult. It is called a low grade fever if it is between normal (98.6 F.) and 101 F. Sustained fever at or ov … er 103 F. should be investigated by a health care professional and 104 F. or over is a situation that needs urgent intervention and treatment. 1 An adult over 65 years old with a fever over 101.9 degrees F (38.8 C). 2  An adult with a fever that lasts longer than 3 days. 3  Low-grade fever: 4  Temperature less than 101 degrees F (38.3 C).
Generally, a child is considered to have a fever if the temperature is at or above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit rectally, 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit orally, or 99 degrees Fahrenheit in the armpit. In an adult, a fever is generally defined as 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) or greater. A fever is an increase in the body temperature above normal. A low-grade fever is a mild elevation of the temperature above normal. Your temperature measurements fluctuate through the day and vary depending upon the site of measurement.
A fever is a body temperature above 100.4°F. A normal oral temperature for a resting, healthy adult is about 98.6°F (37°C) (for someone over 70 normal temp is 96.8°F (36°C)). Your temperature can go up or down 1 to 2 degrees throughout the day. Fever is a sign of inflammation or infection and is a common symptom of illness. Fever is not a disease. 
A fever, or pyrexia, is a rise in internal body temperature to levels that are considered to be above normal. Average body temperature is about 98.6°F or 37°C, and temperatures above 100.4°F or 38°C are generally considered to be febrile. Body temperature is determined by the body's thermoregulatory set-point. 
Definition. A fever is a temporary increase in your body temperature, often due to an illness. Having a fever is a sign that something out of the ordinary is going on in your body.

Consequently, an accurate measurement of body temperature (best is rectal core temperature) of 100.4 F (38 C) or above is considered to be a fever.. A newer option includes a temperature-sensitive infrared device that measures the temperature in the skin by simply rubbing the sensor on the body. Low-grade fevers range from about 100 F-101 F; 102 F is intermediate grade for adults but a temperature at which adults should seek medical care for an infant (0-6 months).
1 A person is considered feverish if oral temperature is above 100 F (37.8 C) or rectal temperature is above 100.7 F (38.2 C). 2  Temperatures measured under the armpit are not considered as accurate and can be as much as 1 degree F lower than an oral measurement. 1 Temperatures measured under the armpit are not considered as accurate and can be as much as 1 degree F lower than an oral measurement. 2  A temperature below 100.4 F (38 C) is considered a low-grade or mild fever.
Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period. Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C)
