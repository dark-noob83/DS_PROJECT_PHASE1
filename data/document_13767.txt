The Institute of Medicine recommends infants ages 0 to 6 months consume 31 grams of fat per day, and babies ages 7 to 12 months eat 30 grams of fat each day. This recommendation includes 500 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids for all infants ages 0 to 12 months. Babies can get omega-3s from breast milk or infant formula. Therefore, a toddler who consumes 1,000 calories would require 33 to 45 grams of fat each day. The Institute of Medicine recommends toddlers ages 1 to 3 consume 700 milligrams of omega-3s each day. Ask your pediatrician about purified omega-3 oils for children.
Total Fat Intake. The American Heart Association recommends that from the ages of 2 to 3 only 30 to 35 percent of your child's daily calories come from fat. And since a single gram of fat is equivalent to 9 calories, a 1,300-calorie diet can consist of 43 to 50 g of dietary fat. You also need to watch her intake of saturated fat. According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, no more than 10 percent of your child's daily calories should come from saturated fat, regardless of age or gender. In a 1,300-calorie diet, that's 14 or fewer grams
Total fat intake isn't the only concern in a child's diet. You also need to watch her intake of saturated fat. According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, no more than 10 percent of your child's daily calories should come from saturated fat, regardless of age or gender.

Don’t restrict a child's fat intake before age 2 because that can affect brain development. Starting at age 2, your child should get 30 to 35 percent of calories from fat. And starting from age 4, your child should get 20 to 35 percent of calories from fat – or the same percentage of fat that you eat as part of a healthy diet. Childhood is the ideal time to establish heart-healthy eating patterns that can last a lifetime. 
by Elizabeth Scherer. First, you need to know how many calories you should eat each day.

Since the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 recommend children within this age range consume 1,000 to 1,400 calories a day and fat provides 9 calories per gram, toddlers ages 2 to 3 should consume 33 to 62 grams of fat per day. For example, girls eating 1,500 calories a day should aim for 42 to 58 grams of fat, while boys consuming 1,600 calories a day need 44 to 62 grams of fat daily.
The amount of fat children should consume each day is based on their age and caloric needs. The Institute of Medicine suggests toddlers ages 2 to 3 need 30 to 40 percent of their daily calories from fat. For example, girls eating 1,500 calories a day should aim for 42 to 58 grams of fat, while boys consuming 1,600 calories a day need 44 to 62 grams of fat daily.

Therefore, a toddler who consumes 1,000 calories would require 33 to 45 grams of fat each day. The Institute of Medicine recommends toddlers ages 1 to 3 consume 700 milligrams of omega-3s each day.
