This ultrasound, also known as a level II ultrasound, is used to look in more detail for possible birth defects or other problems with the baby that were suggested in the previous screening tests. It is usually completed between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy.
This test is usually recommended for women who have a higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome or in response to risk detected by one of the previous tests.

Prenatal testing is used to detect changes in a fetusâ€™s genes or chromosomes before birth. This type of testing is offered during pregnancy if there is an increased risk that the baby will have a genetic or chromosomal disorder. The Centre for Genetics Education offers an overview of prenatal testing, as well as fact sheets about preimplantation genetic diagnosis, screening tests during pregnancy, and diagnostic tests during pregnancy.
Predictive and presymptomatic types of testing are used to detect gene mutations associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful to people who have a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. The Centre for Genetics Education offers an overview of prenatal testing, as well as fact sheets about preimplantation genetic diagnosis, screening tests during pregnancy, and diagnostic tests during pregnancy.

The first trimester screening tests are usually done between the 10th and 13th week of pregnancy. They involve measuring the level of certain substances in the mother's blood and obtaining an ultrasound. Genetic screening tests can be done during the second trimester as well.
Genetic testing is the analysis of chromosomes (DNA), proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related genotypes, mutations, phenotypes, or karyotypes for clinical purposes.. It can provide information about a person 's genes and chromosomes throughout life. 1 Diagnostic testing can be performed at any time during a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. 2  The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about health care and the management of the disease.
