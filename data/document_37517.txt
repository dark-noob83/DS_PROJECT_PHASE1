The minimum salary for an NHL rookie is $ 875,00. However, he can earn a set amount of what is called Schedule A and Schedule B bonuses from both the team and league. Correction: $875,000 is the MAXIMUM entry-level salary. (Not counting bonuses.) The minumum salary for a rookie is the same as any other player; $500,000 in 09-10 and 10-11, then $525,000 for the 11-12 season. Article 9 of the NHL CBA limits the maximum yearly compensation for rookies to just over $1 million in salary and 50% of that in signing, reporting and roster bonuses. Performance bonuses are not affected.
Currently he has two years left on his deal at $8-million and $5.5-million. At $8-million, he will be 11.5% of Tampa Bay’s overall salary cap this coming season. When he becomes a free agent following the 2015-16 season, he’ll certainly be the only possible candidate for a max contract. Chicago will have just over 38% of their cap locked up in two players. If they were to give even one of these players the max (of a $72-million cap), they would then have over 39% of their cap locked up in these two forwards. So will there ever be a max contract in the NHL. No. It’s far too much to devote to one player who may be injured during any given season or might have an off year. If Crosby, Malkin, and Ovechkin aren’t worth 20% of a team’s cap, it’s safe to say that no player will ever be worth the maximum compensation
Max Number of Contracts: NHL teams are only allowed to have a maximum of 50 NHL contracts. This includes the NHL, AHL, and ECHL. Picking Up Salary: Note that currently, GMs are not permitted to pick up a portion of a player's salary/cap hit to alleviate possible trade complications. 
The NHL's minimum wage is scheduled to increase in the coming years reaching $650,000 in 2017-2018, $700,000 in 2019-2020, and $750,000 in 2021-2022.

Now, as it’s explained, a players salary for the entirety of their contract cannot exceed the maximum player compensation of the year that they signed the contract. In other words, Shea Weber signed his contract in 2012 when the cap was $70.2-million and the player maximum was just over $14-million. Chicago will have just over 38% of their cap locked up in two players. If they were to give even one of these players the max (of a $72-million cap), they would then have over 39% of their cap locked up in these two forwards. So will there ever be a max contract in the NHL. No. It’s far too much to devote to one player who may be injured during any given season or might have an off year. If Crosby, Malkin, and Ovechkin aren’t worth 20% of a team’s cap, it’s safe to say that no player will ever be worth the maximum compensat
Players who are 22 and 23 (and have never played an NHL game before) have a 2 yr entry level contract, and players who are 24 only have a 1 yr contract. The contract is predefined with a maximum salary (it increases annually as part of the CBA), and maximum incentives. This year that value is set at $875. Players between the ages of 18 and 21 must sign entry-level contracts for their first three NHL seasons. Those aged 22-23 are entry-level players for two years, those aged 24 for a single year. An entry-level player can earn a maximum of $850,000 per year. The limit rises throughout the agreement, to $925,000 in 2011.
The NHL salary cap is formally titled the Upper Limit of the Payroll Range in the new CBA. For the 2005–06 NHL season, the salary cap was set at US$ 39 million per team, with a maximum of $7.8 million (20% of the team's cap) for a player. Like many professional sports leagues, the NHL has a salary cap to keep teams in larger markets (with more revenue) from signing all of the top players and extending their advantage over smaller-market franchises. A salary cap existed in the early days of the National Hockey League (NHL).
In 2014-15, the NHL set it’s salary cap at $69-million – but any hockey fan already has that number engrained in their head. Instead, there’s a larger question – not just for this season – that surrounds the discussion of the NHL’s cap era. Chicago will have just over 38% of their cap locked up in two players. If they were to give even one of these players the max (of a $72-million cap), they would then have over 39% of their cap locked up in these two forwards. So will there ever be a max contract in the NHL. No. It’s far too much to devote to one player who may be injured during any given season or might have an off year. If Crosby, Malkin, and Ovechkin aren’t worth 20% of a team’s cap, it’s safe to say that no player will ever be worth the maximum compensation
