The method used to extract a metal from its ore depends on where the metal is in the reactivity series. Metals above Carbon in the Reactivity Series. A metal above carbon in the reactivity series (potassium, sodium, lithium, calcium, magnesium and aluminium) can be extracted by electrolysis. Extraction of the metal from its ore involves reduction of the metal ions. Electrons are able to reduce any metal ion.
The method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series. Gold, because it is so unreactive, is found as the native metal and not as a compound [compound: A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements. ] .
1 A brief note on some of the uses of reactive metals and their compounds relating to this page: 2  Many of the metals give bright flame colours when burnt in air, and the same colours are seen when a compound of the metal is heated strongly in a bunsen flame e.g. calcium/lithium give red, sodium yellow.
The Earth's crust [crust: The outer layer of the Earth, on top of the mantle. It is between 6 and 48 kilometres thick and includes the continents and the ocean floor. ] contains metals and metal compounds compounds: Substances formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
Ores are naturally occurring rocks that contain metal or metal compounds in sufficient amounts to make it worthwhile extracting them. The method used to extract a given metal from its ore depends upon the reactivity of the metal and so how stable the ore is.
A metal ore is a rock containing a metal, or a metal compound, in high enough concentration to make it economic to extract the metal. Ores are mined. They may need to be concentrated before the metal is extracted and purified. The economics of using a particular ore may change over time.
