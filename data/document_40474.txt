(occurs at neuro muscular junction). At the end of the skeletal muscle fibre, there is a single motor neuron that forms many finer branches. At the end of these branches is a synaptic terminal which contain mitochondria and vesicles which in turn contain ACh.
The acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle cell. Activation of the nicotin … ic receptor opens its intrinsic sodium/potassium channel, causing sodium to rush in and potassium to trickle out. 3 people found this useful.
3. Describe the process of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle fibers. ACH is released at the end-plate potential. ACH diffuses into the sarcolemma, attaches to the receptors in the motor end plate and causes a change in the ions permeability that creates graded depolarization of

It controls the contraction of all skeletal or voluntary muscles, for instance. It also affects the contraction of smooth and cardiac muscle.
(2) A motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord is activated, and an action potential passes outward in a ventral root of the spinal cord. (3) The axon branches to supply a number of muscle fibers called a motor unit, and the action potential is conveyed to a motor end plate on each muscle fiber.
The role ATP plays in muscle contraction is that ATP binds to sites  on myosin heads, inducing a conformational change in the actin  binding site and reducing the affinity f … or the actin substrate.  Hydrolysis of ATP then cocks the myosin head and moves it closer to  the z disk.
