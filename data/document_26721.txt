A urine sample is a painless way for your doctor to evaluate your health and test for abnormalities. One thing your doctor may check for in your urine sample test (urinalysis) is specific gravity. A urine specific gravity test compares the density of urine to the density of water. This quick test can help determine how efficiently your kidneys are diluting your urine. Urine that’s too concentrated may indicate that your kidneys aren’t functioning properly, or simply that you aren’t drinking enough water.
Description. Urinary specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine. Urine osmolality is a more specific test for urine concentration; however, urine specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis.
Reference Range. Urinary specific gravity (SG) is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine. It measures the ratio of urine density compared with water density and provides information on the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine. A urinary specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis.
Specific gravity measures the kidney's ability to concentrate or dilute urine in relation to plasma. Because urine is a solution of minerals, salts, and compounds dissolved in water, the specific gravity is greater than 1.000. The more concentrated the urine, the higher the urine specific gravity.
