orca have long life expectancies 60 to 80 years for females and 40 60 years for the males females have the ability to reproduce as early as 14 years of age but it is more common to see a female first calf at around 17 to 18 years old 
orcas in the wild have an average life expectancy of 30 to 50 years their estimated maximum lifespan is 60 to 70 years for males and 80 to over 100 for females the average age of death for orcas who have died at seaworld is 13 years old 
there are many questions about how long orcas live in captivity compared to how long they live in the ocean in the 2013 documentary film blackfish howard garrett said the following we knew by 1980 after a half a dozen years of research that they killer whales live equivalent to human life spans 
whale lifespan some whales have a lifespan similar to humans particularly the blue and the fin whales as they reach up to 85 years old the life cycle of a whale varies from type to type but the best known species have the following humpback whales live about 45 100 years gray whales live 25 to 80 years blue whales live over 80 90 years fin whales live about 85 90 years minke whales live 40 to 50 years
while animals such as the beluga whale and killer whale can be found in captivity the largest living animal in the world the blue whale is too large to be held in captivity however over the years the blue whale has become very popular among whale watchers these whales are estimated to live to at least 80 years the bowhead whale has an average lifespan of 100 200 years the fin whale has an average lifespan of 60 100 years the gray whale has an average lifespan of 50 70 years the humpback whale has an average lifespan of 4
average lifespan of whales the beluga whale has an average lifespan of 40 60 years the blue whale has an average lifespan of 70 90 years the bowhead whale has an average lifespan of 100 200 years the fin whale has an average lifespan of 60 100 years the gray whale has an average lifespan of 50 70 years the humpback whale has an average lifespan of 40 100 years
individual whales can live much longer the maximum lifespan has been estimated at up to 90 years for females and 70 years for males depending on the study most of seaworld s whales are far younger only one has so far lived into her 40s 
at least 151 orcas have been taken into captivity from the wild since 1961 including pascuala and morgan 127 of these orcas are now dead in the wild male orcas live to an average of 30 years maximum 50 60 years and 46 years for females maximum 80 90 years
the whale species is known to have several of the longest known living animals in the world with several species living for 100 years or more however estimating the life expectancy of 80 90 or so various species of cetacea cetaceans include all species of whale dolphin and porpoise can be a very challenging task the bowhead whale has an average lifespan of 100 200 years the fin whale has an average lifespan of 60 100 years the gray whale has an average lifespan of 50 70 years the humpback whale has an average lifespan of 4
when a blue whale exhales the spray from its blowhole can reach nearly 30 ft 9m into the air size relative to a bus blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on earth these magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet 30 meters long and upwards of 200 tons 181 metric tons their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant their hearts as much as an automobile
