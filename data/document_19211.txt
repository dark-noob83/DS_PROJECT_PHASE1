An infant’s eyes may change color or darken during the first 3 to 6 months of his life, explains KidsHealth from Nemours. Occasionally, the process takes even longer. Your baby’s eye color becomes firmly established by 6 to 12 months, Sutter Health reports. Once your baby reaches his first birthday, his eyes will most likely remain the same general color for the rest of his life.
Babies of African and Asian descent are usually born with brown eyes that stay brown. Caucasian babies are often born with steel gray or dark blue eyes; they may stay gray or blue or turn green, hazel, or brown by the time they're 9 months old. That's because a child's irises (the colored part of the eye) may gain more pigment in the months after she's born, but they won't get lighter or more blue.
1 Two brown-eyed parents are likely (but not guaranteed) to have a child with brown eyes. 2  If you notice one of the grandparents has blue eyes, the chances of having a blue-eyed baby go up a bit. 3  If one parent has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes, odds are about even on eye color.
}. Depending on the eye color in your family, your baby’s eyes may be their permanent color at six months or a year of age. If their eyes start brown or turn brown during their first year, they will have brown eyes.
Usually your baby's eye color at 6 to 9 months should be close to the permanent hue. What color your baby's eyes will ultimately be depends on the kinds of dominant and recessive genes she received from you and your husband at the time of conception.
Most experts think that your baby's eye color will either stay the same or will darken over the first six to nine months of her life. So gray or blue eyes can turn brown, green, or hazel, but brown eyes likely won't lighten and become blue. Unfortunately, you will likely just have to wait and see what they do.
Usually babies eyes take on the colour they will be within the first 12 months but generally you have a good idea around 6 months.
