Weltanschauung. BIBLIOGRAPHY. Weltanschauung is a German word that often is translated as “ worldview ” or “ world outlook ” but just as frequently is treated as a calque or left untranslated. A Weltanschauung is a comprehensive conception or theory of the world and the place of humanity within it. It is an intellectual construct that provides both a unified method of analysis for and a set of solutions to the problems of existence.
Weltanschauung is used as an English word, from the German because the English worldview is too vague and not comprehensive enough. (For anschauen = to look at, rather with the meaning to take a good look at, for schau = to show, display, as opposed to blicken = to look, or aussehen from sehen = to see).
A true weltanschauung is far different from the random, eclectic stew of likes, dislikes and ad hoc opinions that most people have. Perhaps we can better understand what a weltanschauung is, if we first consider what it is not. It is not an agglomeration of acquired facts.

Weltanschauung is a calque of world view. Often, calques gain traction when translation of the word is either inelegant or does not justify the word's deeper meaning (e.g., Zeitgeist). Weltanschauung appears to be an important concept in cognitive philosophy.
