Fitbit Flex. The Fitbit Flex is the same price as the One, but the Flex is a wristband model. It does not track floors climbed and does not have a display. It tracks your activities but you have to use the app or the web interface to see your progress.
I started with a FitBit Zip 4 years ago and now use the FitBit Charge HR which tracks steps, stairs, has an activity timer and a heart rate monitor all in one. It's also a watch. As far as if these devices are worth it, I know that using a tracking device motivates me.
I love that you can see your steps, you can see your activity level, you can even track your sleep. I also love that it integrates with myfitnesspal so you can enter you foods into http://www.myfitnesspal.com and it will sync up to your fitbit (as long as you’ve allowed that to happen).
There were very few drawbacks to using FitBit. The biggest one is that it’s so small I kept losing it. Fortunately I usually found it still clipped on the last shirt I wore, but still, a beeping locator would be really nice.
Fitbit priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $20 a share on Wednesday night, up from the expected range of $17 to $19 a share. That means Wall Street thinks Fitbit is worth $4.1 billion. Fitbit will debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FIT, starting Thursday morning.
But the FitBit is worth it because it is petite and easy to use, with user-friendly software that provides strong motivations to keep using it as a lifestyle tool instead of tossing it in the kitchen drawer. ______________________________________________________.

Fitbit stores minute-by-minute data for about seven days or daily data for 30 days. The device can last at least five to seven days without a charge, the company said. I was skeptical about whether a pedometer would help me, because I already document my workouts using Android apps and my GPS watch.
I got a Fitbit One for Christmas and I love it!! It is a great motivator. I have my goal steps for the day at 10,000. I've met that goal only 3 times, but it really gets me going. I think it has helped me get over a bit of a plateau I was on just because I am trying to move more to reach my goal.
