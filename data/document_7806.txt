Vitamin D may play a key role in thyroid health and function. Vitamin D serves many important functions in your body. Research continues to lead to discovery of new and exciting roles for this vitamin. One important interaction is that of vitamin D and thyroid function. While vitamin D is not required for thyroid hormone production, it may modulate the function of your thyroid function through other pathways.
Importantly, both vitamin D and thyroid hormone bind to similar receptors called steroid hormone receptors. A different gene in the Vitamin D receptor was shown to predispose people to autoimmune thyroid disease including Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
Researchers at UCLA tried to show that low vitamin D1 would make an autoimmune thyroid problem worse. Their experiment was based on the idea that vitamin D has a dampening effect on an excessive and inappropriate immune response in many areas of your body.
About Vitamin D. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a role in the balance of calcium in your body. The two types you will encounter are vitamin D2 and D3. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants and vitamin D3 is produced from cholesterol in your body after exposure to the sun.
Vitamin D and Your Thyroid Gland Vitamin D is quickly becoming an all-important vitamin. Although it is naturally produced in the skin, most people never receive enough of it in this way. Therefore, there is a need for constant supplementation. Some recent clinical studies show that vitamin D deficiency is closely related to thyroid problems. This article identifies the thyroid problems linked with vitamin D deficiency and discusses how vitamin D supplementation can help treat thyroid disorders.
Vitamin D and Thyroid Function. A study presented at the European Congress of Endocrinology in 2011 examined the interaction of serum vitamin D levels and TSH in patients with an autoimmune thyroid condition called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
