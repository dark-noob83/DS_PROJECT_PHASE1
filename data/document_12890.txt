The kidneys are surrounded by a fibrous, transparent renal capsule; a fatty adipose capsule that cushions the organ; and an outer fibrous renal fascia that anchors the kidney to surrounding structures. Internal Anatomy. There are three distinct regions of the kidney: the cortex, the medulla, and the renal pelvis. Nephrons are the structural and functional units of the kidneys that carry out processes that form urine. Each nephron consists of a renal corpuscle composed of a tuft of capillaries (the glomerulus), surrounded by a glomerular capsule (Bowman s capsule) and a renal tubule.

Each nephron consists of a renal corpuscle composed of a tuft of capillaries (the glomerulus), surrounded by a glomerular capsule (Bowman s capsule) and a renal tubule.
Each nephron is composed of an initial filtering component (the  renal corpuscle ) and a tubule specialized for reabsorption and secretion (the renal tubule). The renal corpuscle filters out solutes from the blood, delivering water and small solutes to the renal tubule for modification. Kidney nephron drawing with labels of the following: the Bowman's capsule, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, descending limb of loop of Henle, ascending limb of loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct.
These 10 facts about space will blow your mind. The renal capsule is a thin yet tough layer of fibrous connective tissue that surrounds each of the two kidneys. The primary components of this tissue are the proteins elastin and collagen. A dialysis machine, which is used for those with renal failure. A diagram of a kidney, including the renal capsule in pink. Long-term use of illicit drugs may cause kidney health to become compromised.
The renal capsule is a tough fibrous layer surrounding the kidney and covered in a thick layer of perinephric adipose tissue. It provides some protection from trauma and damage. The renal capsule relates to the other layers in the following order (moving from innermost to outermost): 1  renal medulla. 2  renal cortex. 3  renal capsule.
The Bowman's capsule is composed of two layers of cells: an inner layer that closely covers the glomerulus, and an outer layer that is continuous with the inner layer and with the wall of the renal tubule. The renal tubule ... Click to read more below. The Bowman's capsule is an expansion at the closed end of a renal tubule. A kidney's renal corpuscle is composed of tangled clusters of blood capillaries, called a glomerulus, and a thin-walled, saclike structure called the Bowman's capsule, which surrounds the glomerulus. 
Renal capsule is a layer of fiber surrounding kidneys. It provides  protection against damage and trauma to the renal system. Moving  from innermost to the outermost layer o â€¦ f the renal system, renal  capsule is the third layer. exists and is an alternate of. Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. The role of this covering is to support the mass of the kidneys as well as provide protection for the delicate tissues of the kidneys.
The fatty tissue covering the renal capsule helps to cushion the kidney and provide shock resistance during movement. This is of significant importance because the kidneys do have a limited amount of space in which to move around within the body. A dialysis machine, which is used for those with renal failure. A diagram of a kidney, including the renal capsule in pink. Long-term use of illicit drugs may cause kidney health to become compromised.
In the Bowman's capsule, the artery splits up into a network of capillaries called the glomerulus. These capillaries join into a single vessel again as they leave the capsule, and then split into a second set of capillaries that are wrapped around the renal tubule. The blood leaves the tubule in the renal vein. Each kidney contains about a million tiny structures called nephrons. A nephron has a cup-shaped Bowman's capsule leading into the renal tubule. The two sections of each nephron extend across the two different regions of the kidney: 1  the Bowman's capsules are found within the outer cortex region. 2  the renal tubules run from the cortex into the darker medulla
