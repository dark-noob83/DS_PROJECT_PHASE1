Standard drivers for women are an 1 inch shorter than standard men's drivers. Previously, the standard length for a woman's driver was 43 inches.
For example, if you are 6-feet tall and your wrist-to-floor measurement is 35 inches, a standard length driver -- 44 inches for a steel shaft driver and 45 inches for a graphite shaft driver -- would be appropriate.
The standard length of a driver for men used to be 43.5 inches with a steel shaft and 44 inches for a graphite shaft. However, in the 21st century a standard driver is considered to be 45 inches.
Every golfer wants to hit the ball farther, and the quest for maximum length has led many 21st century golfers to opt for drivers with shafts that are 1 to 3 inches longer than the standard recommended length. However, the longer the shaft the harder it is to control the club and hit the ball squarely.
Drivers and Other Clubs. Clubs other than drivers gradually get shorter -- if a 44-inch steel shaft driver is indicated by the chart, your 5-iron will measure 38 inches and sand wedge 35.5 inches. Graphite clubs are slightly longer, with a standard driver at 45 inches, 5-iron at 38.5 inches and a sand wedge 36 inches. Standard club lengths for women are one inch shorter than for men. Whether these club lengths make sense is another question.
Women's Drivers. Standard drivers for women are an 1 inch shorter than standard men's drivers. Previously, the standard length for a woman's driver was 43 inches. As of 2012, it's 44 inches.
There is no standard, industry-wide maximum height for children's golf clubs, but there is a club length chart for juniors on the Clubmaker.net website. The maximum listed club length is 38 to 39 inches for a youngster who is 5 feet tall. PING makes youth sets with drivers as long as 39 inches that are appropriate for 10-to-11 year olds who are 54 to 60 inches tall.
