Current is a scalar quantity (though in circuit analysis, the direction of current is relevant). The SI unit of electrical current is the ampere, defined as 1 coulomb/second. Definition: Electrical current is a measure of the amount of electrical charge transferred per unit time. It represents the flow of electrons through a conductive material.
A current of 1 ampere means that there is 1 coulomb of charge passing through a cross section of a wire every 1 second. To test your understanding, determine the current for the following two situations. Note that some extraneous information is given in each situation. (The current is 12 C / 3 s or 4 Amperes at point A. Since current is everywhere the same, it is also 4 Amperes at point E. So the ratio of Q to t is 4 C / s.). f. False. The current is everywhere the same within an electric circuit.
In physics, power is the rate of doing work. It is equivalent to an amount of energy consumed per unit time. In the SI system, the unit of power is the joule per second (J/s), known as the watt in honour of James Watt, the eighteenth-century developer of the steam engine. 
Electric current is defined as the rate at which charge flows through a surface (the cross section of a wire, for example). Despite referring to many different things, the word current is often used by itself instead of the longer, more formal electric current. This means that the coulomb is defined as the amount of charge that passes through a surface when a current of one ampere ampère flows for one. [Second = C].

The influence of charges is characterized in terms of the forces between them (Coulomb's law) and the electric field and voltage produced by them. One Coulomb of charge is the charge which would flow through a 120 watt lightbulb (120 volts AC) in one second. Two charges of one Coulomb each separated by a meter would repel each other with a force of about a million tons! The rate of flow of electric charge is called electric current and is measured in Amperes. In most DC electric circuits, it can be assumed that the resistance to current flow is a constant so that the current in the circuit is related to voltage and resistance by Ohm's law. The standard abbreviations for the units are 1 A = 1C/s.
See Answer Answer: D Current is the rate at which charge flows. Charge will not flow in a circuit unless there is an energy source capable of creating an electric potential difference and unless there is a closed conducting loop through which the charge can move. Answer: D. Current is the rate at which charge flows. Charge will not flow in a circuit unless there is an energy source capable of creating an electric potential difference and unless there is a closed conducting loop through which the charge can move. 2. (The current is 12 C / 3 s or 4 Amperes at point A. Since current is everywhere the same, it is also 4 Amperes at point E. So the ratio of Q to t is 4 C / s.). f. False. The current is everywhere the same within an electric circuit.
Science Physics for Kids. Current is the flow of an electric charge. It is an important quantity in electronic circuits. Current flows through a circuit when a voltage is placed across two points of a conductor. 1 The flowing of electric current through a wire can sometimes be thought of like the flowing of water through a pipe. 2  The electrical conductivity of a material is the measurement of the ability of the material to allow for the flow of electrical current.
