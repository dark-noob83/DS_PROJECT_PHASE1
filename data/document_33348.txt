1 The five-year relative survival rate for people with HL has more than doubled, from 40 percent in whites from 1960-1963 (only data available) to 87.7 percent for all races in 2004-2010. 2  The five-year relative survival rate is 93.7 percent for people with HL who were less than 45 years old at diagnosis. 1 From 1975 to 1977, the five-year relative survival rate for the total population with leukemia was 34.2 percent, and from 2004 to 2010, the overall relative survival rate was 60.3 percent. 2  From 2004-2010, the five-year relative survival rates overall were. 3  CML - 59.9 percent.
For example, the 5-year survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2003-2007 was 91 percent for children younger than 15 years compared with 78 percent for adolescents ages 15 to 19 years (6). The 5-year overall survival rate among adolescents ages 15 to 19 years with cancer exceeded 80 percent in 2003-2007, similar to that among younger children (6). However, for specific diagnoses, survival is lower for 15- to 19-year-olds than for younger children.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer that affects the white blood cells. These cells fight infection and help protect the body against disease. Patients with ALL have too many immature white blood cells in their bone marrow. These cells crowd out normal white blood cells. Without enough normal white blood cells, the body has a harder time fighting infections. Siblings of children with leukemia have a slightly higher risk of developing ALL, but the rate is still quite low: no more than 1 in 500.
1 Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) occurs more commonly in adults than in children, and more commonly in men than women. 2  It is treated with chemotherapy. 3  The five-year survival rate is 40%, except for APL (Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia), which has a survival rate greater than 90%. 1 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. 2  It also affects adults, especially those 65 and older. 3  Standard treatments involve chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 4  The survival rates vary by age: 85% in children and 50% in adults.
The success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person. Outcomes have improved in the developed world. The average five-year survival rate is 57% in the United States. In children under 15, the five-year survival rate is greater than 60 to 85%, depending on the type of leukemia. In children with acute leukemia who are cancer-free after five years, the cancer is unlikely to return. 1 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. 2  It also affects adults, especially those 65 and older. 3  Standard treatments involve chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 4  The survival rates vary by age: 85% in children and 50% in adults.
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The overall 5-year survival rate for children with AML has also increased over time, and is now in the range of 60% to 70%. However, survival rates vary depending on the subtype of AML and other factors. Survival rates for childhood leukemias. Survival rates are often used by doctors as a standard way of discussing a person’s prognosis (outlook). Some parents may want to know the survival statistics for children in similar situations, while others may not find the numbers helpful, or may even not want to know them.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer involving blood and bone marrow. This type of leukemia progresses at a fast rate, creating immature white blood cells called lymphocytes. ALL strikes about 6,000 people a year, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. 
The 5-year survival rate for children with ALL has greatly increased over time and is now more than 85% overall. The overall 5-year survival rate for children with AML has also increased over time, and is now in the range of 60% to 70%. However, survival rates vary depending on the subtype of AML and other factors. Survival rates for childhood leukemias. Survival rates are often used by doctors as a standard way of discussing a person’s prognosis (outlook). Some parents may want to know the survival statistics for children in similar situations, while others may not find the numbers helpful, or may even not want to know them.
Although only 150 infants are diagnosed with leukemia each year, their prognosis is not very encouraging. While older children who are diagnosed with leukemia have an 80 percent survival rate, the survival rate for infants is less than 50 percent. That’s because the biology of infant leukemia, as well as infants’ response to treatment, is very different from other childhood leukemias.
