Cytoplasmic droplets of the boar are progressively lost from the flagellum of boar spermatozoa during epididymal transit, at ejaculation and during the nitrogen cavitation technique for isolation of plasma membranes. The maximal potential contamination of cytoplasmic droplet internal vesicular membranes in plasma membrane fractions was determined to be 2.2% of the entire membrane surface area collected.
The cytoplasm comprises cytosol (the gel-like substance enclosed within the cell membrane) – and the organelles – the cell 's internal sub-structures. All of the contents of the cells of prokaryote organisms (such as bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus) are contained within the cytoplasm. Movement of calcium ions in and out of the cytoplasm is thought to be a signaling activity for metabolic processes. In plants, movements of the cytoplasm around vacuoles are known as cytoplasmic streaming.
Inclusions (Cytoplasmic) are non-living substances that may or may not be present in a cell, depending on the cell type. Inclusions are stored nutrients, secretory products, and pigment granules. Glycogen: Glycogen is the most common form of glucose in animals and is especially abundant in cells of muscles, and liver. It appears in electron micrograph as clusters, or rosette of beta particles that resemble ribosomes, located near the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

Recently, water channels have been detected on the cytoplasmic droplet in mice, rats and around midpiece membranes in man. These channels would become operative when spermatozoa are subjected to hypotonicity at ejaculation. Site of RVD channels: the cytoplasmic droplets. The cytoplasmic droplet is one site of osmolytes channels involved in RVD. In the mouse, K + channels, Cl − channels and K + –Cl − cotransporters, and in man K + and Cl − channels, have been located there, at the neck and along the midpiece.
Lipids: Lipids are triglycerides in storage form is the common form of inclusions, not only are stored in specialized cells (adipocytes) but also are located as individuals droplets in various cell type especially hepatocytes. Glycogen: Glycogen is the most common form of glucose in animals and is especially abundant in cells of muscles, and liver. It appears in electron micrograph as clusters, or rosette of beta particles that resemble ribosomes, located near the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
Third, the cytoplasmic droplet does not appear to migrate along the midpiece, because both testicular and ejaculated human spermatozoa have a cytoplasmic droplet behind the head (Figure 5a). The length of the human sperm midpiece (~4.0 µm (Ref. 96)) approximates that of the sperm head (~4.5 µm). Site of RVD channels: the cytoplasmic droplets. The cytoplasmic droplet is one site of osmolytes channels involved in RVD. In the mouse, K + channels, Cl − channels and K + –Cl − cotransporters, and in man K + and Cl − channels, have been located there, at the neck and along the midpiece.
It remains uncertain how the varied components of the cytoplasm interact to allow movement of particles and organelles while maintaining the cell’s structure. The flow of cytoplasmic components plays an important role in many cellular functions which are dependent on the permeability of the cytoplasm. Movement of calcium ions in and out of the cytoplasm is thought to be a signaling activity for metabolic processes. In plants, movements of the cytoplasm around vacuoles are known as cytoplasmic streaming.
