3.Nerves are found in the peripheral nervous system, while neurons are found in the brain, spinal cord and the peripheral nerves. 4.A neuron can also be called a neurone or a nerve cell. 5.Neurons conduct nerve impulses, while nerves transmit information to various parts of the body. The soma is the central part of the neuron, and the nucleus is found within the soma. Dendrites form extensions from the neuron, and axons are the extensions from the soma. Axons are fine structures, and they vary in number from hundreds to thousands.
A neuron is an individual cell in the PNS or CNS that can be excited and conduct impulses along its axon. A nerve is a bundle of multiple neuron fibers that each are carrying their own signals. They are protected by connective tissue. Eventually the neuron fibers diverge away from the nerve to reach their destination. A neuron is a nerve cell. A synapse is a gap between the sending and receiving neurons, where there are neurotransmitters responsible for transporting chemicals to the r … eceiving neuron.
Neuron. Interposed between the receptors and effectors are the conductile cells of the nervous system, the neurons. These are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system and ramify throughout an organism, forming an elaborate communication network. It is the single neuron that transmit the action potential of a stimulus or the replying motor signal along the axons dendrites and the cell body whereas, the nerves simply covey the axons to and from the CNS. The neurons are the oldest cells of the body
Nerve. A nerve, on the other hand, is a bundle of axons or dendrites wrapped in connective tissue that conveys impulses between the central nervous system and some other parts of the body. A typical nerve has a tough outer covering, epineurium. It is the single neuron that transmit the action potential of a stimulus or the replying motor signal along the axons dendrites and the cell body whereas, the nerves simply covey the axons to and from the CNS. The neurons are the oldest cells of the body
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: A nerve is a bundle of axons. A neuron is the basic cell of the nervous system and is made of the cell body, dendrites, and an axon. These structures can become ambiguous in some neurons. nerve are made up of axons. neuron is the stuructural and functional unit of life. nerves are sometimes also called neurons. nirman · 8 years ago.

Nerve vs. Neuron. Although nerve and neuron may sound similar to most people, they are, in fact, two different components of the body. However, they are closely related, as nerves are actually projections of neurons. There are three main types of nerves: Afferent nerves, efferent nerves and mixed nerves. The soma is the central part of the neuron, and the nucleus is found within the soma. Dendrites form extensions from the neuron, and axons are the extensions from the soma. Axons are fine structures, and they vary in number from hundreds to thousands.
Tweet. Key Difference: Neurons are specialized cells which are capable of transmitting signals between different parts of the body. Nerve is a bundle of fibers composed of neurons. Therefore, neurons and nerves are closely related. Nerve is a bundle of fibers composed of neurons. Neurons form the foundation of our nervous system. The word neuron was coined by the German scientist Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz in 1891. Neurons are delicate cells which have a large interconnected channel present inside the body.
