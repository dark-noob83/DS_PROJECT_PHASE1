Acipencer transmontanus. Also known as Pacific Sturgeon and Columbia Sturgeon.

Four barbels hang under the sturgeon's long, flattened snout in front of the mouth.
This is the only leaping fish to give caviar (which is sturgeon roe). Caviar is used in Herblore to make barbarian mixes. It is wise when gutting a full inventory's worth of sturgeon to leave one open space in the inventory, as unlike roe received from other leaping fish, caviar is received from every sturgeon gutted.
The Leaping sturgeon is a leaping fish which requires 70 Fishing, 45 Strength, and 45 Agility to be caught, providing 80 Fishing experience, 7 Strength experience, and 7 Agility experience.

Like most sturgeons, the beluga is anadromous, migrating upstream in rivers to spawn. The largest generally accepted record is of a female taken in 1827 in the Volga estuary at 1,571 kg (3,463 lb) and 7.2 m (24 ft). Several other records of aged sturgeon exceed 5 m (16 ft). These great sizes mark the beluga as the largest freshwater fish in the world.
