Time Frame. A grafted pecan tree can produce a small crop as soon as two years after its grafting, although it will typically take closer to five years to mature enough to produce a large crop. Some pecan trees may take 10 to 12 years to move beyond vegetative growth into fruiting maturity.
Pecan trees can grow to 70 feet tall have trunk diameters of 6 feet at full maturity. Trees can be spaced as close as 30 to 40 feet apart until they are about 15 years old, at which point they should be thinned. At 30 to 40 years old, pecan trees grow to a width of closer to 60 feet.

Pecan Tree Maturity. Pecan trees mature at different ages, depending on whether they are grown from seed for from a graft. Trees grown from seed usually bear their first crop at 10 to 14 years of age and reach full maturity at 18 to 22 years.
A pecan tree begins to bear fruit about three to four years after its graft date. Pecan trees are the largest tree in the hickory family, reaching a height of 100 to 140 feet at maturity. These trees are native to mid-western and southeastern states and require abundant moisture. The age at which pecan trees bear fruit depends on the variety and environmental factors.
For proper growth, pecan trees grow well in a soil pH of 5.5 and 6.5. Fertilize young trees with a 10-10-10 fertilizer in spring and summer, using one pound per 25 square feet. Fertilize bearing trees with 4 pounds of a 10-10-10 fertilizer per every inch of trunk diameter, up to 25 pounds per tree.
