1 Chlorophyll a is most abundant photosynthetic pigment, which is the only pigment found in all photosynthetic plants. 2  Chlorophyll absorbs light near both ends of the visible spectrum-the blue and red light and transmit or reflect green light. 3  Therefore, these appear to be green in colour.
Chlorophylla-a is the primary pigment for photosynthesis in plants, but the range of light absorption is extended by chlorophyll-b, beta-carotene and other accessory pigments. The variations of chlorophyll-b and the bacterial version are indicated above.
Photosynthetic cells contain special pigments that absorb light energy. Different pigments respond to different wavelengths of visible light. Chlorophyll, the primary pigment used in photosynthesis, reflects green light and absorbs red and blue light most strongly. In plants, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which contain the chlorophyll.
1 Out of these, the two important types of chlorophyll found in green plants are chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. 2  A chlorophyll molecules consists of two parts 3  -. Chlorophyll a is most abundant photosynthetic pigment, which is the only pigment found in all photosynthetic plants.
1 Chlorophyll a: This is the most abundant pigment in plants. 2  Chlorophyll a absorbs light with wavelengths of 430nm(blue) and 662nm(red). 3  It reflects green light strongly so it appears green to us. 4  It contains a hydrophobic (fat soluble) phytol chain that allow it to be embedded in a lipid membrane.
Chlorophyll, the photosynthetic pigment in chloroplasts, absorbs light energy. Plants appear green because chlorophyll does not absorb light in the yellow-green region of the visible spectrum. Yellow and green wavelengths of the spectrum are reflected or transmitted depending on the thickness of a leaf.

Pigments for Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis in plants is dependent upon capturing light energy in the pigment chlorophyll, and in particular chlorophyll a. This chlorophyll resides mostly in the chloroplasts and gives leaves their green color.
