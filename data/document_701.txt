Lithium is a mineral that has long been used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression. Although the drug can be toxic in high doses, lithium supplements may appeal to those seeking to treat brain illnesses with natural, over-the-counter remedies.
Lithium aspartate and lithium orotate are available over-the-counter and contain lower dosages of lithium than lithium carbonate, which must be prescribed by a doctor. Most proponents of low-dose lithium therapy such as Dr. Jonathan Wright recommend them equally.
Lithium orotate is a dietary supplement that can be used in small doses to treat conditions like manic depression, alcoholism, ADHD and ADD, depression, aggression, PTSD, Alzheimer's Disease and overall stress management.
But not enough is known about the safety of lithium orotate. Avoid using lithium orotate until more is known. Lithium can cause nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle weakness, fatigue, and a dazed feeling. These unwanted side effects often improve with continued use. Fine tremor, frequent urination, and thirst can occur and may persist
Lithium (Li) is a naturally occurring trace metal that belongs to the alkali family of chemical elements. In its carbonate and citrate form, lithium is often prescribed for bipolar disorder and OCD. Lithium aspartate and lithium orotate are both forms of lithium. Lithium aspartate is lithium salt bound to aspartic acid (an amino acid). Lithium orotate is lithium salt bound to orotic acid (also known as vitamin B13).
