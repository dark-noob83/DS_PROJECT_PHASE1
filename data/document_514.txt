It depends on your area, and the breeders in your area. In the suburbs of Chicago they can go up to $900, but I think that is a ridiculous price. Beagles are pretty common, you could go to Petfinder.com and find one that you could adopt from a shelter for a much lower cost like $800 or $500.
If you see a Beagle puppy priced at $250, this is a red flag. Alternatively, a $2500 Beagle is exceptionally expensive.

There is that notion that a Beagle puppy (or any other breed for that matter) “must be” 2 months old when purchased. Therefore, an unsold pup that is 9, 10, or even 11 weeks old will most likely be sold for much less money than his younger counterpart.
1 On average, a pocket beagle can cost anywhere from $250 to as much as $1,200. 2  A show-quality beagle that is in good health will tend to be near the higher price region, while your lower priced dogs are often found in dog pounds.
In Beagles. Well it kind of depends how old the dog is and where (what state) your in. my beagle cost around $600-$800 maybe but puppies are worth much more. Im sure if you adopt you can … get a cheaper and better deal.
Timing is critical in regard to the price of a Beagle puppy. There is a very small window of time in which pricing can be top dollar. Top, reputable breeders may take deposits on litters not even born yet, however once the pups reach the age of 8 weeks old, the price usually takes a dramatic drop.
