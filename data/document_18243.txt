Other coastal categories: 1  A cliffed coast or abrasion coast is one where marine action has produced steep declivities known as cliffs. 2  A flat coast is one where the land gradually descends into the sea. 3  A graded shoreline is one where wind and water action has produced a flat and straight coastline.
