Roast the tenderloin at 450 F for 10 to 15 minutes to aid browning, then reduce the oven to 325 F. Roast the tenderloin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part shows an internal temperature of 140 F. Remove the tenderloin from your oven and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest for 10 minutes before carving, which gives its internal temperature time to rise to 145 F, the temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for food safety.
1 Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices. 2  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist. 3  After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees.
Pan-roasting pork tenderloin Preheat your oven to 425ºF and coat an ovenproof skillet with oil. Sear the tenderloin over medium-high heat until it’s brown on all sides. Roast the tenderloin for 15 to 20 minutes until the internal temperature reads 145ºF.
Pan roasting. Pan searing and then finishing in a moderate oven (about 350 F, 175 C although there is flexibility here if you have other dishes to finish) is certainly one very effective method for cooking a pork tenderloin, but any method that brings it to the desired temperature will work.
1 Preheat oven to 500 degrees. 2  Remove tenderloin from refrigerator. 3  Season meat as desired. 4  Place seasoned meat in an uncovered roasting pan on a shelf in the bottom 1/3 of your oven. 5  Bake EXACTLY 5 1/2 minutes PER POUND. 6  Adjust +/- according to your oven's accuracy and heat retention.
With a pork tenderloin: Season the meat, sear all sides in a very hot pan, and then finish in the oven at 350°F (175°C) degrees until the internal temp. hits 145°F (63°C). Then let it sit for 10 minutes, and cut 'er up. If you need it done faster, a higher oven temp will accomplish this, but may compromise quality.
1 Place the tenderloin in a roasting pan. 2  Place the pan in the oven and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 3  Allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
