Salmon filet, salmon steak or a whole salmon. Before you grill salmon, you will want to decide which cut of fish you want to grill. Preparation and grilling times will vary a little based on the cut of fish you choose and the recipe you use. You can buy salmon as a filet, a steak or a whole salmon. Check what your recipe calls for before you choose a type to grill.
1 Marinades. 2  Recipes for marinades can provide additional flavor to salmon before grilling. 3  If you choose to use a marinade, do not let salmon (or any other fish) sit in a marinade more than 15 minutes before cooking, as the acidic ingredients will begin to break down the flesh and make it mushy.
Flip. The salmon will release itself from the grill when it's ready. Use a flat spatula to flip the salmon over when it's 60 percent cooked. A 1-inch-thick piece will cook in about 6 to 10 minutes. When it's done, remove it from the grill and let it rest.

For filets that are 1-inch thick, we grill the salmon for a total of about 8 minutes over a 500ÂºF fire. This should result in fish that is cooked medium to medium-well. Place each filet on the grill grate directly over the fire with the skin-side up.
4 minutes a side per inch of thickness. If grilling, oil the grates when med-high and put salmon on flesh side down. Turn a quarter turn after 2 minutes for grill marks. Flip after total of 4 minutes, reduce grill to medium for remaining 3-4 minutes.
