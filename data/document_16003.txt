Posted: 11:05 am, May 30, 2012. It’s not rocket science to know that the cost of building a satellite is high – it can cost between $200 million and $600 million to send one into orbit. However, in these frugal times, satellite operators are looking for ways in which they can cut costs, but not compromise on quality.
These can include computers, computer software and cameras. Another factor that contributes to the expense associated with satellites is the cost of putting one into orbit. It is estimated that a single satellite launch can range in cost from a low of about $50 million to a high of about $400 million. Launching a space shuttle mission can easily cost $500 million dollars, although one mission is capable of carrying multiple satellites and send them
The total cost of building and launching a commercial satellite is approximately $200,000,000 to $600,000,000 according to Telenor Satellite Broadcasting. Their site has a lot … of further information and can be found here: http://www.telenorsbc.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=410 200 million dollars.
Some of the factors that drive the cost of satellites are the equipment and materials used to build them. Transponders alone hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to maintain, while bandwidth cost per MHz is priced at a minimum of about $3,500 a month. Running a satellite at a 36MHz bandwidth will cost over $1.5 million a year.
