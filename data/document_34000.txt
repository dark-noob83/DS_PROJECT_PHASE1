ABC Ltd. is engaged in sale of footballs. Its cost per order is $400 and its carrying cost unit is $10 per unit per annum. The company has a demand for 20,000 units per year. Calculate the order size, total orders required during a year, total carrying cost and total ordering cost for the year. EOQ = SQRT(2 × 20,000 × 400/10) = 1,265 units
The cost of carrying inventory can be calculated by multiplying the cost of carrying a unit of inventory by the average number of units carried, usually for a year. If inventory is used at a steady pace, and restocked when empty, then the average number of units held would be the order size divided by 2. We can determine the ordering cost by calculating the number of orders in a year, and multiply this by the cost of each order. To determine the number of orders we simply divide the total demand (D) of units per year by Q, the size of each inventory order. D=Total demand (units). Q=Inventory order size (quantity).
Inventory carrying cost is a ratio which describes the relationship between the cost-of-owning-inventory-per-year and the inventory value. For example, if your inventory carrying cost is 25% and your annual average inventory is $1M, then your annual cost of owning inventory is $250K. The rule of thumb for inventory carrying cost is between 20% and 30%. Inventory carrying cost is different for every business.
Annual demand is 20,000 units so the company will have to place 16 orders (= annual demand of 20,000 divided by order size of 1,265). Total ordering cost is hence $64,000 ($400 multiplied by 16). Average inventory held is 632.5 ((0+1,265)/2) which means total carrying costs of $6,325 (i.e. 632.5 × $10). The company has a demand for 20,000 units per year. Calculate the order size, total orders required during a year, total carrying cost and total ordering cost for the year.
EXAMPLE: A firm’s inventory currently turns over 6 times per year, and the firm’s annual unit flow through the warehouse is 180,000 units. The firm’s average inventory is 180,000/6 or 30,000 units. Assume the carrying cost of inventory is 25% and the cost of a unit is $10. The inventory investment is 30,000 x $10 = $300,000. The annual inventory carrying cost is $300,000 x .25 = $75,000. If the firm increases inventory turnover from 6 to 9 turns per year and maintains the same level of product flow, the average inventory would be 180,000/9 = 20,000 units or $200,000. There are two important influences at work here. Carrying costs will now be $200,000 x .25 = $50,000 per year, which equates to an annual savings of $25,000 ($75,000 - $50,000). As the example demonstrates, inventory turnover is a critical performance metric to assess the effectiveness of inventory management.
(Total fixed costs + Total variable costs) / Total units produced. The cost per unit should decline as the number of units produced increases, primarily because the total fixed costs will be spread over a larger number of units (subject to the step costing issue noted above). Thus, the cost per unit is not constant. For example, ABC Company has total variable costs of $50,000 and total fixed costs of $30,000 in May, which it incurred while producing 10,000 widgets. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $50,000 variable costs) / 10,000 units = $8 cost per unit. In the following month, ABC produces 5,000 units at a variable cost of $25,000 and the same fixed cost of $30,000. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $25,000 variable costs) / 5,000 units = $11/unit. 
Over 65% of most companies do not compute inventory carrying costs, they use rough estimates ! Leading logistics experts place the cost of carrying inventory between 18% per year and 75% per year depending on the type of products and business ! 
The total inventory cost for a year for a business is simply the sum of the carrying cost and the ordering cost. The total inventory cost formula is below, and the total inventory cost calculator can be found on this website. C=Carrying cost per unit of inventory. Q=Inventory order size (quantity). We can see by the equation above that the carrying cost of inventory can be reduced by reducing the size of Q. This is usually achieved by reducing the amount of capital invested in inventory, as well as the space and expense required to store it. We can determine the ordering cost by calculating the number of orders in a year, and multiply this by the cost of each order. To determine the number of orders we simply divide the total demand (D) of units per year by Q, the size of each inventory order. D=Total demand (units). Q=Inventory order size (quantity).
Carrying cost or holding cost is the cost associated with keeping inventory on hand (storage, interest, insurance, taxes, and so on). Let's use $100. Calculate the numerator: 2 Annual Usage in units (100 units) Order Cost ($500) = $100,000. Divide the numerator ($100,000) by the Annual Carrying Cost per Unit ($100). This equals 1,000 units. Take the square root of 1,000 units. A simple way to find the square root is to raise a number to the 1/2 power.
