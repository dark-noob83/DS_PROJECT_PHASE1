If you are using WinZip 12 or later with JPG files, you can use Best method and compress your JPG files up to 20% more without loss of quality. With this setting, WinZip will use Jpeg compression with your JPG files and the result will be a Zipx file.
The amount of compression will vary depending on the file and its type. For example, text files (htmp. php,etc) can usually compress somewhat. Some files such as image and pdf files do not compress much at all. As for the types of compression available in 7-zip, I tested a txt file with each type. The top 4 compression formats, starting from the smallest, are .xz, .7z, .gz, and .zip.
Comparison. The zip format is not the only compression format in use. Other common compression formats include RAR and 7-zip. According to Igor Pavlov, developer of 7-zip, the standard zip format underperforms the other two formats by as much as 30 to 40 percent, depending on the type of data being compressed. In a test, Pavlov compressed a full installation of Google Earth 3.0.0616.
Therefore, such files don't get much, if any, smaller when they are added to a Zip file (.zip or .zipx). You would see a similar lack of compression if you zipped some files using maximum compression and then added that Zip file to another Zip file. This second Zip file would not be substantially smaller than the first one (it may even be slightly larger).
