Neural stem cells have been identified in the neurogenic brain regions, where neurogenesis is constitutively ongoing, but also in the non-neurogenic zones, such as the midbrain and the striatum, where neurogenesis is not thought to occur under normal physiological conditions.
The identification of two adult neurogenic zones, which contain astrocyte-like neural stem cells, has led to a dramatic increase in the number of studies looking at the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing neurogenesis.
Stem Cells and Neurogenesis. Neurogenesis refers to the birth of new brain cells; not until the late 1990s did scientists prove that this process occurs in the human adult brain.
Neurogenesis (birth of neurons) is the process by which neurons are generated from the neural stem cells and progenitor cells. Neurogenesis is most active during pre-natal development, and is responsible for populating the growing brain with neurons.
Research Topics. The section is dedicated to publishing new and important findings in the rapidly expanding field of neurogenesis and has a particular interest in the biology of postnatal neural stem cells and the neurogenic niche.
Introduction. Since the initial discovery that the adult brain contains stem cells that generate new neurons, an important question in neurobiology has been whether or not this adult neurogenesis is functionally important.
