On average, a sheet of plasterboard that is 4 feet by 8 feet and  1/2 inch thick is around 52 pounds. A sheet that is 4 feet by 12  feet and 1/2 inch thick is approximately … 77 pounds. 
The weight of mdf will depend on the grade and thickness of the  material. A grade mdf 3/4 inch thick in a 49x97 inch sheet size  weighs roughly 96 lbs. = 82 lbs.   5/8 thick standard drywall weighs 3.4 x 0.625 = 2.2 lbs per sq. ft.   4' x 8' x 5/8 thick sheet weighs about 70 lbs.   4' x 10' x 5/8 thick sheet weighs about 88 lbs.   4' x 12' x 5/8 thick sheet weighs about 105 lbs.
1. a single sheet of 3/4 4x8 mdf does not weight 96 lbs..not matter how good a quality it is, you may find that it FEELS like it does...but it does NOT. I will weight one of my sheets tomorrow and report back...i bet it is closer to 70lbs. i have weighted 1mdf and it was 84bs....and felt like 120lbs. My local supply shop has ultralight MDF which is about 20-25 lbs lighter and has the same properties (actually it is much easier to work with).
In it, they state that softwood plywood should weigh approximately 3 pounds per square foot, per inch of thickness. Actual plywood weight is slightly less, as the specification is for pre-sanded sheets. The organisation offers a bunch of technical informations and educative content. In the next chart, we’re going to compare the weight of other plywood products to Softwood plywood. For the sake of simplicity, we’re only going to compare 1/2” thick plywood. Click to sort by plywood weight or percentage.
Basically, since the resins and glues used to hold the wood together are heavier than the wood or wood fibers, the greater the percentage of glue or resin found in the plywood product, the greater the weight of the plywood.

Quoted: 18 Post(s). Liked: 38. It depends on how thick the MDF is ... I used 32mm (1& 1/4)thick MDF 2420x 1215 sheets to buld some subs and I can tell you that it was pretty weighty around 150lb per sheet easily.... Cheers....

Find out the density of MDF sheets from the material specification; the density of MDF ranges from 680 to 830 kg/cubic meters. For this example, the density is 700 kg/cubic meters. Multiply the volume of the MDF sheet by its density to calculate the sheet weight. In this example, the sheet weight is 0.0377 cubic meters x 700 kg/cubic meters, or 26.39 kg. Multiply the weight (in kg) of the sheet by 2.205 to convert the weight to pounds. In the example, it is 26.39 kg x 2.205, or 58.19 pounds. 
– Hardwood plywood typically weighs around 55 lbs. per 3/4-in.-thick sheet. Utility plywood can be much heavier, however. A 3/4-in.-thick sheet of BC fir plywood, for example, can weigh more than 70 lbs. By comparison, a full sheet of 1/4-in. birch plywood weighs only 12 lbs. – MDF is typically a whopping 96 lbs. per 3/4-in.-thick sheet. Ugh. The suggested maximum load for a car roof (check your owner’s manual) can be as low as 100 lbs., so it doesn’t take many sheets to max out your car
