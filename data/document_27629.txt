netflix with more than 20000 titles available for streaming kicks booty here hulu plus has a mere 2000 plus tv episodes both services will continue to stockpile titles of course so these numbers will continue to rise
more often than not a film you find on amazon prime will also be on netflix so netflix still wins here although hulu plus doesn t have a lot of movies it does have access to the criterion collection which is the perfect resource for classic award winning and critically acclaimed films from around the globe
however hulu plus does give you the option of customizing what kind of ads you see both amazon and netflix though are gloriously ad free although amazon prime does show short promos before each video for other series available on the service
amazon prime membership costs $ 99 per year or about $ 8 25 per month but also includes unlimited free two day shipping on many items you also get access to the company s growing selection of streaming tv shows and movies hulu plus costs $ 7 99 per month or $ 95 88 per year
the costs are all around the same but if you want movies go with netflix if you want next day tv episodes go with hulu plus if you want free shipping plus a streaming service go with amazon prime or you can do what most cord cutters do go with all three services with a total cost of around $ 24 23 per month you re still spending less than you would with cable or satellite
shows on hulu plus like their counterparts on the regular and free hulu will have commercials that s a bummer for subscribers but a second means of income for hulu netflix has no commercials that alone would make me choose netflix over hulu plus
