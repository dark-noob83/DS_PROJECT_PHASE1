Allegiant and JetBlue pay first year pilots $131, though JetBlue has a higher pay rate for their top fliers at $189 compared to Allegiant's $153. A lot of data can hide in averages, however. Delta pays their first year pilots, at the lowest, $173 an hour with the highest paid pilot hitting $263.00. Not every airline has a payscale that close, however. The lowest paid pilots at both U.S. Airways and American Airlines are making just $35 an hour while the highest is at $241.00.

On the low end, first-year pilots at US Airways would, theoretically, earn a minimum $21,600 a year. For that, they would work 72 hours a month at the controls of a plane (lots more hours are involved in flight preparations, overnights and sitting around waiting). But that’s the starting minimum by contract. Airline pilots typically can earn more with overtime, extra trips, per-diem allowances and bonus pay for international trips. At the top end of the airline scale, Southwest Airlines has a first-year minimum of $49,572.
