Dale Hollow is renowned for its fishing opportunities. In addition to yielding the world record smallmouth bass and being known as a trophy smallmouth lake, the Obey River below Dale Hollow Dam is also known for excellent rainbow and brown trout fishing.
Most of the fishing pressure on the Obey River is concentrated in the upper 3 km of the tailwater (Bettoli 1996). The trout section of the Obey River runs from the Dale Hollow Dam, about 12km (7.5 river miles), to its confluence with the Cumberland River. Boat ramps, public restrooms, and extensive picnicking facilities provide ample attraction to this tailwater.
The Obey River is a 7.5 mile tail water of the Dale Hollow Lake. This beautiful area is away from all the hustle and bustle and the perfect place for a peaceful float down the river. There are a couple options for using our boats on the Obey. One option is to use our shuttle service for drop-off and pick-up.
