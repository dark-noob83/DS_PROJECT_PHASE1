When you have fulfilled the requirements necessary to effect release, CBP will clear the package, note how much duty is owed, and return it to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for delivery. Usually, you will receive notification in a matter of days, but it can take as long as 30-45 days.

The package exits customs after anywhere from a few hours to a few days, then it's rush, rush, rush to your local post office, where afterward, you'll have your clothing within a few days.
