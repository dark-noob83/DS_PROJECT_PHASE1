Yahoo’s stock price has been tumbling since Alibaba Group debuted on the New York Stock Exchange Friday. As shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant gained Friday, the value of Yahoo’s YHOO core business deteriorated — and so did its stock price. Its investment in Alibaba is worth about $37 billion. Add in its 35% stake in Yahoo Japan — worth about $8.2 billion — and Yahoo’s core business turns out to be worth almost nothing. Or less than nothing, if that’s possible.
Analysts have tempered their annual outlook for the company’s sales, expecting Yahoo to bring in $4.35 billion, according to Bloomberg data. That would be the lowest level in nine years. Until now, most of Yahoo’s value has hinged on its investment in Alibaba. Its investment in Alibaba is worth about $37 billion. Add in its 35% stake in Yahoo Japan — worth about $8.2 billion — and Yahoo’s core business turns out to be worth almost nothing. Or less than nothing, if that’s possible.
Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO) core business is still in trouble, and its financials and fortunes still rely heavily on Yahoo Japan and its stake in Alibaba. The rising stock price has benefited the company's stockholders, even though this is largely due to the growing value of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Alibaba is easily Yahoo's best investment, but it also presents a problem. Yahoo's 24% stake is probably worth more than the entire $16 billion worth of assets on its balance sheet.
As I said in my earlier article, Alibaba is planning 3 IPOs and I expect the first to be worth $35-40 billion. So, Yahoo's gross proceeds for its 10% will be $3.5-4.0 billion. The value of Yahoo's remaining 14% stake will depend on how Alibaba's stock performs after the IPO. As part of my valuation of Alibaba, I regressed the Price to Trailing 12 Months [TTM] Sales [P/S], Price/Book Value of Equity [P/BVE] and Price/Book Value of Assets [P/BVA] for nine comparable firms including Yahoo.
Yahoo sold about $5.1 billion worth of Alibaba shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant’s IPO on Friday. Bloomberg News. As Alibaba shares soared in their first day of trading on Friday, the value that investors are placing on Yahoo ’s core business was sliced in half to about $6.8 billion. That’s because Yahoo still owns a large chunk –about 400 million shares — of the e-commerce giant after the IPO. Alibaba’s shares rose 38% on Friday, while Yahoo’s shares fell about 2.7%, so even more of Yahoo’s market capitalization is made up of non-core assets. Yahoo made about $5.1 billion in cash, net of taxes, from the sale of shares in the Alibaba IPO.
Yahoo investors have waited years for Alibaba's IPO, expecting the public value of the Chinese e-commerce giant's stock that Yahoo owns might send Yahoo's stock into the stratosphere. Alas. In the early hours following Alibaba's debut, Yahoo's stock was getting smashed. What you're left with is the value the market is attributing to Yahoo's core business: About -$500 million with Alibaba trading at $90. Yahoo has about a billion shares outstanding. If each are going for $40, Yahoo's core business makes up less than $0 of that price — theoretically, -$.50 per share.
But investors seem to be more concerned about Yahoo’s core business than the cash it forfeited. Yahoo’s market value is nearly $39 billion. Its investment in Alibaba is worth about $37 billion. Add in its 35% stake in Yahoo Japan — worth about $8.2 billion — and Yahoo’s core business turns out to be worth almost nothing. Or less than nothing, if that’s possible.
She can buy a whole lot more when she cashes in those Alibaba shares. Yahoo's 24% share might be worth about $36 billion. That's the estimate from RBC Capital Markets, which this week raised its price target for Yahoo to $44, from $38, citing the value of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba. Analyst Mark Mahaney also raised his estimate of the value of Yahoo's Alibaba stake to $36 billion, from $26.4 billion. Mahaney now estimates the value of Alibaba at $150 billion, up from $110 billion. This week's reason for enthusiasm about Alibaba Group is the news that the company would invest about $360 million in the Haier Group. Haier is a brand known in the US for its appliances.
