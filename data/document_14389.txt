Griseofulvin is a medicine which is used to treat fungal infections. It is mainly prescribed for infections occurring on the skin or scalp.
Griseofulvin, the newly available systemic antibiotic, shows clinical promise in the chemotherapy of superficial fungus infections (1). Oral, rather than topical, administration of this drug provides fungistatic levels effective clinically against the known species of dermatophytes.
Griseofulvin is a systemic antifungal agent that is effective against the common dermatophytes. It is practically insoluble in water and only slightly soluble in most organic solvents. Particle sizes of griseo-fulvin vary from 2.7 μm (ultramicrosized) to 10 μm (microsized).
Infection causes itching, hair loss, scales, and crusts that often take a circular pattern, giving the infection the name ringworm.. Griseofulvin is a systemic treatment and is most often used in selected cases of animals with underlying immune problems or severe infections.
