People with untreated classic PKU have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems. Mutations in the PAH gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition, such as variant PKU or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia. phenylketonuria-caused by mutations in the PAH gene. More than 500 mutations in the PAH gene have been identified in people with phenylketonuria (PKU). Most of these mutations change single amino acids in phenylalanine hydroxylase.
Classical PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Over 70 different mutations on the PAH gene found on Chromosome 12 have been found to cause the almost complete absence of PAH as seen in PKU patients. Prevalence. The incidence of PKU is highly variable in different populations. Many PAH gene mutations are thought to be Celtic in origin, this is supported by high frequencies of PKU in the Irish and in the Scottish, and for example an incidence of 1/4500 is seen in the Irish.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is characterized by a person's inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine.If the body can not process part of the protien phenylalanine (phe) then it can cause severe brain damage, skin disorders, behavioral problems, heart defects or even mental retardation. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is located in the q arm of chromosome 12. It is caused by a mutation of the (PAH) phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. The (PAH) gene produces the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase and it then converts the phenylalanine to tyrosine.
Genetic mutation. PKU is caused by a genetic mutation (change to the DNA) in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. There are many different types of mutations that can affect the PAH gene, all of which result in the body not producing a functioning PAH enzyme.
People with untreated classic PKU have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems. Mutations in the PAH gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition, such as variant PKU or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia. If gene mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine from the diet is not processed effectively. As a result, this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues.
The PAH gene produces an enzyme that breaks down the amino acid phenylalanine. Mutations in the PAH gene can cause phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder that can change cells in the brain. The faulty protein allows dangerously high levels of phenylalanine to accumulate in the brain, poisoning the cells. If a person with PKU consumes too much phenylalanine, the build-up can cause mental retardation. faulty protein,phenylketonuria,phenylalanine,pah,mental retardation,amino acid,mutations,chromosome,pku,cells,brain.

Phenylketonuria (commonly known as PKU) is an inherited disorder that increases the levels of a substance called phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the diet. It is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. If gene mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine from the diet is not processed effectively. As a result, this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues.
Mutations in the PAH gene cause phenylketonuria. The PAH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme converts the amino acid phenylalanine to other important compounds in the body. If gene mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine from the diet is not processed effectively. As a result, this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues.
Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. A genetic mutation causes phenylketonuria. In a person with PKU, this defective gene causes a lack of or deficiency of the enzyme that's needed to process an amino acid called phenylalanine. A dangerous buildup of phenylalanine can develop when a person with PKU eats foods that are high in protein, such as milk, cheese, nuts or meat. For a child to inherit PKU, both the mother and father must have and pass on the defective gene. This pattern of inheritance is called autosomal recessiv
