We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs. This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste. Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and. Upside down. Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found. I don't want this feeling to go away. Please don't go away. Please don't go away. Please don't go away. Is this how it's supposed to be. Is this how it's supposed to be. 
Just tonight, I want you to stay. [Chorus]. You're turning me on, you turn me around. You turn my whole world upside down. You're turning me on, you turn me around. You turn my whole world upside down. [Verse 2]. Every time I hurt you, well it's hurting me too. Don't know if I could really stay here tonight. You're turning me on, you turn me around. You turn my whole world upside down. You're turning me on, you turn me around. You turn my whole world upside down. [Hook]. Oh, you know, you turn me upside down. You know, you turn me upside down.
