Direct Materials Inventory is debited for the standard cost of $9,000 (3,000 yards at $3 per yard), Accounts Payable is credited for the actual amount owed, and the difference of $240 is credited to Direct Materials Price Variance. A debit balance in a variance account is always unfavorable—it shows that the total of actual costs is higher than the total of the expected standard costs. In other words, your company's profit will be $50 less than planned unless you take some action.
The following is a journal entry to close out manufacturing overhead and all variance accounts: *$186,100 = $78,000 + $234,000 + $99,600 – $128,000 – $97,500. **$99,600 underapplied overhead = $630,000 actual overhead costs – $530,400 applied overhead. 1 Assuming a standard price of $5 per yard, prepare a journal entry to record the purchase of raw materials for the month. 2  The company used 39,000 yards of material in production for the month, and the flexible budget shows the company expected to use 40,800 yards.
The Direct Materials Usage Variance is: [the standard quantity of material that should have been used to make the good output minus the actual quantity of material used] X the standard cost per yard. In our example, DenimWorks should have used 278 yards of material to make 100 large aprons and 60 small aprons. We determine the total standard cost of the denim that should have been used to make the 160 aprons by multiplying the standard quantity of denim (278 yards) by the standard cost of a yard of denim ($3 per yard):
On January 8 DenimWorks' Direct Materials Inventory is increased by the standard cost of $3,000 (1,000 yards of denim at the standard cost of $3 per yard), Accounts Payable is credited for $2,900 (the actual amount owed to the supplier), and the difference of $100 is credited to Direct Materials Price Variance. A debit balance in a variance account is always unfavorable—it shows that the total of actual costs is higher than the total of the expected standard costs. In other words, your company's profit will be $50 less than planned unless you take some action.
(Hint: The total overhead variance for the month is $16,660U.). 2. Provide summary journal entries to record actual overhead costs and standard overhead cost applied to production during the month. 3. Provide the journal entry to record the two overhead variances for the month. 4. Assume that the variances calculated above represent net variances for the year.
The following is a journal entry to record transfer of finished goods to cost of goods sold: The following is a journal entry to close out manufacturing overhead and all variance accounts: *$186,100 = $78,000 + $234,000 + $99,600 – $128,000 – $97,500. 1 The company used 10,000 direct labor hours during the month with an actual rate of $19 per hour. 2  The flexible budget shows the company expected to use 11,200 direct labor hours at a standard rate of $18 per hour. 3  Prepare a journal entry to record direct labor costs for the month.
Because Direct Materials Inventory reports the standard cost of the actual materials on hand, we reduce the account balance by $870 (290 yards used $3 standard cost per yard). After removing 290 yards of materials, the balance in the Direct Materials Inventory account is $2,130 (710 yards x $3 standard cost per yard). We determine the total standard cost of the denim that should have been used to make the 160 aprons by multiplying the standard quantity of denim (278 yards) by the standard cost of a yard of denim ($3 per yard):
1 Fiber Optic, Inc., investigates all variances above 10 percent of the flexible budget. 2  The flexible budget for direct materials is $50,000. 3  The direct materials price variance is $4,000 unfavorable and the direct materials quantity variance is $(6,000) favorable. 1 Assuming a standard price of $5 per yard, prepare a journal entry to record the purchase of raw materials for the month. 2  The company used 39,000 yards of material in production for the month, and the flexible budget shows the company expected to use 40,800 yards.
A credit to the variance account indicates that the actual cost is less than the standard cost. After this transaction is recorded, the Direct Materials Price Variance account shows an overall credit balance of $190. A credit balance in a variance account is always favorable. In other words, your company's profit will be $190 greater than planned due to the favorable cost of direct materials. A debit balance in a variance account is always unfavorable—it shows that the total of actual costs is higher than the total of the expected standard costs. In other words, your company's profit will be $50 less than planned unless you take some action.
