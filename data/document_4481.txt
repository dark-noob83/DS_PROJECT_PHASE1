Repeat the ear candling on the other ear. If both of your ears have a wax buildup, repeat the process on your other ear. Be sure to follow the steps closely and according to the product packaging. This may prevent burning or other trauma in your ear.
Hopi Ear Candles are hollow tubes made of cotton, soaked in beeswax, honey and herbs. When lit, the candle acts like a chimney, causing the warm air inside it to rise and creating a vacuum at the bottom. This vacuum gently stimulates the ear, facilitating removal of excess wax and impurities.
Practitioners of Hopi ear candling often claim that it is effective for removing ear wax but we remain concerned about this form of therapy. There is no good evidence that it helps the majority of people with tinnitus. There is, however, good evidence that the use of ear candles has damaged some peopleâ€™s ears.
Ear candling, also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is an alternative medicine practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the other end in the ear canal.
Lisa Roazen, M.D. Ear candling, also known as auricular candling or coning, refers to various procedures that involve placing a cone-shaped device in the ear canal and supposedly extracting earwax and other impurities with the help of smoke or a burning wick. The origins of candling are obscure.
Ear candling does NOT remove wax from the ear. Any wax inside the candle is simply residual wax from the candle itself. What it does do, however, is expand the ear canal, dislodging any old wax or foreign debris thus making it easier for the ear to clean itself. It does, indeed, relieve sinus pressure as well.
