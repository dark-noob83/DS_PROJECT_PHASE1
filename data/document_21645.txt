WHEN AND HOW GREEKS EAT. The Greek lifestyle is reflected most in the food the Greeks eat and when and how Greeks eat. You can always tell a lot about the lifestyle of a country, the way of life, by seeing how they eat. How Greeks eat is a very different pattern to other countries. The western world have had it drummed into us to always have breakfast, normally packaged cereals or toast with jam, or the English breakfast of fried eggs, sausages and bacon! For the midday meal, a packed lunch of sandwiches or a roll.
Greeks tend to eat a lot of seafood, poultry, goat meat and pork. They also love desserts, for example, Bacalavas (soft or normal), yoghurt and melle (honey), fruits and yoghurt.
Vegetables were a huge part of the Greek diet. Most Greeks ate a diet that was almost vegetarian. Among the most common vegetables and plants eaten by Greeks were asparagus, fennel, cucumbers, chickpeas, and celery. They also gathered and boiled dandelions to eat.
Food. The Greek diet was very healthy. Food in Ancient Greece consisted of grains, wheat, barley, fruit, vegetables, breads, and cake. The Ancient Greeks grew olives, grapes, figs and wheat and kept goats, for milk and cheese. They ate lots of bread, beans and olives. In the Summer months there were plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables to eat and in the winter they ate dried fruit and food they had stored like apples and lentils.
Not the most popular meal of the day, traditionally, Greeks ate a small and simple breakfast, such as herbal tea with bread or paximadi (dried bread). Coffee was more of a luxury item, but when it was available it was consumed alone or also with bread. Another simple breakfast consisted of soft-boiled eggs
