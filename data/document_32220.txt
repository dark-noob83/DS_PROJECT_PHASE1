Vaccines and Immunizations. ShareCompartir. For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at age 12-47 months, either MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used. When the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines is administered at ages 48 months and older, use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of MMR and varicella vaccines.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a two-dose vaccine schedule for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines for children, with the first dose at age 12-15 months and the second at age 4-6 years. When the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines is administered at ages 48 months and older, use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of MMR and varicella vaccines.
New combined chickenpox and MMR vaccine (MMRV) from July 2013. From July 2013, a single combination vaccine that protects against the measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (varicella) viruses (MMRV) can be given to children who are 18 months old who have been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine at 12 months.
