Getting your rabbit through GI Statis. My rabbit hasn't pooped in about three days. My friend says he has a hairball in his stomach and I should give him pineapple juice, papaya enzyme tablets, Prozyme and a cat hairball laxative to dissolve the hairball. This doesn't seem to be working.
Petromalt Hairball Remedy-Original Formula. Rabbits cannot regurgitate (really!), which means that ingested hair can contribute to health problems if not passed through the system. This popular kitty hairball treatment is also recommended by many people for bunnies. This small, handy tube will last you a long while.
Most of the hair will pass through the intestinal tract harmlessly, especially if the rabbit is eating a good diet composed mainly of hay and other high-fiber foods. If a solid hairball forms and lodges in the intestinal tract, however, a life-threatening obstruction can occur.
Question. I have read that rabbits can take cat hairball remedy like Petromalt. How much would you give a 5 Lb. rabbit. My bun is having a big molt and with the extra hair coming out, I wondered if at these times he could have the hair ball remedy. He always has plenty of hay and runs around the house for exercise.
