In economics, total cost is made up of variable costs + fixed costs. Variable costs (VC) are costs that change based on how many goods you produce or how much of a service you use. Fixed costs (FC) are costs that don't change from month to month and don't vary based on activities or the number of goods used.
Average total cost, sometimes referred to as the per unit total cost, is the per unit cost. This includes fixed costs, those costs that are required for production but do not change based on output, and variable costs, those costs that increase (or decrease) as output increases (or decreases).
