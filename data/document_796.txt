The real reason kittens nurse only for 6-8 weeks is because of human intervention. Since they are capable of eating solid food, people go ahead and remove them from their mothers to place them in homes. But 6 weeks is still a bit young-even the Humane Society won't place kittens until at least 8 weeks old.
