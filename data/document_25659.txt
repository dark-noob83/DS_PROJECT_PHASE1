In 1875, England raised the age to 13 years; an act of sexual intercourse with a girl younger than 13 was a felony.

If the person then does indeed proceed to sexually penetrate or violate a child of 16 or 17 years he does not, according to sections 15 and 16, commit a crime!

The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity.
