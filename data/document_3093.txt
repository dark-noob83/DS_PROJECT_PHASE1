For example: 23789 per annum for full time (37.5hrs) contracted hours 22.5hrs (23789 per annum Pro Rata - 22.5 hrs per week). 23789 divided by 37.5 x 22.5 = 14273.40 Gross per annum. Stick the 14273.40 into the salary calculator on the homepage and you will see the net per month/week/ etc :D.
My definition: Pro rata, when it comes to jobs, generally refers to pay. Say the salary is '$40,000 per annum-pro rata', it will mean that if you only work part time, you get part of the pay. A standard week is (about) 40 hours, so the pay for 20 hours will be $20,000 per annum. 
Calculation. To arrive at your pro rata salary, you must know what the job pays on a full-time basis, what your employer views as full-time hours, the number of weeks you will be working during the year and your required work hours per week. Your pro rata salary is proportionate to the amount that a full-time employee -- who works the same job and has the same qualifications as you -- would receive. For example, this may happen to a teacher who works on a part-time basis for a college or university. Assume a full-time teacher makes $48,000 per year, based on a 40-hour work week, and does the same work you do. If you work 20 hours per week, your annual pro rata salary would be half of $48,000, or $24,000
Answers. Best Answer: well per annum means per year. Pro rata means at that rate. So for example,if you work the full 37.5 hours per week for the full year you will earn £20,000 per annum, however if you end up working half of that you would earn £10,000. So if you only work 3months that is a 1/4 of £20,000, so you would earn £20,000/4 = £5,000. Source(s): Hey, Can anyone help me understand what this means.

Hi If the job states £15,000 per annum for 20 hours a week then that is what you will earn, ie £15,000. However if it mentions pro-rata then you need to find out what it is pro-rata to. For example a job might be £15,000 per annum based on 40 hours a week, so if you are doing 20 hours you would get £7,500 of it because you have done half the hours. Or it could be that it is a short term job like a temporary contract, £15,000 per annum pro rata, so if you are there for 1 month you would get 1/12 of the £15,000. Normally jobs are based on 1 working week of 37.5 hours so I would check carefully that the 20 hours isn't pro-rata Gavin. Gavin T · 8 years ago. Thumbs up.
For reduced hours, most employers will multiply the full-time salary by the reduced number of hours divided by the full-time hours. For example, if the full-time salary is £20,000 per year for 37.5 hours’ work per week, the pro-rata salary based on a 18-hour working week would be: £20,000 x (18 / 37.5) = £9,600. Income tax, National Insurance and other deductions are then calculated based on this new salary.
