After the first few days, your formula-fed newborn will take from 2 to 3 ounces (60â€“90 ml) of formula per feeding and will eat every three to four hours on average during her first few weeks. (Breastfed infants usually take smaller, more frequent feedings than formula-fed infants.).
1 The length of time between feedings varies depending on the amount of formula your baby drank during the previous feeding. 2  Most 2-week-old babies drink about every 2 hours. 3  Older babies often drink more formula at each feeding. 4  They often drink a bottle every 4 hours during the day.
From 9-15 or 18 months, on average, your baby will nap two times a day. Although many people believe most babies transition to one nap at 12 months, the average age is actually 15 to 18 months. From 18 months to 4 years, toddlers will nap once a day.
Feedings are not usually spaced evenly around the clock. Most babies will vary the time between feedings and the length of time each feeding takes. The average amount of time a breastfeeding session takes can vary from about 10 minutes to about 45 minutes.
5 months. 4 to 5. 7 fl oz (210 mL) to 8 fl oz (240 mL). 6 months. 4 to 5. 7 fl oz (210 mL) to 8 fl oz (240 mL). A baby drinks from a bottle of formula for about 5 to 25 minutes at a time. Pay attention to your baby's nutritional needs and cues. Don't be concerned if your baby doesn't eat much at one feeding.
Most newborns feed about 6 to 10 times every 24 hours. Average feeding amounts will vary depending on your baby's age and how hungry he or she is at that moment. This table provides general guidelines for feeding amounts.
