6 which can be used to create a DNA Fingerprint which in turn, will confirm or deny whether a suspect was present at a crime scene. DNA Fingerprinting in conjunction with other evidence can assure that the accused person will receive the correct verdict. Another use of DNA fingerprinting is paternity testing.
The advantage of using DNA fingerprinting in this context is that it is over 99 percent reliable in determining paternity or a familial relationship. Useful in Rape Cases. There are also many advantages to using DNA fingerprinting in sexual assault or rape cases.
Discuss the advantages of the technique. Technique used to make copies of DNA in a short amount of time. An advantage is that PCR does not require a large sample. Steps: Denaturation-separates DNA Primer Annealing-bind to the complementary DNA Primer extension-extends these primers and forms extensions.
Actually, the question is about DNA fingerprinting, which is the term for using DNA evidence to create profiles of each individual. DNA evidence includes blood, hair follicles, skin cells, bone, semen, and other types of body tissue.
2. Criminal Identification and Forensics DNA isolated from blood, hair, skin cells, or other genetic evidence left at the scene of a crime can be compared, through VNTR patterns, with the DNA of a criminal suspect to determine guilt or innocence.
Flakes of skin, drops of blood, hair, and saliva all contain DNA that can be used to identify us. In fact, the study of forensics, commonly used by police departments and prosecutors around the world, frequently relies upon these small bits of shed DNA to link criminals to the crimes they commit.
RFLPs and VNTRs are the traditional methods of fingerprinting DNA, which uses a relatively large sample that uses the method of probe hybridization to detect polymorphisms in the DNA. STRs are the most current form of DNA fingerprinting, which is PCR based and uses a very small sample of DNA.
