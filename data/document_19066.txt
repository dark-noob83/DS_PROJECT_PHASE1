Cost for capital improvements is obviously dependent on the condition of a road. As the figures above show, these can vary significantly. Using a weighted average of the above figures, the reclaim/overlay costs are approximately $124,844.90 per mile of paved road.
According to an world bank report, the cost per km of paving (black tar) a road is about $250,000/k.m. but constructing a new road is about $900,000/km.
Then divide by 2000 [man-hrs per year] to get man-yrs/mile). In 1898 in Massachusetts, it cost an average of $5700/mile for 16 ft wide macadamized road. With labor running at about $0.10/hr that's 28.5 man-yrs per mile. In 1908 (an average over about 20 states) it cost about $8870/mile for PAVED road.
A lot more than many people think, but it varies greatly, especially based on location, width, and underlayment needed.In 2008 in Pittsburgh it cost an average of $338,000 per mile to REpave city streets. (Usually 24 ft wide streets). That's an average of $64 per running foot.
But over the same period of the time the county only spent $27,293.13 in maintenance costs on 2,028.6 miles of paved road. Using those figures, it cost the county about $1,887.44 per mile of gravel road that needed maintenance and about $13.45 per mile for maintenance on bituminous.
According to an world bank report, the cost per km of paving (black tar) a road is about $250,000/k.m. but constructing a new road is about $900,000/km. This is April 2000 data so probably the price is up by 5 to 15% by now. Ofcourse, the condition will vary greatly and so will the price.
The cost to pave a road per mile is easily between $80,000 to $100,000.. Faust said he thinks the township has about 30 miles of dirt roads out of 64 miles of roadways. On a larger level, Pennsylvania has more than 25,000 miles of unpaved roads, according to the state Department of Agriculture.
