Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase is the full form of SGPT. It is an enzyme which is normally present in liver and heart cells. When the heart or liver are damaged in any person then SGPT is released into blood.
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT). Guide. An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test measures the amount of this enzyme in the blood. ALT is found mainly in the liver, but also in smaller amounts in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas. ALT was formerly called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). ALT is measured to see if the liver is damaged or diseased. Low levels of ALT are normally found in the blood. But when the liver is damaged or diseased, it releases ALT into the bloodstream, which makes ALT levels go up.
SGOT and SGPT. Liver function tests are one of the blood tests that are most commonly performed to assess the function of the liver or injury caused to the liver. Liver damage is detected initially by performing a simple blood test that determines the level of various liver enzymes present in the blood.
It is a known fact that the elevated levels of SGPT is the indication of the existence of different other medical problems like viral hepatitis, liver damage, bile duct problems, congestive heart failure, infectious mononucleosis or myopathy. SGPT is also known by the name of ALT (Alanine Transaminase).
SGPT is released into blood when the liver or heart are damaged. The blood SGPT levels are thus elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). Some medications can also raise SGPT levels. Also called alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
The term SGPT stands for Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase. This is an enzyme that is found in the cells of the liver. It is also commonly known as Alanine Transaminase, abbreviated as ALT. In a normally healthy individual, the level of SGPT is measurable in the blood.
