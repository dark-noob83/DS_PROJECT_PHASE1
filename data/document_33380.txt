In math class you simplified fractions to make them easier to understand and work with. For example, the first fraction, as shown below, can be simplified to a much smaller fraction with the same value. For basic equations, like those presented in the Equation Basics lesson, your first step to solving the equation might be to subtract the variable on the left from both sides.
They are indexed by two nonnegative integers; the binomial coefficient indexed by n and k is usually written. It is the coefficient of the x term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x) . Under suitable circumstances the value of the coefficient is given by the expression. 
Basically, finding the n-th root of a (positive) number is the opposite of raising the number to the power n, so they effectively cancel each other out. These 4 expressions have the same value: `root(n)(a^n)=(root(n)a)^n``=root(n)((a^n))=a`. The 2nd item in the equality above means: take the n-th root first, then raise the result to the power n . The 3rd item means: raise a to the power n then find the n-th root of the result. Both steps lead back to the a that we started with. For the simple case where `n = 2`, the following 4 expressions all have the same value: `sqrt(a^2)=(sqrt(a))^2``=sqrt((a^2))=a`.
The nth Root used n times in a multiplication gives the original value. 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th, ... n th ... Instead of talking about the 4th, 16th, etc, if we want to talk generally we say the  nth .

1 In general terms, we can say that for any number N, the sum of the numbers from 1 to N is equal to (N/2)(N + 1). 2  The simplified form of this equation is (N(N + 1))/2, our integer sum equation. Multiply N by (N+1) and divide by 2. When you've defined the integer value of N, plug it into the equation (N(N + 1))/2. This equation finds the sum of all the integers between 1 and N. 1  In our example, we would plug 100, our value for N, into the equation. ( 2 N(N + 1))/2 becomes (100(100 + 1))/2.
B) Correct. The rational expression can be simplified by factoring the numerator as (2x + 3)(x + 5) and the denominator as (2x + 3)(x + 10) and then since = 1, you can simplify the expressions to. The values x= –10 and x = give a denominator equal to 0, so the domain is all x not –10, . C) Incorrect. Rational expressions, or fractions containing polynomials, can be simplified much like fractions can be simplified. To simplify a rational expression, first determine common factors of the numerator and denominator, and then remove them by rewriting them as expressions equal to 1.
