The product's price is constant at $2. Therefore, average and marginal revenue are $2, as well. For example, at a quantity of 110 units, the total revenue is 110 times $2, or $220. The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity
Average revenue is revenue per product. For example, if your firm's total revenue is $200, and you are selling 100 products, then your average revenue is $200 divided by 100, or $2. Note that if the price is constant, then the average revenue and marginal revenues equal the price. Below is a table of a hypothetical firm, which has a choice of selling quantities ranging from 0 to 130. The product's price is constant at $2. Therefore, average and marginal revenue are $2, as well. For example, at a quantity of 110 units, the total revenue is 110 times $2, or $220. The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity
The average revenue is the total revenue divided by the quantity produced. For example, at a quantity of 120, the total revenue is $240. Therefore, the average revenue at this quantity is $240 divided by 120, or $2. Note that if the price is constant, then the average revenue and marginal revenues equal the price. Below is a table of a hypothetical firm, which has a choice of selling quantities ranging from 0 to 130. The product's price is constant at $2. Therefore, average and marginal revenue are $2, as well. For example, at a quantity of 110 units, the total revenue is 110 times $2, or $220. The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity
To calculate business A's average revenue, add the data points, for example: Total Revenue = $10,000 + $15,000 + $8,000 + $12,000 + $15,000 + $14,000 + $18,000 + $20,000 = $112,000. Divide the total revenue by the number of data points, as follows: Average Revenue = $112,000 ÷ 8 = $14,000.
