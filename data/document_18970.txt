SS. Dear SS: According to Foodsafety.gov, uncooked poultry is safe in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, and safe in the freezer for 9 months (for pieces) and up to 12 months for whole chickens or turkey. Cooked poultry is safe refrigerated for 3-4 days.
Meats do not last long in the refrigerator. Only about 3 to 4 days if it is raw. Then 1 to 2 days longer if cooked and placed in an airtight container. You should always … cover meats when stored in the fridge.

At that point, it should be re-heated or refrigerated. If the chicken is raw, when you take it out of the fridge, soak it in cold water and 1/4 cup of salt (in a clean sink or basin) for approximately 5 - 10 minutes and then rinse well and pat dry before cooking. This kills any bacteria on the chicken as well as tenderizes the meat and gives it a better taste.

I have to say that I have kept chicken in the fridge for longer than 2 days and not died. Some even have best before dates 3-4 days in. The quality definitely suffers, and I'm sure there's some risk, but it's probably low.
You chicken is perfectly safe to eat. Most experts state that 2 hours at room temperature is the max for leaving hot or warm foods out the fridge. However, I have left cooked chicken etc. out for 2-3 hours and no one ever got sick.
