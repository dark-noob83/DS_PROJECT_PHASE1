Tin is never found as the free element. most important tin ore is cassiterite (tin oxide, SnO 2). Most of the world's supply comes from Malaya, Bolivia, Indonesia, Zaire, Thailand, and Nigeria. Cornwall in England was famous for its tin mines.
The ions are Sn2+ and Br-, so the formula is SnBr2. Edit. Share to: 1  The Periodic Table of Elements Life is sustained by a number of chemical elements. 2  They are responsible for the birth of planets and the evolution of cells to complex organisms.
Almost all the common + ions are metallic. The most notable exception is NH 4 +. The charges on metals in the representative groups can be determined from their position in the periodic table. Most of the transtition metals have two or more commonly occuring charge. In the following chart, the most commonly occuring charge for each element is listed first.
The charges on the representative non-metallic elements can generally be determined from their position in the periodic table. Except for hydroxide (OH -) any ion ending in ide is an element from one of these groups, so you can locate it o
The ionic charge of the element in question depends on it's oxidation state in the molecule it is part of. Since these elements are generally nonmetallic, they mostly form covalent bonds rather than ionic ones. However, if they do form ionic bonds the charges can vary from 2+ to 4+.
Atoms are made up of electrons, protons and neutrons. electrons have a charge of -1, neutrons are neutral and protons have a charge of +1. different atoms have different â€¦ numbers of protons and neutrons and electrons, but in their normal state the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, so the charge is neutral.
