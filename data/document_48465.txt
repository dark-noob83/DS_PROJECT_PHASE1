Paid Time Off. You'll spend about 10% of your payroll on paid time off. Paid time off is a very highly rated benefit, especially with so many workers trying harder to balance work and family life. Most companies provide paid holidays for all of their employees. The national average is 10 1/2 paid holidays per year. These are typically New Years day, President's day, Memorial day, Independence day, Labor day, Thanksgiving day, the day after Thanksgiving day, Christmas Eve, and Christmas day.
