Clinical anatomy students learn to use imaginary lines and bony landmarks on the front and back of the thorax to describe locations of the anatomical structures.
On the anterior surface of the thoracic cage lies the pectoralis major muscle group and overlying skin. Understanding the surface anatomy of the thorax will help to identify important clinical landmarks and is therefore crucial to performing a competent clinical examination.
Anatomic Landmarks. It is important to review the anatomy of the chest wall and thoracic cavity, as you will use anatomic landmarks to document the location of respiratory assessment findings. The thoracic cavity is made up of 12 pairs of ribs that connect in the posterior thorax to the vertebral bodies of the spinal column. In the anterior thorax, the first 7 pairs of ribs are attached to the sternum or breastbone by cartilage. The lower 5 ribs do not attach to the sternum.

A thorough knowledge of thoracic anatomy is of fundamental importance to the thoracic surgeon.
The nerves of the breast come from the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the 4th to 6th intercostal nerves. They supply sensory fibers to the skin and sympathetic fibers to the blood vessels and smooth muscles of the nipple and skin.
The anterior of the chest is a main area for physical examination. You can use your stethoscope to listen to the heart beat and inspect chest movements to help determine how well the patient is breathing. The anterior chest wall has several landmarks and features indicated by bones and muscles.
