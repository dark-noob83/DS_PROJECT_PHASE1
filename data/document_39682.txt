Best Answer: Mitochondria are sometimes described as cellular power plants, because they generate most of the cell's supply of ATP, used as a source of chemical energy. The number of mitochondria in a cell varies widely by organism and tissue type.
Mitochondria are tiny organelles inside cells that are involved in releasing energy from food. This process is known as cellular respiration. It is for this reason that mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell.
ATP is known as Energy Currency of the cell and it is used as cellular fuel. Energy stored in ATP is used to bring about energy requiring activities of the cell such as photosynthesis, protein synthesis and muscle contraction.
· just now. Report Abuse. Mitochondria is known as powerhouse of cell because the major part of cellular respiration occurs in it, thereby maximum amount of ATP is generated there. This ATP is the energy provider to all the major/minor vital biological functions. ATP is called the energy/power currency of the cell.
The Powerhouse of the Cell. Mitochondria play host to one of the most important processes in your body: cellular respiration. Taking in glucose and oxygen, mitochondria produce energy, which they capture and package as energy-rich molecules of ATP.
Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell because they contain enzymes that are needed for stepwise oxidation of food stuffs (carbohydrate, fats and lipids) present … in the cells to CO2 and water. Oxidation of food releases energy which is used to form high energy ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecules.
The mitochondrion is referred to as the powerhouse of the cell. The mitochondrion is a membrane bound organalle that converts oxygen and nutrients into Adenosine triphosphat … e (ATP). The mitochondrian generates most of the cell's supply of ATP.
