Boil water alone in the microwave. Put enough water to submerge the eggs into a microwave safe bowl, leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) clearance at the top. Heat for at least three minutes, or however long it takes for the water to begin to boil. Heating the water in advance reduces the risk of exploding the shell, although a few cracks may still occur.
Let the egg stand for two or three minutes. Microwaves heat up the fat in the egg much hotter than a pot of boiling water does. This heat will continue to cook the egg after it is removed. If part of the egg isn't hard enough after three minutes, cook it for another 10 to 20 seconds.
If you need easy-to-peel eggs and you have fresh eggs, you might want to try steaming the eggs for 15 minutes. Pour an inch of water into a pot and insert a steamer basket.Bring to a boil. Place the eggs in the steamer basket, cover and steam for 15 minutes (more or less, check!).
After 30 seconds cooking, the water will return to a gentle boil, and cook the eggs, as they do conventionally. 3 minutes will cook the eggs to soft boil stage and 5 - 6 minutes (according to their size) will cook to a hard boil. Remove dish from the oven, and quickly run cold water over the eggs, for 1 minute or so.
Directions. Place eggs in a large saucepan. Cover them with cool water by 1 inch. Slowly bring water to a boil over medium heat; when the water has reached a boil, cover and remove from heat. Let sit 12 minutes. Transfer eggs to a colander; place under cool running water to stop the cooking.
