If you make an early withdrawal from a Roth IRA that is not a qualified distribution, the IRS slaps you with a 10 percent additional tax penalty. You will need to record non-qualified, early distributions on your tax return, and you are responsible for paying income tax on those amounts, plus the 10 percent penalty.
