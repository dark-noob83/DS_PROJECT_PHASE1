Pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas. 1  The pancreas is an abdominal gland situated behind the stomach in the upper abdomen. 2  The main function of the pancreas is to secrete hormones and enzymes that help with digestion and regulate blood sugar (glucose) metabolism. Pancreatitis is a condition that may be mild and self-limiting, though it can also lead to severe complications that can be life-threatening. The acute form of pancreatitis, in its most severe form, can have deleterious effects on many other body organs, including the lungs and kidneys.
After an attack of acute pancreatitis, tissue and cells of the pancreas return to normal. With chronic pancreatitis, damage to the pancreas occurs slowly over time. Symptoms may be persistent or sporadic, but the condition does not disappear and the pancreas is permanently impaired. an inflammatory condition of the pancreas that may be acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis is generally the result of damage to the biliary tract, as by alcohol, trauma, infectious disease, or certain drugs.
The pancreas is an essential part of a dogâ€™s digestive system. It produces hormones like insulin that process sugars and proteins, as well as enzymes that help with digestion. The pancreas nestles by the stomach and has a duct that empties out where the stomach transitions into the start of the small intestine. The causes of canine pancreatitis are unclear and the symptoms are also somewhat vague and imprecise. The symptoms most frequently ascribed to pancreatitis in dogs include vomiting, abdominal pain, lack of appetite, loss of energy, dehydration, diarrhea, depression, fever, and shock.
Definition. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that is important in digestion. Pancreatitis can be acute (beginning suddenly, usually with the patient recovering fully) or chronic (progressing slowly with continued, permanent injury to the pancreas). an inflammatory condition of the pancreas that may be acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis is generally the result of damage to the biliary tract, as by alcohol, trauma, infectious disease, or certain drugs.
1 It is an important part of the digestive system, producing enzymes and hormones that help break down foods. 2  The pancreas is a 6 to 10 inch organ and is located behind the stomach. 3  It is fish shaped and extends horizontally across the abdomen. The pancreas has an endocrine function because it releases juices directly into the bloodstream, and it has an exocrine function because it releases juices into ducts. Enzymes, or digestive juices, produced by the pancreas are secreted into the small intestine to further break down food after it has left the stomach. The gland also produces the hormone insulin and secretes it into the bloodstream in order to regulate the body's glucose or sugar level
Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur.

The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and next to the small intestine. The pancreas does two main things: 1  It releases powerful digestive enzymes into the small intestine to aid the digestion of food. 2  It releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream. 3  These hormones help the body control how it uses food for energy. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis: 1  Upper abdominal pain that radiates into the back; it may be aggravated by eating, especially foods high in fat. 2  Swollen and tender abdomen. 3  Nausea and vomiting. 4  Fever. 5  Increased heart rate.
