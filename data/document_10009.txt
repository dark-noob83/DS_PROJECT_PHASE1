Definition. noun, plural: heterotrophs. An organism that is unable to synthesize its own organic carbon-based compounds from inorganic sources, hence, feeds on organic matter produced by, or available in, other organisms. If it obtains nitrogen from organic compounds but not energy, it is still considered an autotroph (such as carnivorous plants). Organisms that obtain carbon from organic compounds may either be: photoheterotrophs or chemoheterotrophs. Word origin: G. heteros: héteros the other of, two, other + Different. g: trophos. feeder
Heterotrophs contrast with autotrophs, such as plants and algae, which can use energy from sunlight (photoautotrophs) or inorganic compounds (lithoautotrophs) to produce organic compounds such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from inorganic carbon dioxide. Most heterotrophs are chemoorganoheterotrophs (or simply organotrophs) who utilize organic compounds both as a carbon source and an energy source. The term heterotroph very often refers to chemoorganoheterotrophs.

Diffen › Science › Biology. Autotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food from the substances available in their surroundings using light (photosynthesis) or chemical energy (chemosynthesis). Heterotrophs cannot synthesize their own food and rely on other organisms — both plants and animals — for nutrition. Herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores. Definition. An organism that is able to form nutritional organic substances from simple inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide. Heterotrophs cannot produce organic compounds from inorganic sources and therefore rely on consuming other organisms in the food chain.
Autotrophs and Heterotrophs. Organisms are divided into autotrophs and heterotrophs according to their energy pathways. Autotrophs are those organisms that are able to make energy-containing organic molecules from inorganic raw material by using basic energy sources such as sunlight. Plants are the prime example of autotrophs, using photosynthesi
Report Abuse. An autotroph (from the Greek autos = self and trophe = nutrition) is an organism that produces complex organic compounds from simple inorganic molecules and an external source of energy, such as light or chemical reactions of inorganic compounds. Autotrophs are considered producers in a food chain. Best Answer: An autotroph is an organism that creates its own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. This is like a plant or protist. A heterotroph is like a human or other animal; they cannot produce their own food and must eat other organisms to live.
A heterotroph is any organism that requires organic subtrates in order to survive. Basically, a heterotroph is a consumer which must take food from other plants, it cannot produce its own food like animal ,fungi etc.. A heterotroph is any organism that requires organic subtrates in order to survive. Basically, a heterotroph is a consumer which must eat other animals and cannot produce its own food.
Overview of cycle between autotrophs and heterotrophs. A heterotroph (/ˈhɛtərɵtroʊf/ ; ἕτερος heteros = another, different and τροφή trophe = nutrition) is an organism that cannot fix carbon and uses organic carbon for growth. Most heterotrophs are chemoorganoheterotrophs (or simply organotrophs) who utilize organic compounds both as a carbon source and an energy source. The term heterotroph very often refers to chemoorgano
A heterotroph is an organism that requires organic substrates to get its carbon for growth and development. A heterotroph is known as a consumer in the food chain. A heterotroph is any organism that requires organic subtrates in order to survive. Basically, a heterotroph is a consumer which must eat other animals and cannot produce its own food.
