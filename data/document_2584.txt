Lol = lots of love... I use this when I write something which might offend the reader of the email... when I write the lol behind it, it means it´s not that bad as you might … think... but it hasn´t got anything to do with love :-)))   It can also mean laugh out loud... I say it after I say something mean, but it's really a joke. 2 people found this useful.
