For patients who have been in a remission of their colitis symptoms, this inflammation causes a re-occurrence of symptoms, also referred to as a flare. Stress and the Autoimmune System. Cytokines are released in the fight or flight response. Through cytokines, ulcerative colitis can be directly linked to stress.

The causes of colitis include stress, infections (including Salmonella, Clostridium, and E. coli), and parasites (including, Giardia, Cryptosporidium and whipworms), trauma, allergic colitis and primary inflammatory bowel disease (lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, granulomatous and histiocytic types).

Symptoms include abdominal pain or cramping, mild fever, rectal bleeding and diarrhea, and, less commonly, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and anemia. Griffith’s story sounds familiar to Gerard E. Mullin, MD, director of integrative GI nutrition services at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. While stress doesn’t cause ulcerative colitis, research shows it can increase the risk of flare-ups, says Mullin. Take WebMD's Ulcerative Colitis Health Check.
