Roasted Pork Shoulder. Roast your pork shoulder in the oven at 350 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes per pound for a nice slicing roast. At this temperature, a 6-pound pork shoulder will require 3 to 3 1/2 hours to roast. Check for doneness by placing a meat thermometer into the roast at the thickest point. Be careful not to touch the bone.
In the smoker, a 6-pound pork shoulder roast will require between 6 and 9 hours, depending on how tender you want your meat. Keep the smoker temperature between 225 and 250 degrees F. The shoulder is done in approximately 6 hours, when the temperature reaches 170 degrees.
Set the meat on a rack set into a roasting pan. Roast for 20 minutes, and then reduce the heat to 325 degrees F. Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the shoulder reads 185 degrees F, about 4 hours. Remove the pork from the oven and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes.
Remove pork from the oven and let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. With the pork drippings you may make a vinegar sauce using this formula: for every 1/2 cup of drippings, whisk with 3 tablespoons vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Either carve the pork into thin slices, or, using 2 forks, pull into small pieces.
Pork shoulder is best when it's cooked long and slow. Roast uncovered in the oven for about 1 hour per pound of meat. You may reduce the heat as needed if the pork appears to be cooking too quickly-many recipes call for 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius) rather than 350 (177 C).
Spare ribs and pork shoulder are both cooked in an oven at the same temperature(~225F) for me. The difference is time. A pork shoulder takes at least 8 hours but usually around 12 hours to give good pulled pork.
