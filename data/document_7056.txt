PayPal determines and charges transaction fees for using their service. PayPals fees are deducted from the amount the Seller receives. PayPal fees will be deducted from the Seller's payment for total amount of the listing, including the Ask Price and the Sale Fee. PayPal's fees are typically 2.9% + $0.30 USD per transaction, but may vary. Please consult PayPal's site for more information.
Sending money to friends and family is free in the US for both you and the recipient when you fund the transfer with your bank account or PayPal balance. For a small fee, you can also use a debit or credit card. International transfers to Canada are free when funded by bank or account balance.
The fee the seller pays is calculated for each transaction and is represented as a percentage of the total transaction plus 30 cents. The PayPal percentage rate fluctuates depending on the amount of money the seller earns in one month through PayPal. PayPal requires sellers to pay fees monthly. Step 1.
For example, if you sell an item for $20 and charge $4 for shipping, your Paypal fee will be $1.02 (3% of $24 is $0.72 plus the automatic $0.30). When you are selling items with a low value, that automatic 30 cents can really hurt!
