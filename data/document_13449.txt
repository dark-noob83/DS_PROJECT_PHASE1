It is a member of group 18 (noble gases) elements. A colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere, is isolated by fractionally distilling liquefied air, and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is inert for most practical purposes.
Although traces of krypton are found in various minerals, the most important source of krypton is Earth's atmosphere. Air is also the most important source for the other noble gases, with the exception of helium (obtained from natural gas) and radon (obtained as a byproduct of the decay of radioactive elements). krypton (symbol Kr) Gaseous nonmetallic element that is a noble gas. Discovered in 1898, krypton makes up about 0.0001% of the Earth 's atmosphere by volume and is obtained by the fractional distillation of liquid air. It is used in fluorescent lamps, lasers and in electronic heart valves. Properties: at.no.
Krypton is found in nature as a constituent gas of the atmosphere. It is present in the atmosphere at concentrations of 0.00011%. It is also present in gases that escape from … thermal waters and volcanoes. 5 people found this useful. Krypton-85 is formed naturally via the action of cosmic rays on stable Kryption-84, but nowadays most is produced artificially as a byproduct of nuclear fission of uranium-235 … , but even then only 3 in a thousand fission products are Krypton.

Air is also the most important source for the other noble gases, with the exception of helium (obtained from natural gas) and radon (obtained as a byproduct of the decay of radioactive elements). Under normal conditions, krypton is a colorless, tasteless, odorless gas. Its density at normal temperature and pressure is about 0.5 oz per gallon (3.7 g per liter), making it nearly three times heavier than air. At extremely low temperatures, krypton may exist as a liquid or a solid.
Krypton-85 is formed naturally via the action of cosmic rays on stable Kryption-84, but nowadays most is produced artificially as a byproduct of nuclear fission of uranium-235, but even then only 3 in a thousand fission products are Krypton. A natural fibre is extracted from a plant, while a Synthetic fibre is created using Polymerisation in which a saturated element is cracked (meaning to break the double bond) … and to create a polymer. AKA. A Natural fibre is extracted from natural things. A Synthetic fibre is man-made.
Krypton is chemical element number 36 on the periodic table of the elements. It belongs to the group of elements known as the noble gases. The other noble gases are helium, neon, argon, xenon, and radon.

Overview. Krypton was one of three noble gases discovered in 1898 by Scottish chemist and physicist Sir William Ramsay (1852-1916) and English chemist Morris William Travers (1872-1961). Ramsay and Travers discovered the gases by allowing liquid air to evaporate. Compounds. Compounds of krypton have been prepared in the laboratory but do not exist in nature. The synthetic (artificial) compounds are used for research purposes only. Although neon lights sometimes do include neon, krypton is often the gas used.

Uses: Krypton is a colorless, odorless, inert gas. Although it is extremely unreactive krypton can react with fluorine, and a few compounds of the element have been prepared, including krypton (II) fluoride and krypton clathrates. Solid krypton is white and crystalline. Krypton is used in lighting products. 
It has been uncovered that the Krypton Kratom drug is not a traditional kratom powder or extract and may in fact be dangerous to use. In fact, it is a blend of caffeine and O-desmethyltramadol, a synthetic opioid. This is a shocking bit of information.
