If a glass of milk or a slice of pizza causes swollen lips, hives, or other significant symptoms, you may have an allergy to casein, a protein in milk. Another milk protein associated with food allergies is whey.
A. Casein is a protein found in dairy products and other foods containing dairy or lactose. Even foods proclaiming to be dairy-free or lactose-free contain casein. Because many soy products and imitation dairy products also contain casein, it's important to read labels carefully when following a strict casein free diet.
There are many foods that contain casein. Some of those foods include infant formulas, ice cream, breath mints, glaze for baked goods, salad dressings, meats that are processed, cereals, protein powders, nutrition bars, and any foods with whipped toppings.
Casein in Foods. Most dairy products contain casein, but not all. Since casein is a protein, it is found in dairy products that have a higher protein content, such as milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese and ice cream. Dairy products that contain barely any protein, such as butter and cream, only have traces of casein.
Casein is a slow-digesting natural protein derived from dairy sources. Milk is about 20 percent whey (a quicker-digesting protein) and 80 percent casein. Casein can take up to 7 hours to digest because it forms a gel in the stomach after consumption and provides a slow release of amino acids.
Casein is a type of protein found in milk and milk products. In people with milk allergies, casein may be the culprit. The protein sometimes shows up in unsuspected products, so awareness is essential if your doctor has advised you to avoid it.
