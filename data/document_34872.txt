RO10. Cyclic Voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry is a commonly used method of measuring the reduction potential of a species in solution. The species may be a coordination complex or a redox-active organic compound, for example.
In a cyclic voltammetry experiment,the potential of the reference electrode is varied and the current between the working and reference electrodes is measured.FIG. 3: A triangular waveform is applied to the working electrode. For description of the symbols, see text.FIG. 4: A typical cyclic voltammogram. 
Cyclic Voltammetry. The cyclic voltammetry of thin films of the polymers is characterized by broad irreversible oxidation and reduction waves whose positions and current magnitude are influenced by the pH of the electrolyte solution. Cyclic voltammetry of another film of PPyBBIM is shown in Figure 3.15. The movement of the anodic wave is quite clear, moving to increasingly positive potentials with successive sweeps. This behaviour is only evident after cycles through the reduction waves at negative potentials (cf.
Electrochemical cell and electrodes for cyclic voltammetry. Demonstration by Dr. Alf Bacher; notes by Shadi Rezai Chem 174, UCLA, Winter 2003. An simple electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes and an electrolyte. An electrode is the interface at which dissolved substrates may pick up or lose electron(s).

Cyclic voltammetry is generally used to study the electrochemical properties of an analyte in solution. Cyclic voltammetry is not a hydrodynamic technique. In a hydrodynamic technique, flow is achieved at the electrode surface by stirring the solution, pumping the solution, or rotating the electrode as is the case with rotating disk electrodes and rotating ring-disk electrodes.
4 CHAPTER 1. CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY 1.2 Electrode Reactions A typical electrode reaction involves the transfer of charge between an electrode and a species in solution.The electrode reaction usually referred to as electrolysis, typically involves a series of steps:1. 8 CHAPTER 1. CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY Figure 1.5: Schematic of the setup.In this case we consider diﬀusion normal to an electrode surface (x direction). The rate of change of theconcentration c O as a function of time t can be seen to be related to the change in the concentrationgradient.

Cyclic voltammetry or CV is a type of potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement. In a cyclic voltammetry experiment the working electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time. Unlike in linear sweep voltammetry, after the set potential is reached in a CV experiment, the working electrode's potential is ramped in the opposite direction to return to the initial potential. Cyclic voltammetry is not a hydrodynamic technique. In a hydrodynamic technique, flow is achieved at the electrode surface by stirring the solution, pumping the solution, or rotating the electrode as is the case with rotating disk electrodes and rotating ring-disk electrodes.
