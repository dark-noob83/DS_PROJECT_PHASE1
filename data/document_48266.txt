In 1900 a German physicist named Friedrich Ernst Dorn discovered the radioactive gas that is emitted from radium when studying its decaying chains and named it Radium Emanation. Friedrich Ernst Dorn is credited with the discovery of Radon.
History and Uses: Radon was discovered by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, a German chemist, in 1900 while studying radium 's decay chain. Originally named niton after the Latin word for shining, nitens, radon has been known as radon since 1923. Today, radon is still primarily obtained through the decay of radium.
Discovery of Radon. Radon gas was discovered in 1900 by Fredrich E. Dorn in Halle, Germany. He described it as radium emanation because it arose from the element radium, which he was working with. In 1908 William Ramsay and Robert Gray isolated the gas and named it niton.
Word origin: The word radon is derived from radium, of which radon is a gas. Early in its discovery it was also called radium emanation and niton, which comes from the Latin nitens, meaning shining. Since 1923, however, it has been called radon. Discovery: German physicist Friedrich Ernst Dorn discovered radon in 1900.
PROPERTIES: Radon is a gaseous highly radioactive element discovered by English physicist Ernest Rutherford in 1899. The discovery is also credited to German physicist Friedrich Ernst Dorn in 1900. More specifically, Rutherford discovered radon's alpha radiation and Dorn discovered that radium was releasing a gas.
