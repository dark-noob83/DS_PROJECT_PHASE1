The first patent for Pristiq is set to expire in February 2022. This is the earliest predictable date that a generic version of the drug could become available. However, other circumstances could come up to extend or shorten the exclusivity period.
A patent allows you, and only you, to profit from your genius when you invent something new. No one else can manufacture or sell your invention unless you give permission. However, this protection does not last forever. Depending on what youâ€™ve invented, your patent will expire in either 14 or 20 years. When this occurs, anyone can copy your idea and market it. When a patent expires, the protection it offers ceases to exist.
Before that I was taking Effexor XR for as many years as it had been out. I was at 225mg of Effector and have been on Pristiq 100mg for many years. This year, new insurance with $3600.00 deductible, so since Pristiq will now cost me $250.00 a month, which is out of the question for me, I will have to switch back. I took my last Pristiq night before last, nothing last night and tonight first night of generic Effexor 225mg. I am a nervous wreck about the switch.
No -- desvenlafaxine is the active ingredient in Pristiq, but is not a generic version of it. What can be confusing is that, oftentimes, the active ingredient of any drug is referred to as the generic name.. The generic name is different from a generic version of a medicine.
What you might not know, is the same company that makes the drug Pristiq (Wyeth) also makes Effexor, which is an almost identical antidepressant, and Effexor has recently become available in generic form (Venlafaxine) .
(Newser) - Antidepressant Effexor XR will soon lose patent protection, and maker Wyeth is hoping Pristiq, the successor drug approved today by the FDA, will soften the financial blow.
