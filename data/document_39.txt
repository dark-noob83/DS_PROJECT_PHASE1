Late Filing Penalty. You need to file your federal income tax return by the due date, or at least request an extension. Otherwise, the IRS automatically assesses a late-filing penalty, usually 5 percent of the amount of unpaid taxes, for every month or part of a month that you are late, up to 25 percent.
The IRS assesses a late-payment penalty if you do not pay 90 percent or more of your unpaid tax by April 15, even if you file Form 4868. For example, let's say you owe $5,000 in taxes: If you don't pay at least $4,500 when you file Form 4868, the IRS will assess a late-payment penalty.

Even if you file a return, you will incur a late payment penalty if the full amount of tax owed is not paid on time. This penalty is 0.5% of your unpaid tax; charged each month (or part of a month) that your tax is overdue, up to a maximum of 25%.
If you file your tax return on time and apply for an installment agreement, the IRS reduces your late-payment penalty to 0.25 percent per month. $5,000 x 0.0025 = $12.50 per month. If you do not apply for the filing extension, the late-filing payment fee is 4.5 percent of the unpaid tax per month up to five months. $5,000 x 0.045 = $225 per month. In addition to late-payment penalties, any tax you owe after April 15 will accrue interest.
