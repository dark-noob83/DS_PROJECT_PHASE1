Sugar is a five carbon (pentose sugar), in nucleic acids (both in DNA and in RNA). The pentose sugar in RNA has a hydroxyl group (-OH) linked to its number two Carbon atom. … The pentose sugar in DNA hasn't got an oxygen in that position (hence the name: Deoxyribonycleic Acid (DNA), only a-H atom.
Exploring a DNA chain The sugars in the backbone The backbone of DNA is based on a repeated pattern of a sugar group and a phosphate group. The full name of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, gives you the name of the sugar present-deoxyribose. Deoxyribose is a modified form of another sugar called ribose.
DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA.
Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule. Together, a base, sugar, and phosphate are called a nucleotide. Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix.
The sugar in RNA is ribose, whereas the sugar in DNA is deoxyribose. The only difference between the two is that in deoxyribose, there is an oxygen missing from the 2' carbon … (there is a H there instead of an OH). This makes DNA more stable/less reactive than RNA.
DNA structure. DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). The order of these bases is what determines DNA's instructions, or genetic code.
The sugar-phosphate supporting structure of the DNA double helix is  called the backbone. This is why the DNA is commonly referred to as  a double helix.
