The tally as of the end of last month was actually 50,240 but no press release has been issued that we’ve seen as of yet. GM had initially projected U.S. Volt sales of 45,000 for 2012 but then cut that back to a benign non-projection that it would “ match supply to demand ” from the single assembly plant that produces the global car, Detroit-Hamtramck.
Ford sold 763,402 F-series vehicles in 2013 alone. As Reuters reported, “Volt sales last year were flat, at 23,094. In the first three months this year, Volt sales dropped 15 percent to 3,606.”. GM has shut down production of the Volt many times because sales have not justified keeping the manufacturing lines open. Featuring a smaller, cheaper battery system, the new model Chevy Volt is going into production in Detroit in 2015. The Volt has sold a mere 58,158 units since it first went on sale just over three years ago. Despite price cuts, cash-back deals, and heavy promotion from President Obama and environmentalists, sales have been anemic. In comparison, the Ford F-series pickup truck, sold more than 70,000 units last month
The Volt was the top selling plug-in electric car in the United States until February 2015. The Volt/Ampera family of vehicles is the world's all-time best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle as of June 2015. The Volt MPV5 is a plug-in crossover hybrid and has a top speed of 100 mph (160 km/h) and an electric range of 32 miles (51 km). The MPV5 integrates design elements from the Volt, with a body style very similar to the Chevrolet Orlando and four inches larger than its predecessor, Chevrolet HHR.
Its 2012 sales also put the Volt well ahead of its nearest competitor, the Nissan Leaf. Nissan sold about 9,800 Leafs in 2012, an increase of just 1.5% over 2011. Still, Nissan pointed out, it was a record year for Leaf sales. General Motors sold three times as many Chevrolet Volts in 2012 as it did in 2011, which was the car's first full year on the market. GM sold 23,461 Volts in 2012 compared with just 7,671 in 2011
As of September 2015, global Volt / Ampera family sales are led by the Chevrolet Volt, with the United States as the main market with 82,624 units sold, followed by Canada with 4,820 units through September 2015, and the Netherlands with 1,065 Volts registered as of 31 December 2014. The Volt MPV5 is a plug-in crossover hybrid and has a top speed of 100 mph (160 km/h) and an electric range of 32 miles (51 km). The MPV5 integrates design elements from the Volt, with a body style very similar to the Chevrolet Orlando and four inches larger than its predecessor, Chevrolet HHR.
Chevy Volt sales are cranking up. GM sold 23,461 Volts in 2012 compared with just 7,671 in 2011. While it's an impressive jump, the Volt is still one of Chevy's lowest-selling cars. However, the Volt greatly outdid the Corvette, for instance, of which only 14,000 were sold last year. General Motors sold three times as many Chevrolet Volts in 2012 as it did in 2011, which was the car's first full year on the market. GM sold 23,461 Volts in 2012 compared with just 7,671 in 2011
Unfortunately for Nissan, that wasn't enough to catch the Chevrolet Volt. While the Volt didn't see the LEAF's growth in 2013, it still sold more with a final tally of 23,094 for the year. In December, the LEAF had its best month ever with 2,529 units sold versus the 2,392 units of the Volt. 2013 is over and the numbers are in, so we now know how many Volt plug-in hybrids and how many LEAF (LEAVES?) electric cars were sold. The LEAF made a valiant effort to grab the #1 spot, more than doubling its sales from 2012 (9,819) and reaching a final number of 22,610 for 2013
