The way I would interpret it is Tyelonol 4g is the safe dose in 24hrs, 650mg q4hr or 1000mg q6h for the safe dosage range. You might try the site below for more detailed information, but you should always seek to clarify these things w/ your instructor. 
Calculating and Verifying Safe Dosages • Set up ratios and calculate minimum and maximum safe ranges • Recommended range is 10 to 20 mg per dose 0.5 mg X mg1 kg 20 kgX 0.5 20X 10 mg per dose==×=1 mg X mg1 kg 20 kgX120X 20 mg per dose==×=.

Compare ordered with recommended dose – Ordered dose: • 20 mg – Recommended dose range: • 10 to 20 mg – Conclude ordered dose is safe
Calculating a safe medication dose range is just one example of a real world complex problem of medication administration. The skill requires the learner to interpret information in a drug handbook and apply the knowledge to a medication order with consideration of the patient's age, weight, and medical condition. 
64.2mg/2= 32.1 mg bid (this is the low range dose). 5mg x 21.4kg= 107mg/day to be given bid. 107mg/2= 53.5 mg bid (this is high range dose). The MD order is 40 mg bid (80mg/day). The safe range is 32.1mg-53.5 mg bid, so 40 mg bid is safe or the safe daily total 64.2mg-107 mg/day and 80 mg/day is safe. 5.
The maximum time between doses should not exceed 12 hours. The starting dose range is 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The effective dose of NEURONTIN in patients 3 to 4 years of age is 40 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. 
Example: A doctor orders 200 mg of Rocephin to be taken by a 15.4 lb infant every 8 hours. The medication label shows that 75-150 mg/kg per day is the appropriate dosage range. Is this doctor's order within the desired range? 24 hours in one day and the medication is ordered every 8 hours. Yes doctor has ordered a dosage within the desired range. Example: Solumedrol 1.5 mg/kg is ordered for a child weighing 74.8 lb. Solumedrol is available as 125 mg / 2mL.
The doctor orders Klonopin 1 mg daily for a child who weighs 36 pounds. Calculate the safe range for this medication based on a safe range of 0.01 0.05mg/kg/day. First calculate the child's weight in kilograms (kg). Divide 36 lb by 2.2 kg = 16.36 kg. Multiply the child s weight in kg by the lowest and highest safe dose. The safe range is 0.01mg/16.36kg/day (0.01 x 16.36 = 0.16mg) to 0.05mg/16.36kg/day (0.05 x 16.36 = 0.82mg).
Yes, it is safe to administer the acetaminophen because it is within the S&T dosage range of 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose. e. x mL160 x 5 1050 x 5 6.6 mL rounded to the nearest tenth Remember to round all doses to the nearest tenth.Exceptions: Round all narcotics, antiepileptics, and cardiac medications to nearest hundredth. Recommended 100 to 200 mg/kg/24 h q6–8 h The patient is receiving an S&T dose at 105.6 mg/kg/24 h. Between 100 and 200 mg/kg/24 h is safe. CALCULATING PEDIATRIC IV SOLUTIONS Pediatric patients require smaller volumes of IV fluids and medications than adults.
The dose is both safe and therapeutic for this child.• A dose smaller than 100 mg is considered safe but may not be therapeutic for the child’s weight. • Doses larger than 150 mg are considered too much for the child’s weight and may exceed the therapeutic range. There are exceptions—some dosages may be higher. Recommended 100 to 200 mg/kg/24 h q6–8 h The patient is receiving an S&T dose at 105.6 mg/kg/24 h. Between 100 and 200 mg/kg/24 h is safe. CALCULATING PEDIATRIC IV SOLUTIONS Pediatric patients require smaller volumes of IV fluids and medications than adults.
The dosage is safe, just not in the therapeutic range. Anything that is not over the max would be considered in the safe range. As far as not giving Lasix with Nephrotic Syndrome, I wasn't aware that you couldn't.
