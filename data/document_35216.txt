full definition of led a semiconductor diode that emits light when a voltage is applied to it and that is used especially in electronic devices as for an indicator light see led defined for english language learners see led defined for kids
a light emitting diode led is a semiconductor device that emits visible light when an electric current passes through it the light is not particularly bright but in most leds it is monochromatic occurring at a single wavelength
led tvs are still lcd tvs it is just that these new sets use led backlights rather than the fluorescent type backlights used in most other lcd tvs in other words led tvs should actually be labeled lcd led or led lcd tvs
that s not to downplay how good an lcd hdtv can look since the picture quality can be stunning but there s no denying that there is indeed a difference between them that said there are other differences worth taking into account
well the answer is yes and no but first we need to understand what these terms actually mean lcd liquid crystal display a prevalent model of hdtvs lcds are flat panel displays through which light can pass or be blocked
led televisions can be considerably thinner than lcds even coming as thin as 0 3 inches this however when mixed with the clearer image means that buying an led television is going to cost more than an lcd tv so now you know the difference between lcd and led there are other differences between them and even differences within them but hopefully now that you know the main things that make lcd and led screens different you can better decide which type of television is right for you
one type of led backlighting is referred to as edge lighting in this method a series led backlights are placed along the outside edges of the screen the light is then dispersed across the screen the advantage of this method is that the led lcd tv can be made very thin
