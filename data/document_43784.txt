-p Protocol: Shows connections for the protocol specified by Protocol. In this case, the Protocol can be tcp, udp, tcpv6, or udpv6. If this parameter is used with-s to display statistics by protocol, Protocol can be tcp, udp, icmp, ip, tcpv6, udpv6, icmpv6, or ipv6. -s: Displays statistics by protocol. By default, statistics are shown for the TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP protocols. If the IPv6 protocol for Windows XP is installed, statistics are shown for the TCP over IPv6, UDP over IPv6, ICMPv6, and IPv6 protocols. The-p parameter can be used to specify a set of protocols. -r: Displays the contents of the IP routing table.
Netstat. Displays active TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPv4 statistics (for the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols), and IPv6 statistics (for the IPv6, ICMPv6, TCP over IPv6, and UDP over IPv6 protocols). By default, statistics are shown for the TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP protocols. If the IPv6 protocol for Windows XP is installed, statistics are shown for the TCP over IPv6, UDP over IPv6, ICMPv6, and IPv6 protocols. The-p parameter can be used to specify a set of
Netstat. Netstat displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections. From a command prompt, type Netstat-a to display all connections and listening ports. Type netstat-r to display the contents of the IP routing table and any persistent routes. 
-a: Displays all active TCP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening. -e: Displays Ethernet statistics, such as the number of bytes and packets sent and received. This parameter can be combined with-s. By default, statistics are shown for the TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP protocols. If the IPv6 protocol for Windows XP is installed, statistics are shown for the TCP over IPv6, UDP over IPv6, ICMPv6, and IPv6 protocols. The-p parameter can be used to specify a set of
Netstat is a common command line TCP/IP networking utility available in most versions of Windows, Linux, UNIX and other operating systems. Netstat provides information and statistics about protocol s in use and current TCP/IP network connections. (The name derives from the words network and statistics .). By default, statistics are shown for IP, IPv6, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, TCPv6, UDP, and UDPv6; the-p option may be used to specify a subset of the default.
-p Protocol: Shows connections for the protocol specified by Protocol. In this case, the Protocol can be tcp, udp, tcpv6, or udpv6. If this parameter is used with-s to display statistics by protocol, Protocol can be tcp, udp, icmp, ip, tcpv6, udpv6, icmpv6, or ipv6. By default, statistics are shown for the TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP protocols. If the IPv6 protocol for Windows XP is installed, statistics are shown for the TCP over IPv6, UDP over IPv6, ICMPv6, and IPv6 protocols. The-p parameter can be used to specify a set of
The netstat command is a Command Prompt command used to display very detailed information about how your computer is communicating with other computers or network devices. -r = Execute netstat with-r to show the IP routing table. This is the same as using the route command to execute route print. -s = The-s option can be used with the netstat command to show detailed statistics by protocol.
When you use the netstat command together with the-o parameter, the command displays the owning PID that is associated with each connection. This parameter was not previously present in Windows 2000. After you install this update, you can map ports to PIDs by using the netstat-ano command. You can identify the port and the associated PID from the netstat-ano command output. You can then use Task Manager to identify the process that is associated with the PID. By default, Task Manager does not display the PID that is associated with a process. To display a PID in Task Manager, follow these steps:
protocol = When specifying a protocol with the-p option, you can use tcp, udp, tcpv6, or udpv6. If you use-s with-p to view statistics by protocol, you can use icmp, ip, icmpv6, or ipv6 in addition to the first four I mentioned. -r = Execute netstat with-r to show the IP routing table. This is the same as using the route command to execute route print. -s = The-s option can be used with the netstat command to show detailed statistics by protocol.
-s: Displays statistics by protocol. By default, statistics are shown for the TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IP protocols. If the IPv6 protocol for Windows XP is installed, statistics are shown for the TCP over IPv6, UDP over IPv6, ICMPv6, and IPv6 protocols. The-p parameter can be used to specify a set of protocols.
