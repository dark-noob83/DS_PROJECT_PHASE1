A signaling molecule. The term ligand is used for a molecule that specifically binds to another molecule, often a larger one. Ligand binding generally causes a receptor protein to undergo a change in shape. For many receptors, this shape change directly activates the receptor, enabling it to interact with other cellular molecules. For other kinds of receptors, the immediate effect of a ligand binding is to cause the aggregation of two or more receptor molecules, which leads to further molecular events inside the cell.
A ligand binds its receptor through a number of specific weak non-covalent bonds by fitting into a specific binding site or pocket. In situations where even low concentrations of a ligand will result in binding of most of the cognate receptors, the receptor affinity is considered to be high. Low receptor affinity occurs when a high concentration of the ligand is required for most receptors to be occupied. The dissociation constant (Kd,) is the concentration of ligand required to occupy one half of the total available receptors. This measurement of receptor affinity is often in the range of 10-4 to 10-9 mM. With prolonged exposure to a ligand (and occupation of the receptor) cells often become desensitized.
The cell membrane is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment. The cell membrane is selectively-permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells. It consists of the phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. In biochemistry, a receptor is a protein molecule, embedded in either the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm of a cell, to which one or more specific kinds of signaling molecules may attach.
In biochemistry and pharmacology, a ligand is a substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve a biological purpose. In protein-ligand binding, the ligand is usually a signal-triggering molecule binding to a site on a target protein. The binding typically results in a change of conformation of the target protein. In DNA-ligand binding studies, the ligand can be a small molecule, ion, or protein that binds to the DNA double helix. The binding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The docking (association) is usually reversible (dissociation)
High-affinity binding of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the binding energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered behavior of an associated ion channel or enzyme. In DNA-ligand binding studies, the ligand can be a small molecule, ion, or protein that binds to the DNA double helix. The binding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces.
Protein Properties: Binding Sites [edit]. A binding site is a position on a protein that binds to an incoming molecule that is smaller in size comparatively, called ligand. In proteins, binding sites are small pockets on the tertiary structure where ligands bind to it using weak forces (non-covalent bonding). Only a few residues actually participate in binding the ligand while the other residues in the protein act as a framework to provide correct conformation and orientation. Most binding sites are concave, but convex and flat shapes are also found. A ligand-binding site is a place of chemical specificity and affinity on protein that binds or forms chemical bonds with other molecules and ions or protein ligands. The affinity of the binding of a protein and a ligand is a chemically attractive force between the protein and ligand
The hydrophobic effect is the observed tendency of nonpolar substances to aggregate in aqueous solution and exclude water molecules. This occurs because interactions between the hydrophobic molecules allow water molecules to bond more freely, increasing the entropy of the system. The word hydrophobic literally means water-fearing, and it describes the segregation and apparent repulsion between water and nonpolar substances. The hydrophobic effect is responsible for the separation of a mixture of oil and water into its two component
Hydrophobic groups on the protein bind to hydrophillic groups on the column. The more hydrophobic a protein is, the stronger it will bind to the column. Load the proteins in the presence of a high concentration of ammonium sulfate (not ammonium per sulfate). Affinity chromatography relies on the biological functions of a protein to bind it to a column. The most common type involves a ligand, a specific small biomolecule. This small molecule is immobilized and attached to a column matrix, such as cellulose or polyacrylamide.
