Bipolar DepressionMonotherapy In the short-term, ﬂexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study,dystonia occurred in 0.9% of LATUDA-treated subjects (0.0% and 1.8% for LATUDA 20 to60 mg/day and LATUDA 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively) compared to 0.0% of subjectsreceiving placebo. The frequency of akathisiaincreased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATUDA 20 mg, 10.7% for LATUDA 40 mg,12.3% for LATUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg).

In the monotherapy study, the higher dose range (80 mg to 120 mg per day) did not provide additional efficacy, on average, compared to the lower dose range (20 to 60 mg per day)
Administration with dfoodsubstantially increases the absorption of LATUDA (2.3, 12.3).• Moderate and Severe Renal Impairment: Recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day,and the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg per day (2.4, 8.6). The frequency of akathisiaincreased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for LATUDA 20 mg, 10.7% for LATUDA 40 mg,12.3% for LATUDA 80 mg, and 22.0% for LATUDA 120 mg). Akathisia was reported by 7.4%(9/121) of patients receiving 160 mg/day. Akathisia occurred in 3.0% of subjects receivingplacebo.
