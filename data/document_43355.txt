Stands for outstanding blow job. Given to a man because it was well deserved. Usually because he has done something spectacular. Also given until the recipient has achieved an orgasm. If bj's are given as part of foreplay, they usually aren't completed. 
The OBJ file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone â€” namely, the position of each vertex, the UV position of each texture coordinate vertex, vertex normals, and the faces that make each polygon defined as a list of vertices, and texture vertices. MTL files are commonly accompanied by and referenced from OBJ files that define geometry upon which the materials of the MTL file are mapped. The MTL format, although still widely used, is outdated and does not fully support later technologies such as specular maps and parallax maps.

OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package. The file format is open and has been adopted by other 3D graphics application vendors. For the most part it is a universally accepted format. MTL files are commonly accompanied by and referenced from OBJ files that define geometry upon which the materials of the MTL file are mapped. The MTL format, although still widely used, is outdated and does not fully support later technologies such as specular maps and parallax maps.
Want or you can just put your phone on vibrate..... 3. 1. Go to settings then sounds then text tone to change it to what you want or you can just put your phone on vibrate.

OBJ is a programming language family introduced by Joseph Goguen in 1976. A family of declarative ultra high-level languages. Abstract types, generic modules, subsorts, pattern-matching modulo equations, E-strategies, module expressions, theories and views. For the massively parallel RRM.
