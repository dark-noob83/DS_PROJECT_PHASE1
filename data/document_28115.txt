description hemoglobin h disease is a subtype of alpha thalassemia see 604131 in which patients have compound heterozygosity for alpha thalassemia caused by deletion of one alpha globin gene and for alpha 0 thalassemia caused by deletion in cis of 2 alpha globin genes summary by lal et al 2011
abstract over the years study of the disorders of hemoglobin has served as a paradigm for gaining insights into the cellular and molecular biology as well as the pathophysiology of inherited genetic disorders to date more than 1000 disorders of hemoglobin synthesis and or structure have been identified and characterized
thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder people with thalassemia disease are not able to make enough hemoglobin which causes severe anemia hemoglobin is found in red blood cells and carries oxygen to all parts of the body 
alterations in the gene for one of the two hemoglobin subunit chains alpha a or beta b are called mutations often mutations change a single amino acid building block in the subunit most commonly the change is innocuous perturbing neither the structure nor function of the hemoglobin molecule people who have one sickle mutant gene and one normal beta gene have sickle cell trait which is benign hemoglobin c hemoglobin c results from a mutation in the beta globin gene and is the predominant hemoglobin found in people with hemoglobin c disease a 2 b 2

hemoglobinopathies hemoglobin disorders alterations in the gene for one of the two hemoglobin subunit chains alpha a or beta b are called mutations mutations that produce this condition are termed thalassemias people who have one sickle mutant gene and one normal beta gene have sickle cell trait which is benign hemoglobin c hemoglobin c results from a mutation in the beta globin gene and is the predominant hemoglobin found in people with hemoglobin c disease a 2 b 2
a number sign is used with this entry because hemoglobin h disease is caused by contiguous gene deletion of the hemoglobin alpha 1 hba1 141800 and alpha 2 hba2 141850 genes on one chromosome 16 and a defect deletional or nondeletional in either hba1 or hba2 on the other hemoglobin h disease is a subtype of alpha thalassemia see 604131 in which patients have compound heterozygosity for alpha thalassemia caused by deletion of one alpha globin gene and for alpha 0 thalassemia caused by deletion in cis of 2 alpha globin genes summary by lal et al 2011
if our red blood cells cannot transport enough oxygen the whole body suffers as a result organs become undersupplied or may even fail a genetic mutation in the oxygen transporter hemoglobin is often the root cause of diseases which are categorized under the medical term hemoglobinopathiesare genetic diseases that result from impairment of the red blood pigment hemoglobin sickle cell anemia is the most common and severe hemoglobinopathy characterized frequently by recurrent painful symptoms side effects of currently available treatments are another issue that affects these patients
sickle cell anemia a common form of sickle cell disease is caused by a particular mutation in the hbb gene this mutation results in the production of an abnormal version of beta globin called hemoglobin s or hbs in this condition hemoglobin s replaces both beta globin subunits in hemoglobin beta globin is a component subunit of a larger protein called hemoglobin which is located inside red blood cells in adults hemoglobin normally consists of four protein subunits two subunits of beta globin and two subunits of another protein called alpha globin which is produced from another gene called hba
hemoglobinopathies are genetic inherited disorders of hemoglobin the oxygen carrying protein of the red blood cells the hemoglobin molecule is composed of four separate polypeptide chains of amino acids two alpha chains and two beta chains as well as four iron bearing heme groups that bind oxygen
