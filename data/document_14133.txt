In 2010, the University of Texas at Arlington was featured in the news for drilling 22 wells on a single drill pad that will drain natural gas from 1100 acres beneath the campus. Over a 25 year life-time the wells are expected to produce a total of 110 billion cubic feet of gas. The alternative would be to drill many wells, each requiring a drilling pad, pond, access road and gathering line. (C) Increase the length of the pay zone. If a vertical well is drilled through a 50-foot-thick reservoir rock then natural gas or oil can seep into the well through 50 linear feet of pay zone.
The cost to drill an oil well can vary. A conventional vertical well in central Canada can cost as low as $350,000, a horizontal well with hydraulic fracturing in North Dakota can be as high as $5,000,000 and an off-shore well in the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea can be a $20 or $30 million monster. Once a well begins producing oil there are ongoing costs that include water disposal, trucking, storage and other various operating necessities. These are calculated as a cost per barrel and can varry as low as $15 and as high as $80 depending on where the well is located and what type of oil is being produced.
How much does it cost to drill a new well? It depends how deep they have to drill for the water. ANS 2 -In Canada it currently costs about $48 per foot plus a 'set up ' charge of approximately $3,500. - In my area an … average well is anywhere between 100 and 200 feet deep, so that cost would be $8,300 to $13,000. What is the average cost to drill a well? $100.00 per foot That estimate seems extremely high, but I'm sure that the actual costs will depend greatly on the local market situation and geology.
The average total drilling cost in 2008 was roughly $2.5 to $3 million for a 15,000-foot well, while a 20,000-foot well often cost as much as $3.5 to $4 million. In 2013, the average total drilling cost for a 21,000-foot well is approximately $3 to $3.5 million. Oil and gas operators in the Bakken have seen EURs for dual laterals increase from an average of approximately 375,000 barrels of oil in 2008 to more than 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent in 2013. In addition to drilling an extra 5,000 feet or more, the time to drill a well to TD has decreased significantly. Five years ago, 16,000-foot wells were taking an average of 32 days to drill. Now, the average drill time for 21,000-foot wells is 18 days or less.
The record-depth Kola Borehole used non-rotary mud motor drilling to achieve a depth of over 12,000 metres (39,000 ft). Until the 1970s, most oil wells were vertical, although lithological and mechanical imperfections cause most wells to deviate at least slightly from true vertical. The well is created by drilling a hole 12 cm to 1 meter (5 in to 40 in) in diameter into the earth with a drilling rig that rotates a drill string with a bit attached.
$7.6M. A new 92-page study just released by the University of Pittsburgh (copy embedded below) takes a realistic look at the direct costs, and economic impacts, of drilling a single Marcellus Shale gas well. Undergraduate and graduate students from Pitt found that a single well had direct costs of more than $7.6 million. Or think of it this way: More than $7.6 million is invested in a local community, on average, for each and every well drilled.
Most wells drilled for water, oil, natural gas, information or other subsurface objectives are vertical wells-drilled straight down into the earth. However, drilling at an angle other than vertical can obtain information, hit targets and stimulate reservoirs in ways that can not be achieved with a vertical well. The alternative would be to drill many wells, each requiring a drilling pad, pond, access road and gathering line. (C) Increase the length of the pay zone. If a vertical well is drilled through a 50-foot-thick reservoir rock then natural gas or oil can seep into the well through 50 linear feet of pay zone.
The study, called the “Economic Impact of the Value Chain of a Marcellus Shale Well,” looked in depth at an EQT-drilled well in Washington County, PA. Undergraduate and graduate students from Pitt found that a single well had direct costs of more than $7.6 million. Or think of it this way: More than $7.6 million is invested in a local community, on average, for each and every well drilled. The costs to drill a well break down this way: 1  Land acquisition and leasing: $2.1 million. 2  Permitting: $10,000
Average day rates for the various rig types are given in the related link. Day rates on a semi-submersible, deepwater rig capable of drilling in 5,000 ft or more, with all services included, may cost 1 million dollars per day, or 100 million dollars if drilling takes 100 days. What is the average cost to drill a well? $100.00 per foot That estimate seems extremely high, but I'm sure that the actual costs will depend greatly on the local market situation and geology.
One also cannot directly translate shale gas development costs in U.S. plays to other prospective areas around the world. For example, a 10,500 vertical foot well with a 4,000 foot lateral in the Haynesville Shale costs about $8 million, Medlock said, but the same well in Poland would cost $14 million to $16 million.
