By about 40,000 years ago, Homo sapiens had evolved into modern human beings, Homo sapiens sapiens (wise, wise man). In 1868, the first fossils of modern Homo sapiens sapiens were found in Cro-Magnon caves in southwest France, which gave that name to all early Homo sapiens sapiens. 
This is when ancient animals would gradually change forms over a long period of time.the first land animals appear on earth? About 417 million years age during the Devonian era. As for creationism there are skeletons of humans who are much older than 6000 years. Hence it is the first plant as well as first animal. Some millions of year back. The first known fossils of what is possibly animal life appear in the Ediacara biota just prior to the Cambrian era.
If you believe in creationism, the first land animals probably came to earth about 5 or 6 thousand years ago. This is my uneducated guess that God created them. ____________ … ______________________________________________ This is incorrect. Dinosaurs were alive millions and billions of years ago. Hence it is the first plant as well as first animal. Some millions of year back. The first known fossils of what is possibly animal life appear in the Ediacara biota just prior to the Cambrian era.

An essay donated by Rev. Jim Persinger Sponsored link. I contend that Adam and Eve were not the first humans on Earth as believed by...well virtually ever Christian and Jew on the planet. Humans were created on the sixth day, God rested on the seventh and created Adam and Eve later. 
During the Silurian era the first simple animals began to appear on land. It is thought that this is due to the development of the Ozone layer protecting non-aquatic life for UV radiation. (This refers to the appearance of animals on dry land. Animals in the sea existed long before.). Hence it is the first plant as well as first animal. Some millions of year back. The first known fossils of what is possibly animal life appear in the Ediacara biota just prior to the Cambrian era.
This timeline of evolution of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the major events during the development of life on planet Earth. In biology, evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. 1 2.4 billion years ago, many obligate anaerobes, in the Great Oxygenation Event; 2  252 million years ago, the trilobites, in the Permian–Triassic extinction event; 3  65 million years ago, the pterosaurs and nonavian dinosaurs, in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
Early Modern Homo sapiens. All people today are classified as Homo sapiens. Our species of humans first began to evolve nearly 200,000 years ago in association with technologies not unlike those of the early Neandertals. It is now clear that early Homo sapiens, or modern humans, did not come after the Neandertals but were their contemporaries. So far, the earliest finds of modern Homo sapiens skeletons come from Africa. They date to nearly 200,000 years ago on that continent. They appear in Southwest Asia around 100,000 years ago and elsewhere in the Old World by 60,000-40,000 years ago.
