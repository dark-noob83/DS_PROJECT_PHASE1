Dividends are after-tax cash payments to shareholders. The retained-earnings account in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet holds the accumulated profits, minus dividend payments. The statement of cash flow shows a company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Step 3. Subtract the dividend payments from the result to get the ending retained-earnings balance. For example, if the beginning retained earnings balance is $100,000, net income is $50,000 and dividend payments are $25,000, the ending retained-earnings balance is $125,000 ($100,000 + $50,000 - $25,000).
Subtract the retained earnings from the net income to find the total dividends paid out. For example, if the company retained $200,000 in earnings in the current year and had $650,000 in net income, the company paid out $450,000 in dividends.
1. Determine the net income of the company. To find a company's dividend payout ratio, first find its net income for the time period you're analyzing (one year is the typical period for dividend payout ratio calculation). This information can be found in a company's income statement.
The dividend payout ratio is the amount of dividends paid to stockholders relative to the amount of total net income of a company. The amount that is not paid out in dividends to stockholders is held by the company for growth. The amount that is kept by the company is called retained earnings.
The amount calculated is your retained earnings. For example, add the beginning retained earnings amount of $100,000 to net income of $50,000 to get $150,000. Subtract preferred stock dividends of $4,000 and common stock dividends of $5,000 from the $150,000. The retained earnings amount is $141,000.
A simple example would be a company who pays out 100% of their net income in dividends. In this situation, net income would be equal to dividends. Using the formula for this example, the dividend payout ratio would be 1 or 100%.
