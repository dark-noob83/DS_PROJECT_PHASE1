Pancreatic cysts are pockets of fluid on or in the pancreas, an accessory organ of the digestive system that produces digestive enzymes and hormones. Most pancreatic cysts are not cancerous and usually do not produce symptoms. Some, however, may be precursors to pancreatic cancer.
While it is virtually impossible to tell what caused a specific person to develop pancreatic cancer, there are some important principles of cancer biology that can help us understand why pancreatic cancer develops, and large population-based studies help us understand the many risk factors for this disease.
Symptoms. You may not have symptoms from pancreatic cysts, which are often found when imaging tests of the abdomen are done for another reason. When signs or symptoms of pancreatic cysts do occur, they typically include: 1  Persistent abdominal pain, which may radiate to your back. 2  A mass you can feel in your upper abdomen.
Understanding Pancreatic Cysts. Pancreatic cysts are pockets of fluid on or in the pancreas, an accessory organ of the digestive system that produces digestive enzymes and hormones. Most pancreatic cysts are not cancerous and usually do not produce symptoms. Some, however, may be precursors to pancreatic cancer.
Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include alcoholism, gallstones, trauma, and surgery.
Pancreatic cysts are collections (pools) of fluid within the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts, that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts and do not contain specialized lining cells.
The cause of most pancreatic cysts is unknown. Some cysts are associated with rare illnesses including von Hippel-Lindau disease, a genetic disorder that can affect the pancreas and other organs.
