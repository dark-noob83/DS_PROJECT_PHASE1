Eventually the Egyptians began to make boats from wood. They used acacia wood from Egypt and imported cedar wood from Lebanon. They also began to use a giant sail in the middle of the boat so they could catch the wind when heading upstream. 1 The first papyrus boats are estimated to have been made around 4000 BC. 2  The Egyptians developed many types of boats. 3  Some were specialized for fishing and traveling, while others were designed for carrying cargo or going to war.
They don’t deteriorate like wooden boats do. Fiberglass fibers are lightweight, stronger than steel, and won’t stretch or rot. For this boat, a fiberglass mold is made by spraying gun roving and resin into the form.
Once you know how a fiberglass boat is made, you'll be shocked at how simple of a concept this is. Fiberglass is extremely easy to work with and is one of the most popular types of materials used to make boats. Those who make fiberglass boats will use the materials on the list below. 1  Boat mold. 1 Gelcoat the mold. 2  Fiberglass boats are made with female molds, meaning that the mold is concave. 3  It appears to be a backward process and if it is thought of that way, it's much easier to understand. 4  Part of this process is applying the gelcoat.
The most common type of Egyptian boats were made out of papyrus reeds. These type of boats were used to travel short distances. The reeds were bound toghether by ropes and wer … e usually used for hunting fish. They were eather poled or paddled. Other boats were mad out of cedar wood imported from Lebanon.
