In indoor volleyball, for non-deciding sets (first 2 of a 2-out-of-three match, or first 4 for a best 3-of-5 match), the teams play until one scores 25 points, winning by at least two points. The deciding set is played to 15 points, winning by at least two points. So the only time a set is played to 15 points is in a deciding set. For indoor: 6.2 TO WIN A SET A set (except the deciding, fifth set) is won by the team which first scores 25 points with a minimum lead of two points. In the case of a 24-24 tie, play is continued until a two-point lead is achieved (26-24; 27-25; …)
Making the world better, one answer at a time. It depends on the rules, but usually there are 5 games in a match. Each of the first four is composed of 25 points with a two point lead, although there is sometimes a cap, or a maximum number of points that a game can go up to. The last game is generally 15 points.
In 2008, the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to 25 for women's volleyball (men's volleyball remained at 30.) If a fifth (deciding) set is reached, the minimum required score remains at 15. The three standard volleyball formations are known as 4–2, 6–2 and 5–1, which refers to the number of hitters and setters respectively. 4–2 is a basic formation used only in beginners' play, while 5–1 is by far the most common formation in high-level play.
Winning a Set. Each set is played to 25 points, except if the teams are tied at two sets apiece after four sets -- or one set apiece after two sets under USA Volleyball’s tournament rules. In that case, the deciding tiebreaker set is played to 15 points. But the winner of the next point would be up 25-24, and it would be set point for that team. There’s no limit to how many set points there can be in a set, just as there is no limit on how many points a set can have. Beyond 25 -- or 15 in the tiebreaker set -- the teams play until someone has a two-point edge, whether that’s 26-24 or 30-28 or 120-118 or something else
Matches are played best of five sets. The first four sets are played to 25 points, with the final set being played to 15 points. A team must win a set by two points. There is no ceiling, so a set continues until one of the teams gains a two-point advantage. Every rally would now earn a point. The first four sets are played to 25, but the winning team must be ahead by at least two points. The fifth set is played to 15 – and again the winner must have a two-point margin.
For example, if the score in a set is 24-21, then the team in the lead can win if it scores the next point, because it will have 25 points and a lead of at least two points. On the other hand, if the score is tied 24-24, then the next team to score will hold a lead of only 25-24, meaning it cannot win the set. But the winner of the next point would be up 25-24, and it would be set point for that team. There’s no limit to how many set points there can be in a set, just as there is no limit on how many points a set can have. Beyond 25 -- or 15 in the tiebreaker set -- the teams play until someone has a two-point edge, whether that’s 26-24 or 30-28 or 120-118 or something else
Setting up the Court. A volleyball court is 30 feet wide and 60 feet long; each side of the net is 30 feet by 30 feet. A 2-inch line borders the court to serve as the out-of-bounds line. Any ball that touches the line during play is still considered in the court. In volleyball, there are six people on the court at one time for each team
Game can refer to a volleyball set, or to the whole match. Volleyball sets are normally played to 25 points (30 in some mens' tournaments). Whoever reaches to 25 first, bu … t by a point difference of 2, wins. A set can thus be extended, i.e. it may finish 33-31.
