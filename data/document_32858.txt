Sklar'sÂ® Freer Elevator is an orthopedic instrument that can be used as a multipurpose tool in many procedures, although it is primarily used for blunt debulking and lifting periosteum from bones in confined areas. This double-ended instrument typically has a rounded handle with two slightly curved, tear-drop tips. One tip is blunt while the other is sharp. This product has 4.5mm tips and is 7-3/4 inches long.
Novo Surgical's Freer Septum Elevator is commonly used in nasal septum surgeries. The blunt end is used to lift the mucoperichondrial flap and its curvature allows for the navigation of tricky contours. In addition, this tool could be used in elevating the periosteum over the underlying bone. Please wait...
