How ever long it takes for the hair to grow, it takes about 12 to 18 months for the hair to grow in fully. Sometimes at 12 months as the hair is cycling into what is known as asynchrony (to be explained), the hair thickness can actually dip a little towards a year. At 18 months, asynchrony can be fully re-established.

After three and four months of the surgery, the hair will start growing at least half inch per month. But, you will see proper full growth after ten to twelve months.

While a hair transplant is a safe and efficient procedure, it is also a long term process. Understanding how the transplanted hair grows will help to keep expectations realistic. For the average hair transplant client, the initial growth is slow and the hairs that do grow in are short and thin.
Exactly how long it takes for the transplanted hair to grow is highly individual and depends on many different factors, including the health of the client and the overall success of the hair transplant. A couple of weeks after the hair transplant surgery, hairs are expected to fall out. This is normal and occurs to all hair grafts after any hair transplant procedure. Over the following weeks and months, usually within the first 3 months, the client can expect to see a few new hairs growing in.
