This is often what the term means, but as FM is a way to put information on a carrier, that type of modulation could be used on just about any signal you'd care to apply it to. Certainly communications and amateur radio use it frequently on frequencies outside the so-called FM broadcast band. You decide what signal you want to listen to, you tune your radio to the frequency of the station you want, and it discards the signals on all other frequencies. Commercial FM stations in the US are licensed to operate on frequencies in the range of 88 to 108 MHz.
Medium wave (MW) is the part of the medium frequency (MF) radio band used mainly for AM radio broadcasting. For Europe the MW band ranges from 526.5 kHz to 1606.5 kHz, using channels spaced every 9 kHz, and in North America an extended MW broadcast band goes from 535 kHz to 1705 kHz, using 10 kHz spaced channels. Names such as FM/AM Stereo or AM & FM Stereo can be misleading and usually do not signify that the radio will decode C-QUAM AM stereo, whereas a set labeled FM Stereo/AM Stereo or AMAX Stereo will support AM stereo.
MW or Medium Wave is just a higher frequency range than LW. The higher frequency ranges have medium distances between the radio waves, compared to LW, and thus the term Medium Wave. FM broadcasting is in the 88-108 MHz band. AM (Amplitude Modulation) is typically used at frequencies below VHF (but not limited to that). AM radio amplitude modulates the carrier signal. AM broadcast radio operates in the 500 KHz - 1.5 MHz frequency band.
Best Answer: FM is frequency modulation, that is the information is sent by varying the frequency (the wave amplitude never changes.) MW (medium wave) and LW (long wave) are AM (amplitude modulation) - the information is sent by varying the amplitude, but keeping the frequency the same. FM broadcasting is in the 88-108 MHz band. AM (Amplitude Modulation) is typically used at frequencies below VHF (but not limited to that). AM radio amplitude modulates the carrier signal. AM broadcast radio operates in the 500 KHz - 1.5 MHz frequency band.
In general, FM radio refers to radio that is broadcast using FM, or frequency modulation, as its modulation scheme. Frequency modulation is the shifting of the frequency of th … e transmitted signal above and below an assigned center frequency or carrier frequency to impress the signal on the carrier. You decide what signal you want to listen to, you tune your radio to the frequency of the station you want, and it discards the signals on all other frequencies. Commercial FM stations in the US are licensed to operate on frequencies in the range of 88 to 108 MHz.
In the case of radio broadcasting, the information embedded onto the radio waves is typically Voice and Music. FM (Frequency Modulation) is just a method of Modulation typically used in the VHF frequency ranges, but not limited to VHF. FM radio frequency modulates the carrier signal. FM broadcasting is in the 88-108 MHz band. AM (Amplitude Modulation) is typically used at frequencies below VHF (but not limited to that). AM radio amplitude modulates the carrier signal. AM broadcast radio operates in the 500 KHz - 1.5 MHz frequency band.
Report Abuse. Am stands for Aplitude Modulation-that is, the radio signal changes in the actual electrical impluses up and down. FM stands for Frequency Modulation- that is, the radio signals change in the actual frequency. BC used to stand for Before Christ and AD used to stand for After Death but now these are not PC so they're using BCE (Before Christian Era). larry_the_orc · 9 years ago. Thumbs up. 1.

The numbers in an FM radio station represent the frequency the station transmits the signal on. The frequency range for FM band radio stations is from 87.5 MHz to 108.0 MHz. T … hese radio frequencies are considered VHF or Very High Frequency. You decide what signal you want to listen to, you tune your radio to the frequency of the station you want, and it discards the signals on all other frequencies. Commercial FM stations in the US are licensed to operate on frequencies in the range of 88 to 108 MHz.
mw. .mw is the Internet country code top-level domain for Malawi. In 2002 the IANA recommended that administration of the ccTLD be transferred to the Malawi Sustainable Development Network Programme from Computer Solutions LTD Prices for .mw domains are 100 USD for the first two years, followed by 50 USD per year. see more on Definitions.net »
