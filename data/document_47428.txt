Cristae. Definition. noun, singular: crista. (cell biology). The infoldings or inward projections of the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, which are studded with proteins and increase the surface area for chemical reactions to occur like cellular respiration. (anatomy). Crests or ridges projecting from a surface, as in cristae cutis (dermal ridges on palms and soles
Cristae (singular crista) are the internal compartments formed by the inner membrane of a Mitochondrion..   They are studded with proteins, including ATP synthase and a v … ariety of cytochromes. The maximum surface for chemical reactions to occur is within the mitochondria. The cristae are the inner foldings of membrane within the mitochondria. On the cristae, there are … sites where cellular respiration occurs. Cellular respiration breaks down sugars into energy to be used in the cell.
The maximum surface for chemical reactions to occur is within the mitochondria. Cristae are the infoldings of the inner membrane of a mitochondrion. They are studded with proteins, including ATP synthase and a variety of cytochromes, and function in cellular respiration. They provide more surface area for cellular respiration to happen. '/.

A crista (/ˈkrɪstə/ , pl. cristae cristæ and) cristae is a fold in the inner membrane of a. mitochondrion Cristae are studded with proteins, including ATP synthase and a variety of cytochromes. With the discovery of the dual membrane nature of mitochondria, the pioneers of mitochondrial ultrastructural research proposed different models for the organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane.
Mitochondrial cristae are folds of the mitochondrial inner membrane that provide an increase in the surface area. This allows a greater space for processes that happen across this membrane. The electron transport chain and chemiosmosis are the processes which help produce ATP in the final steps of cellular respiration. Function of Mitochondrial Cristae. Before we can explain the functioning of the crista (plural = cristae), we need to revisit what a mitochondrion does. The mitochondrion is the cellular organelle where cellular respiration takes place.

A crista (/ˈkrɪstə/ , pl. cristae cristæ and) cristae is a fold in the inner membrane of a. Mitochondrion the name is from The latin for crest or, plume and it gives the inner membrane its characteristic wrinkled, shape providing a large amount of surface area for chemical reactions to occur. on Cristae are studded with proteins, including ATP synthase and a variety of cytochromes. With the discovery of the dual membrane nature of mitochondria, the pioneers of mitochondrial ultrastructural research proposed different models for the organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane.
The function of cristae is to expand the surface area of the mitochondria. The cristae are the inner foldings of membrane within the mitochondria. On the cristae, there are … sites where cellular respiration occurs. Cellular respiration breaks down sugars into energy to be used in the cell.
