This part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume, causing Iceland to be subaerial (above the surface of the sea). Iceland is located at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through the small Icelandic island of Grimsey grímsey off the main'island s northern. coast

This makes Iceland one of the most geologically active places on Earth. Iceland is located east of Greenland in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. Iceland is around 20 million years old, which is rather young geologically speaking. Some of the most active volcanoes in the world are located in Iceland. This is due to Iceland remaining situated on a hotspot. A hotspot is an area under the crust that is relatively hot that receives energy from a thermal plume. Historical volcanism in Iceland provides more information on Iceland's volcanoes and their past eruptions. A detailed map of Iceland lying in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

Sea ice around Iceland. Ice in the ocean around Iceland has mostly arrived from afar. It comes here from the Denmark strait, which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, between Iceland and Greenland.

Late winter the ice can cover fishing grounds northwest of Iceland.
