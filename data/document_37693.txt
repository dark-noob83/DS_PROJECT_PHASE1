Chord-Math word definition. Definition and properties of a chord-a line segment that joins two points on the circumference of a circle. Intersecting Secant Angles Theorem. The angle made by two secants that intersect outside a circle is half the difference between the intercepted arc measures.
Secant. The term secant is a very frequently used term which is originated from a Latin language word secare, the meaning of which is to cut. Secant is an important concept that is used in the reference of geometry and trigonometry both. Secant is a line that cuts a circle in two points.
Definition of Secants and Tangents. A secant is a line that intersects the circle in two different points and a tangent is a line that intersects the circle in exactly one point, called the point of tangency. Secant and tangent theorems can be used to find congruency, similarity, and special length relationships between the two.
Secant function (sec) - Trigonometry. Definition of secant function in trigonometry as applied to right triangles. Secant of a circle definition. Definition and properties of a secant-a line that intersects a circle at two points. (C) 2009 Copyright Math Open Reference.
Secant can be defined in both geometry and trigonometry. Secant is illustrated in following two ways:Geometrical Definition of Secant. In geometry, a secant is a line which intersects a circle at exactly two points. Secant line is a straightly line that passes through the circle and hence cuts it at
