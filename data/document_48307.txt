parkinson s disease or simply parkinson s or pd is the most common form of parkinsonism a group of motor system disorders it is a slowly progressing degenerative disease that is usually associated with the following symptoms all of which result from the loss of dopamine producing brain cells
parkinsonism is the umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of tremors muscle rigidity and slowness of movement parkinson s disease is the most common type of parkinsonism but there are also some rarer types where a specific cause can be identified these include parkinsonism caused by
other symptoms are common but not everyone with parkinson s disease will have all of them they may include restless sleep or daytime fatigue a soft voice or slurred speech difficulty swallowing memory problems confusion or dementia oily skin and dandruff constipation
in parkinson s disease certain nerve cells neurons in the brain gradually break down or die many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine when dopamine levels decrease it causes abnormal brain activity leading to signs of
parkinson s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine
dbs is a way to inactivate parts of the brain that cause parkinson s disease and associated symptoms electrodes can be implanted into one of three areas of the brain the globus pallidus the thalamus or the subthalamic nucleus on one or both sides
pd is the most common form of parkinsonism 1 in which disorders of other causes produce features and symptoms that closely resemble parkinson s disease while most forms of parkinsonism have no known cause there are cases in which the cause is known or suspected or where the symptoms result from another disorder
causes of parkinson s disease parkinson s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine
a shortage of dopamine parkinson s disease occurs when nerve cells or neurons in an area of the brain that controls movement become impaired and or die normally these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine but when the neurons die or become impaired they produce less dopamine
