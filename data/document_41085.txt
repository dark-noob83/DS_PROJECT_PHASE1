1 If a restaurant only charges a nominal delivery fee of $10 or less, a tip of around 7 to 12% is likely appropriate. 2  If they charge a delivery fee of more than $20, and the distance traveled is not terribly far, then tips of 5% or less (and no more than 10%) are probably more
If anyone deserves a tip, a caterer definitely does! Caterer tipping is completely expected. So much so that most catering companies include a 15-18% “service charge” in their contracts. To put it simply, that is the tip! It is divided up amongst the workers who contributed to your event.
If the bartenders are separate from the caterer (usually the case when you have a separate contract for the bar), 10-15% of the total bar bill is a fairly standard tip. Again, double check that the service charge is not the tip.
Tips can add up quickly, costing you a few thousand dollars. Gratuities for caterers alone can be $200 to $600 or more, for example, depending on the number of guests, your catering costs, and where you live.
Tipping on corporate catering is a little murky compared to the customary 15-20% expected for good service dining in at a restaurant. Below you will find suggestions, but remember-how much you tip is entirely up to you! DO Take Into Account the Delivery Fee when determining tip!
The amount tipped to the caterer may vary based on the length of time spent at your event, but a proper tip may be a percentage of the bill, or offered as a per-server gratuity -- a set amount per server -- 15 to 20 percent of the total bill, or up to $50 per server.

Catering: If your contract doesn't include gratuity, you should tip 15 to 20 percent of the total bill. Another way to tip is offering $50 to $100 for each chef and $20 to $50 per server.
