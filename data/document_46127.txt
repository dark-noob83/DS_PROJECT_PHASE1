Change the value in the B1 cell to 4 and press the Enter key. Notice that the result in the C1 cell changes to reflect the new value of 1. Delete the value in the C1 cell. Now enter =5-4 into the cell. Notice that Excel will also subtract numbers entered directly into the cell. The result displayed is 1.
Add and subtract numbers. Adding and subtracting in Excel is easy; you just have to create a simple formula to do it. Just remember that all formulas in Excel begin with an equal sign (=), and you can use the formula bar to create them. Do any of the following: Add two or more numbers in one cell. Click any blank cell, and then type an equal sign (=) to start a formula. After the equal sign, type a few numbers separated by a plus sign (+). For example, 50+10+5+3. Press RETURN. If you use the example numbers, the result is 68.
To subtract two or more numbers in Excel you need to create a formula. Important points to remember about Excel formulas: 1  Formulas in Excel always begin with the equal sign 2  (=). The equal sign is always typed into the cell where you want the answer to appear. 3  The subtraction sign in Excel is the dash (-).
I have a value in cell A1 and a value in cell B1. I would like to have a formula that highlights if the value in cell B1 is plus or minus 10% of A1. Ostensibly, you might write: =ABS(B1/A1)=10%. That returns TRUE if the magnitude of B1 is 10% of the magnitude of A1; FALSE otherwise.
Subtract numbers in a range. To do this task, use the SUM function. Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting. Note There is no SUBTRACT function in Excel. Use the SUM function and convert any numbers that you want to subtract to their negative values.
