The first camera invented was made by Alexander Wolcott. His camera design was patented on May 8, 1840. His invention made it possible for candid photos to be taken and not fade away with time. Mr. Wolcott also has the distinction of opening the earliest photography shop (known as a daguerran parlor) in New York. The First Camera Invented. The first camera invented by Mr. Wolcott in 1841 received U.S. patent number 1,582. This camera could take candid photos and Mr. Wolcott used the daguerreotype process to reproduce the images on paper.
Viewing a daguerreotype is unlike looking at any other type of photograph. The image does not sit on the surface of the metal, but appears to be floating in space, and the illusion of reality, especially with examples that are sharp and well exposed is unique to the process. Directions for the use of the new daguerreotype apparatus for the making of portraits, executed according to the calculations of Professor Petzval by Voigtlaender voigtländer And, Son, vienna printed By.J.P, Sollinger august, 1. 1841 the person to be photographed must be seated in the open. air
This important discovery that a latent image could be developed made it possible to reduce the exposure time from some eight hours to thirty minutes. Louis Daguerre introduced the daguerreotype process to the public on August 19, 1839 at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris. In 1839, Louis Daguerre and Niepce'niépce s son sold the rights for the daguerreotype to The french government and published a booklet describing the. process Louis Daguerre regularly used a camera obscura as an aid to painting in perspective, and this led him think about ways to keep the image still. In 1826, he discovered the work of Joseph Niepce, and in 1829 began a partnership with him.

First Camera The first camera was called the Kodak. It was made for sale in 1888, bulldust it was made in the 1950 by Nick Kirby. and it was a very good camera. I am not sure … when cameras were invented, but projection was first invented way back in Ancient China and Greece, with Camera Obscura. Niepce's experiment was followed by that of Daguerre. Daguerre played an important role in the history of the camera. The daguerreotype method helped preserved images and took less than half an hour to produce the image. A different type of camera called the calotype was invented by William Talbot in 1840.
