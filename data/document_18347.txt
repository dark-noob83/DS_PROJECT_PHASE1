If the placenta is posterior, it is attached to the uterus on the side towards your back. High risk is doctor-speak for health problem. Low risk means healthy. But doctors can't define healthy (yes, this was actually *studied*!!), so they use a term they can relate to instead.
Low-lying placenta, or placenta praevia, is a complication of pregnancy where the placenta that feeds the growing baby is attached to the lower part of the womb near to or covering the cervix. Low-lying placenta may be picked up during a routine 20-week ultrasound scan appointment.
Placenta Previa Overview. Placenta previa is a complication of pregnancy in which the placenta (the organ that joins the mother and fetus and transfers oxygen and nutrients to the fetus) is implanted either near to or overlying the outlet of the uterus (womb).
The placenta is an organ attached to the lining of your womb during pregnancy. It keeps your unborn baby’s blood supply separate from your own blood supply, as well as providing a link between the two. The link enables the placenta to carry out functions that your unborn baby can’t perform for itself.
The placenta is usually attached to the upper part of the uterus, away from the cervix, the opening which the baby passes through during delivery. On rare occasions, the placenta lies low in the uterus, partly or completely blocking the cervix -- a condition called placenta previa.
The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus (womb). Placenta previa is a complication that results from the placenta implanting either near to, or overlying, the outlet of the uterus (the opening of the uterus, the cervix).
Normally, the placenta is attached to the uterus above the cervix. In rare cases, the placenta forms low in the uterus and is partially or completely covering the cervix. When the placenta is blocking the cervix, it is called placenta previa. Placents posterior mean high risk in doctor's language Posterior means back. Anterior is *front*.
