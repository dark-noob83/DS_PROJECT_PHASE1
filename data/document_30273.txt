Therefore, if the money supply is increased, but, output stays the same, everything will just become more expensive. The increase in national income will be purely monetary (nominal). If output increased by 5%. and the money supply increases by 7%. Then inflation will be roughly 2%. This is a simplification. (see: W hy Printing Money doesn’t always cause inflation). However, this provides a rough explanation why printing money usually reduces the value of money causing prices to increase. Related. 1  Monetarist Theory of Inflation.

Printing Money and the Value of a Currency. If a country prints money and creates inflation, then there will be a decline in the value of the currency. 1  Suppose inflation in Germany is 100%, and inflation in UK is 0%. 2  This means German prices are doubling compared to the UK. The reason is that printing more money doesn’t increase economic output in any way – it merely causes inflation. 1  Suppose an economy produces £10 million worth of goods. 2  e.g. 1 million books at £10 each.

In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy.
