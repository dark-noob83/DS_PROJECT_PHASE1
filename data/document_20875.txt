Hospital expenses accounted for 96.9% of these costs, PTT laboratory expenses for 2.9%, and heparin drug expenses for 0.5%. Across the entire LMWH cohort, total cost of bridging anticoagulation was $51 136, with hospital bed expenses accounting for 86%, home nursing visits for 3%, and enoxaparin drug expenses for 11%. All financial analyses were performed with true cost data rather than charge data. Cost information was obtained from the hospital administration’s Product Line Management System. Drug supply costs included $3.11 per heparin bag and $12.78 per 30-mg syringe of enoxaparin. Costs for laboratory monitoring of heparin were calculated by multiplying the number of PTTs ordered while the patient was on heparin by the cost of 1 PTT ($19.63). Costs for hospital bed were estimated by using a mean acuity level bed cost for a nonmonitored, semiprivate bed ($655)

The average cost of treating a patient with uncomplicated DVT is reduced by approximately $5,000 to $8,000 when using low-molecular-weight heparin instead of standard heparin therapy. It is likely that additional studies will yield important information on the cost savings of treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin. Low-molecular-weight heparin is an attractive option for use in patients with a first episode of DVT, no risk factors for bleeding and the ability to administer injections with or without the help of a visiting nurse or family member.
