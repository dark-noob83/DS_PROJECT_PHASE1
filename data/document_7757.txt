Between cell divisions, the DNA in a eukaryotic cell is uncoiled and spread out; in this form it is called.... DNA that is SPREAD OUT in the nucleus of NON-DIVIDING cells is called ________________.
Don’t try this at home: If uncoiled, the DNA in all the cells in your body would stretch 10 billion miles—from here to Pluto and back. 10B miles = 10B * 1.62 / 150M = 108AU. The mean distance between Pluto and the Sun = 39AU.
Don’t try this at home: If uncoiled, the DNA in all the cells in your body would stretch 10 billion miles—from here to Pluto and back. If you could unwrap the DNA you have in all the cells in your body, you would be able to reach the moon and back 6,000 times.
In the nucleus, the DNA double helix is packaged by special proteins (histones) to form a complex called chromatin. The chromatin undergoes further condensation to form the chromosome. So while the chromatin is a lower order of DNA organization, chromosomes are the higher order of DNA organization.
A chromosome is an organized structure of DNA and protein that is found in nucleus of the cell. It is a single piece of coiled DNA containing many genes, regulatory elements and other nucleotide sequences. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which serve to package the DNA and control its functions.
