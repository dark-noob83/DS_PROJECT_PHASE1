Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening problem that affects people with diabetes. It occurs when the body cannot use sugar (glucose) as a fuel source because there is no insulin or not enough insulin. Fat is used for fuel instead.
Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications.
In a person with signs and symptoms of diabetes or hyperglycemia, a non-fasting glucose level (random blood sample) that is equal to or greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) indicates diabetes. The following information summarizes the meaning of other test results.
A blood glucose test may also be ordered when someone has signs and symptoms of high blood glucose (hyperglycemia), such as: 1  Increased thirst, usually with frequent urination. 2  Fatigue. 3  Blurred vision.

Characterized by hyperglycemia, symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, dehydration, weight loss, blurred vision, fatigue, and, occasionally, coma. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia over time damages the eyes, nerves, blood vessels, kidneys, and heart, causing organ dysfunction and failure.
