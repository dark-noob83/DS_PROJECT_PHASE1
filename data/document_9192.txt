Re: How much meat from 6 month jersey calf & butchering costs? « Reply #9 on: May 23, 2011, 08:36:04 pm ». Thanks rosemary, do you think i would see much growth from 3-8 months of age, if i had them from say june-oct/nov, as they could then spend all day grazing, with supplemented feed. 
1 A month old Jersey bull calf is also sold anywhere between $130 and $150. 2  Another type of calf that is sold is Gurnsey bull calf, which is also 3 to 5 months old. 1 This will all depend on the area, the type of calf, and the market conditions. 2  According to this DairyForums.com thread, a user had stated that a Holstein Bull Calf was running anywhere from $125 to $175 while a day old calf could be less than $80. 3  This was based in the state of Florida.
A 6 month old Jersey calf may get up to $800-$900. Here's where your thinking is good. Lets say you buy one of those calves for $800. You put $700 in feed into her and sell her as a springer for $1900 for a profit of $400! I advise not to sell calves or open heifers unless your barns are full or your feed is gone. In my case with grass and a little grain that would be less than $1.00 a day. I will use $700 in costs to grow her to a springer. So that comes to a difference of $1200. If you add something to cover what it cost to get that live heifer calf, I can easily justify asking $1300-$1500 for a baby Jersey heifer calf.
1 This type of calf is sold for anywhere from $140 to $170. 2  A Jersey heifer calf can run you anywhere from $70 to $125 each. 3  Some farmers may charge by the pound. 4  If this is the case, the industry standard can range from $0.75 to $1.50 a pound. 1 This will all depend on the area, the type of calf, and the market conditions. 2  According to this DairyForums.com thread, a user had stated that a Holstein Bull Calf was running anywhere from $125 to $175 while a day old calf could be less than $80. 3  This was based in the state of Florida.

Miniature cows cost $1,800 to $3,500 depending on the size, markings and color. (A good standard Jersey sold as a family milk cow will cost $1,400 to $1,800.) Although small-breed cattle may cost more initially, they have some interesting advantages. To learn more, we talked with Pat Schout. 
So, what does this mean exactly? Well if you buy when calf prices are down and sell when prices are high, then you can gather up a tidy profit for yourself in the meantime. Beef prices go from 79 cents per pound to as much as $1 per pound. That means your 500 pound calf could bring $500 at auction. On the high end of sales you might spend as much as $100 for a calf, and its feed until weaning. So, unless you buy at the highest cost, and sell at the cheapest, you can turn some money around easily. At the low end of last year’s sales, at $107 per hundred-weight, you would earn $145.
One gallon is about eight pounds, so you have milk for as many as eight calves with five dairy goats. That is at a cost of about $17.50 to $25 per week. That sounds like a lot of money, and it is, however, the milk replacer for eight calves would cost about $800 to $1,400 from birth to weaning.
