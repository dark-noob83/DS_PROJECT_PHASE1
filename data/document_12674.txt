According to data from the College Board, the average annual cost of a four-year degree track at a private college is roughly $40,000. For four-year students attending a public college, the average annual costs are $30,000 for out-of-state students and $20,000 for in-state students.
The College Board reports that the average cost of room and board in 2014–2015 ranged from $9,804 at four-year public schools to $11,188 at private schools. Colleges also provide room and board estimates for living off campus based on typical student costs.
Miscellaneous expenses were about $1,900. Tuition and other core fees varied according to the type of college and degree-track. Private four-year students paid an average of roughly $26,000. For four-year students at public colleges, costs ran about $19,000 for out-of-state students and $7,000 for in-state ones. Two-year students paid an average of $2,500.
The cost of tuition and fees varies by college. There is a wide range of prices, as the table below shows. But you should know that half of all full-time undergraduate students at public and private nonprofit four-year colleges attend institutions that charge tuition and fees of $11,550 or less.
It's a discount of your college costs that you do not have to pay back. For example, the average published price of in-state tuition and fees at a four-year public college is $9,139, but the average net price — what the average family really pays — is just $3,030.
According to a recent report issued by the College Board, between 1983 and 2013, tuition and fees for in-state students attending public four-year colleges increased by $6,324 compared to an overall increase in income for the middle 20% of U.S. families of $8,936 over that same timespan.
Colleges often report a combined tuition and fees figure. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2014–2015 school year was $31,231 at private colleges, $9,139 for state residents at public colleges, and $22,958 for out-of-state residents attending public universities.
