They could, and while you’d certainly be frozen, most of the cells in your body would shatter and die. As water freezes, it expands. Since cells are made up of mostly water, freezing expands the “stuff” inside which destroys their cell walls and they die. The cryonics companies need to remove and/or replace this water. The procedure isn’t cheap. It can cost up to $200,000 to have your whole body preserved. For the more frugal optimist, a mere $60,000 will preserve your brain with an option known as neurosuspension. They hope the technology in the future will allow them to clone or regenerate the rest of the body.
Cryonics (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'cold') is the low-temperature preservation of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future. However, the idea of cryonics also includes preservation of people long after legal death because of the possibility that brain structures that encode memory and personality may still persist and be infera
Shrimp: Select high-quality, fresh shrimp for freezing. Shrimp can be frozen cooked or raw, in or out of the shell. For maximum storage life and quality, freeze shrimp raw, with heads removed, but shells still on. Shrimp may also be frozen in water in a freezer container. Be sure to wash and drain the shrimp if frozen uncooked. Quickly chill cooked shrimp before freezing.
Someone preserved this way is said to be in cryonic suspension. The hope is that, if some­one has died from a disease or condition that is currently incurable, they can be “frozen” and then revived in the future when a cure has been discovered. The procedure isn’t cheap. It can cost up to $200,000 to have your whole body preserved. For the more frugal optimist, a mere $60,000 will preserve your brain with an option known as neurosuspension. They hope the technology in the future will allow them to clone or regenerate the rest of the body.
Cryonics procedures ideally begin within minutes of cardiac arrest, and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. However, the idea of cryonics also includes preservation of people long after legal death because of the possibility that brain structures that encode memory and personality may still persist and be inferable in the future.

The shelf life of ice cream depends on a variety of factors, such as the best before date, the preparation method and how it was stored. Because of its creamy texture and delicious varieties it is probably the sweetest treat in the dairy category. You can help ice cream keep fresh longer by storing it in your freezer immediately after use. Once prepared (if homemade) or opened from the carton, ice cream should be stored in a tightly closed container to keep out moisture and other contaminants.
Of course you can freeze and thaw fish. We do it all the time in Kansas. God Bless America. Goldfish can be frozen in water and thawed in the spring without harm. We have done so many times. We had to remove the fish by cutting a block of ice around the fish with a chain saw. We then thaw them in a bucket of water then put them back into the stock tanks with fresh water
Scroll down for video. A 39,000-year-old female woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia in May, is seen here upon its arrival at an exhibition hall in Yokohama, south of Tokyo. The mammoth will be on display for tourists and visitors from 13 July until 16 September. In fact this creature is the best-preserved specimen of a woolly mammoth ever found – whose prehistoric prime was 39,000 years ago. Even clumps of the animal’s distinguishing hair are remarkably intact after being trapped in glacial ice until she was discovered in Siberia earlier this year.
