The entire formula for the surface area of a cylinder is 2 π r2 + 2 π r h. Surface Area of Cylinders. To find the surface area of a cylinder add the surface area of each end plus the surface area of the side. Each end is a circle so the surface area of each end is π * r 2, where r is the radius of the end. There are two ends so their combinded surface area is 2 π * r 2.
So, the formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is L. S. A. = 2 π rh. Example 1: Find the lateral surface area of a cylinder with a base radius of 3 inches and a height of 9 inches. L. S. A. = 2 π (3)(9) = 54 π inches 2. ≈ 169.64 inches 2. The general formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is T. S. A. = 2 π rh + 2 π r 2. Example 2: Find the total surface area of a cylinder with a base radius of 5 inches and a height of 7 inches. T. S. A. = 2 π (5)(7) + 2 π (5) 2 = 70 π + 50 π.
The surface area of our cylinder is the outside area. The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is 2 times pi times the radius times the height plus 2 times pi times the radius squared. To use this formula, we plug in our radius measurement and height measurement. We then evaluate to find our answer.
Our formula to find the surface area of our cylinder is 2 times pi times the radius times the height plus 2 times pi times the radius squared. This formula is actually the combination of two calculations. We first calculate the surface area of the curved part and then we add the two surface areas of our circles.
