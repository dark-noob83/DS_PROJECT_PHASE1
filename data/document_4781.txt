The coronal suture is a dense, fibrous connective tissue joint that separates the frontal and parietal bones of the skull. At birth, the bones of the skull do not meet. If certain bones of the skull grow too fast then premature closure of the sutures may occur. This can result in skull deformities. There are two possible deformities that can be caused by the premature closure of the coronal suture: 1  a high, tower-like skull called  oxycephaly 
Superior view. 1  The coronal suture separates the frontal bone and the parietal bone. 2  The coronal and the sagittal sutures converge into the bregma. 3  The sagittal and lambdoid sutures are also visible from this angle.he cranial sutures are fibrous joints connecting the bones of the skull. To the unknowing individual these shallow grooves may look like fractures. In fact the intricate windy lines of these thin lines mark the adherence between the bones and the growth and closure of the cranial fontanelles.
Craniosynostosis (from cranio, cranium; + syn, together; + ostosis relating to bone) is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone (ossification), thereby changing the growth pattern of the skull.he second most common type is the coronal synostosis representing 20 to 25%. The metopic synostosis comes third with 5 to 15% and the lambdoid synostosis is only seen in 0 to 5% of nonsyndromic cases. In about 5 to 15% more than one suture is affected, which referred to as complex craniosynostosis.
Two parietal bones and frontal b … ones-there is only one frontal bone, the coronal suture joins the two parietal and the one frontal bone The coronal suture connect the frontal bone to the parietal bones of the skull. Frontal and parietal. Parietal and frontal.. The coronal suture connects the frontal bone to the parietal bones. The frontal and parietal bones are connected by the coronal suture. The coronal suture connects the frontal bone to the parietal bones of the skull. The sagittal suture separate the left parietal bone from the right parietal bone. the two parietal bones parietal.

Metopic, or frontal, suture-Separates the frontal bone into two halves. Sagittal suture-Separates the two parietal bones. Coronal suture-Separates the frontal bone from the parietal bone. Lambdoid suture-Separates the posterior edge of the of the parietal bone form the occipital bone. Squamosal suture-Superior border of the squamous part of the temporal bone. The sagittal suture separate the left parietal bone from the right parietal bone. the two parietal bones parietal. Edit.

Separated sutures are large gaps in the skull of an infant that are not typical. A young child’s head is composed of six bony plates that fuse together as the child ages. The edges of the plates are connected and form what is known as a suture. Sutures are very strong, flexible tissues that hold the cranial bones together. When two sutures join, they form a membrane known as a “soft spot” or fontanelle.
