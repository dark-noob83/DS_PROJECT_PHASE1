In the mid 1960's, George Barris of Barris Kustom City acquired the car for $1 directly from Ford. Fast forward to August 1965, the Batman TV show producers approached George to have him build a new Batmobile for their upcoming show. Barris and his crew pulled a mold from the #1 Batmobile and created 3 fiberglass copies. These replicas were displayed at car shows and dragstrips and also made appearances where countless fans could see them. Over 45 years later the 1966 TV Batmobile is still one of the most iconic and popular cars in the world. In 1955, the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company designed and built a futuristic concept car called the Lincoln Futura. It was built entirely by hand in Turin, Italy at a cost of $250,000, and like many concept cars, was never put in to production
1 The vehicle was built from a nonfunctioning 1955 Ford Lincoln Futura concept car that cost $250,000. 2  Car customizer George Barris bought the concept car for $1 and had three weeks and $15,000 to turn it into the Batmobile, which included adding a Ford Galaxy chassis. 
Although the first Batman film serials date back to the 1940s, the first Batman — and Batmobile — people tend to think of is the one from the iconic 1960’s Adam West Batman series. This Batmobile, the first one to be extremely stylized, was originally a one-of-a-kind concept car, specifically a 1955 Lincoln Futura. Most notably, it was the first obvious Batmobile; in the 1940s film serials, the Batmobile was just a regular old car. The 1960s Batmobile was quite flashy by comparison. It also started the trend of jet propulsion, something included on nearly every live-action Batmobile to date.
The Batmobile /ˈbaetməˌbiːl/ ˈbætməˌbiːl is a, wheeled-self, powered armoured fighting motor, vehicle frequently used by THE Dc comics Superhero batman for vehicular hot, pursuit, transportation-anti tank warfare and riot. control The 2008 book Batmobile Owner's Manual, gives theoretical specifications of the car as if it were a real car. The book states that the Batmobile's five cylinder engine is more powerful than turbine jet engines, and capable of achieving up to 1,700 horsepower (1,300 kW).
History. The first Batmobile. Before the familiar bat-finned cars, the title Batmobile was first used on a red convertible in Detective Comics #48 in February 1941. Most of the design was based on the 1936 Cord, though the nose of the car looked more like that of a Lincoln or similar car.
1 A 1949 Mercury was used in the 1949 serial Batman and Robin. 2  The original TV series (1964 - 1968) and the 1966 film Batman used a modified version of the Lincoln Futura concept car-a car which was never put into mass production. 3  The car used in Batman and Batman Returns was built on the chassis of a Chevrolet Impala. 1 The original TV series (1964 - 1968) and the 1966 film Batman used a modified version of the Lincoln Futura concept car-a car which was never put into mass production. 2
The Batmobile made its first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Then a red sedan, it was simply referred to as his car. The 2008 book Batmobile Owner's Manual, gives theoretical specifications of the car as if it were a real car. The book states that the Batmobile's five cylinder engine is more powerful than turbine jet engines, and capable of achieving up to 1,700 horsepower (1,300 kW).
Barris built two fiberglass copies of the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing. Eventually, the three copies (and the screen-used metal Futura Batmobile) were covered with a black velvet fuzz paint, presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies. The 2008 book Batmobile Owner's Manual, gives theoretical specifications of the car as if it were a real car. The book states that the Batmobile's five cylinder engine is more powerful than turbine jet engines, and capable of achieving up to 1,700 horsepower (1,300 kW).
