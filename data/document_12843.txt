So, there you have it. Salinity is a key parameter to measure for in a saltwater aquarium. Salinity should be one of the first and most frequent tests you do on your saltwater tanks.
Then, we will discuss what your salinity level should be, and how to test for it. Salinity is the measure of dissolved salt content in water. Salinity is typically measured in parts per thousand (ppt) or specific gravity (sg). The more salt in your water, the higher your readings will be. Saltwater aquarium salinity is usually kept between 1.020-1.028sg.
1 Note: Salt refractometers are used to measure sodium chloride dissolved in water. 2  Seawater refractometers are used to measure the mixture of salts typically found in seawater or saltwater aquariums. 3  Using the wrong one may result in a reading approximately 5% off, which may be acceptable for non-laboratory purposes.
We can construct a graph of the total salt content of sea water in parts per thousand (o/oo), or salinity (S), versus concentration of the chloride (Cl-), from which we can determine the relationship between salinity and chlorinity (concentration of Cl-ion) for sea water.
