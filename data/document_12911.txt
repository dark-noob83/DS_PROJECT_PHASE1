An amoeba is a unicellular organism which is found in decaying vegetation, wet soil and animals such as human. It is an advanced form of unicellular organism and amoeba can extend and remit their cytoplasm and form blob like arms which are known as pseudopodia. They use pseudopodia to grasp food particles and propel themselves through microscopic terrain.
(Amoeba is sometimes spelled ameba.). Anatomy: An amoeba consists of a single blobby cell surrounded by a porous cell membrane. The amoeba breathes using this membrane-oxygen gas from the water passes in to the amoeba through the cell membrane and carbon dioxide gas leaves through it.
An Amoeba. The cytoplasm of an amoeba contains the organelles and is enclosed by a cell membrane. An amoeba uses a process called phagoctyosis to obtain food. This is a process in which projections of the cell membrane of the amoeba extend and surround the food particle, totally enclosing it.
Acanthamoeba. An amoeba (also ameba, amoeba am≈ìba or) amoeboid is a type of cell or organism which has the ability to alter its, shape primarily by extending and retracting. Pseudopods amoebae do not form a single taxonomic, group but are found in every major lineage of eukaryotic. organisms
An amoeba, sometimes written as ameba, is a term generally used to describe a single celled eukaryotic organism that has no definate shape and that moves by means of pseudopodia. Pseudopodia or pseudopods are temporary projections of the cell and the word literally means false feet.
An amoeba is a type of unicellular organism usually found in water around decaying vegetation, in wet soil and in animals such as humans. It is relatively advanced, and can extend and retract blob-like arms called pseudopodia, which it can use to grasp food particles and to propel itself through microscopic terrain.
