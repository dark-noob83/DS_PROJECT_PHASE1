In American English, a ton is a unit of measurement equaling 2,000 pounds. In non-U.S. measurements, a ton equals 2,240 pounds. A tonne, also known as a metric ton, is a unit of mass equaling 1,000 kilograms. American English speakers generally have no use for tonne, so the spelling rarely appears in U.S. publications. Elsewhere, fastidious publications use the appropriate spellings for the units of measurement.
The 'long ton' comprises 2240 pounds,  whereas the 'short ton' comprises 2000 pounds.    The 'tonne' (spoken as, 'metric ton') is a non-SI unit,  equivalent to a mass of 1000 kg.    A mass of one tonne is equivalent to 0.984 206 (long) tons.    A mass of one tonne is equivalent to 1.102 311 (short) tons. 
Difference Between Ton and Metric Ton. Ton and metric ton are weight measure units. However, there is a difference. Metric ton is equal to 1000 kilograms and is SI unit. Hence, it is a megagram as it contains 1 million grams. The term ton is comes from Latin word tunna which means cask and in the past a cask filled with things usually weighed almost a metric ton.
As such, since 1 kg is equal to 2.204 pounds, a ton falls short of 1 Tonne by a few kilograms. 1 Ton= 1000 X2.204= 2204 pounds. Ton is mostly used in the US where it contains 2000 pounds. If one tries to calculate its value in kilograms, it comes to around 910 kg. In the old British system of weights, 14 pounds make up one stone, 8 stones make up 1 hundredweight, and twenty hundredweight make up one ton. If you ask someone the difference between a ton and a tonne, it is likely that you may draw a blank as most people think that they are one and the same.
The British ton is the long ton, which is 2240 pounds, and the U.S. ton is the short ton which is 2000 pounds. Both tons are actually defined in the same way. 1 ton is equal to 20 hundredweight. It is just the definition of the hundredweight that differs between countries. To distinguish between the two tons, the smaller U.S. ton is called short, while the larger British ton is called long. There is also an third type of ton called the metric ton, equal to 1000 kilograms, or approximately 2204 pounds.
