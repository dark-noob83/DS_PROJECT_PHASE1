Uranium is obtained in the form of ore through mining and its main use is as fuel for nuclear power plants. Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia are the top three uranium producing countries and their combined production accounts more than 60% of world’s production. Other important countries which produce uranium are USA, Russia, Namibia, Niger, Uzbekistan etc. Each of these countries production exceeds 1000 tonnes per year.
However, concentrated uranium ores are found in just a few places, usually in hard rock or sandstone. Uranium deposits are found all over the world. The largest deposits of uranium are found in Australia, Kazakhstan and Canada. High-grade deposits are only found in Canada. It is also found in ocean water.
Large uranium deposits are found in Canada, Zaire (Africa), Australia, and the western United States. The world’s largest uranium mine is in Namibia, in southwest Africa.
Tortkuduk uranium mine, located about 250km north of Shimkent in Kazakhstan, is the fifth largest uranium producing mine in the world. It produced 2,661t of uranium in 2012. The Tortkuduk deposit, also known as the North Muyunkum deposit, uses in-situ leaching (ISL) to produce uranium.
McArthur River, Canada. McArthur River mine located about 620km north of Saskatoon, Canada, is currently the world's largest uranium producing mine. It produced 7,520 tonnes of uranium in 2012, accounting for 13% of the world's total uranium production.
