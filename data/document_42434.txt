The most basic brake service is installing new disc brake pads on the old caliper and rotor. Doing the math, the wholesale cost of the economy brake pad is $30 and the OE-specified ceramic pad is $90.
If we install the OE-type ceramic pads, new calipers, new hoses, and new rotors, the retail price of the parts increases from $50 for a “pad-slap” to $420 for the complete brake service package.
Don't go out and spend a ton of money on new rotors for your car just come down to O'Reilly Auto Parts and let us resurface them for your for just $10.00 for Auto Shops and $15.00 for every day walk in clients. Some mechanics charge over $100.00 dollars for this service.
The brake rotors should be inspected when the pads are replaced, and depending on their condition, they may need resurfacing or replacement. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads. This will allow them to adjust to the rotors and help prevent squeaking.
Considering the cost of rotors these days, resurfacing and replacing can be as little as a $50 difference. If you’re just keeping your ship tight with regular brake maintenance, resurfacing is fine and will get you a few extra miles on your rotors.
