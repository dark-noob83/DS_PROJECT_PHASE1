SUN-Wed are slower nights so approx $250-300 revenue for 8 hr shift. Before Mid Dec 2012, driver would average $550 revenue per 8-9 hr shift.

Uber driver pay varies depending on where you live and how many hours you drive. I make between $20 and $25 an hour in Los Angeles.

This is very close to the $19 an hour the average Uber driver makes around the country. I’ve found that the more hours I drive, the more I make per hour.

If I drive 30 hours a week or more I usually make closer to $25 an hour.
