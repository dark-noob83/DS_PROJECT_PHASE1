How To Bake Perfect Cheesecakes: I usually bake my cheesecakes 1 1/4 hours or until edges are light brown and center is almost set. I then turn the oven off and let cheesecake stand in oven, with door ajar, 30 minutes or until center is completely set. Then remove from oven and cool completely on a wire rack.
By Allrecipes Staff. The key to perfect cheesecake is in the baking. This water bath method bakes the cake very gently, so it won’t darken, curdle, or crack. A springform pan works best because you can remove the cake easily, but muffin tins or any other cake pan will work fine.
1. Preheat your oven to the temperature recommended in your cheesecake recipe. To prevent water from seeping into the removable bottom of the springform pan, wrap aluminum foil completely around the bottom and halfway up the sides of the pan. Place the cheesecake into a jellyroll pan (or any baking pan with sides) and place the pans into the oven.
Beating too much air into the cheesecake may cause it to puff up during baking only to fall while cooling. This creates cracking. Cheesecakes require even heat to rise properly -- for this reason, do not open the oven door during the first 30 minutes of baking.
The puff pastry crust can be made (steps 1 through 4) up to 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature. If it loses its crispness, bake, uncovered, in a 400° oven 15 to 20 minutes, then cool. You can make the filling (step 5) and slice the berries up to 2 hours ahead. Fill crust just before serving.
1 Cool cheesecake in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. 2  Loosen the crust from the side of the pan with an offset spatula or a small sharp knife (but do not remove the sides yet). 3  Cool on the wire rack for another 30 minutes. 4  Unlock the clasp on the sides of the springform pan.
