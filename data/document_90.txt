Neptune is the planet that is the furthest away from the sun. It is about 4.5 billion kilometers from the sun, which is more than three times as distant as Saturn. It is also one of the coldest planets in the solar system. Neptune s temperature can be as low as 55 Kelvin (-218 degrees Celsius). The average temperature of Neptune is about 73 Kelvin (-200 Celsius). However, at the South Pole of Neptune the temperature is about -10 degrees Celsius warmer than the rest of the planet. The South Pole is warmer due to its exposure to the sun.
The average temperature on Neptune is about minus 200 degrees Celsius (minus 392 degrees Fahrenheit). Neptune, the farthest known planet of our solar system, is located about 30 times farther away from the sun than Earth is. Only about one thousandth of the sunlight received by our planet reaches Neptune.
According to scientists, the surface of Neptune is one of the coldest places in the Solar System. At its surface, where the clouds of the planet touch space, the temperature of Neptune can dip down to 55 Kelvin. That’s -218 degrees Celsius.
