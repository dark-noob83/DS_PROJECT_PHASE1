Two types of complex carbohydrates are particularly important for nutrition: 1  Starch: Starch is a polysaccharide that plants use to store energy. 2  Dietary Fiber: Dietary fiber is found in plants as cellulose, pectin, and lignin.
Carbohydrates provide your body with the glucose it needs to function properly. There are two types of carbohydrates: complex and simple. Foods rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber are called good carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates include foods with added sugars -- these are called ba

Two types of complex carbohydrates are particularly important for nutrition: 1  Starch: Starch is a polysaccharide that plants use to store energy. 2  It is the main constituent of complex carbohydrates in the human diet.
1 Sugar. 2  Sugar is the simplest form of carbohydrates. 3  Sugar occurs naturally in some foods, including fruits, vegetables, milk and milk products. 4  Sugars include fruit sugar (fructose), table sugar (sucrose) and milk sugar (lactose). 5  Starch.
Types of carbohydrates top. The carbohydrate group includes simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. Simple carbohydrates are simple because they are in the most basic form. They are also sometimes called simple sugars.
