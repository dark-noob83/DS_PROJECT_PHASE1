Anti-lupus properties. Fish oils, a source of omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to inhibit inflammatory mechanisms and modulate blood fats in the autoimmune disease, lupus nephritis. (7) This led researchers to consider that Flax seed may also have similar benefits.
In cases of lupus, flaxseed oil not only reduces inflammation in the joints, skin and kidneys, but also lowers cholesterol levels that may be elevated by the disease. (8) Taking flaxseed oil for gout may lessen the often sudden and severe joint pain or swelling that is a symptom of this condition.
Omega-3 fatty acids appear to limit the inflammatory reaction associated with these conditions. In cases of lupus, flaxseed oil not only reduces inflammation in the joints, skin and kidneys, but also lowers cholesterol levels that may be elevated by the disease.
Flax seed oil and Lupus. I dont know if I have Lupus, but what ever it is I find it very painful. My joints kill me and I have swelling as well. I started taking flax seed oil about a week ago as I had researched it and it said that it helped with RA and Lupus along with a few other things.
Re: Flax seed oil and Lupus. Hi~ My Dr. is a huge fan of flax seed oil! I use it on salads and actually like the taste (to me, it's got a nutty flavor). But, if you don't like it, you can mix it with some balsamic vinegar. I have friends who pour a touch in their quinoa or oatmeal and enjoy it that way.
