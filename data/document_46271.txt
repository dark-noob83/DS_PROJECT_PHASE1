This vaccine is NOT to be used for the treatment of tetanus (tetanus toxoid) infection. As with any vaccine, vaccination with Tetanus Toxoid (tetanus (tetanus toxoid) toxoid) may not protect 100% of susceptible individuals.
For persons 7 years of age and older, Tetanus (tetanus toxoid) and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed For Adult Use (Td) is preferred to tetanus toxoid alone.

Following routine use of tetanus toxoid in the United States (US), the occurrence of tetanus decreased dramatically from 560. reported cases in 1974 to an average of 50-100 cases reported annually from the mid 1970s through the late 1990s. The. case-fatality rate has been relatively constant at approximately 30%.
Pediatric. Use is not recommended for infants up to 6 weeks of age. For infants and children 6 weeks of age and older, tetanus toxoid is not expected to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults.
DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine) is the vaccine of choice for children 6 weeks through 6 years of age. The usual schedule is a primary series of 4 doses at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age. The first, second, and third doses of DTaP should be separated by a minimum of 4 weeks.
