Barton Creek is a tributary that feeds the Colorado River as it flows through the Texas Hill Country. The creek passes through some of the more scenic areas in Greater Austin and forms a greenbelt that is the habitat for many indigenous species of flora and fauna, including at least seven endangered species of plants. The creek is named for William Barton, who built a house near Barton Springs in 1837. The springs quickly became a popular resort, and its swimming hole was replaced with a pool some time during the 1930s. Development in Austin in the 1970s and 1980s began to threaten both the creek's water quality and wildlife.
Old Mill Spring, sometimes called Walsh or Zenobia Spring, is just south of Barton Creek about 450' below the lower dam and is surrounded by a round limestone enclosure built by the Works Progress Administration. Upper Spring occurs about 1,200' above the swimming pool. For Barton Springs, about 85% of Aquifer recharge comes from six major surface streams that cross the recharge zone: Barton Creek, Onion Creek, Slaughter Creek, Bear Creek, Little Bear Creek, and Williamson Creek (Slade, Dorsey, and Stewart, 1986) .
Barton Springs is a set of four natural water springs located on the grounds of Zilker Park in Austin, Texas, resulting from water flowing through the Edwards Aquifer. Barton Springs is the main discharge point for the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer of Texas, a well known karst aquifer. Geologically, the aquifer is composed of limestone from the Cretaceous period, about 100 million years old. Fractures, fissures, conduits, and caves have developed in this limestone
History and conservation [edit]. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Barton Creek was believed to host Tonkawa and Comanche Indian camps. The creek is named for William Barton, who built a house near Barton Springs in 1837. The springs quickly became a popular resort, and its swimming hole was replaced with a pool some time during the 1930s. Development in Austin in the 1970s and 1980s began to threaten both the creek's water quality and wildlife.
Many of the cavities are filled with water. Some of the cavities act as conduits, or tunnels, and feed water to Barton Springs. But other cavities are relatively dry. They form a network of caves – at least 24 in all – that underlie the Barton Creek watershed. The caves of Barton Creek are home to many fascinating creatures that have adapted to life in the subterranean world. Airman’s Cave, for example, houses a new species of harvestmen (a relative of the spider) much like the Bee Creek Cave harvestman, which is on the federal endangered species list.
Upper Barton Spring is located in the creek bed of Barton Creek, about a half mile (800 m) upstream of Barton Springs Pool. Frequently dry, Upper Barton Spring is fully submerged by Barton Creek during floods. Barton Springs is the main discharge point for the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer of Texas, a well known karst aquifer. Geologically, the aquifer is composed of limestone from the Cretaceous period, about 100 million years old. Fractures, fissures, conduits, and caves have developed in this limestone
