olfactory organ. the olfactory neuroepithelium is composed of receptor and supporting cells and olfactory glands of Bowman, located in the superior part of the nasal cavities.
Olfactory Epithelium. The olfactory epithelium consists of 3 cell types: basal, supporting, and olfactory receptor cells. Basal cells are stem cells that give rise to the olfactory receptor cells (seen in the image below). The continuous turnover and new supply of these neurons are unique to the olfactory system. In no other location in the mature nervous system do less differentiated stem cells replace neurons.
The small, unmyelinated axons of the olfactory receptor cells form the fine fibers of the first cranial nerve and travel centrally toward the ipsilateral olfactory bulb to make contact with the second-order neurons. Conduction velocities are extremely slow, and support is provided in bundles by a single Schwann cell.
Olfactory sensitivity is directly proportional to the area in the nasal cavity near the septum reserved to the olfactory mucous membrane, which is the region where the olfactory receptor cells are located. The extent of this area is a specific between animals species.
Also known as CN1, the olfactory nerve is the first of 12 cranial nerves located within the head. It relays sensory data to the brain, and it is responsible for the sense of smell. The nerve's olfactory receptors are located within the mucosa of the nasal cavity. Unlike many other nerves, CN1 does not possess two trunks. Rather, its sensory fibers extend through the ethmoid bone's cribriform plate, a part of the skull located behind the nose.
