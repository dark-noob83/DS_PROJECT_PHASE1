Hempcrete was discovered in a bridge abutment in France built in the 6th century. Since its rediscovery it has seen growing use in Europe. Industrial hemp is grown by certified commercial growers so the crop can be certified to be very low in THC. Q: Can Tradical® Hemcrete® be used in a loadbearing capacity? A: It is normally used together with a timber frame (or steel or concrete), with the frame transferring the vertical load of the roof and upper floors. The Hemcrete® can be used to provide racking strength to the frame if required.
Hempcrete is made from the shiv or inside stem of the hemp plant and is then mixed with a lime base binder to create the building material. This mixture creates a negative carbon footprint for those who are concerned with the carbon side of things. A home can save about 20,000lbs of carbon when being built out of Hempcrete. Hempcrete is a much more superior building material due to the fact that it is a very strong, lightweight and breathable material. When used as exterior walls, it lets water in without rotting or damaging th
Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the brittleness of concrete and consequently does not need expansion joints. The typical compressive strength is around 1 MPa, around 1/20 that of residential grade concrete. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's density is 15% that of traditional concrete. Like other plant products, the hemp crop absorbs carbon dioxide gas as it grows, retaining the carbon and releasing the oxygen. 165 kg of carbon can be theoretically absorbed and locked up by 1 m 3 of hempcrete wall over many decades as the hempcrete petrifies.
Hemp Technologies uses Hempcrete to build houses. | Hemp-Technologies. Imagine you had a building material that was energy-efficient, non-toxic and resistant to mold, insects and fire. The material may even have a higher R-value, or thermal resistance, than concrete, a claim that is still being investigated. Seeing Hempcrete as a more efficient and sustainable building material has led to some dubbing it as a gateway product. The people behind the U.K.-based Tradical Hemcrete are using their hemp based product to create a carbon negative thermal walling material.
Hempcrete is a bio-composite made of the inner woody core of the hemp plant mixed with a lime-based binder. The hemp core or “Shiv” has a high silica content which allows it to bind well with lime. This property is unique to hemp among all natural fibers. Q: Can Tradical® Hemcrete® be used in a loadbearing capacity? A: It is normally used together with a timber frame (or steel or concrete), with the frame transferring the vertical load of the roof and upper floors. The Hemcrete® can be used to provide racking strength to the frame if required.
Hempcrete is a mixture of hemp hurds (shives) and lime (possibly including natural hydraulic lime, sand, pozzolans or cement) used as a material for construction and insulation. It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre. Like other plant products, the hemp crop absorbs carbon dioxide gas as it grows, retaining the carbon and releasing the oxygen. 165 kg of carbon can be theoretically absorbed and locked up by 1 m 3 of hempcrete wall over many decades as the hempcrete petrifies.
Given it has survived 14 centuries, people expect hempcrete buildings will have a long life. Hemp itself is a beneficial crop requiring no fertilizer, weed killer, pesticide or fungicide. It grows so thickly that weeds cannot grow. Farmers grow it in rotation with other crops such as barley or rye. Q: Can Tradical® Hemcrete® be used in a loadbearing capacity?

History of Hempcrete. Using hemp as a building material is nothing new, in fact the ancient Gauls used a Hempcrete-like material to build a bridge over two-thousand years ago. Since then it has been a popular building material in Japan for centuries and most recently in Europe. Hempcrete as we know it was developed in France, because Europe never prohibited the cultivation of hemp plants they have been able to take full advantage of this remarkable and environmentally friendly building material. Using Hempcrete to build homes and even office buildings.

Hempcrete is a building material that incorporates hemp into its mixture. Hempcrete is very versatile as it can be used for wall insulation, flooring, walls, roofing and more. It’s fire-proof, water-proof, and rot-proof as long as it’s above ground. A home can save about 20,000lbs of carbon when being built out of Hempcrete.
