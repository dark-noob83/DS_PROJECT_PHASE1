Most Canadians consume far more sodium than is needed. The recommended amount per day is between 1500 mg (considered adequate intake) and 2300 mg (upper amount) for people 9 -50 years of age. For people over 50 years of age, an adequate intake drops to 1300 mg per day until 70 and then 1200 mg over 70 years of age. However, the average daily intake in the Canadian diet is about 3500 mg of sodium, although many Canadians eat well in excess of 5000 mg per day.
That is equivalent to about 1 tsp. of salt a day. According to the Institute of Medicine, the maximum daily intake for sodium are the following: ages 1 to 3, 1,500 mg; ages 4 to 8, 1,900 mg; ages 9 to 13, 2,200 mg, and ages 14 to 18, 2,300 mg. People who are sensitive to sodium should only consume 1,500 mg of sodium per day. 
What Do the 2010 Guidelines Say About Sodium? The problem of eating too much sodium is covered in the report: n The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommend that Americans aged 2 and up reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day. 
For adults, the American H … eart Association recommends that for every 1,000 Calories of food consumed, the sodium intake should be 1,000 mg and should not exceed the 3,000 mg limit. The average sodium intake in the US is between 4,000 and 5,000 mg of sodium per day. The UK RDA for adults is 1,600 milligrams of sodium. The Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, issued a report that lowered the recommended daily amount of sodium. Previously, the daily allowance was 2500 milligrams, but it has been lowered to 1500 milligrams per day.
Some people are more sensitive to the effects of salt than others. The guidelines also recommend that, in general, individuals with hypertension, blacks, and middle-aged and older adults should limit intake to 1,500 mg of sodium per day. 1 Potassium can help blunt the effects of sodium on blood pressure. 2  The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. 3  Potassium-rich foods include leafy, green vegetables and fruits from vines. 4  Flavor food with pepper and other herbs and spices instead of salt.
The “Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010” addresses sodium intake in detail. The average daily sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 milligrams per day, an excessive amount that raises blood pressure and poses health risks. In general, Americans should limit daily sodium consumption to 2,300 milligrams, but this is an upper safe limit, not a recommended daily allowance
The FDA urges Americans to limit dietary sodium. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that individuals consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, and that certain groups limit intake to 1,500 milligrams per day. The average daily sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 milligrams per day, an excessive amount that raises blood pressure and poses health risks.
1 The Nutrition Facts Label lists the Percent Daily Value (%DV) of sodium in one serving of a food. 2  The %DV for sodium is based on 100% of the recommended amount of sodium, which is less than 2400 milligrams (mg) per day. 1 Read the Nutrition Facts Label to see how much sodium is in the foods you are considering. 2  All Americans should consume less than 100% of the Daily Value or less than 2400 mg of sodium each day.
Aim for 2,300 milligrams of sodium or less per day. Evidence shows that consuming too much sodium can raise blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can also lead to heart disease, kidney disease and congestive heart failure. 
The minimum requirement of sodium for normal body function is about 500 mg/day. The recommendation for sodium intake is less than 2,300 mg/day for adults. This equals about one teaspoon of table salt. Most people consume far too much sodium through processed foods and table salt, therefore, this recommendation is set at an upper limit.
