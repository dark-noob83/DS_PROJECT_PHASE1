For example, you may only charge $20 to cut the front and back of a small property that only takes 30 to 60 minutes, but charge $40 for a property that takes twice as long to complete. Step 2. To encourage repeat business, give previous customers a discount for every second or third cutting. For example, customers pay the regular price for two lawn cuttings, and you agree to reduce every third lawn service by $5 or $10.
