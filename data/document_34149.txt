DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Adapalene is a gel used for the treatment of acne vulgaris (pimples). The exact mechanism of action is not known. Scientists believe that when adapalene is applied to the skin, it affects the growth of skin cells and thereby reduces the formation of pimples.
In the United States, adapalene is available under the brand name Differin in three different preparations: 0.1% cream, 0.1% gel, and 0.3% gel. The 0.1% gel is available as a generic made by Teva. It is also available combined with benzoyl peroxide under the brand name Epiduo.
There is also an “off brand” of 0.1% adapalene gel known as Teva. Adapalene is also marketed as Differin gel, but only int the 0.1% strength, in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, it is possible to get a prescription for a gel that is a combination of Differin and benzoyl peroxide.
Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid primarily used in the treatment of mild-moderate acne, and is also used off-label to treat keratosis pilaris as well as other skin conditions. It is effective against acne conditions where comedones are predominant.
