Report Abuse. NO. covalent bond is more stronger than an ionic bond .when sharing of electrons(covalent bond)occurs there is a mutual frimness given to bond from both the atoms where as in ionic bond only one carries away the electrons making the bond weaker from the other donor atom.
1 If each of the two atoms shares an electron with the other atom nearly equally, the bond is called covalent. 2  If one atom exerts considerable force over the other atom’s electron, while the other atom strives to give its electron over, the bond is largely ionic.
A covalent bond is a chemical bond between two nonmetals (two metals cannot covalently bond) in which electrons are shared, while an ionic bond is a chemical bond between a me … tal and a non metal due to the attraction between oppositely charged ions. 13 people found this useful.
Chemical Bonds: Ionic and Covalent. There are a variety of ways atoms bond to one another. Some bonds are weaker, and some are stronger. Two of the strongest forms of chemical bond are the ionic and the covalent bonds. Chemical bonds form between two atoms, each with its own electron environment. 1  If each of the two atoms shares an electron with the other atom nearly equally, the bond is called covalent.
The covalent bond is formed when two atoms are able to share electrons whereas the ionic bond is formed when the sharing is so unequal that an electron from atom A is completely lost to atom B, resulting in a pair of ions. Each atom consists of protons, neutrons and electrons.
A covalent bond is formed between two non-metals that have similar electronegativities. Neither atom is strong enough to attract electrons from the other. For stabilization, they share their electrons from outer molecular orbit with others. An ionic bond is formed between a metal and a non-metal. Non-metals(-ve ion) are stronger than the metal(+ve ion) and can get electrons very easily from the metal. These two opposite ions attract each other and form the ionic bond.
