You'll remove your toilet in two stages: first the tank, then the bowl. The messiest part is removing the old wax ring underneath the bowl; once that's done, the job is simple. Before you disconnect the plumbing, make sure you have another toilet to use while this one is out of commission. 
Drain Water. Shut off the water supply to the toilet. After the water supply is disconnected, flush the toilet several times. Flushing repeatedly will remove the water from inside the tank and most of the water from the bowl. If there is any water left in the bowl, use a container to scoop it all out.

First, take off the lid to the tank and shut off the water. Drain the water out of the tank by holding down the flush lever. Then use a sponge or a towel to get the rest of the water out.
Take the tank lid off of the tank and put in a safe place to avoid accidently breaking it. Step 2: Turn off water supply. The water supply valve is normally located on the wall, on the left side of the toilet as you are facing the toilet. Turn the handle clockwise to turn off the water.

2. Take off the tank. Use a ratchet wrench or a basin wrench to remove the nuts from the mounting bolts that hold the tank onto the bowl. There will be one on each side of the tank, and there may even be a third one in the middle. Gently lift the tank off the bowl. There is a wax ring under the toilet that seals the bottom of the bowl to the end of the drain pipe (called the toilet flange). Straddle the toilet and gently rock it from side to side in order to break the seal. Once you do, lift off the bowl and place it nearby on its side.
4. Loosen and remove the nuts on the mounting bolts that secure the toilet tank to the bowl with a basin wrench.
