The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Everard le Tieis, which was dated 1170, in Sir Christopher Hatton's Book of Seals, during the reign of King Henry 11, known as The Builder of Churches, 1154 - 1189. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation.
The surname is found particularly well recorded in Yorkshire Church Registers: John, son of William Tyas, was christened at Dewsbury on April 3rd 1545, and the marriage of Nicholas Tyas and Helen Jubb was recorded in Wragby, on August 10th 1587.
Tyus Name Meaning. Probably an altered spelling of English Tyas, from an ethnic name from Old French tieis ‘German’; or alternatively of German Thias, from a short form of the personal name Matthias (see Matthew).
This unusual and interesting name is of early medieval English origin, and derives from the Anglo-Norman French ethnic name used to distinguish someone from Germany or the Low Countries.
