What Shellac is Not. Shellac is not lacquer. Both are high-performance, clear wood finishes originating in Asia, and both have names that derive from the same Sanskrit word (laksha), but lacquer is made from tree resin. Shellac, on the other hand, is made from bug excretions.
So gel manicure is sort of a made up name for Shellac (people in the industry always use the term Shellac). Meanwhile, Shellac and Gels are not the same service. Just as the ingredients, procedures and results for Acrylics and Gels differ, the same is true about Shellac vs Gels.
A shellac finish has been used by woodworkers since the early 1800's. It has many advantages: shellac is non-toxic, can be used as a sealer before applying a stain (to even out the stain's application), can be mixed with nearly any color, and is very easy to repair in the event of damage from use.
The story of shellac starts with a small scaly insect in India that is attracted to the twigs of several species of tree.
Shellac is a resin secreted by the female lac bug, on trees in the forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes (pictured at right) and dissolved in ethanol to make liquid shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food glaze and wood finish.
From the time it replaced oil and wax finishes in the 19th century, shellac was one of the dominant wood finishes in the western world until it was largely replaced by nitrocellulose lacquer in the 1920s and 1930s.
Shellac is scraped from the bark of the trees where the female lac bug, Kerria lacca (Order Hemiptera, Family Kerriidae), also known as Laccifer lacca, secretes it to form a tunnel-like tube as it traverses the branches of the tree.
Shellac is a blend of gel and nail polish. Because it is like a polish, it canâ€™t be used to extend your nail. Because it is like a gel, however, it does add strength and durability. In the long term Shellac is much less damaging to nails than traditional Gels (or Acrylics).
