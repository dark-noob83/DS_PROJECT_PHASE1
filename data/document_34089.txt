Fundamental and Harmonics. The lowest resonant frequency of a vibrating object is called its fundamental frequency. Most vibrating objects have more than one resonant frequency and those used in musical instruments typically vibrate at harmonics of the fundamental.
Noun. 1. fundamental frequency-the lowest tone of a harmonic series. first harmonic, fundamental. harmonic-a tone that is a component of a complex sound.
2. Of or relating to the lowest possible frequency or the lowest frequency component of a vibrating element, system, periodic wave, or quantity: a fundamental chord. 3. Music Having the root in the bass: a fundamental chord. n. 1. Something that is an essential or necessary part of a system or object. 2.
The fundamental frequency of a wave is the lowest frequency (longest wavelength) that can be used to define its period. The easiest way to understand it is via a musical analogy: The fundamental frequency is the root tone of the overtone or harmonic series.
Fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency, often referred to simply as the fundamental, is defined as the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform. In terms of a superposition of sinusoids, the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum.
