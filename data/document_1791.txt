Elevation Effects. For every 1,000 feet of change in elevation, there is a loss of 1 foot in suction or lift and a 0.5 pounds per square inch decrease in atmospheric pressure. Example 2 - An engine can lift water 22.5 feet at sea level. The same engine is driven to a fire at an elevation of 2,000 feet above
Step 6. Set up the problem and solve. EP = 100 psi - 100 psi + 30 psi. The engine pressure needs to be 30 pounds per square inch for a desired nozzle pressure of 100 pounds per square inch in this hose lay.
Typical is the Aussie Fire Chief, a pump that delivers up to 80 metres head, and a maximum flow of 500 litres a minute. They are used in a wide range of applications that include on farm duties, like high pressure water transfer, agricultural spray, machinery wash down, and of course bush fire fighting.
Friction loss of a 100-foot, 1-inch hose, cotton-synthetic, at 15 gallons per minute, is typically 3 to 6 pounds per square inch. Friction loss for a 1.5-inch hose at 15 gallons per minute is typically 1 pound per square inch for 100 feet.
You control the hoses using the truck's pump panel on top of the fire engine. The pump panel is a series of levers and switches that controls how much water is flowing and which lines are being discharged. When arriving at a fire scene, the driver will jump out and climb to the top of the truck to begin pump operation.
Hoses, also called lines, will put out different amounts of water depending on the hose length, diameter and the amount of pressure in the pump. When responding to a house fire, the firefighters will immediately pull off the crosslay hoses. These lines are located directly below the pump panel. They lay out in the open and are light, so they are easy to get off the fire engine for attacking a fire. Crosslays are 200 feet (61 m) long, have a diameter of 1.5 inches and can gush water at 95 gallons (360 L) per minute.
Friction Due to Hose Length. For hose lengths longer than 100 feet, friction loss in the hose should be considered. Friction loss of a 100-foot, 1-inch hose, all synthetic, with volume rate of 15 gallons per minute, is typically 4 to 9 pounds per square inch.
