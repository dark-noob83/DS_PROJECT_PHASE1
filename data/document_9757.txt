This is a list or table of elements that are radioactive. All elements have radioactive isotopes. This table contains the elements that have no stable isotopes. Each element is followed by the most stable known isotope and its half-life.
MINERAL PROPERTIES: RADIOACTIVITY. Radioactivity is an attribute of minerals that contain radioactive element s. Radioactive elements are elements that contain disintegrating nuclei, emitting alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays. Uranium and thorium are the best known radioactive elements.
The calculation of radioactivity in minerals is dependent on certain assumptions which affect the true activity of a mineral. The assumptions used in calculating mineral radioactivity are: 1  Uranium (U & U) and Thorium (Th) decay produces a series of daughter isotopes which are themselves radioactive.
The roads we ride or drive on and the buildings we live learn and work in all contain minerals. Below is a selected list of commonly used metallic and nonmetallic minerals, ore minerals, mineral byproducts, aggregates, and rock types that are used to make products we use in our daily life.
Radioactive materials used in medicine: radionuclides and radioactive isotopes. A radionuclide is any type of radioactive material, including elements and the isotopes of elements. An isotope of an element is a particular atomic version of it. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different atomic structures.
Definition. Radioactivity in minerals are caused by the inclusion of naturally-occurring radioactive elements in the mineral's composition. The degree of radioactivity is dependent on the concentration and isotope present in the mineral. For the most part, minerals that contain potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th) are radioactive. This table lists all of the naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes. Mineral radioactivity is due to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation from the unstable isotopes in the
