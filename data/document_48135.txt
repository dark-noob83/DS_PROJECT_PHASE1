Enzymes are natural proteins that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions. Enzymes are processing aids: the enzyme itself is not functional in the final product. DSM’s natural, easy-to-use food enzymes empower our customers to get more from raw materials; streamline production processes – and make a consistently high quality product that feels, looks and tastes great. From the discovery of Amylase in 1906 to the launch of Brewers Clarex® , our 100+ years of innovation have made us a world leader in the formulation of new enzymes for the food industry.
Enzymes in Food Processing. Enzymes have been applied in food processing for millennia, and today they are enabling various food industries to provide the quality and stability of its products, with increased production efficiency. Enzymes are very useful catalysts in industrial processes: they perform specific reactions essential for the production process – but have no technological function in the final food – while ensuring the quality of the end product.
In Canada, enzymes that are used in food processing are regulated as food additives. An enzyme meets the definition of a food additive, as set out in section B.01.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations, when it affects the characteristics of the food and/or it or its by-products become part of the food. Enzymes extracted from edible plants and the tissues of food animals, as well as those produced by microorganisms (bacteria, yeasts, and fungi), have been used for centuries in food manufacturing.
Enzyme preparations used in food processing contain an active enzyme that is responsible for the intended technical effect in food. In some instances, enzyme preparations may contain a blend of two or more active enzymes. Composition of the enzyme preparation. Commercial enzyme preparations that are used in food processing typically contain an enzyme, which catalyzes the chemical reaction that is responsible for its technical effect, as well as substances used as stabilizers, preservatives or diluents.
STARCH PROCESSING. Starch is widely used for the production of glucose, maltose, high fructose and other syrups, which are used in multiple food processing sectors. Starch itself is also used as an ingredient in various food processes, such as baking and alcohol production. Enzymes are very useful catalysts in industrial processes: they perform specific reactions essential for the production process – but have no technological function in the final food – while ensuring the quality of the end product.
Major Enzyme Applications in Food Industry. In food industry, enzyme has been used to produce and to increase the quality and the diversity of food. Some examples of products that use enzyme are cheese, yoghurt, bread syrup etc. Tags: biotechnology, enzyme. I. Introduction. Enzymes are produced by all living cells as catalysts for specific chemical reactions. Not surprisingly enzymes are present in all foods at some time, and play an increasingly important role in food processing techniques.
Catalase is the enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen. Catalase effectively removes the residual hydrogen peroxide, ensuring that the fabric is peroxide-free and mainly used in food industry and also in egg processing with other enzymes.

In the past 35 years, the use of commercial enzymes has grown from an insignificant role in the food industry to an important aspect of food processing. Included in the book is a history of the role of enzymes in food processing, enzyme characterization, a discussion of different classes of enzymes including lipases and proteases, commercial enzyme production, and the processing of particular foods such as meat, vegetables, fruit, baked goods, milk products, and beer.
In the past 35 years, the use of commercial enzymes has grown from an insignificant role in the food industry to an important aspect of food processing. This Third Edition of Enzymes in Food Processing explores recent and extensive changes in the use of enzymes as well as the discovery of new enzymes and their uses.
