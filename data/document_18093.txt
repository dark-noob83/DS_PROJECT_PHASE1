Records in the Augusta County Courthouse indicate Thomas Stuart, Archibald's son obtained a deed for 353 acres in the Stuarts Draft in 1749. He is acknowledged as Stuarts Draft's founder. The name Stuarts Draft was first used nearly 100 years later in 1837, when a post office opened. The origin of the term Draft is disputed
