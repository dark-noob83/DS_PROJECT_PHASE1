Polyphony Polyphony (polyphonic texture) is an important texture in all historic style periods. Polyphony contains two or more active melodies. In contrast to homophony, emphasis is placed upon the interplay between lines rather than on a single melody or a stream of chord sounds. The interplay of contour, motives, continuity features, and rhythms are important factors in polyphonic texture. Counterpoint Counterpoint is the interaction of voices in polyphonic texture. Imitative counterpoint occurs if one voice repeats or mimics the patterns just stated in another voice. A canonic process occurs if the anwering voice or voices repeat the lead voice exactly.
The terms monophony and polyphony have very straight-forward literal meanings. Monophony means music with a single part and a part typically means a single vocal melody, but it could mean a single melody on an instrument of one kind or another. Polyphony means music with more than one part, and so this indicates simultaneous notes. In practice, these simple definitions can be blurred by various performance techniques or refined by other terms. The principal example of monophony is plainchant, with its single unaccompanied vocal melody.
