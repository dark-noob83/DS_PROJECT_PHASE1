Hyperpolarization occurs when the value of the electrical potential across a cellular membrane becomes more negative. Hyperpolarization is when the difference in electrical potential between two sides of a cellular membrane changes significantly, resulting in a large electrical potential across the membrane.

Definition. noun. The process or act of making the membrane potential of a cell more negative. Supplement. Hyperpolarization is a term that is used when referring to a process or act resulting in the membrane potential of a cell more negative than it typically is. Polarization is a condition wherein there are positive and negative electrical charges across the plasma membrane
1 After the peak of the action potential, a hyperpolarization returns the membrane potential to its resting value, first by making it less positive, until 0 mV is reached, and then by continuing to make it more negative. 2  This hyperpolarization occurs in the figure from approximately 2 to 3 ms on the time scale. It is the opposite of a depolarization. Hyperpolarization is often caused by efflux of K+ (a cation) through K+ channels, or influx of Cl– (an anion) through Cl– channels. On the other hand, influx of cations, e.g. Na+ through Na+ channels or Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels, inhibits hyper
Hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization is a change in a cell's membrane potential that makes it more negative. It is the opposite of a depolarization. It inhibits action potentials by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action potential threshold. Hyperpolarization is often caused by efflux of K+ through K+ channels, or influx of Cl– through Cl– channels.
In neurophysiology Hyperpolarization is a change in a cell's membrane potential that makes it more negative. It is the opposite of a depolarization. Hyperpolarization is often caused by efflux of K+ (a cation) through K+ channels, or influx of Cl– (an anion) through Cl– channels. On the other hand, influx of cations, e.g. Na+ through Na+ channels or Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels, inhibits hyperpolarization.

On the other hand, influx of cations, e.g. Na+ through Na+ channels or Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels, inhibits hyperpolarization. A nerve impulse causes Na + to enter the cell, resulting in (b) depolarization. At the peak action potential, K + channels open and the cell becomes (c) hyperpolarized. Voltage gated ion channels respond to changes in the membrane potential, generating the action potential as well a
hyperpolarization. A change in the value of the resting membrane potential towards a more negative value. The inside of the cell becomes more negative than the outside. Hyperpolarization is inhibitory because the membrane potential moves away from the neuron's threshold at which an action potential could occur. Example: the retinal photoreceptor potentials when stimulated by light. See depolarization; receptor potential; resting membrane potential; synapse. hyperpolarization. any increase in the amount of electrical charge separated by the cell membrane and hence in the strength of the membrane potential. In cardiology this is the process by which an electrical fiber, at the end of phase 3 repolarization, becomes more negative than usual. (hī'pĕr-pō'lăr-i-zā'shŭn),
So, the potential goes even more negative than resting. This is hyperpolarization. It may goes as low as -90 mV, close to the Nernst potential for K ions. Eventually, the extra K channels close and the membrane potential goes back to its resting, polarized level.
