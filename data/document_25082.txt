It does depend a fair amount on the poo particles. The smallest atom is a hydrogen atom (37 picometers) whereas some larger atoms more than 5 times larger (lanthanum is 187 picometers). If the atom is an ion, it will also change it's radius significantly (positive ions are smaller and negative ions are larger than the neutral atom).
Lanthanum is found in ‘rare earth’ minerals, principally monazite (25% lanthanum) and bastnaesite (38% lanthanum). Ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques are used to isolate the ‘rare earth’ elements from the minerals.
One measure of size is the element-element distance within the element. It is not always easy to make sensible comparisons between the elements however as some bonds are quite short because of multiple bonding (for instance the O=O distance in O 2 is short because of the the double bond connecting the two atoms.
Atomic Number: 57 Period Number: 6 Group Number: none. Lanthanum, which is the first element of lanthanide series, is a silvery white metal and rare-earth element. Lanthanum can be mainly found in monazite and bastnasite. Although the source of lanthanum is not rare, but the process to get pure material is very complex.
