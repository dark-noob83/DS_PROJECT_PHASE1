Other tests have cost even less. Most patients pay an average of $25 for lab tests that would have cost more than $100 if the lab company billed the patient or the insurance company directly. Our charges, including any lab work, are itemized on a sign in the waiting room. The net practice profit (my income) is $62 per patient I see. We break even by seeing four patients per day, which yields $328. When you multiply that by 245 clinic days per year, it adds up to about $80,000, which is a bit more than our annual overhead.
The average patient at Access Healthcare spends $82 per visit – $45 for the visit and $37 for lab and supply charges. If the practice sees four patients per day ($328) during its 245 clinic days per year, it takes in $80,360 for the year. The net practice profit (my income) is $62 per patient I see. We break even by seeing four patients per day, which yields $328. When you multiply that by 245 clinic days per year, it adds up to about $80,000, which is a bit more than our annual overhead.
(For the average daily charge, divide total charges for the last three months by 90.3 days, representing three months). For example: If total charges for three months equal $81,270, the average daily charge equals $900 ($81,270/90.3). If total outstanding A/R is $50,000, days in A/R equals $50,000/$900, which is 55.55 days. 
For example, in 2011 in America, the average charge for an office visit for an established patient, level 3, requiring approximately 15 minutes with a doctor, was $104. The average total paid was $69. 
This statistic is impacted by the number of physicians in the group, their production, collection rate and payor mix, and the types of services provided. According to MGMA s 1999 Cost Survey, average operating overhead for OB/GYN practices is 50.68%. However, the survey indicates 8.88% of the surveyed practices charge volume is for Medicare and Medicaid. A: The collection statistic that you refer to is typically known as a gross collection ratio or an unadjusted collection ratio. This ratio indicates the yield of your practice or what you collect for every dollar charged.
IN-HOUSE: The percentage of revenue that a practice collects varies widely by specialty as well. Our hypothetical practice collects 60% of what it actually bills. According to industry experts, this describes an in-house billing department that is average at bill collection. OUTSOURCED: A practice can expect a 5% to 15% increase in the amount they’re able to collect by switching to a billing service. IN-HOUSE: Clearing house fees for a provider submitting 20,000 claims per year would be approximately $300 per month ($100 per physician), or $3,600 annually. OUTSOURCED: A medical billing service usually charges a percentage of the amount collected as their fee. The industry average varies widely by specialty.
Q&A | March 01, 2007. Question: We would like to know what the average collection ratio of a practice’s total billed charges should be. For example, in September 2006, we billed $250,000. After insurance payments and adjustments and patient payments, $23,000 remains uncollected. The physician thinks this is outrageous. According to the MGMA, the gross fee-for-service (FFS) collection median rate is 41.6 percent (what you collect of what you charge). The adjusted FFS collection median rate is 93.98 percent (what you collect of what you are owed).
In terms of averages, the Medical Group Management Association s (MGMA) 1999 Cost Survey reports average Gross Fee for Service Collection Ratio for OB/GYN practices of 68.81%. A better statistic to evaluate your collection performance is the Adjusted Collection Ratio (ARC). A: The collection statistic that you refer to is typically known as a gross collection ratio or an unadjusted collection ratio. This ratio indicates the yield of your practice or what you collect for every dollar charged.
