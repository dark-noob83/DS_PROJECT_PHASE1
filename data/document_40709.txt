Osteoclasts and osteoblasts are both types of osteons or bone cells. They differ in their function. An osteoblast will build bone. You can remember it as as osteoblast will build bone. An osteoclast, however, is designed to break down bone that is no longer needed. Or cill bone. The function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are to create new bone in places where bone has not yet grown or where bone has previously been lost. Osteoclasts control the reabsorption properties as well as maniuplate the overall shape of the bone. Osteoblasts are the cells that begin bone growth
Osteoblasts that are buried in matrix are called osteocytes. During active bone formation, the surface layer of osteoblasts consists of cuboidal cells, called active osteoblasts. When the bone-forming unit is not actively synthesizing bone, the surface osteoblasts are flattened and are called inactive osteoblasts.
Osteoblasts vs Osteoclasts. The skeletal system is basically made up bones. Bone tissue is considered as a hard but resilient tissue that is unique to vertebrates. The main functions of bones are to protect internal organs and to provide rigid support for muscle attachment. • Osteoblasts promote the formation of bones while osteoclasts promote the bone breakdown. • Osteoblasts become osteocytes, whereas osteoclasts do not. • Osteoblasts are smaller and mononucleate, whereas osteoclasts are larger and multinucleate.

An osteoclast (from the Greek words for bone (ὀστέον), and broken (κλαστός)) is a type of bone cell that breaks down bone tissue. This function is critical in the maintenance, repair, and remodelling of bones of the vertebral skeleton. An osteoclast is a large multinucleated cell and human osteoclasts on bone typically have five nuclei and are about 150-200 µm in diameter. Giant osteoclasts can occur in some diseases, including Paget's disease of bone and bisphosphonate toxicity
There are three types of cells in bone tissue; osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes. Osteocytes are considered as mature osteoblasts, and they do not secrete bone matrix. The function of the osteocyte is to maintain the metabolism and to exchange nutrients and eliminate wastes. Osteoblasts are the bone forming cells while osteoclasts have the opposite function of osteoblasts. Hence, these two cell types control the rates of formation and breakdown of bone or bone remodeling. Osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are small, mononucleate cells, responsible for bone formation. • Osteoblasts promote the formation of bones while osteoclasts promote the bone breakdown. • Osteoblasts become osteocytes, whereas osteoclasts do not. • Osteoblasts are smaller and mononucleate, whereas osteoclasts are larger and multinucleate.

Individual cells cannot make bone, and the group of organized osteoblasts together with the bone made by a unit of cells is usually called the osteon; the basis of this is discussed in Organization and ultrastructure of osteoblasts below. During active bone formation, the surface layer of osteoblasts consists of cuboidal cells, called active osteoblasts. When the bone-forming unit is not actively synthesizing bone, the surface osteoblasts are flattened and are called in
Osteoblast: A cell that makes bone. It does so by producing a matrix that then becomes mineralized. Bone mass is maintained by a balance between the activity of osteoblasts that form bone and other cells called osteoclasts that break it down.
Osteoblasts are one type of bone cell (out of three) that is found in bone tissue. They are bone forming cells (make bone) (bone builders). It deposits bone even as another bo … ne cell, osteoclasts, breaks it down. When there is a break, or lacuna, in the bone the osteoblasts form a sheet over the gap. The function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are to create new bone in places where bone has not yet grown or where bone has previously been lost. Osteoclasts control the reabsorption properties as well as maniuplate the overall shape of the bone. Osteoblasts are the cells that begin bone growth
