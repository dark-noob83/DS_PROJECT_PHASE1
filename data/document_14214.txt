The maximum riser height shall be 7¾ inches (196 mm) and the minimum tread depth shall be 10 inches (254 mm). The riser height shall be measured vertically between leading edges of the adjacent treads. 
Click on this link for more information about stairway building codes. I've been working almost my entire life with a stair tread minimum width of 9 inches and a riser maximum height of 8 inches until recently or should I say according to the 2012 International Building Code book, these numbers have changed. 
Residential. The OSHA guideline for residential stairs sets the minimum vertical rise for each step at 4 inches and the maximum at 8 1/4 inches. An international building code, however, puts the maximum at 7 3/4 inches. In industrial applications, OSHA puts the minimum rise at 6 1/2 inches and the maximum at 9 1/2 inches, but ties the rise to the angle of the stairs. For instance, it sets the rise for stairs on a 35-degree angle at 7
The maximum variations in the height of risers or the width of treads in any one flight shall be one-fourth-inch. (7) Where the rise would exceed 9 1/2 inches and the run would be less than 8 inches, portable, fixed, or ships ladders shall be used. (Title 24, Part 2, Section 2-3326(e).). (A) A minimum of 17 and a maximum of 24 inches of width between the stair rails. (B) A minimum tread depth of 8 1/2 inches, a minimum tread width of 7 inches, a minimum tread run of 5 inches and a maximum rise to the next alternating tread surface of 9 1/2 inches.

Maximum riser height, typically 8.25 inches (210 mm). Note that by specifying the maximum riser height and minimum tread length, a maximum slope is established. Residential building codes will typically allow for steeper stairs than public building codes. Minimum riser height: Some building codes also specify a minimum riser height, often 5 inches (13
