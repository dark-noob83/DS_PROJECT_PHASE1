Confidence votes 90. It can vary tremendously depending on race, and continent (Africans' average hair thickness is higher than Europeans', for example). It also depends if you talk about body hair or head hair. Hair from a human head is normally between .04 and .25 millimeters, averaging normally .1. Body hair depends on gender and even within individuals of the same gender and race it can be very different from an individual to another. The Thickest Hair in the human body belongs to a man's moustache
Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair.
Hair Volume. How many hairs a person has on average depends on the hair colour. With 150,000 hairs blondes have the most hairs. Black-haired people come in second with about 110,000 hairs, followed by brunettes with 100,000 hairs and redheads with 80,000 hairs. Our genetic make-up decides whether we have thick or thin hair. Europeans consider hair with a diameter of 0.04 to 0.06 mm as thin, hair with a diameter between 0.06 and 0.08 mm as normal, and hair with a diameter between 0.08 and 0.1 mm as thick. By comparison with European hair, Asian hair is significantly thicker. The average diameter of Asian hair is 0.08 to 0.12 mm
1 There are 25,400,000 nanometers in one inch. 2  A human hair is approximately 80,000- 100,000 nanometers wide. 3  A single gold atom is about a third of a nanometer in diameter. 4  On a comparative scale, if the diameter of a marble was one nanometer, then diameter of the Earth would be about one meter. It’s difficult to imagine just how small that is, so here are some examples: 1  A sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick. 2  A strand of human DNA is 2.5 nanometers in diameter. 3

Average Human Hair Diameter. The average human hair diameter is 99 um. A single um is equal to one millionth of a meter. It is also equivalent to one thousandth of a millimeter (0.001 mm). In inches, the diameter would be 0.001. In centimeters it would be 0.00254. Growth. No matter what the average human hair diameter is, human scalp will typically grow at 0.4 mm daily. Human scalp growth is four times quicker compared to human nails. This assumes that the human body is in good condition.

Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Human hair varies considerably in thickness; however, 100 micrometers is generally taken as the average. Cell sizes vary, too, but the average hair cell is 10 micrometers across. On that basis, I'd say the average human hair is about 10 cells thick. Source(s): http://science.education.nih.gov/supplem...
