To solve this problem, there’s the 80% test. In short, you find your 1 RM for an exercise that targets a specific muscle and then test how many reps you can do with 80% of that. If you can do less than 8, the muscle is fast twitch dominant. If you can do more than 8, it’s slow
This is sub-optimal. The glutes are slow twitch dominant by a few percent, but the hamstrings are composed of a whopping 70% fast twitch fibers. The erector spinae are slow twitch dominant by around 6%. This means you should use low reps for the hamstrings, but medium to high reps for the lower back and the glutes.
Research also shows that the erector spinae have a mix of type 2—high-threshold, fast-twitch—muscle fibers and type 1—low-threshold, slow-twitch—muscle fibers. So maximum development of them requires a variety of training protocols.
The glutes are slow twitch dominant by a few percent, but the hamstrings are composed of a whopping 70% fast twitch fibers. The erector spinae are slow twitch dominant with 56% type I fibers. This means you should use relatively low reps for the hamstrings, but medium to high reps for the lower back and the glutes.
Vladamir Janda discovered that muscles can be categorized as either postural, phasic, or a mixture of the two. Postural muscles act predominantly to sustain your posture in the gravity field. These muscles contain mostly slow-twitch muscle fibres and have a greater capacity for sustained work. They are prone to hyperactivity. Phasic muscles contain mostly fast-twitch muscle fibres, and are therefore more suited to movement. They are prone to inhibition.
Unless you’re an anatomy wiz, you’ve probably never heard of your erector spinae or the spinalis muscles. The erector spinae is a group of muscles and tendons, including the spinalis muslces, which run vertically up your spine. Together, the erector spinae muscle group and the spinalis muscles aid in backbending, side bending and twisting the spine.
