Australopithecus garhi was found at Bouri, Ethiopia, a mere 96 km from Hadar were the earliest Oldowan tools were found. Further, they’re dated to ~2.5 million years ago making them contemporary with the aforementioned tools. Oldowan tools were also found at Bouri but they were located on the surface of the site. Some may simply have been bi-products of the manufacturing process and not actual tools. However, subsequent discoveries of the Oldowan have pushed back the date for its appearance from 1.75 million years ago to 2.5 million years ago.
The brains of most species of Australopithecus were roughly 35% of the size of that of a modern human brain. Most species of Australopithecus were diminutive and gracile, usually standing 1.2 to 1.4 m (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 7 in) tall. However, if these species do constitute their own genus, they may be given their own name, Paranthropus. Australopithecus species played a significant part in human evolution, the genus Homo being derived from Australopithecus at some time after 3 million years ago.
For some hominid species of this time, such as A. robustus and A. boisei, some debate exists whether they constitute members of the same genus. If so, they would be considered 'robust australopiths', while the others would be 'gracile australopiths'. However, if these species do constitute their own genus, they may be given their own name, Paranthropus. Australopithecus species played a significant part in human evolution, the genus Homo being derived from Australopithecus at some time after 3 million years ago.
Australopithecus garhi is a 2.5-million-year-old gracile australopithecine species whose fossils were discovered in 1996 by a research team led by Ethiopian paleontologist Berhane Asfaw and Tim White, an American paleontologist. Discovery [edit]. Tim White was the scientist to find the first of the key A. garhi fossils in 1996 in the Bouri Formation, located in the Middle Awash of Ethiopia 's Afar Depression.
Some of the bones with tool marks that link Australopithecus with stone tools. The first stone tools manufactured by our ancestors were part of the Oldowan industry. This toolkit consists of small sharp flakes which could be used for a wide range of cutting tasks. Some may simply have been bi-products of the manufacturing process and not actual tools. However, subsequent discoveries of the Oldowan have pushed back the date for its appearance from 1.75 million years ago to 2.5 million years ago.
Australopithecus anamensis, A. afarensis, and A. africanus are among the most famous of the extinct hominins. A. africanus was once considered to be ancestral to the genus Homo (in particular Homo erectus). However, fossils assigned to the genus Homo have been found that are older than A. africanus. However, if these species do constitute their own genus, they may be given their own name, Paranthropus. Australopithecus species played a significant part in human evolution, the genus Homo being derived from Australopithecus at some time after 3 million years ago.
Further, since Homo habilis is the oldest member of Homo this means that stone tools may have been manufactured by the Australopithecines. The genus Australopithecus appeared ~4 million years ago and is the ancestor of Homo and thus modern humans. Some may simply have been bi-products of the manufacturing process and not actual tools. However, subsequent discoveries of the Oldowan have pushed back the date for its appearance from 1.75 million years ago to 2.5 million years ago.
The stone tools have not been found but the cut marked bone has been dated to 3.4 ma, a time and place where the only hominin species was Australopithecus afarensis ..). Scientists have reconstructed the layers in which Au. garhi was found as the edge of a lake, probably surrounded by grassland. If Au. garh i was the first hominin to make and use stone tools, this reconstruction might provide insights into the habitats in which this important adaptation occurred. Found in deposits dated to 2.5 million years ago (mya) by radioisotopic and biochronological (a technique using the relative time frames of extinct non-hominin animals) methods, Au. garhi is important because it may be the oldest hominin species to make stone tools. This possibility is discussed further, below.
Fossils of Australopithecus garhi are associated with some of the oldest known stone tools, along with animal bones that were cut and broken open with stone tools. It is possible, then, that this species was among the first to make the transition to stone toolmaking and to eating meat and bone marrow from large animals. This is the only known skull of this species, Australopithecus garhi. It has a curious mixture of Homo-like cranial features, an Australopithecus-like brain size, and large Paranthropus-sized teeth.
