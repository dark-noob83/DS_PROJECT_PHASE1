Symptoms of iron deficiency in dogs include appetite loss, dark and tarry feces, pale gums, lethargy, lack of growth in young canines, rapid respiration, exercise intolerance and frequent infections. The most frequent cause of iron deficiency is anemia due to blood loss.
Answer: Not Recommended. Giving your dog iron supplement pills, made for human consumption, isn’t the way to go. We give our youngest dog this canine-formulated iron supplement after it was confirmed that she was mildly deficient. We’ve since improved her diet. Finding out the underlying reasons for low iron levels is extremely important.
Supplements that I Recommend for Canine Anemia. A diet rich in protein and vitamin B12 is critical for your dog's anemia treatment. Supplements and minerals added to your dog's diet can also enhance overall health.
Anemia, Iron Deficiency in Dogs. When the body is deficient in iron, red cells do not develop as they should. The lack of iron causes the cells that are produced by the bone marrow to be too small, and too low in oxygen-carrying features. In adult dogs, this condition is usually caused by some kind of blood loss.
