The KRT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 1. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells called keratinocytes that make up the skin, hair, and nails.
One group of intermediate filaments we have already encountered is the keratin filaments in skin and other epithelial cells. Some types of keratin are involved in making up skin, hair and nails. A second type of intermediate filaments include vimentin and its relative desmin.
Keratin 6b partners with a similar protein, keratin 17, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into dense networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues.
Keratin 7 is a protein that makes 8nm segments of intermediate filaments in the epithelial cells. Normally the Keratin 7 proteins have 489 amino acids. In humans, the amino acid count for Keratin 7 is 469. The protein Keratin 7 has been found to have 6 exons, but more recently, it was determined to have 9 exons.
For example, most animal epithelial cells contain keratins, a diverse family of intermediate filaments consisting of more than 50 members, while mesenchymal and muscle cells are rich in the fibrous proteins, vimentin and desmin, respectively.
keratin filaments. Definitions: 1. a class of intermediate filaments that form a network within epithelial cells and anchor to desmosomes, thus imparting tensile strength to the tissue. Synonyms: cytokeratin filaments. The definition information for keratin filaments is provided by Stedman's. You can search our medical dictionary here.
