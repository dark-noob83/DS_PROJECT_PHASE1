Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Cellular respiration provides energy for living organisms. So, cellular respiration is important because it provides the energy for living organisms to perform all of the other necessary functions to maintain life. Most single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, do not require much energy and are able to survive on glycolysis and fermentation.
Just like we need energy to get through the day, individual cells need energy for survival too. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells get their energy in the form of ATP. There are two types of cellular respiration, aerobic and anaerobic.
Cellular respiration is critical for the survival of most organisms because the energy in glucose cannot be used by cells until it is stored in ATP. Two critical ingredients required for cellular respiration are glucose and oxygen.
Best Answer: I assume by respiration you mean cellular respiration. Respiration changes the chemical energy of food molecules to energy in the form of ATP needed to support life of cells and organisms. Source(s): Biology instructors for 40 years.
Cellular respiration is important because it is energy that is  released from food molecules. Cellular respiration is also  important because oxygen is needed in order to br … eak down and  digest the food. The food gives humans the nutrients needed to stay  healthy.
Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O → 12H2O + 6 CO2. The energy released is trapped in the form of ATP for use by all the energy-consuming activities of the cell. 1  glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid.
