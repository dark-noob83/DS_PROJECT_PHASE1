(3) (botany) The matrix of the chloroplast which is a thick fluid in between grana where various enzymes, molecules and ions are found, and where the dark reaction (or carbohydrate formation reactions) of photosynthesis occurs.
Stroma can refer to two things in Biology.   Stroma is the fluid inside chl â€¦ oroplasts, the site of photosynthesis in all plant cells.   It is also, however, the framework (like a skeleton) inside any biological tissue, cell or organ.
In animal tissue, stroma refers to the connective, supportive framework of a biological cell, tissue, or organ. The stroma in animal tissue is contrasted with the parenchyma.
