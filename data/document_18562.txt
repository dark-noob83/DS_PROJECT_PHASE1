1 For patients not covered by health insurance, cataract surgery typically costs $5,000 to $10,000 per eye, for a total of $10,000 to $20,000 for both eyes. 2  For example, at Park Nicollet, a hospital in Minneapolis, Minn., it costs about $4,365 per eye -- a total of $8,730 for both eyes. 1 Prescription eye drops usually are required after cataract surgery. 2  Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed.
Since it no longer requires days in the hospital, the cost of cataract surgery has decreased. According to a study by AllAboutVision.com, the average cost of cataract surgery in 2012 was $3,429 per eye. With many insurances, this price can lower to $500-600. There are some reasons you may be charged more, however. During the average cataract surgery, the surgeon implants an intraocular lens (IOL). 
Cataract surgery is used to correct a clouding of the lens of the eye that affects vision and usually is caused by aging. Surgery sometimes is recommended when cataracts have caused blurring of vision too severe to be improved with new glasses, better lighting, anti-glare sunglasses or a magnifying glass. 1 Prescription eye drops usually are required after cataract surgery. 2  Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed.
Average Cost of Cataract Surgery. The average cost of Cataract surgery in a Medicare outpatient setting is generally around $2,500.00/eye for the surgeon, the out patient facility, and the anesthesia provider. Medicare would pay 80% or $2,000.00/eye and you would pay the remaining $500.00 out of pocket
(In 2010 the average was about $3,279, in 2011 it was $2,699, in 2012 it was $3,429 and in 2013 it was $3,230.). If you want a high-tech, presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens for your cataract procedure, then costs would increase to an average of about $4,591 per eye (vs. $4,461 in 2010, $4,337 in 2011, $4,269 in 2012 and $4,350 in 2013). 1 An average additional charge of $2,188 per eye for a premium, presbyopia-correcting IOL, if you already have Medicare coverage for basic cataract surgery costs. 2  An average additional charge of $607 per eye, if you need an extra surgical procedure to correct mild astigmatism.
1 Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed. 2  This typically costs $250 to $450 and usually is covered by insurance. 1 Prescription eye drops usually are required after cataract surgery. 2 
1 Cataract surgery is covered by most health insurance plans. 2  Many patients who need cataract surgery are 65 or older, and Medicare covers cataract surgery. 3  For patients covered by insurance, typical out-of-pocket costs would consist of coinsurance of 10 to 20 percent or more -- or $1,000 or more for both eyes. 1 Prescription eye drops usually are required after cataract surgery. 2  Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed.
The cost of cataract surgery is covered by health insurance companies provided you satisfy your deductibles, agree to the copays, stay within your network, and accept the basic package. The basic package includes 90 days of post-operative care with no additional office visit fees related to cataract surgery. Premium Cataract Surgery can cost an additional $500 to $5000 per eye. Qualified patients should expect a customized visual result that reduces their dependence on glasses when compared to the basic cataract package.
The cost of cataract surgery depends on many variables, such as the type of procedure you have and the intraocular lens (IOL) implanted in your eye. The area where you live also can be a factor, depending on cost-of-living standards that help set the typical price of cataract surgery. 1 An average additional charge of $2,188 per eye for a premium, presbyopia-correcting IOL, if you already have Medicare coverage for basic cataract surgery costs. 2  An average additional charge of $607 per eye, if you need an extra surgical procedure to correct mild astigmatism.
