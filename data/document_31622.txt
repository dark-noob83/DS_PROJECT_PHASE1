Breaker faulty so entire box has to be replaced. Amazing how code requires them to replace all breakers, but if that is done then they have to replace the aluminum pole, and install new ground and and and.... so a $2000 cost for box replacement almost triples, all because the breaker isn't made anymore. I am getting other quotes. 1 Typically it costs $800-$1,200 to have a qualified electrician upgrade an existing panel to 100 amps, or $1,500-$2,500 if a new panel is needed. 2  Expect to pay $1,300-$3,000 to upgrade to 200 amps, or $2,000-$4,000 to go to 400 amps. 3  Installing a new sub-panel runs $500-$1,000
As for the cost, Needham said he stocks old Zinsco breakers, which run about $60 to $70 each, plus another $125 or so for the installation, so replacing a single breaker comes to about $200 altogether. We live in a '61 Eichler in Terra Linda/San Rafael with the original circuit panel. One of our 30amp circuit breakers is on the blink and we're advised by some Eichler owners to just go ahead and spend the ~$1700-$1800 to have the entire panel replaced, complete with permit.
Take the old circuit breaker to your home improvement store and find a new one that is the same brand, size, style and amperage rating. Ask for help matching the breaker if necessary. New circuit breakers can cost from $3 to more than $75. However, unless you need a specialty breaker, you should be spending less than $20 for a replacement. Unplug all major appliances. Also unplug important smaller appliances, such as televisions, computers and stereos.
