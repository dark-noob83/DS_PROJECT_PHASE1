A hemorrhoidectomy is the removal of hemorrhoidal tissue. Hemorrhoidal tissues contain blood vessels that act as cushions by swelling slightly to protect the anal canal during bowel movements. Anal pressure can cause these tissues to stay swollen.
Surgical removal of hemorrhoids (hemorrhoidectomy) is recommended for third-and fourth-degree internal hemorrhoids (with or without external hemorrhoids) when conservative treatment measures fail to alleviate severe burning, itching, swelling, protrusion, bleeding, and pain.
Hemorrhoidectomy is surgery to remove hemorrhoids. You will be given general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia so that you will not feel pain. Incisions are made in the tissue around the hemorrhoid. The swollen vein inside the hemorrhoid is tied off to prevent bleeding, and the hemorrhoid is removed. The surgical area may be sewn closed or left open. Medicated gauze covers the wound. Surgery can be done with a knife (scalpel), a tool that uses electricity (cautery pencil), or a laser.
Definition. A hemorrhoidectomy is the surgical removal of a hemorrhoid, which is an enlarged, swollen and inflamed cluster. of vascular tissue combined with smooth muscle and connective tissue located in the lower part of the rectum or around the anus. A hemorrhoid is not a varicose vein in the strict sense.
A hemorrhoidectomy is surgery to remove internal or external hemorrhoids that are extensive or severe. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy is the most effective treatment for hemorrhoids, though it is associated with the greatest rate of complications.
The primary purpose of a hemorrhoidectomy is to relieve the symptoms associated with hemorrhoids that have not responded to more conservative treatments. These symptoms commonly include bleeding and pain. In some cases the hemorrhoid may protrude from the patient's anus.
