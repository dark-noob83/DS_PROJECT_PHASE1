By June Thomas. In 2007, Americans spent $95.2 billion on dental care, or $315 per capita. That represents only 4.3 percent of the $2.2 trillion ($7,421 per capita) spent on health care overall. It's no wonder, then, that dentistry and dental costs tend to be overlooked when policymakers crunch numbers.
As a result of this steep increase in the cost of dental care, dentists on average are now making more money than many physicians. According to the American Dental Association, the average net income in 2009 for general dentists in private practice was $192,680.
Dental care includes procedures such as tooth repair, crowns or caps, root canals, dental implants, braces, retainers, bite plates, and headgears. The average costs of some procedures are as follows: 1  Braces: $5,000 to $6,000*. 2  Traditional porcelain veneers: $900 to $2,500 per tooth*.
Factoring in the estimated cost of premiums for those with dental insurance, the average amount spent on dental care was similar for those with ($978) and without ($1,007) dental insurance.
