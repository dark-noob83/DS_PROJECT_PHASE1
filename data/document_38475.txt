A hotspot is a defined area on an image that acts as a hypertext link. The hotspots are defined through the use of image maps. Image maps list the coordinates that define the boundaries of the hotspots (or the regions that act as hypertext links) on an image.
In the Direct Link dialog box, click the image or hotspot to which you want to link, and then click OK. You can test your internal links by clicking the Preview button in the Export workspace, and then, in the Deep Zoom Composer preview window, clicking the images and hotspots to which you added links.
An image map is an image that has been divided into regions called hotspots; when a user clicks a hotspot, an action occurs (for example, a new file opens). Client-side image maps store the hypertext link information in the HTML documentâ€”not in a separate map file as server-side image maps do.
Image hotspots module allows you to mark the different areas of the image by text labels (similar to annotations). You can mark a person on the image or a part of the image. Hotspots are responsive. When you scale the image, hospots scale proportionally. The module is integrated with drupal image module, so it's possible to add hotspots to any image field.
An image map is an image containing one or more clickable sections (i.e., hotspots), which are assigned hyperlinks. Image maps can provide visual clues to the type of link. For example, the Campus Virtual Tour provides a map of the campus and links to all of the UW-Eau Claire campus buildings.
Defining image map hotspots. To create image an image map, you need coordinates of the points corresponding to the hotspot boundaries. In other words, you will define an area, by using coordinates, for each hyperlink that you want on an inline image.
