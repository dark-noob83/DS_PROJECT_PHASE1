There is a slight risk that you can be stung by handling a recently deceased bee. Obviously a dead bee is not moving so it would require you to press the sting against your skin. Beekeepers who inspect bees under a microscope are careful to avoid this happening because it is a possibility.
Most bees or wasps only sting when provoked or threatened. Wasps and bees have venom sacs at the ends of their bodies, with a stinger that injects the venom into the victim. They can sting you even after they die. If you see a dead wasp or bee, do not pick it up: You can still get stung.
Note: A dead bee’s stinger can sting you, and the force of your weight on the bee’s body can result in venom injection. So, don’t step on, sit on, or play with dead bees.

This is only the case in the Honey Bee in which the stinger is a modified ovipositor. The stinger is barbed, so once it pierces the skin, it cannot be retracted. Wasps and other bees do not have a barbed stinger so they are capable of multiple stings. But I think the question here is more on the capability of a wasp or bee being able to deliver a sting after it has died. This is not possible since the animal is dead and, therefore, not conscious.
