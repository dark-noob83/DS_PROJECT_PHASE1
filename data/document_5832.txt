Residential addresses usually do not require a signature. FedEx leaves residential deliveries in what the driver determines to be a safe, protected place.. However, it is at the driver's discretion not to leave a package when he or she does not feel the package will be safe.
(Not available for FedEx Express® Freight Services)• Direct Signature Required (DSR) – FedEx obtains a signature from someone at the delivery address and reattempts delivery if no one is available to sign for the package. Available for residential and nonresidential deliveries.
Indirect Signature – This is a flexible option that allows someone at the delivery address to sign, or a neighbor or building manager. Alternatively, the recipient can sign the door tag to allow the package to be left at the door later.
Direct Signature Required. FedEx obtains a signature from any person at the delivery address. If no one is at the address, FedEx will reattempt delivery; Direct Signature Required overrides any recipient release that may be on file for deliveries to nonresidential addresses. A surcharge applies.
All deliveries to a Business Address will continue to require a signature upon delivery. However, deliveries to Residential Addresses do not require a signature regardless of the type of delivery (Ground or Express). The FedEx driver has discretion over whether or not to leave the package at the front door.
For packages not requiring a signature for release, our drivers will leave the package at a recipient's door, or other secure location, if the driver believes it is reasonable to do so. In most cases, FedEx will attempt to deliver your package three times before returning to the shipper.
