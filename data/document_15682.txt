1 Bigeye and yellowfin, also known as ahi, are common in sushi. 2  Both types, along with bluefin, are high in mercury and should be eaten infrequently, if at all. 3  Most tuna are caught by purse seines or longlines, which have moderate-to-high bycatch of seabirds, sea turtles and marine mammals.
1. Yellowfin tuna is a subtype of the Ahi tuna species. 2. Yellowfin tuna isn’t preferred well for raw fish dishes (sashimi) as other Ahi species are for sashimi. 3. Yellowfin tuna is relatively larger with deep red meat while most other Ahi tunas are smaller with pinkish flesh.
Tuna is not a single species of fish, but rather several species. Scientists often use the term “tuna and tuna-like fish” which includes a total of 61 species, fourteen of which are considered “true tuna”. Four species are of major commercial importance in the Pacific Islands: skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, and albacore.
Ahi is a type of tuna mainly derived from the Yellowfin tuna. Generally speaking, there are two species of Ahi namely bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna also known as shibi in Hawaii. The dorsal fins, anal as well as the finlets on the yellowfin are yellow in color hence its name.
The yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) is one of the most abundant flatfish species in the eastern Bering Sea and is the target of the largest flatfish fishery in the United States. They inhabit the EBS shelf and are considered one stock. Abundance in the Aleutian Islands region is negligible.
In Hawaii, “ahi” refers to two species, the yellowfin tuna and the bigeye tuna. It has a slimmer profile than the bigeye tuna, with distinctive soft dorsal and anal fins and finlets are bright yellow. The dorsal and anal fins tend to lengthen with age. Smaller yellowfin are also called “shibi” in Hawaii.
