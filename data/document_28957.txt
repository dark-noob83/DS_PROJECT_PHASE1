When the plants are consumed by animal, about 10% of the energy in the food is fixed into animal flesh which is available for next trophic level (carnivores). When a carnivore consumes that animal, only about 10% of energy is fixed in its flesh for the higher level. So at each transfer 80 - 90% of potential energy is dissipated as heat (second law of thermodynamics) where only 10 - 20% of energy is available to the next trophic level.
Ten Percent Law. Lindemann (1942) put forth ten percent law for the transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next. According to the law, during the transfer of organic food from one trophic level to the next, only about ten percent of the organic matter is stored as flesh.
1 Only a fraction of the energy available at one trophic level is transferred to the next trophic level. 2  The rule of thumb is 10%, but this is very approximate. 3  Typically the numbers and biomass of organisms decrease as one ascends the food chain.
Explaining the 10 percent rule in an ecosystem. Roughly 90 percent of energy is lost as it is transferred up each trophic levels.
Answer by Asasasasssa. Confidence votes 47. everytime something's eaten only ten percent of the energy make it to the consumer. for example. a peine uses photosynthesis and would be able to use 10% of the energy, then a culo eats the peine and gets 10% of the peine's energy, which is 1% of the original puta's energy. next a blue waffle eats the culo and only gets .1% of the original energy from the puta.
