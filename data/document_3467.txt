HORSE HEART RATE. An adult horse at rest will have a pulse rate ranging from 30 to 40 beats per minute. Foals will have a pulse rate ranging from 70 to 120, yearlings from 45 to 60 and two-year-olds from 40 to 50. If you are using a stethoscope, place it on the horse s girth area just behind the left elbow. You will hear the heart beat it makes two sounds, lub then dub, to count as a single heart beat.

If you are using a stethoscope, place it on the horse s girth area just behind the left elbow. His heart rate was about 150 beats per minute and down to approximatly 60 beats per minute at the end of the recording. A healthy, well-conditioned horse should, after strenuous exercise, return to near normal within 15 minutes, depending on the ambient temperature.
A normal resting heart rate (pulse) for a healthy, mature horse is between 35 to 45 beats per minute (bpm) It varies, depending on the age and physical condition of the horse. In general, a normal resting heart rate for an adult is between 70-80 beats per minute with women tending to have a … slightly higher heart rate than men. Also children and the elderly tend to also have a higher rate that can be as high as 100 bpm. The other factor is if you are physically fit.
HEART RATE Heart rate (pulse) is faster in young horses than in older horses. Normal adult horses have a heart rate of 28 to 40 beats per minute. Newborn foals’ heart rates range from 80 to 120, older foals from 60 to 80, and yearlings from 40 to 60 beats per minute. To determine an accurate heart rate, However, in a fit horse the rate should decline to 40 or 50 breaths per minute within 10 or 15 minutes. The ratio of heart rate to respiration rate in horses is usually about 4:1. That is, the heart beats 4 times for each breath the horse takes.
For example, a young, strong, healthy athlete may have a resting heart rate of 30-40 beats per minute, but may easily increase his heart rate to 180 beats per minute with exercise. This is normal. Slow heartbeat (heart rate), called bradycardia, is an arrhythmia, or disorder of the heart’s rhythm. Each day, a normal heart beats about 100,000 times, at a rate any­where from 60 to 100 times a minute. Changes in heart rate caused by activity, diet, medications, and age are normal and common.
The heart of a blue whale weighs about a half a ton, 1000 lbs. It has to be large enough to pump about 15,000 pints of blood as compared to about 8 pints in a human. The average heart rate for a man is 72bpm. A blue whale’s heart beats six times a minute. A horse has 38bpm. A rabbit has 205bpm. A rat 420. A mouse 670. The heartbeat of a canary occurs 17 times in a second. A rate of 1260 beats per minute was measured in a Blue-throated Hummingbird. In torpid hummingbirds, the heart rate can drop to 50-180 per minute.

In general, a normal resting heart rate for an adult is between 70-80 beats per minute with women tending to have a … slightly higher heart rate than men. Also children and the elderly tend to also have a higher rate that can be as high as 100 bpm. The other factor is if you are physically fit.
