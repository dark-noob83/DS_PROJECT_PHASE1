Common type of glial cell that supports and protects the neurons: the cell helps perform the blood-brain barrier. astrocyte. nerve tissue that is called nerve glue: composed of astrocytes, microglia, oligadendrocytes and ependymal cells.
In many ways, the cell body is similar to other types of cells. It has a nucleus with at least one nucleolus and contains many of the typical cytoplasmic organelles. It lacks centrioles, however.
The most common type of neuron is the _____ which communicates from one neuron to another. The branch of the autonomic nervous system that induces the flight or fight response is the_____. The cells that support, nourish and protect neurons are the _____.
Nervous Tissue is made up of two types of cells: neurons and supporting cells A. Supporting Cells 1. Neuroglia: includes many types of cells that support, insulate, and protect the delicate neurons AKA: Glia or glial cells a. Types of glia include: astrocytes, microglia, ependymal cells, oligodendrocytes b. Found in the CNS 2.
The core component of the nervous system in general, and the brain in particular, is the neuron or nerve cell, the brain cells of popular language. A neuron is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information by electro-chemical signalling.
Glial (Neuroglial) cells do not conduct nerve impulses, but, instead, support, nourish, and protect the neurons. Glial cells are far more numerous than neurons and, unlike neurons, are capable of mitosis.
The nervous system is made up of two types of cells: neurons and glia. Neurons Neurons are the fundamental cellular unit of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS).
