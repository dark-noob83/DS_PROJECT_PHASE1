1 Review. 1 Review. Calcitriol is a form of vitamin D, sold under the brand names Rocaltrol (oral capsule or liquid), Vectical (topical ointment), Calcijex (injection), and others. The medicine is used to treat certain conditions caused by abnormal parathyroid hormone levels or low levels of calcium in the blood.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol comprise the team of polypeptide and steroid hormones responsible for maintaining adequate levels of blood calcium. When blood calcium falls, PTH secretion is stimulated. PTH increases synthesis of calcitriol. Calcitriol increases calcium absorption in the intestine.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol comprise the team of polypeptide and steroid hormones responsible for maintaining adequate levels of blood calcium. When blood calcium falls, PTH secretion is stimulated.
When calcium levels decrease, this stimulates the parathyroid gland to release parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone encourages the normal process of bone breakdown (essential for maintenance and growth of the bone). This process of bone breakdown releases calcium into the bloodstream.
Calcitriol. Calcitriol is one of the scientific names for vitamin D and is used in veterinary medicine to treat dogs and cats suffering from renal failure and related problems. Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D is actually a hormone linked to parathyroid hormone (PTH).
Normally, parathyroid hormone release is triggered when the level of calcium in the blood is low. When the calcium level rises and is back to normal, the release of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroids is suppressed. However, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin work together to control calcium levels in the blood. The blood calcium level is the main stimulus for the release of these hormones, as the release of these hormones is not controlled by the pituitary.
