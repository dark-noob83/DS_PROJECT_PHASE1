Edible ginger root can be bought fresh by the pound, or in a powdered or candied form. It can also be grown throughout Florida. The edible ginger, Zingiber officinale, has narrow leaf blades and yellow-green flowers with purple tips that grow in dense spikes. Its underground stems, or rhizomes, are plump and tan, and they smell pungent and spicy. Ginger does best in partial to full shade in a bed that's been prepared with organic matter.
Wild ginger plants tend to grow moderately slow and are non-invasive with evergreen, kidney-shaped or heart-shaped leaves. Versatile and easily grown, growing wild ginger is an excellent choice in a woodland garden, as a shade ground cover or mass plantings.
