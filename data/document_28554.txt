Tree Sizes. The size of the tree in question plays a large role in how much you’ll pay to have it removed. For example: 1  Small Trees up to 30 Feet in Height – $125 to $450. 2  Medium Trees between 30 and 60 Feet in Height – $175 to $950. 3  Large Trees between 60 and 80 Feet in Height – $400 to $1,100.
The average price to remove a pine tree is around $200 if the tree is 40 feet tall, but the 80-foot pine trees will cost about $1,500 because of the work and potential danger involved. Depending on the breed of pine tree you have, there could be additional work involved with removing the branches and cones.
One of the ways that you can determine how much it would cost to remove your tree is to find out how large your tree is. The cost of a smaller tree is going to be around 125 dollars while a taller tree can run between 900-1400 dollars to be cut down. Stability of your tree is also an important factor in pricing your tree, and taller trees can tend to be less stable which partially attributes to their higher costs.
