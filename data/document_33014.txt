The troposphere extends up to the stratosphere layer, where good ozone protects life on Earth by absorbing some of the sun's UV rays. Stratospheric ozone is found most often between six to 30 miles above the Earth's surface.
Ozone present in the stratosphere of the earth's atmosphere is  called as good ozone. It protects us from the harmful UV light of  the sun.Ozone present in the troposphere i … s also called as bad  ozone. It is also a   green house gas. It is the major constituent of the urban smog.
The other layer, called the stratosphere, is miles above the Earth's surface. Ozone in the stratosphere is good because it protects life on Earth by absorbing some of the sun's harmful UV rays. Stratospheric ozone is found most often between six and 30
The hole in the ozone layer in the earth’s upper atmosphere (stratosphere) reduces the greenhouse effect because ozone is a greenhouse gas. However, ozone is needed in the stratosphere where it occurs naturally to filter out harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
The ozone layer is essentially Mather Earth’s safety net, residing some 50 kilometres above the planet’s surface. Created from O3, or ozone gas, it is up to 20 kilometres thick and 90 per cent of this gas can be found up on the Earth’s stratosphere.
Where is ozone found in the atmosphere? Ozone is mainly found in two regions of the Earth's atmosphere. Most ozone (about 90%) resides in a layer that begins between 6 and 10 miles (10 and 17 kilometers) above the Earth's surface and extends up to about 30 miles (50 kilometers). This region of the atmosphere is called the stratosphere.
Ozone gas protects the Earth's surface from UV-B radiation (which damages DNA). Ozone also moderates day / night temperature swings, and to couple nitrogen and oxygen temperatures to radiate away some of their heat (they cannot radiate in infrared, but ozone can).
