Step 3. Multiply your infant's weight in kilograms by 120 if he is a full-term, healthy newborn. An average full-term newborn needs to consume 120 calories per kilogram of weight each day to grow into a healthy child. For example, if your newborn weighs 4.55 kilograms, multiply 4.55 by 120. The result, 546, is the number of calories your infant should consume in one day. 
Calorie needs by age. Infants need a relatively high number of calories for their body weight compared to older children and adults. According to Merck, healthy infants under six month of age need about 50 to 55 calories per pound of body weight. From six months to one year, babies need about 45 calories per pound of body weight. Save. It may seem that a tiny baby needs very few calories each day, but with their bodies growing drastically in the first year, it's important to make sure your infant is receiving plenty of calories from food sources you've discussed with your doctor.
For that matter, your baby probably won't consume exactly the same amount of food each day. As a general rule, a 7-month old needs 100 calories per kilogram, which equals approximately 2.2 pounds, per day. Although your baby needs a certain number of calories per pound of body weight, you don't have to drag out the baby scale each morning and figure out how many calories your baby needs that day. Your baby is capable of determining how many calories he needs as long as you offer an adequate amount of food. An average-sized 18.5 pound, 7-month-old boy needs 668 calories per day, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. The average 7-month-old girl weighs slightly less, around 17 pounds and needs approximately 608 calories
Beginning at birth, your baby needs about 515 calories or more each day, a number that changes according to his age and needs. In addition to calories, his diet should also consist of fat, protein, vitamins and minerals and come from healthy sources. Kids and Nutrition states that from birth to 3 months of age, babies need between 515 to 690 calories a day. At this age, their only source of nutrition should be 18 to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula daily.
To maintain weight, the chart below shows you your daily calorie limit. It's based on your age, activity level, and the BMI (body-mass index) of 21.5 for women and 22.5 for men. To lose weight -- about 1 pound a week -- reduce total calories in the chart by 500 a day. To gain weight, add 500 calories per day for each pound you want to gain per week.
That's about 2,000 calories a day. However, during the last three months of your pregnancy (third trimester) , you will need an extra 200 calories a day, making a total of about 2,200 calories a day. Bear in mind that we're all different shapes and sizes, and some of us are more active than others. 
Beginning at 7 months of age, babies need 795 to 920 calories a day. Their intake will consist of 24 to 36 ounces daily of breast milk or formula until they are 9 months old, and decrease to 18 to 30 ounces daily from 10 to 12 months of age. Kids and Nutrition states that from birth to 3 months of age, babies need between 515 to 690 calories a day. At this age, their only source of nutrition should be 18 to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula daily.
Milk Calories. Generally, a baby aged 7 months will drink up to 32 ounces of formula per day, with solid food making up the rest of his calories. Since formula contains 20 calories per ounce, drinking 30 ounces of either will provide 600 calories, the bulk of your baby's caloric needs. Although your baby needs a certain number of calories per pound of body weight, you don't have to drag out the baby scale each morning and figure out how many calories your baby needs that day.
