New home construction cost per square foot build cost is a frequently sought reference number. The challenge with using cost per square foot as a way to budget a home is that cost per square foot excludes* the following factors:
Show me a house design, and with a few specific questions, I can place it within a rough range of cost. That’s a start, but for a 2,500-square-foot custom home, even a range of $20 per square foot is a lot of money. You most definitely don’t want your cost estimate on a $250,000 house to be off by $50,000! With a little research, square-foot pricing can be a useful tool to get you “in the ballpark” — but that’s all.
For example, a $5,000 well will cost $1 per square foot on a 5,000 s.f. house and $2 a s.f. on a 2,500 s.f. house. Since houses with low square footage of finished space still tend to have garages, porches, and all the other site costs, the cost per square foot tends to be higher.
Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price.
Generally, turnkey costs will start at around $70 a square foot for a starter home in ideal conditions. An average level of finish will be more like $90-100. At $110-120 we are building a custom finish.
An average commercial steel building costs between $16 and $20 per square foot, including building package (I-Beams, purlins, girts etc.) , delivery, foundation and the cost of construction.
Home prices of $55, $66, $72, $80, $84, $92, $110, $118, and $328 per square foot combine to produce an average of $112 per square foot, which is probably a reasonable figure for many areas of the country. However, the difference between the lowest figure and the highest is very substantial.
