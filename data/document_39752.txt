Taste is the ability to respond to dissolved molecules and ions called tastants. Humans detect taste with taste receptor cells. These are clustered in taste buds and scattered in other areas of the body. Each taste bud has a pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. 1  salty. 2  sour. 3  sweet. 4  bitter.
Gustatory sense receptors are clustered in structures called ?, They are found in elevations, called papillae on the surface of the tongue. These sense receptors are also made of separate cells, called gustatory cells. There are five kinds of basic tastes; they are sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami.
Taste buds are found in these folds. Each taste bud contains 30–50 taste receptor cells arranged like a bunch of bananas. Each cell has tiny hair-like structures, called microvilli, that stick up towards the taste bud surface and form a taste pore. Taste molecules in food touch the taste pores and bind to the microvilli.
