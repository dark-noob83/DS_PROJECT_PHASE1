1 The depth to the C horizon increases as the combined thickness of the A and B horizons increases. 2  Profile horizons are A-B-C. 3  5,000 – 50,000: The above sequence of events continues. 4  Most of the CaCO3 is leached out of the soil or is very deep in the C horizon (loss).
The horizons are: O – (humus or organic) Mostly organic matter such as decomposing leaves. The O horizon is thin in some soils, thick in others, and not present at all in others. A - (topsoil) Mostly minerals from parent material with organic matter incorporated. A good material for plants and other organisms to live.
The A horizon is the topmost layer of the mineral soil. As it lies just below the O horizon, this layer also has some amount of humus in it and therefore, it is darker than the layers below. Similarly, the soil particles in this zone are smaller and finer compared to the lower horizons of the soil.
Notes: The first requirement for all master horizons other than O horizons is that they are composed mostly of mineral material. It is very important to be able to differentiate organic from mineral material. Dark color of the A horizon is due to the mixing of humus with mineral.
1 500 – 5,000 years: The A horizon has stabilized and is fairly thick and dark for this soil. 2  High productivity and lots of biotic activity continually recycle the organic matter. 3  The original minerals in the soil begin to weather and form new clay minerals.
The upper soil horizons (the O and the A horizons) include those that have been substantially altered by soil processes and often have a large organic component giving the soil a dark color compared to the lower mineral soil horizons. The O horizon (organic horizon) is the top layer that makes up the forest floor.
