TV VESA Compatibility, Explained. There are 4 mounting holes on the back of your TV (see diagram below). The distance between these mounting holes determine the VESA compatibility of your TV, and therefore which mounts will fit. All of our tv wall mounts are VESA compliant. A VESA hole pattern is measured in both horizontal and vertical distance between mounting holes. For example, VESA 75 x 75 means your TV mounting holes are 75mm apart horizontally and 75mm apart vertically.

The Flat Display Mounting Interface (FDMI) , also known as VESA Mounting Interface Standard (MIS) or colloquially as VESA mount, is a family of standards defined by the Video Electronics Standards Association for mounting flat panel monitors, TVs, and other displays to stands or wall mounts. Most sizes of VESA mount have four screw-holes arranged in a square on the mount, with matching tapped holes on the device. The horizontal and vertical distance between the screw centers was originally 100 mm. A 75 mm × 75 mm layout was defined for smaller displays.
VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association). VESA is an industry standard layout of screw holes at the back of your TV-Used for mounting your TV onto a stand or wall mount. The most common standards are: VESA 75x75, 100x100, 200x200, 300x300, 400x200, 400x400 and 600x400, 800x400. So for example 'VESA 600x400' means the measurement between the mounting screw holes will be 600mm Horizontally x 400mm Vertically. Example of VESA 600x400: In this example the mounting holes at the back of the TV are 600mm across and 400mm up/down. VESA 600x400.
VESA is an international standards body for computer graphics formed in 1988 by NEC Home Electronics, maker of the MultiSync monitor line, and eight video display adapter manufacturers: ATI Technologies, Genoa Systems, Orchid Technology, Renaissance GRX, STB Systems, Tecmar, Video 7 and Western Digital/Paradise Systems.

Established in 1989, VESA works to develop industry-wide interface standards for a large variety of products including Flat Panel TVs and monitors. VESA has developed a set of standards for the manufacturing of flat screen televisions and PC monitors. Most manufacturers comply with this standard by adhering to an industry wide i¿ï ½hole¿patterni patternï ½ on the back of their displays for. mounting purposes A typical VESA hole pattern for flat panel displays can be one of the following sizes: 1  75 mm x 75 mm (75 mm = 2.95 inches). 2  100 mm x 100 mm (100mm = 3.94 inches). 3  200 mm x 200 mm (200 mm = 7.87 inches).

As well as being used for mounting monitors, the standards can be used to attach a small PC to the mount or monitor. The first standard in this family was introduced in 1997 and was originally called Flat Panel Monitor Physical Mounting Interface (FPMPMI) , it corresponds to part D of the current standard. Most sizes of VESA mount have four screw-holes arranged in a square on the mount, with matching tapped holes on the device. The horizontal and vertical distance between the screw centers was originally 100 mm. A 75 mm × 75 mm layout was defined for smaller displays.
