The length of time it takes a women to get her period after giving birth varies from women to women. For many women it can take about 2 to 3 months before your period returns to normal. If you are nursing than this time frame will last even longer. It could take about 6 months on average.
I had my baby 2 months ago and DO NOT breastfeed. I had my first period 6 weeks after giving birth and I should have had a period this month like 4 days ago and still haven’t gotten it. I’m wondering if its normal to be irregular after giving birth when not breast feeding.
Getting pregnant after birth   It is not necessary to have a period after giving birth to get pregnant again. That's part of the reason doctors tell you to wait si … x weeks before having intercourse again. The other reason is you have to give your uterus and cervix time to heal.
It varies very much. Some women get a period about a month after giving birth. Some women do not get a period for months if they are fully breastfeeding. Just because you don't have a period does not mean you cannot get pregnant. Every Ob/Gyn (or GP) has seen women pregnant at the post-natal check.
I had my daughter 9 weeks ago and i still have not got a period. I am not breast feeding. Is this normal i bled for about 5 weeks after the birth. I have got my pill from the doctor and i am waiting to take it but i want to take it the first day of my period. Has anyone else waited this long for a perod.
If you don't get your period by three months postpartum, talk to your doctor. She may want to check for secondary amenorrhea (that's when women with previously normal cycles don't have a period for three months), pregnancy, or other issues.
