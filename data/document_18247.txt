A regulatory sequence is a segment of a nucleic acid molecule which is capable of increasing or decreasing the expression of specific genes within an organism. Regulation of gene expression is an essential feature of all living organisms and viruses. In DNA, regulation of gene expression normally happens at the level of RNA biosynthesis (transcription), and is accomplished through the sequence-specific binding of proteins (transcription factors) that activate or inhibit transcription. Transcription factors may act as activators, repressors, or both.
Transcription is the process of creating a complementary RNA copy of a sequence of DNA. Gene regulation is essential for viruses as it increases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell to express protein when needed. One of the simplest ways to illustrate gene regulation is to understand how gene regulation works in humans. The latest estimates are that a human You do not have access to view this node, a Eukaryotic You do not have access to view this node, contains some 21,000 genes.
Gene regulation is essential for viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes as it increases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell to express protein when needed. 1 Repressors bind to the Operator, coding sequences on the DNA strand that are close to or overlapping the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand, thus impeding the expression of the gene.The image to the right demonstrates regulation by a repressor in the lac operon.
2 Regulation can be negative or positive. 1  A repressor is a protein that inhibits expression of a gene. 2  It may act to prevent transcription by binding to an operator site in DNA, or to prevent translation by binding to RNA. 1 A repressor is a protein that inhibits expression of a gene. 2  It may act to prevent transcription by binding to an operator site in DNA, or to prevent translation by binding to RNA. 3  The operator is the site on DNA at which a repressor protein binds to prevent transcription from initiating at the adjacent promoter.
Up-regulation is a process that occurs within a cell triggered by a signal (originating internal or external to the cell), which results in increased expression of one or more genes and as a result the protein(s) encoded by those genes. 1 Repressors bind to the Operator, coding sequences on the DNA strand that are close to or overlapping the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand, thus impeding the expression of the gene.The image to the right demonstrates regulation by a repressor in the lac operon.
For prokaryotes, most regulatory proteins are negative and therefore turn genes off. Here, the cells rely on proteinâ€“small molecule binding, in which a ligand or small molecule signals the state of the cell and whether gene expression is needed. The repressor or activator protein binds near its regulatory target: the gene.
Regulation of gene expression includes a wide range of mechanisms that are used by cells to increase or decrease the production of specific gene products (protein or RNA), and is informally termed gene regulation. 1 Repressors bind to the Operator, coding sequences on the DNA strand that are close to or overlapping the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand, thus impeding the expression of the gene.The image to the right demonstrates regulation by a repressor in the lac operon.
Gene expression. Gene expression is the process by which the genetic code-the nucleotide sequence-of a gene is used to direct protein synthesis and produce the structures of the cell. Genes that code for amino acid sequences are known as 'structural genes'. The process of gene expression involves two main stages: Transcription: the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase, and the processing of the resulting mRNA molecule.
Gene regulation is the process of turning genes on and off. During early development, cells begin to take on specific functions. Gene regulation ensures that the appropriate genes are expressed at the proper times. Gene regulation can also help an organism respond to its environment. Gene regulation is accomplished by a variety of mechanisms including chemically modifying genes and using regulatory proteins to turn genes on or off.

Gene regulation or regulation of gene expression includes the processes that cells and viruses use to regulate the way that the information in genes is turned into gene products. One of the simplest ways to illustrate gene regulation is to understand how gene regulation works in humans. The latest estimates are that a human You do not have access to view this node, a Eukaryotic You do not have access to view this node, contains some 21,000 genes.
