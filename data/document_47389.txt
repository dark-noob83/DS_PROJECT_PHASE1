For economic and geographical reasons, most aerobic biological treatment processes operate in the mesophilic range, which is shown in Figure 6.23. In the mesophilic range, the rate of the biological reaction will increase with temperature to a maximum value at 31°C [87.8°F] for most aerobic waste systems. A temperature above 39°C will result in a decreased rate for mesophilic organisms. At temperatures above 96°F (35.5°C) there is deterioration in the biological floc. Protozoa have been observed to disappear at 104°F (40°C) and a dispersed floc with filaments to dominate at 110°F (43.3°C). Psychrophiles grow within the range of 0 to 20°C (32 to 70°F), with an optimum of 10 to 15°C (50 to 60°F). Mesophiles, which comprise most of the species commonly found in wastewater treatment processes, grow within the range of 10 to 45°C (50 to 115°F), with an optimum of approximately 30 to 35°C (85 to 95°F).
For example, food processing wastewater will generally have a COD:BOD ratio of ~2:1, while textile wastewater that can contain dyes will often have a much higher COD:BOD ratio of ~5:1. To establish the COD:BOD ratio for your wastewater, simply have both COD and BOD run on several wastewater samples. 1 Most wastewater samples will fall in the high range, so standards of 100, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/L are typically prepared. 2  COD standards can also be purchased. 3  A COD reactor/heating (150°C) block and a colorimeter are turned on so that both instruments are allowed to stabilize.
It is to be understood that many industrial wastewater systems cannot maintain their wastewater at or below this temperature. Nonetheless, the literature is consistent in setting 95°F as the upper limit, beyond which the operation of the biological system and solids settling in the clarifiers will begin to suffer. Background Information. Industrial operations can often make for difficult conditions in the wastewater treatment system. There can be large variations in flow, organic loading, pH, nutrient value (insufficient nitrogen and/or phosphate), and temperature.
There are three temperature regimes: the mesophilic over a temperature range of 4 to 39°C [39.2 to 102.2°F], the thermophilic which peaks at a temperature of 55°C [131°F], and the psychrophilic which operates at temperatures below 4°C [39.2°F]. Psychrophiles grow within the range of 0 to 20°C (32 to 70°F), with an optimum of 10 to 15°C (50 to 60°F). Mesophiles, which comprise most of the species commonly found in wastewater treatment processes, grow within the range of 10 to 45°C (50 to 115°F), with an optimum of approximately 30 to 35°C (85 to 95°F).
Wastewater constituents and average values at a typical brewery. The brewing process generates a unique, high-strength wastewater as a by-product. The wastewater typically has a high concentration of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) from the carbohydrates and protein used in brewing beer. Brewery wastewater usually has a warm temperature (greater than 100°F). The high level of soluble BOD and the warm temperature make brewery wastewater an ideal substrate for anaerobic treatment. Anaerobic treatment of brewery wastewater is a proven process. More than 250 full-scale systems are operational worldwide. 
The other common reason for purging wastewater is the buildup of chlorides, which are typically limited to 12,000 mg/l, based on the metallurgy used in the scrubbers. With corrosion-resistant metallurgy, chlorides up to 35,000 mg/l can be handled, thus reducing wastewater production. 
The temperature of the wastewater entering a municipal wastewater treatment plant is usually not a concern. Background Information. Industrial operations can often make for difficult conditions in the wastewater treatment system. There can be large variations in flow, organic loading, pH, nutrient value (insufficient nitrogen and/or phosphate), and temperature.
The BOD test measures the amount of oxygen neededto biologically oxidize material in wastewater. Because the rate of biological activitydepends on temperature and complete stabilization may require as long as 20 days, theBOD 5 test has been standardized to conditions of 20°C for five days. Alternatively, use a factor of 80 mL/mgd. For example, at a flow of 4.1 mgd,the sample volume to be collected is 4.1 mgd 80 mL/mgd 328 mL. 17-26 Operation of Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants Copyright © 2007 Water Environment Federation.
FOG requires more oxygen to break down than BOD 5 (Stuth). The typical aerobic treatment plant can achieve a 95% FOG removal with an influent of 745 mg/L (Stuth & Wecker, 1997). Most researchers agreed that aerobic pretreatment is able to reduce high strength wastewater. Most researchers apply a range to quantify concentrations of BOD 5, TSS, and FOG for wastewater influent. The most commonly used range is 100-300 mg/L BOD 5 and 100-350 mg/L TSS (NSF Standard No. 40). FOG ranges typically are identified as 50-150 mg/L with 150 mg/L being identified as “strong”.
