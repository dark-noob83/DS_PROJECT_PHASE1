Naming of exoplanets. The IAU fully supports the involvement of the general public in the naming of astronomical objects, whether directly or through an independent organised vote, in the naming of planetary satellites, newly discovered exoplanets, and their host stars.
A common source is an exoplanet's host star's widely recognized, common or astronomical catalogue name. Alternatively, exoplanets are often named after the scientific instrument or project that discovered the exoplanet. We'll look at several examples of the first element of exoplanetary naming. 51 Pegasi b, for instance, is an exoplanet around the star 51 Pegasi in the constellation Pegasus.
Nominate Exoplanet Names! Astronomers have discovered that over 160 billion planets orbit stars in our galaxy. They are called exoplanets. Help us build the first list of names the public wants to see exoplanets named with! Every nomination helps fund space research and education.
About 200th discovered exoplanet (in 2007); reported to be the first potentially Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its star, though that is in doubt now. The joke might be that like Space Planet, Planet #14 is a generic and unoriginal name.
The planet orbiting Iota Horologii was the first planet that I gave a name to. This planet was quite interesting to me, and it deserved a special one: Cronus. Beginning in 2004, I started a hobby of giving extrasolar planet names to the planets outside the solar system.
