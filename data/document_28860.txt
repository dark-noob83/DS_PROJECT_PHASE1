The eucalyptus tree is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, common in Australia, to which it is native. There are over 700 species of Eucalyp … tus, and beside Australia, around 15 species are found in their native state in parts of New Guinea and Indonesia. It's the tree that a koala lives in and the koala eats it's leaves. 7 people found this useful. Edit.

Koala. The eucalyptus forests and woodlands of Australia’s east coast are disappearing quickly, with a significant loss occurring throughout our local area. Australia Zoo has identified the koala, an icon of this dwindling habitat, as an important conservation species. Although not listed as endangered by any Australian state, the koala population has been devastated over the last hundred years and is currently under great threat due to urbanisation and massive, uncontrolled habitat destruction.
It is important to note that the Koala’s status as ‘Common’ in a particular area does not necessarily mean that Koalas are indeed common in that area (As in Queensland and Victoria-see below). The Koala is not on the official Threatened Species list in Victoria and therefore the state government is not prompted to make any hard management decisions.
The koala’s habitat is in the country of Australia. Their range is between the eastern and southern parts of the country. Information facts about their population and habitat vary, but they live mainly in the Australian states of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. Plant specie information about eucalyptus trees indicate there are many different varieties in the wild. In fact each koala is particular about what kind they will eat. Baby koalas acquire their taste for specific varieties by adulthood. One of the main reasons koalas are endangered in some areas is the destruction of native eucalyptus forest habitats
Eucalyptus leaves is the only food koalas eat. Although the leaves are poisonous to most animals, they have special bacteria that live in their stomachs to break down and digest them. Their diet includes up to one pound of leaves a day. The koala has special teeth adapted for their eucalyptus diet.

Hill as an ENDANGERED SPECIES in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Act, and as a consequence omit reference to Eucalyptus parvula L. Johnson & K. Hill from Part 1 of Schedule 2 (Vulnerable) of the Act. Listing of Endangered Species is provided for by Part 2 of the Act. The Scientific Committee has found that: 3. Eucalyptus parvula is a small tree or mallee, endemic to the south-eastern edge of the NSW southern tablelands (Miles 2008). It is found in the South Eastern Highlands Bioregion and may extend into the adjacent South East Corner Bioregion (sensu. Thackway & Creswell 1995).
The Scientific Committee, established by the Threatened Species Conservation Act, has made a Final Determination to list the mallee Eucalyptus castrensis K. D. Hill as a ENDANGERED SPECIES in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Act. Listing of endangered species is provided for by Part 2 of the Act. The Scientific Committee has found that: 1. Eucalyptus castrensis K. D. Hill (family Myrtaceae) is described by Hill and Stanberg (2002) as: a mallee to 8m tall. 5. Eucalyptus castrensis is potentially at risk from unauthorised activity on military land, potential change in land tenure, frequent fires and is threatened by demographic and environmental stochasticity due to its localised extent.
as my interests are far and wide. As a genus, the eucalyptus is not endangered. However, within this genus, there are some endangered species, such as the Eucalyotus scoparia, Eucalyptus parvala and Eucalyptus cattai, just to name a few.
