1 Cost depends heavily on geographic location; large cities can cost double or triple. 2  Makeup artists also charge more if they have to travel to the wedding location and charge an hourly rate of $50 to $125 or more to remain onsite for touch-ups.

Bridal hair/makeup: $180. Bridesmaid/mother of the bride hair/makeup: $150. Hair or makeup only : $80. *Note, these prices do not include a “trial” hair/makeup run, which can cost anywhere from $50-$150. IMHO, I think $65 for hair/makeup trial is a fair price to be argued for.

$200 for a trial (with airbrushing) with $100 of that going towards a bridal package that is $850, which includes my hair & makeup, with airbrushing and lashes ($350) and four hair and/or makeup services at $100 each. Each additional hair or makeup service at $85. Bridesmaid/mother of the bride hair/makeup: $150.

Average Wedding Cost. The average wedding cost in the United States is $26,444. Couples typically spend between $19,833 and $33,055 but, most couples spend less than $10,000. This does not include cost for a honeymoon. Understanding wedding cost now can help you with your wedding budget later. 
However, while the average, magazine-worthy hair/makeup artist will charge around $500/day for several different looks, it still seems overpriced to pay a potentially less qualified wedding hair/makeup artist $300 for one look. Bridesmaid/mother of the bride hair/makeup: $150. Hair or makeup only : $80. *Note, these prices do not include a “trial” hair/makeup run, which can cost anywhere from $50-$150.
