LeAnn Rimes sang a song called Blue, which was also the name of her debut album in 1996. The song was written by Bill Mack. Mack wrote the song 30 years earlier to be recorded by Patsy Cline, but she was killed in a plane crash before recording the song. Bill Mack released his own version of the song as did Kenny Roberts back in the 1960's.
This is Track 16 on The Who's Album-Who's Next. The original version of Behind Blue Eyes was recorded at The Record Plant in New York, on March 18, 1971 and produced by Kit Lambert. Al Kooper on organ.
The song Blue Prelude was written by Gordon Jenkins and Joe Bishop. As to who wrote the lyrics versus who composed, I'm uncertain, since Joe Bishop usually wrote the music, … yet often so did Gordon Jenkins. Perhaps they take co-composing credit. 1 person found this useful.
