When a blue whale exhales, the spray from its blowhole can reach nearly 30 ft (9m) into the air. Size relative to a bus: Blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet (30 meters) long and upwards of 200 tons (181 metric tons). Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.
Yes, whales are mammals, however due to the fact that they live in the ocean these large animals are referred to as marine mammals. In fact the blue whale is the largest living mammal (and animal species) on this earth. In terms of size the blue whale can grow to lengths of over 90 ft. long and weigh more than 150 tons.
Blue whales are the largest mammals that ever lived, but they are also an endangered species. Due to aggressive hunting and environmental changes, these ocean-dwellers could become extinct. Balaenoptera musculus, or the blue whales dominate the oceans, reaching lengths of 100 feet and weighing more than 200 tons.
The blue whale (scientifically referred to as balaenoptera musculus) is a large marine mammal that is part of the baleen whale (mysticeti) suborder and is the largest animal alive growing to lengths of up to 100 ft. long and weighing as much as 150 tons or more.
Description. It is difficult to imagine the size of the blue whale, the largest animal inhabiting the earth. There are records of individuals over 100 feet (30.5 m) long, but 70-90 feet (23-27 m) is probably average. A good way to visualize their length is to remember that they are about as long as three school buses.
