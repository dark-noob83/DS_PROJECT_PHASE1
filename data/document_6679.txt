Most new cars (1999 and above) come with rotors at each wheel. Older cars may have drums instead of rotors at the rear wheels. Brake rotors play an important part in the braking system. It is the friction between brake pads and rotors that cause your car to slow down and stop.
Your mechanic should measure the rotor thickness every time the brake pads are replaced. Brake rotors usually last twice as long as brake pads, which usually means you need to replace rotors every other brake service. If you drive the car with worn-out brake pads for too long, you will destroy the rotors.
The average cost for a brake pad and rotor replacement is between $297 to $406. Labor costs are estimated between $152 to $193 while parts are priced between $145 to $213. Get a personalized estimate based on your location and specific car. Estimate does not include taxes and fees.
1 For work on front and back brakes, CostHelper readers reported paying $273-$1,025 for an average of $567 at standard repair shops, or $280-$935 for an average of $578 at dealerships.
At most dealerships or other types of repair facilities, replacing your brake rotors, on average, will cost somewhere between $30 and $60 for each of the wheels. Replacing brake rotors is considered more labor intensive than just doing normal brake maintenance jobs, like replacing your brake pads.
Brake rotors should be measured at every brake pad replacement. If found to be at or below the manufacturer's minimum thickness specification, they will require replacement. These measurements should always be noted on your repair order. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads.
$300 for all four brake pads, rotors, and labor sounds completely reasonable. $200 would be almost suspiciously cheap and $400 would start becoming a ripoff. As was said, you don't HAVE TO buy rotors. If they're still thick enough, they can turn them to make them true again.
