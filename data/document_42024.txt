The various factors that affect yeast activity and the degree of fermentation in the baking process are: Fermentation time This factor determines the amount of time yeast gets to act on the sugars present in the ferment, whether it be a sponge, brew, or a straight-dough. While the rate of fermentation declines with time at a constant temperature, it does not completely stop. However, the longer the fermentation time, the higher the degree of fermentation. Bakeries using flour-brew systems that chill the brew after fermentation have to be careful about this factor.
Bakers who use yeast in their bread making are very aware of this. Yeast is used to leaven bread (make it rise). Yeast leavens bread by fermenting sugar, producing carbon dioxide, CO 2, as a waste product. Some of the carbon dioxide is trapped by the dough and forms small “air” pockets that make the bread light.
Yeast fermentation is affected by temperature as a result of the various different standards of temperatures that the yeasts are exposed to. If the yeasts are exposed to their … optimum temperature(approximately 66.667 degrees celcuis), then this would yield the most amount of fermentation.

Thus, if yeast cells become denatured, as a result of a too high temperature, which causes the yeast cells enzymes to be denatured(lack of a better word...sorry), then the yeast would not ferment to the best of their ability, hence causing a decrease in the rate of fermentation.
The various factors that affect yeast activity and the degree of fermentation in the baking process are: Fermentation time Fermentation temperature Specific ingredients in dough formulation: Level of water, sugar, salt and mold-inhibitor Dough pH.
The higher the temperature the faster fermentation, but yeast mortality also increases as the temperature … rises. Above a certain temperature and the yeast will be killed. Around 25 decrees C is good temperature for fast fermentation without temperature related mortality.
