There will be a one-time filing fee regardless of the type of divorce being sought. In Kentucky, a couple may file a joint petition for divorce. The charge can range between $100 and $400 depending on the county. If one spouse is filing the petition, the other must officially be served a copy of the complaint. For those who cannot afford this, a waiver can be received. Keep this in mind if you are worried about how much does a divorce cost in Kentucky.
Answers. Best Answer: He is 50% responsible for all bills. A legal separation costs whatever it costs. You should see an attorney. I found an attorney and he wrote one up for $900. My buddy went to one and it cost him nearly $4000. Many lawyers will give you 30 minutes for free so shop around.
A legal separation can last up to one year. After one year you should be ready to decide if you want to get a divorce or get back together with your spouse. If, after one year, either party moves for dissolution, the decree of legal separation is converted to a divorce decree.
