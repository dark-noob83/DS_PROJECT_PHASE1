AutoSprink costs about $4500 for the 1st year, and $3300 / yr after that. That fee includes updates and full tech support. HydraCAD is $3000 - 5000 to purchase and $960 / yr for updates and $960 / yr for unlimited tech support. So, the fees are comparable. But, if I can increase production by 200%, then the cost is negligible. I think that I may have paid $200 in the last 5 years for HCAD tech support. AutoSprink is going to run about $4500 +/- for the initial purchase. You then have a yearly fee of $3300 or so to renew the license.
That translates to $37.2 million for each of the stateâ€™s five executions since the state reenacted the death penalty. The study estimates that the average cost to Maryland taxpayers for reaching a single death sentence is $3 million - $1.9 million more than the cost of a non-death penalty case. The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000.
Final value fee. If the item sells, you're charged a final value fee. Final value fees are calculated based on the total amount of the sale and are charged per item. The total amount of the sale is the final price of the item, shipping charges, and any other amounts you may charge the buyer. Sales tax is not included. Shipping to the buyer is $30, so the total amount of the sale is $7,830. The final value fee is $750. (10% of $7,830 is $783, but the maximum charge for auction-style final value fees is $750).

RE: SprinkCAD vs. HydraCAD. The costs with AS and HydraCAD are closer than in the past, at least for a single station-as that is all I have. I know that with the increased production in AS, that I makeup the costs above HydraCAD typically by the end of January each year. I have heard good things about it. Unfortunately, it is not AutoCad based, and the type of work we do requires an AutoCad based program. I have also heard that it has trouble with importing large autocad drawings, and the majority of the projects I work on are large (~200,000+ sq. ft. footprints).
Texas death penalty cases cost more than non-capital cases. Each death penalty case in Texas costs taxpayers about $2.3 million. That is about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years. (Executions Cost Texas Millions, Dallas Morning News, March 8, 1992). The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000.
A Seattle University study examining the costs of the death penalty in Washington found that each death penalty case cost an average of $1 million more than a similar case where the death penalty was not sought ($3.07 million, versus $2.01 million). The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000.
It costs approximately $90,000 more a year to house an inmate on death row, than in the general prison population or $57.5 million annually. The Attorney General devotes about 15% of his budget, or $11 million annually to death penalty cases. Executing all of the people currently on death row, or waiting for them to die there of other causes, will cost California an estimated $4 billion more than if they had been sentenced to die in prison of disease, injury, or old age; California death penalty trials have cost as much as $10.9 million.
