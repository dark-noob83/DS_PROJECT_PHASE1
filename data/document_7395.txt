Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells (as defined in Martin Fowlerâ€™s Refactoring book).
There is a Pylint configuration file directly in the source code (tools/pylintrc.txt). There is an cofiguration file for pep8 tool, too (tools/pep8config.txt). Pylint is static code analyser for Python. You can use it for detecting errors in your source codes or to help follow coding standards. However, default Pylint configuration is not compatible with GRASS Python coding style. The rc file is on this page (use copy and paste).
Pylint is a source code bug and quality checker for the Python programming language. It follows the style recommended by PEP 8, the Python style guide. It is similar to Pychecker but includes the following features:
