Liver Transplant Surgery. Model for end-stage liver disease, also known as the MELD score, is the most commonly discussed topic when meeting with our liver transplant waiting list patients. Discussing the MELD score is the most anxiety provoking part of any conversation that we have with our patients.
When a patient moves to a higher MELD score, the waiting time at the lower level is not carried to the new level. The clock at the new level starts at 0. (Example: Patient has a MELD score of 15 and has been at level 11-18 for 100 days. With new laboratory tests, the patient’s MELD score is 22. The patient moves to a new MELD level of 19-24. The patient’s waiting time at this new level starts at 0 days).
Within the MELD continuous disease severity scale, there are four levels. As the MELD score increases, and the patient moves up to a new level, a new waiting time clock starts. Waiting time is carried backwards but not forward.
Currently, the average MELD score for a patient undergoing a liver transplant is 20 nationally. The average MELD score for liver transplant patients in our region varies from 26-33, depending on blood type. The average waiting time for a patient to receive a liver in our region, once a patient is placed on the UNOS waiting list, is 12-36 months.

MELD score or Model for End-stage liver disease is a scoring system used to assess the severity of chronic liver disease. disease is defined as being chronic when it is present in a patient for a duration of more than six months.
