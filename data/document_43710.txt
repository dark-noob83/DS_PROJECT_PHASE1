3. Heat the oven to 500 degrees for a raw roast, 375 for a pre-browned one. 4. Place the roasting pan in the oven; cook for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 300 degrees. 5. Cook for about 45 minutes, then start checking the roast's temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the roast when the internal temperature, measured as deep into the roast as you can get, reads 165 degrees. 6. 
How long and at what temperature should I cook a beef roast in the oven? Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast. Sirloin-tip, rump, rolled-rump, eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice. Cooking at a constant oven temperature of 300°F (160°C), a 5- to 8-lb standing rib roast will take 17-19 minutes per pound for rare, 20-22 for medium rare, 23-25 minutes for medium, and 27-30 minutes for well done.
1 For a medium rare roast: Cook the roast for 20 minutes for every pound. 2  If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook it for 100 minutes. 3  For a medium roast: Allow 22 minutes of cooking time for every pound. 4  If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook the meat for 110 minutes. 1 For a rare roast: Allow 15 minutes of cooking time for every pound of roast. 2  For example, if you had a 5 pound roast, you would cook your roast for 75 minutes if you wanted it rare.
1 If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook it for 100 minutes. 2  For a medium roast: Allow 22 minutes of cooking time for every pound. 3  If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook the meat for 110 minutes. 4  If you are cooking a pork roast, you should allow 20 minutes per pound of meat. 1 For a rare roast: Allow 15 minutes of cooking time for every pound of roast. 2  For example, if you had a 5 pound roast, you would cook your roast for 75 minutes if you wanted it rare.
4) Place the beef in a roasting pan, and put it in the oven, uncovered. Timing is Everything. 1) Cook the roast for 15 minutes at 500 degrees F. 2) After 15 minutes, turn the temperature down to 375 degrees F. 3) Continue cooking for 16 minutes per pound (ex: If your roast is 3 pounds, that would be 48 minutes). 4) Remove from oven, and place pan on a cooling rack. 5) Let rest for 15 minutes
Remove the roast from the oven and set on a cutting board. Cover the meat with tin foil and let it rest for about 15 minutes before slicing it. The temperature of the roast will continue to rise about another 5 degrees. It’s difficult to say. WIth a roast, you generally want to cook to an internal temperature, not a time. But, when you lay it out butterflied, it’s thinner and more of the meat is exposed to heat, so if you were to cook it at 350 degrees at a 1/2 hour/lb. a 6 lb roast would end up ruinously overdone.
4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°)
