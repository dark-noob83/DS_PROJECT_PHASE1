The Cost Of Assisted Living. The average cost for living in an Assisted Living facility ranges between $60 and $80 per day ($1800 to $2400/month) for the basics. This cost covers room and board, basic utilities (electricity, heat, water, and garbage), basic housekeeping (fresh linens) and some meals. This is similar to what many seniors would pay in an Independent Living facility but is much less expensive than the $70-$300 per day ($2100 to $9000/month) for a Nursing Home..

Brand-new facilities will eat $130,000 to $145,000 per room in start-up costsâ€“or about $11 million for an average-sized location with 80 units, estimates Jim Moore, an industry consultant and author of Assisted Living Strategies for Changing Markets. 
Therefore the cost is usually higher than that of regular assisted living.According to Genworth.com, in 2014, the national average cost of memory care for a single resident was almost $5,000 per month. This cost does vary widely by community, however, and generally ranges from $2,000 to $7,000 per month. 
Just as the cost of real estate varies by geographic area, assisted living costs also vary nationwide. In the 2015 Cost of Care Survey conducted by Genworth Financial, assisted living showed an increase of 2.86% compared to the 2014 costs and the national median monthly rate is $3,600. Ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, this fee is non-refundable and covers administrative expenses and the cost of apartment renovations between residents. Other assisted living costs may include fees for private transportation, off-site activities, guest meals and use of a guest apartment within the community.
The average cost for a private one-bedroom apartment in an assisted living residence is over $3,000 per month, according to research compiled by several nonprofit senior living organizations, including the Assisted Living Federation of America.
