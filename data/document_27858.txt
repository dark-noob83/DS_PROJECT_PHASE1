The commercial wind turbine cost is about $1- $2 million a MW nameplate capacity installed and if you buy the same turbine in 2 MW, its cost would be about $2.8 million. The wind turbines for residence and farm are less expensive, when a KW energy production capacity applies to the rates. The 10 KW wind turbine price is about $28,000and 100 KW price is about $ 48,000.
Capital costs: The cost of the wind turbine is the single largest cost component, and can make up 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project. The cost of installation, such as construction, makes up the remaining capital costs. 1 The cost of electricity can be reported in dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh) or cents per kilowatt-hour (c/kWh) as commonly seen on residential electricity bills. 2  For example, $50 per MWh = 5 cents per kWh. 3  An average U.S. home uses 11,000 kWh or 11 MWh each year.
1 The Department of Energy finds that “ Among a large sample of wind projects installed in 2012, the capacity-weighted average installed cost stood at nearly $1,940/kW, down almost $200/kW from the reported average cost in 2011 and down almost $300/kW from the reported average cost in both 2009 and 2010 .” [3]. 1 The cost of electricity can be reported in dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh) or cents per kilowatt-hour (c/kWh) as commonly seen on residential electricity bills. 2  For example, $50 per MWh = 5 cents per kWh. 3  An average U.S. home uses 11,000 kWh or 11 MWh each year.
Recent improvements in turbine technology has reduced the cost of wind energy, allowing electricity consumers and utilities to lock in low, affordable electricity rates through 20 to 30 year contracts.

Home or Farm Scale Wind Turbines. Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more). Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.
The costs for a utility scale wind turbine range from about $1.3 million to $2.2 million per MW of nameplate capacity installed. Most of the commercial-scale turbines installed today are 2 MW in size and cost roughly $3-$4 million installed. Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.
Cost per Unit of Output. While there is no available average cost of a wind turbine, there is, at least for large turbines, an average cost per megawatt. In 2015, it was about $2 million per megawatt. The SeaTitan 10MW, therefore, although not priced at the time, could cost in the neighborhood of $20 million. At the bottom end of the price scale, the Aleko WG450A Wind Turbine Generator with a 450 Watt 24 Volt capacity was selling for $402 in 2015. Micro-turbines are largely for hobby purposes.
This is a per megawatt cost of about $3 million to $8 million. At the bottom end of the price scale, the Aleko WG450A Wind Turbine Generator with a 450 Watt 24 Volt capacity was selling for $402 in 2015. Micro-turbines are largely for hobby purposes.
The cost of a wind energy project will vary depending on the scale, site and installation requirements. Some typical figures for the installed cost for different scales of wind turbine are provided in the following table. Capital cost figures are approximate and include installation costs due to civil works. Planning and feasibility study costs are not included as these vary considerably.
Total costs for installing a commercial-scale wind turbine will vary significantly depending on the number of turbines ordered, cost of financing, when the turbine purchase agreement was executed, construction contracts, the location of the project, and other factors. Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.
