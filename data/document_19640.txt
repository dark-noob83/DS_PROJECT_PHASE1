But that's misleading because you're still paying for the phone over the life of much of your contract. What you really need to do is look at the cost of a contract-free, or unlocked, iPhone. T-Mobile lists the starting price of an unlocked iPhone 6 at $649. The starting price for an unlocked 6 Plus is $749. That's some serious coin.
Apple's iPhone 5C, though, doesn't cost that much less to produce than the iPhone 5S. The iPhone 5C costs between $173 and $183 to make, according to IHS. The devices are similar in production cost because they really aren't all that different.
As for Apple's expenses, I'll turn to a 2012 report from the research firm UBM TechInsights. It looked at the cost of the made-in-China 16 GB iPhone 5's various components and concluded that Apple shelled out $167.50 to make each of the gadgets.
That last point is as true as ever with its new iPhone 6, for which Apple is charging more than three times the cost of components and manufacturing. According to a teardown report from research firm IHS, the components and manufacturing cost of a 16GB iPhone 6 cost Apple $200.10. The device is selling for $649 in the U.S. without a contract with a wireless carrier. That gives the device a profit margin of about 69%.
A big part of answering that question is first determining how much an iPhone costs on each carrier. We will take a look at how much it costs to have a phone on a new contract with Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and then the cost of an unlocked iPhone on T-Mobile. For reference, we’ll be looking at the least expensive plans that support the iPhone for each carrier, using Geek.com’s local prices (New York City).
