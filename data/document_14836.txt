As a result, the nucleus of the megakaryocyte can become very large and lobulated, which, under a light microscope, can give the false impression that there are several nuclei. In some cases, the nucleus may contain up to 64N DNA, or 32 copies of the normal complement of DNA in a human cell. Platelets are held within these internal membranes within the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. There are two proposed mechanisms for platelet release. In one scenario, these proto-platelet processes break up explosively to become platelets. Alternatively, the cell may form platelet ribbons into blood vessels.
A very large cell native to the bone marrow which is the precursor of platelets and the largest (40–100 µm in diameter) normal nucleated haematopoietic cell in the marrow. Megakaryocytes may be relatively small (micromegakaryocytes) and measure 15–30 µm in diameter. an extremely large bone marrow cell measuring between 35 and 160 μm in diameter and having a nucleus with many lobes. Megakaryocytes are essential for the production and proliferation of platelets in the marrow and are normally not present in the circulating blood.
In general, megakaryocytes are 10 to 15 times larger than a typical red blood cell, averaging 50-100 μm in diameter. During its maturation, the megakaryocyte grows in size and replicates its DNA without cytokinesis in a process called endomitosis. Platelets are held within these internal membranes within the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. There are two proposed mechanisms for platelet release. In one scenario, these proto-platelet processes break up explosively to become platelets. Alternatively, the cell may form platelet ribbons into blood vessels.

A megakaryocyte (mega- + karyo- + -cyte, large-nucleus cell) is a large bone marrow cell with a lobulated nucleus responsible for the production of blood thrombocytes (platelets), which are necessary for normal blood clotting. Platelets are held within these internal membranes within the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. There are two proposed mechanisms for platelet release. In one scenario, these proto-platelet processes break up explosively to become platelets. Alternatively, the cell may form platelet ribbons into blood vessels.
meg·a·kar·y·o·cyte. A large cell (as much as 100 mcm in diameter) with a polyploid nucleus that is usually multilobed; megakaryocytes are normally present in bone marrow, not in the circulating blood, and give rise to blood platelets. Synonym(s): megacaryocyte, megalokaryocyte, thromboblast. an extremely large bone marrow cell measuring between 35 and 160 μm in diameter and having a nucleus with many lobes. Megakaryocytes are essential for the production and proliferation of platelets in the marrow and are normally not present in the circulating blood.

Megakaryocytes are cells that originate from a pluripotent progenitor cell in the hematopoietic tissue. They are found in bone marrow and are easily recognizable as very large cells, up to 100 m in diameter with a large, lobulated nucleus. x cells are the first blood cells to develop in the embryo, at which time and until postnatal life they produce fetal hemoglobin.
