3. a: a light volatile flammable liquid C4H10O used chiefly as a solvent and especially formerly as an anesthetic b: any of a class of organic compounds characterized by an oxygen atom attached to two carbon atoms. — ethe·ric \i-ˈther-ik, -ˈthir-\ adjective. See ether defined for English-language learners.
Whereas if they are different the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers A typical example is the solvent and anesthetic diethyl ether, commonly referred to simply as ether (CH 3 -CH 2 -O-CH 2 -CH 3).
Chemical Application Ether is an organic functional group consisting of a disubstituted oxygen, or an oxygen atom bonded to 2 carbon atoms (if adjacent to a ketone, functiona … l group is then called an ester).
Ethers feature C-O-C linkage defined by a bond angle of about 110° and C-O distances of about 140 pm. The barrier to rotation about the C-O bonds is low. The bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. In the language of valence bond theory, the hybridization at oxygen is sp 3.
1 Basically, an ether is any chemical compound that contains one atom of oxygen that is bonded to two aryl or alkyl groups. 2  Ethyls are…. 3  Student's Guide to Understanding Ethers In organic chemistry, the ether functional group is formed of two alkyl or aryl radicals tied to an oxygen atom: R-O-R'.
Chemical Application. Ether is an organic functional group consisting of a disubstituted oxygen, or an oxygen atom bonded to 2 carbon atoms (if adjacent to a ketone, functional group is then called an ester). Ethers are commonly used as powerful non-polar solvents for both industrial applications and for chemical reactions.
In summary, ether is a chemical with an oxygen atom bound to two alkyl groups. Ethers are liquid at room temperature and are typically colorless, with a sweet smell. The most common type of ether is diethyl ether, which is extremely flammable and was one of the first anesthetics used in surgery.
