The salinity of estuarine water varies from estuary to estuary, and can change from one day to the next depending on the tides, weather, or other factors (Levinton, 1995.). Estuaries are transitional areas that straddle the land and the sea, as well as freshwater and saltwater habitats.
An estuary is a partially enclosed body of water, and its surrounding coastal habitats, where saltwater from the ocean mixes with fresh water from rivers or streams. In fresh water the concentration of salts, or salinity, is nearly zero. The salinity of water in the ocean averages about 35 parts per thousand (ppt). The mixture of seawater and fresh water in estuaries is called brackish water and its salinity can range from 0.5 to 35 ppt.
Salinity. temperature | depth | salinity | dissolved oxygen | turbidity | pH | nutrients | chlorophyll. In estuaries, salinity levels are generally highest near the mouth of a river where the ocean water enters, and lowest upstream where fresh water flows in.
