1 On average, a whole chicken that is not organic will cost $0.75 to $1.50 per pound. 2  An organic whole chicken, on the other hand, can cost upwards of $2.50 to $5 per pound. 3  The average chicken is going to cost $10 to $25 as a whole. 1 Again, it is going to depend on the weight. 2  According to users on Mothering.com, they paid anywhere from $3.50 to $5 per pound for a free-range chicken. 3  For example, on this SouthernSavers.com post, the author stated that the prices on whole chickens ranged from $2.49 to $4.69
The approximate costs to raise 3 hens would be: 1  Chickens: $3 - $30 per chicken depending on age, breed etc. 2  Coop: Free (recycled materials) to $2,000 & up (new & fancy). 3  Feed approximately $15.00 per month. 4  Miscellaneous $10.00 per month. If you decide to raise your own chicks you can expect to pay $3.00 and $5.00 per chick (day-old) for popular breeds and for rare breeds you can expect to pay up to $50.00 or more per chick. Older chicks and mature chickens' prices vary greatly between breeds, age of the chickens etc.
Five farms processed chickens on farm. An average of 2.4 family members processed birds on these farms with 2 to 7 employees also working on processing. The average cost to process a chicken on farm was $1.17. Off-farm processing costs ranged from $1 to $4 per bird. If the unusually high $4 charge is excluded, the average cost to process a bird off farm was $1.41. 
Wood shavings cost around $6.00 (.276 cubic meter loose and .092 cubic meters compressed). Straw will cost you between $3.00 and $12.00 per bale, depending on availability, quality and size of order. Sawdust pellets will cost around $4.00 per 40 lbs bag. How much a chicken will eat is near impossible to say. Certain breeds, Leghorns for example, are not big eaters.

Each adult chicken will eat approximately 1/4 pound of feed per day. A bag of purchased layer feed is 50 pounds and costs me approximately $35 (you may be able to get it cheaper where you live). That is about 17.5 cents a day per chicken. The average multi-purpose hen will lay approximately 260 eggs per year at peak performance. It works out to $63.88 spent per chicken per year with a return of approximately 21.66 dozen eggs if you purchase all their food from a store. How much does it really cost to feed chickens in return for eggs, is it really worth it or should I just buy them from the store or a neighbors. My first thought is that it's a no brainer. I know eggs from free range hens are much healthier than anything store bought and I love having chickens around.
Grower and all flock feed for older chickens will cost around $17.00 per 50 lbs bag and layer pellets between $15.00 and $30.00 per 50 lbs bag, depending again on brand and whether you buy organic/regular.

I was wondering how much money do chickens cost per year. For food hay and vet checks. My family doesn't know how much money it will take for this stuff. Also, include the cost of a chicken coop, waterer and a fence because we are planing to have free range chickens during the day. Answer: I am going to answer your question from the most economical way of starting out with chickens. First, lets get the vet issue out of the way. Feed: The amount of feed your chickens will eat will depend on the breed(s) you choose. Also, I noticed you said you would be free ranging during the day. I to free range my birds, I have 12 birds(several different breeds) and they go through a 50 pound bag of feed every 4 to 5 weeks.
