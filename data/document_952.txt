To implement a task switching or multitasking environment, it was thought that a special, separate key was needed. This is similar to the way “Ctrl + Alt + Del” is used under Windows NT. On 84-key keyboards (except the 84-key IBM Model M space saver keyboard), SysRq was a key of its own. On the later 101-key keyboard, it shares a physical key with the Print Screen key function. One must hold down the Alt key while pressing this “dual-function” key to invoke SysRq. The default BIOS keyboard routines simply ignore SysRq and return without taking action.
Print screen (often abbreviated Print Scrn, Prnt Scrn, Prt Scn, Prt Scr, Prt Sc or Pr Sc) is a key present on most PC keyboards. It is typically situated in the same section as the break key and scroll lock key. 
Maybe you found a totally cool picture that you want to share with a friend, you can copy it right to your graphics program or Microsoft word by using the Print Screen or the PrtS key. To capture the whole screen, just hit the Print Screen (it might say Prt Sc) button on your keyboard. Then, open your imaging software (and a blank page, if you need to-it will depend on your software) and select your Paste command (usually Ctrl+V). This should paste an image of your computer screen into the document you're working on. 
Just press the PrtSc key, then open up Word or Wordpad, and click on Edit-Paste in the drop down menus. An exact Image of your PC screen is now in contained in the word (or Wordpad) document and can be saved, or emailed to someone else. Many people are not aware of the existence of the “PrtSc” key on every PC keyboard, or what it’s function is. In fact this is a very useful key. The “PrtSc” stands for PrintScreen and every time you press this key, an image of the current contents of your PC display is copied into an area called the Windows Clipboard
Best Answer: A screen shot is when you take a picture of what ever is on your computer monitor. For instance if you push the print screen button on your keyboard it will take a picture of your screen. Pretty darn simple. It's where your comp captures a picture of what is on your screen. To do it, hold the function (fn) button and click the button abbreviated as Prt Sc. Then, go into Microsoft Word and click paste.
One of the keys in my new Computer Keyboard has the letters “Prt Scr” on the top and “SysRq” on the bottom mentioned on it. What does that mean? Does that mean two different commands or one single command? How to use it? I can answer a portion of this question. prt scr allows you to take a snapshot of whatever is on your screen. You press that key, then open up any type of word document (i.e. MS Word, WordPerfect, or even WordPad in your Accessories folder). Then paste (usually ctrl-v) and you will see what was on the screen.
