Fertilization: Sperm Penetrates Egg. It takes about 24 hours for a sperm cell to fertilize an egg. When the sperm penetrates the egg, the surface of the egg changes so that no other sperm can enter. At the moment of fertilization, the baby's genetic makeup is complete, including whether it's a boy or girl.
It will then take approx. 36 hours for the ovaries to release the mature eggs. However the egg can only survive up to 24 hours without fertilization via sperm. Sperm can survive up to 5 days in body to search for the unfertilized egg.
It takes sperm approximately 36 hours to fertilize the egg after the male ejaculates in the vagina.
The Sperm's Long Journey. A man may ejaculate 40 million to150 million sperm, which start swimming upstream toward the fallopian tubes on their mission to fertilize an egg. Fast-swimming sperm can reach the egg in a half an hour, while others may take days. The sperm can live up to 48-72 hours. Only a few hundred will even come close to the egg, because of the many natural barriers that exist in a woman's body. It takes about 24 hours for a sperm cell to fertilize an egg. When the sperm penetrates the egg, the surface of the egg changes so that no other sperm can enter. At the moment of fertilization, the baby's genetic makeup is complete, including whether it's a boy or girl.
Best Answer: Sperm stays in your body for like 10 days. That means that it can get you pregnant up to ten days after you had sex. The other side of that coin is that a woman is only fertile for 3 days or so out of her cycle (which is why a man's sperm is designed to stay inside you for so long).
