Although traditionally composed of natural chalk, modern blackboard chalk is generally made from the mineral gypsum (calcium sulfate), often supplied in sticks of compressed powder about 10 cm (4 in) long. The most common forms are CaCO 3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing.
Chalk /ˈtʃɔːk/ is a soft, white, porous sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is calcium carbonate or CaCO 3. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. The most common forms are CaCO 3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing.
Calcium carbonate occurs as aragonite and calcite. The carbonate minerals form the rock types: limestone, chalk, marble, travertine, tufa, and others. Calcium carbonate has been found in some mines to be 99.2% pure. Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca C O 3. It is formed by three main elements: carbon, oxygen and calcium. It is a common substance found in rocks in all parts of the world, and is the main component of shells of marine organisms, snails, coal balls, pearls, and eggshells.
Limestone is the name for a rock that is primarily composed of the mineral calcite. Distinguishing between rock and mineral terms is important though, as a limestone rock may contain other minerals in addition to its calcite. As a consequence, calcite is not only the main mineral of limestone rocks and marble (metamorphosed limestone), but also a common accessory component of sandstone and siltstone rocks. Calcite forms cave decorations, hot spring travertine, and hydrothermal mineral deposits.
Split and merge into it. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Chalk is made of calicite, which is a form of limestone, limestone is a type of Sedimentary rock. sedimentary rock is made out of sediments which are the remains of broken down rocks, shells,and different things like that. Chalk is a sedimentary rock composed of the skeletal remains of tiny marine organisms and is composed mainly of the mineral calcite. As such, chalk is not a mineral.

In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. The most common forms are CaCO 3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing.
Summary Author: Rob Sheridan. Blackboard and sidewalk chalk were originally made from the sedimentary rock of the same name; a form of soft limestone. Chalk, composed principally of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), formed underwater by slow accumulation and compression of the calcite shells of single-celled coccolithophores. When this sedimentary rock is further compressed and metamorphosed, it may become limestone and then marble. Today, sidewalk and blackboard chalk are made from gypsum, as it’s more common and easier to work with than chalk. Gypsum, calcium sulfate (CaSO4), occurs in thick evaporite beds. These beds are commonly found in association with other evaporite minerals, particularly halite. As an evaporite mineral, it’s water-soluble
