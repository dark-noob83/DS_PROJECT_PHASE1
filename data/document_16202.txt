This science fair project was o to examine the pollution levels in different urban locales. Specially, what is the air quality of different parts of a city like? Samples of air were collected in a city park, a school, a market, a city bus station, the city hall, a hospital, a building top and in a home. Levels of carbon monoxide emission by aging cars. This science fair project was performed to compare the amounts of carbon monoxide gas released by cars of different ages. The tests were done by comparing the emission levels of a new car, a 5-year-old car, a 10-year-old car and a 20-year-old car.
How to Measure Air Pollution for a Science Fair Project. Pollution is one among the major problems of today’s world and air pollution is one root cause of many environmental issues. 1 You can use a magnifying glass for this purpose as the dust particles are too tiny to be seen with necked eye. 2  Count the number of dust particles carefully stuck to the Vaseline in each square and note them down on a note book. 3  Use the number of dust particles sticked to the squares as a proof of air pollution.
Harmful particles can come from pollutants in the air like dust, smog, soot, smoke, and other chemicals. Because of the importance of clean air to our health, most cities keep track of air pollution by issuing smog warnings on days when there is a high level of air pollution. Introduction. The air we breathe has a lot do do with our health. As we breathe in fresh air, our lungs absorb oxygen from the air and pass it into our blood stream so it can be transported throughout our bodies. Oxygen is important for our whole body to have the energy it needs to survive.
Conduct it in your science fair project and earn good grades. 1  Measure Air Pollution Air pollution can have some severe negative impacts on the life of living things. 2  Select this idea for your science fair project and let the people know how air pollution can affect your life. 1  Effect of Detergent on Plant Growth Detergents are combination of harsh chemicals that can affect the growth of plants. 2  Conduct this experiment in order to proof this fact. If you are a high school student, then the science fair project is your golden opportunity to put all your skills on the show that you learned throughout the school year. You have lot of variations available in the field of science. You can conduct science fair project on any of the numerous fields
Years and years of breathing particles of tar and smoke can cause the lung tissue to develop cancer, and can even cause death. Breathing clean air is important for keeping your lungs nice and healthy. Tiny particles of dust and soot in the air can enter your lungs when you breathe, and can block the movement of oxygen.

How to Change an Air Filter in a 1996 Audi A4. Science Project on the Effect of Temperature on the Evaporation of... How to Measure Humidity. Science Fair Project on How Air Temperature Affects the Bounce of a... Leave enough room to make a loop to hang the poster board, then tie a knot. Draw a medium-sized square in the middle of each of your poster board squares. They must be exactly the same size to make the experiment fair. Cover the inside of that medium square with petroleum jelly.
Step-By-Step Procedure. 1  1. Find an area in which you can hang several cut out pieces of the posterboard. 2  You can do this in your home if you’d like to find out how clean the air in your home is, or you can hang the cut out pieces of posterboard outside in your yard or another area. 3  2. 3. Draw a square with the marker on each cut out piece of posterboard, a little smaller than the square itself. 4. Punch a hole in the top of each piece of posterboard and tie pieces of string in the holes so you can hang the cut outs in various areas. 5.
Air pollution has become a big problem. Children will not understand the effects of air pollution unless they can physically see it. Measuring the air pollution in certain areas will help children recognize the amount of dirt and particles they are breathing into their lungs when they enter those areas. Leave enough room to make a loop to hang the poster board, then tie a knot. Draw a medium-sized square in the middle of each of your poster board squares. They must be exactly the same size to make the experiment fair. Cover the inside of that medium square with petroleum jelly.
All these toxic sources are a part of our air in the form of tiny and invisible particles. Air pollution can lead to some major health issue like, heart problems, breathing problems, lungs cancer etc. 1 You can use a magnifying glass for this purpose as the dust particles are too tiny to be seen with necked eye. 2  Count the number of dust particles carefully stuck to the Vaseline in each square and note them down on a note book. 3  Use the number of dust particles sticked to the squares as a proof of air pollution.
6. Choose Right Place for the Experiment. Now, you have to finalize an area where you can hand the pieces of the posterboard. You can choose the internal area of your home for this purpose in case if you really want o find out about the proportion of dust particles in the air of your house. 1 You can use a magnifying glass for this purpose as the dust particles are too tiny to be seen with necked eye. 2  Count the number of dust particles carefully stuck to the Vaseline in each square and note them down on a note book. 3  Use the number of dust particles sticked to the squares as a proof of air pollution.
