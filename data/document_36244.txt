Very generally, you would let them cook for 45 minutes to an hour at 350 degrees F. When checking chicken for doneness, insert a knife or fork in the thickest portion of the meat. If it is done, the juices will run out clear, if not, the juices will have a pinkish tinge and you should let them cook a little longer.

Baking the Chicken: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake the chicken, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink inside. You can bake the chicken legs in a 375°F. oven, if desired. Increase the baking time to 45 to 50 minutes. Tip: An accurate way to check chicken doneness is to insert an instant-read thermometer into the thigh, avoiding the bone. It should read 180°F when the chicken is done.
Cooking time is generally 20 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken registers 165°F in the thickest part. Amazingly, all the chicken pieces wind up cooking at about the same rate — dark meat pieces cook a bit slower than white meat, but the thickness of the breast meat means everything finishes around the same time.

RE: What temp and time to cook chicken thighs in oven? I usually put a little oil in aluminum foil and seasoning with chicken breasts, but because I am using things with bones, what tempature should I use and for how long?
Toss the chicken with the baking sauce. Spread the chicken in the baking dish. No need to grease the dish. Just lay the chicken inside. Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165°F. Boneless, skinless thighs cook quickly. Check after 20 minutes, and if they are not quite up to temperature, put back in the oven and continue cooking and checking the temperature in 5-minute increments
Directions. In a bowl, toss chicken thighs with olive oil and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper and marinate 1 hour (or up to a day). Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
