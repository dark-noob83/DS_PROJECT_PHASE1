Automobile associations warn of this issue. A Swiss Association regulating parking space wants to consider this issue for 2016. In the United Kingdom the recommended standard Parking bay size is 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) wide by 4.8 metres (16 ft) long. Recently there has been some controversy about most UK parking spaces being too small to fit modern cars, which have grown significantly since standards were set decades ago. Parallel parking spaces are typically cited as being approximately 2.76 metres (9.1 ft) wide by 6.1 metres (20 ft) long. During construction, the specific dimensions of a parking space are decided by a variety of factors. A high cost of land will encourage smaller dimensions and the introduction of compact spaces.
The Different Sizes of Parking Spaces. The average size of a parking space is 320 square feet or 30 square meters. However, there are also other sizes available, one of the most common of which is 270 square feet or 25 square meters. For perpendicular or angled parking spaces, the length is commonly 16 feet to 18 feet or 4.9 meters to 5.5 meters. Meanwhile, the standard width is 7.9 feet to 9 feet or 2.4 meters to 2.75 meters. Some other versions of this type of parking space measure between 7.5 feet and 10 feet or 2.3 meters and 3.2 meters. For parallel parking spaces, the standard width is 7.9 feet or 2.4 meters while the standard length is 20 feet or 6.1 meters. They are usually marked 6.9 feet to 7.9 feet or 2.1 meters to 2.4 meters wide
Other Parking Space Sizes. The length for angled or perpendicular types is 4.9 meters to 5.5 meters. This is 16 to 18 feet. The average width is 2.4 meters to 2.75 meters; this is equivalent to 7.9 feet to 9 feet. Variations on these figures range from 2.3 meters and 3.2 meters to 7.5 feet and 10 feet. The size of the area rests upon the purpose of the space. The bigger spaces are used if there is high retail customer / high turnover rate. Parking that is adjoining the curb is typically 20 ft (6.1 m) long and 9.1 ft (2.7 m) wide. The parallel spaces are usually marked 6.9 to 7.7 ft (2.1 to 2.34 m) wide.
Though, in the United States, a parking space 10 feet (3.0 m) deep is uncommon and most parking spaces will be within 16 to 20 feet (4.9â€“6.1 m), with 19 feet (5.8 m) feet deep being the standard DOT recommended depth for standard perpendicular parking. Parallel parking spaces are typically cited as being approximately 2.76 metres (9.1 ft) wide by 6.1 metres (20 ft) long. During construction, the specific dimensions of a parking space are decided by a variety of factors. A high cost of land will encourage smaller dimensions and the introduction of compact spaces.
For example, normal parking spaces in the city of Dallas, Texas are 8.5 feet (2.6 m) wide, while compact spaces are 7.5 feet (2.3 m) wide. Because the boundary between parking space and driving area is not always well-defined, the length of a parking space is more difficult to establish. Parallel parking spaces are typically cited as being approximately 2.76 metres (9.1 ft) wide by 6.1 metres (20 ft) long. During construction, the specific dimensions of a parking space are decided by a variety of factors. A high cost of land will encourage smaller dimensions and the introduction of compact spaces.
Parallel Parking. The standard width is 2.4 meters or 7.9 feet. The average length is 6.1 meters or 20 feet. These are typically marked 2.1 meters to 2.4 meters / 6.9 feet to 7.9 feet wide. The average length is 6.7 meters to 7.9 meters/ 22 feet to 26 feet. This is inclusive of the exit and entry maneuvering. The size of the area rests upon the purpose of the space. The bigger spaces are used if there is high retail customer / high turnover rate. Parking that is adjoining the curb is typically 20 ft (6.1 m) long and 9.1 ft (2.7 m) wide. The parallel spaces are usually marked 6.9 to 7.7 ft (2.1 to 2.34 m) wide.
The standard recommended size of a parking space is 8.5 feet wide.  However, parking spaces can be anywhere from 7.5 to 9 feet wide. 1 person found this useful. Edit. Confidence votes 69. Municipal and Federal parking regulations vary by locaiton and agency. From a review of Federal, state and local codes, the range of parking space widths varies from about 8.9 long wide to about 10.9 feet with apparent convergence around 9 feet long. Length appears to vary more, presumably explained by parallel parking requiring more length than head-in or angled parking
