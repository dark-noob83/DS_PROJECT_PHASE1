Sedimentation Rate (Sed Rate). Guide. The sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour. The more red cells that fall to the bottom of the test tube in one hour, the higher the sed rate.
A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the speed that the red blood cells (erythrocytes) in a tube of blood fall to the bottom of the tube, or sediment.
The sedimentation rate test measures inflammation in the body. It is also called the sed rate or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test. It is a blood test. It determines how quickly red blood cells sink in a tube of blood.
A high sed rate blood test indicates inflammation in the body. This is because during inflammation, some specific proteins make the red blood cells stick to each other and become heavier. This causes them to fall to the bottom of the tube, more quickly than is otherwise normal.
A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the red blood cells (erythrocytes) sedimenting in a tube over a given period of time.
The sed rate blood test is quite common and is used for detecting and monitoring inflammation inside the body. It collects red blood cells (erythrocytes) in a test tube, and then measures the sedimentation rate (sed rate) of this blood over a specific period of time.
