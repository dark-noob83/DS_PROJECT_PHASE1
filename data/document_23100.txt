We have developed a specific size cloth for customers to use whilst exhibiting or during conferences. The cloths are based on an average size trestle table which is 6ft long, 2ft 6 wide and 2ft 5 high. The fabric used is our 100% polyester, easy care fabric which has been brushed to create a cotton feel. This fabric offers excellent colour retention, anti-stain and anti-crease properties and superior durability. Please note you will need to check this as all trestle tables are not the same. We offer a standard exhibition/conference cloth which is not fitted, but sized at 328 x 178cm (129 x 70) which leaves approximately 11 overhang at the rear of the table.
This size of cloth will sit nicely on the table and will not fall off of its own accord. Table clips are available to hold the cloth securely in position if required. The 275cm x 178cm exhibition tablecloth is designed for 4ft and 5ft size trestle tables. On a 4ft trestle table this cloth will reach to the floor at the front and sides, with a 30cm overhang at the back. We offer 2 standard exhibition/conference cloths which are sized at 328cm x 178cm (129 x 70) for 6ft size trestle tables or 275cm x 178cm (108 x 70”) for 4ft/5ft size trestle tables.
