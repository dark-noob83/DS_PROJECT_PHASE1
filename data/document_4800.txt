Tone-wise, there is no difference between the texas specials in an american special and the SRV strat, the wood of the guitar and the setup will have its influence but they are the same pickups, trust me. The american specials sound really good.
The only dfferences I can tell between the American Standard and the Special as far as looks are the headstock and the tremolo. To my ears the American Special has a different tone all together. As someone else said, try to play them side by side. For me, the American Special was the one that came home with me.
2) Fender Standard Stratocasters, which are only made in Mexico (aka MIM). Fender Standard is the proper designation for a Mexican made 'Standard' Stratocaster. So American Standard = MIA, and Fender Standard = MIM.
I got the Highway One and the American Standard FSR (with Texas Specials). My Highway is exactly same as the Am.Special except for paint and pickups. But the FEEL is night and day difference. IÂ´m not saying the Specials arent good, they are indeed.
