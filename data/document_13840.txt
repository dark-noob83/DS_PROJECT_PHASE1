An AGA can't actually heat an entire house, as some believe -- that is confusion with the 'Rayburn' and 'Stanley' makes of stoves. It will, though, warm the kitchen, and some AGA Stove models do have a boiler inside so they also supply the hot water for your house. Traditionally, the stoves ran all the time, non-stop.

A two oven AGA model has a roasting / baking oven and a simmer oven. The three oven model adds another baking oven. A premium four oven model has an additional plate on top, for warming, as well as having a warming oven that the other models don't. AGA Stoves must be installed as they require a flue or a chimney. No extractor fan is needed, as cooking smells from the ovens go straight out that flue. As of 2010, you can purchase AGA Stoves that run on electricity, diesel, natural or propane gas; you can also get dual-fuel versions.
An AGA cooker can be a great addition to your home as ours was in 2001 when we first fitted a renovated AGA. Since then gas prices have increased dramatically making it far less of a benefit.
Balanced Flue-Natural Gas & LPG Only. A balanced flue can be used when an AGA is being sited on an external wall using 2 pipes; one to bring in fresh air supply to the burner and one to discharge products of combustion. Regulations apply to where a balanced flue can be situated.
