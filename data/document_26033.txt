Report Abuse. a life sentence varies depending on the country or the state on which you are referring to. Normally a life sentence is a 20-25 year imprisonment and in some cases you can apply for parole a few years before you have completed your sentence.

When a lifer is paroled, the parole persists for life, with the result that even a drunk and disorderly conviction can (often does) send the lifer back to the tank to finish his sentence.

A life sentence is a prison term that typically lasts for one's lifetime. However, an individual may be able to receive a sentence that could potentially allow them to be released at some point. For example, a judge may impose a sentence of 30 years to life with a chance for parole. This means that after the offender serves the first 30 years of the life sentence, the offender could possibly have the opportunity to get out of prison on parole to serve the remaining years of the sentence. 
Actually it depends on whether it is life or life without the possibility of parole. Life can be 25 years to life (they usually plea bargain to 15 to 20 years). Life without the possibility of parole is usually behind bars until the offender dies. There are two kinds of life sentence: with and without parole. When a lifer is paroled, the parole persists for life, with the result that even a drunk and disorderly conviction can (often does) send the lifer back to the tank to finish his sentence.
