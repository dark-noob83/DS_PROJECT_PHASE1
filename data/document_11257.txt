Blizzard always stands by their RNG, though. Its been seen, by various players, to be streaky and weird. Blizzard still stands by it. A glaring example would be how on one server a guild says they always get these same shaman drop items, that they don't need.
priest gets rocks =(. A thirsty Crow came upon a Pitcher which had once been full of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of the Pitcher he found that it was only half full, and that he could not reach far enough down to get at the remaining water.
Blizzard still swears by their own RNG, saying they won't do stuff like that pushing that other games might have. On the other hand, I believe that historically even they have said something like perhaps someone else should start the raid - which is a bit suspicious.
RNG. 103,158 pages on this wiki. RNG is a game term that is an acronym for random number generator. Random number generators (or, more correctly, pseudorandom number generators) are algorithms used in computing when an outcome needs to be as random as possible.
rng (i think, maybe it was rgn) - (RGN)Random Generated Name or a name chosen by the game's name generator and not the player. (RNG)Random Number Generator, or a command you type in game that will roll a number from 1 to a specified number.
RNG = Random number Generator. Our relationship is a love/hate thing. On one hand, it gave me the Baron's mount in one run. On the other, it ensures that I almost never get the items I want/need from high end raids and dungeons unless I run them an excess of 10+ times.
