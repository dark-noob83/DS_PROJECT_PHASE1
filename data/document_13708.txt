In general relativity, the gravitational field strength is called the strength of gravitoelectric field, and the torsion field corresponds to the gravitomagnetic field. In the weak gravitational field limit the specified quantities are included in the equations of gravitoelectromagnetism.
This reduces the strength to the gravitational force acting on a unit mass. There is another definition, where the field strength is found by space and time derivatives of the gravitational field potentials or by the components of the gravitational tensor.
The gravitational field strength (g) at any point in a gravitational field is the gravitational force per unit mass exerted on any body placed at that point. 1  SI unit of gravitational field strength is newton per kilogram.
The strength of a gravitational field is defined as the force, F, acting on a unit mass, m, in the field which in an equation is: Symbol: g. Units: newtons per kilogram, Nkg -1, which is the same as ms -2. Uniform field.
The gravitational field strength in the international system of units is measured in meters per second squared [m/s 2 ] or in Newtons per kilogram [N/kg].
We have already met gravitational fields, where the gravitational field strength of a planet multiplied by an objects mass gives us the weight of that object, and that the gravitational field strength, of Earth is equal to the acceleration of free fall at its surface, .
Gravitational field strength. Weight is the result of gravity. The gravitational field strength of the Earth is 10 N/kg (ten newtons per kilogram). This means an object with a mass of 1kg would be attracted towards the centre of the Earth by a force of 10N. We feel forces like this as weight.
Report Abuse. My sch defines gravitational field strength as follows: The gravitational field strength, g, at a point is defined as the gravitational force per unit mass at that point acting on a small test mass placed at that point in the g field.
