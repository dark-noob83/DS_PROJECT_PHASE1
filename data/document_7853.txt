Copper and tin mainly make up bronze but other elements include phosphorus, manganese, silicon and aluminium. Copper and tin are the main two elements that make the alloy Bronze. Traces of other materials are often alloyed too.
Bronze is one of the earliest metals known to man. Here is a look at the chemical composition and properties of bronze. Answer: Bronze is an alloy made of copper and another metal, usually tin. Compositions vary, but most modern bronze is 88% copper and 12% tin.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Copper and tin mainly make up bronze but other elements include phosphorus, manganese, silicon and aluminium. Copper and tin are the main two elements that make the alloy Bronze. Traces of other materials are often alloyed too.
Bronze is usually made up of copper (about 90%) and tin (about 10%). Brass is usually made up of copper and zinc. Some alloys are called bronze when they are actually brass, such as commercial bronze which is made from copper and zinc. Other metals may also be added, but if the main addition is tin, it's a bronze, and if the main addition is zinc, it's a brass.
Bronzesmiths make bronze by melting two different metals and mixing them. The two metals are copper and tin. Copper, by itself, is too soft to make tools of.
