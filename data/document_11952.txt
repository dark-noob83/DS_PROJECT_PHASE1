1 Let’s pretend you calculated that you need to eat 2000 calories per day to lose weight or build muscle or whatever your goal is. 2  Next let’s pretend you figured out that you need to eat 150 grams of protein per day. 1 Now they’d just subtract 1100 from their 2000 total and get 900 calories. 2  Since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, this example person can see that they should eat 225 grams of carbs per day.
1 So that’s 600 from protein plus 500 from fat which gives this person 1100 calories accounted for so far. 2  Now they’d just subtract 1100 from their 2000 total and get 900 calories. 3  Since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, this example person can see that they should eat 225 grams of carbs per day. 1 Now they’d just subtract 1100 from their 2000 total and get 900 calories. 2
