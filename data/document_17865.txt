Such variables include the region it will be aired (some areas are more expensive than others); time of day; day of week; quantity of viewers; length of the commercial (15 sec, 30 sec, 60 sec or a 30 min infomercial); and how frequently the ads will run. (Having said that, the least expensive options may not be the best opportunities, either). Overall, the cost of producing a commercial can run from as little as $1,000 and upwards to hundreds of thousands of dollars. A more practical average could be from $3000 to $25,000.
The first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on July 1, 1941 over New York station WNBT (now WNBC) before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Over the course of 10 hours, American viewers will be shown approximately three hours of advertisements, twice what they would have seen in the 1960s. If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements.
So 12 x 30 = 360. Each frame takes time to draw, let alone the characters. So it would depend on how long it takes to draw a character and how long you would spend on the background. But really, there are too many variables to actually state how long it takes for a thirty second animation to be made. 3 Miles in 19.5 minutes (19 minutes 30 seconds) is 1 mile in 6.5 minutes (6 minutes 30 seconds). (19.5 ÷ 3 = 6.5)   That is based on her average speed. It is safe to as … sume that she can run one mile or just even the first of 3 miles in less time, probably around 6 minutes.
You can time yourself and see how long it takes you to animate each frame, but if you run on a very rough estimate about 5-10 seconds a frame: 720*5=3600, 3600/60=60; 720*10=7200, 7200/60=120. So if it takes you 5-10 seconds to shoot a frame, that'll be about one to two hours of animating. 3 Miles in 19.5 minutes (19 minutes 30 seconds) is 1 mile in 6.5 minutes (6 minutes 30 seconds). (19.5 ÷ 3 = 6.5)   That is based on her average speed. It is safe to as … sume that she can run one mile or just even the first of 3 miles in less time, probably around 6 minutes.
The main surprise is how inexpensive TV advertising can be. (Having said that, the least expensive options may not be the best opportunities, either). Overall, the cost of producing a commercial can run from as little as $1,000 and upwards to hundreds of thousands of dollars. A more practical average could be from $3000 to $25,000. Following are some fundamentals about TV advertising costs
A television advertisement (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in American English, and known in British English as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Over the course of 10 hours, American viewers will be shown approximately three hours of advertisements, twice what they would have seen in the 1960s. If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements.
But what I do know is that commercials come in a variety of lengths. When I was young pretty much all commercials were a consistent 60 seconds long. Which seems so short. But somewhere around the late 80's they started making 30 second and then even shorter ones. but I think most commercials are 30 seconds long now. But often a network when advertising their own shows at the end of a commercial break those are usually about 15 seconds long.

That's an average of $150,000 per second. Commercials in the first Super Bowl in 1967 cost $42,000. So for the price of one second worth of air time now, you could have purchased three full slots then. Last year, 30 seconds in the game ran $4 million. The $500,000 price hike this season is the largest year-to-year increase in the history of the Super Bowl
Example: Commercial is made for the Internet, and 6 months into the negotiated 1 year maximum period of use, Producer wishes to air the commercial on broadcast television. Original payment for Internet use was 350% of session. Producer contacts performer’s agent for consent, and bargains for use. 1 A commercial moved over to the Internet and used in a 1-year use cycle is paid at 400% of the session. 2  Now, if it’s made only for the Internet, then an 8-week use cycle is 133% of session and a 1-year use cycle is 350% of scale.
