The perimeter of a two-dimensional shape is the total distance around the shape, or the sum of the length of its sides. By definition, a square is a four-sided shape with four straight sides of equal length, and four right (90Â°) angles. Determine the length of one side, and multiply it by 4 to find the perimeter. Depending on the assignment, you may need to measure the side with a ruler, or look at other information on the page to determine the side length.
Multiply the side length by 4 to find the perimeter. Take the side length s you just calculated and plug it into the perimeter formula, P = 4s. The result will be the perimeter of your square! 1  For the square with area 20 and side length 4.472, the perimeter P = 4 * 4.472, or 17.888. Determine the length of one side, and multiply it by 4 to find the perimeter. Depending on the assignment, you may need to measure the side with a ruler, or look at other information on the page to determine the side length.
Perimeter of shapes. The perimeter of a figure is the distance around the outside of the figure. This is true whether the figure is a familiar figure like a rectangle or triangle, or if it is a complex figure like the floorplan of a house. To find the perimeter of this figure, you need to add the lengths of all 6 sides. Perimeter = 5 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 16 unit
Instructions. Determine the perimeter of a triangle or rectangle by knowing the length of all of the sides of the figure and then adding these numbers together. The perimeter is the sum of all sides of a figure to get one length. So, to find the perimeter, the formula is base + height + base + height. If the base is 10 inches and the height is 5 inches, you would have: Perimeter: 10 + 5 + 10 + 5 = 30 inches. Determine the area of a rectangle by using multiplication.
Add up the lengths of the three side lengths to find the perimeter. Recall that the perimeter P = a + b + c. Now that you know the lengths of sides a, b and c, you simply need to add the lengths together to find the perimeter. 1  In our first example, P = 3 + 4 + 5, or 12. 6. Add up the lengths of the three side lengths to find the perimeter. Recall that the perimeter P = a + b + c. Now that you know the lengths of sides a, b and c, you simply need to add the lengths together to find the perimeter. 1  In our first example, P = 3 + 4 + 5, or 12. 2  In our second example, P = 6 + 8 + 10, or 24.
For a square of side length S, the perimeter is simply four times the side length: P=4s. Ad. 2. Determine the length of one side, and multiply it by 4 to find the perimeter. Depending on the assignment, you may need to measure the side with a ruler, or look at other information on the page to determine the side length.
The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. A rectangle has four sides with opposite sides being congruent. The formula for finding the perimeter is Side A + Side B + Side A + Side B. This could also be stated as 2*Side A + 2*Side B or 2*(Side A + Side B). Return to Top. 
This will help you work out the amount of material you require. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is P = 2(l + b), where l = length and b = breadth. The perimeter (P) of a square is P = 4s, where s = length of the sides. The perimeter (P) of a triangle is P = a + b + c, where a = length of one side, b = length of another side, c = length of the third side.
