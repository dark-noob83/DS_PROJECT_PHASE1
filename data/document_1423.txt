Design Controls designates the application of a formal methodology to the conduct of product development activities. It is often mandatory (by regulation) to implement such practice when designing and developing products within regulated industries (e.g. Medical devices).
Industrial control systems are used in industrial production for controlling equipment or machines. There are two common classes of control systems, open loop control systems and closed loop control systems. In open loop control systems output is generated based on inputs. In closed loop control systems current output is taken into consideration and corrections are made based on feedback. A closed loop system is also called a feedback control system. The human body is a classic example of feedback systems.
Once you have the information on how well the system is performing, you have to do something with that information. The problem the control system designer faces is to determine how to use the information available to develop and apply a control signal that will make the system do what he or she wants it to do. At this point in these lessons that what you are just starting to learn.
A control system is a device, or set of devices, that manages, commands, directs or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems.
What is clear is that if you want to control a system, you need to know what you want it to do, and you need to know how well it is doing. That implies a couple of things. First, you need to know what you want the system to do. There are lots of ways you can do that.
The design control requirements of Section 820.30 of the regulation apply to the design of Class II and III medical devices, and a select group of Class I devices. The regulation is very flexible in the area of design controls.
