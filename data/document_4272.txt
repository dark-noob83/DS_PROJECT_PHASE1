One of insulinâ€™s most important jobs is to help cells use glucose. Insulin acts like a key to unlock the door that lets glucose into the cell. Cells in the body use glucose as a source of energy that they need to live. Without energy, the cells in the body cannot survive.
Insulin and glucagon work synergistically to keep blood glucose concentrations normal. Insulin: An elevated blood glucose concentration results in the secretion of insulin: glucose is transported into body cells. The uptake of glucose by liver, kidney and brain cells is by diffusion and does not require insulin. Click on the thumbnail for details of the effect
Insulin is a hormone produced and secreted by the pancreas or administered by injection, that is necessary for glucose (in the blood) to be transported into cells where it is converted into energy. The only tissues that do not require insulin to transport glucose into cells are the brain and heart.
This means they respond to the presence of insulin and begin to take glucose into cells. Other GLUT proteins such as GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 do not require insulin to operate-they maintain glucose blood levels at a basal (lowest possible without causing problems) rate.
