Posted over 3 years ago. I just wanted to put up a quick post too see where everyone stands as far as how long their hiring process took. I know a lot of departments say 4-6 months, because that is what mine was. But, due to budget cuts and other factors, it took me exactly 18 months. It was a 6 month long job interview. We were being watched by how we shined our boots to how we spoke to our instructors and how we pressed the creases into our uniforms. Attention to detail was the key. Towards the end of BLET I was approached by the agency and the hiring process thereafter went smoothly.
Report Abuse. Well, it took them about 3 months to get back me. it all varies upon the amount of people who are applying for the position. Usually they will call you in for a interview. Then its another long process after that. I say a good 1 1/2 to 2 months after the initial interview
The length of the hiring process varies. Typically it takes 6 weeks to fill a position; however, it can take longer due to a variety of factors. The hiring process normally takes 3 - 5 months to complete. However, this time period can be shorter or longer, depending on the amount of openings and the experience level of an applicant. more. jcks.com. /publicsafety/.../JCPDHiringProcess...
That being said, a typical time-to-fill goal for a position is 45 days from the time the job is posted to when the selected candidate starts on the job. This typically means 2-3 weeks to review candidates, 2 weeks to interview, and another 2 weeks for the selected candidate to give notice and start. Of course, this can vary, but this is a goal that most recruiting organizations target. From start to finish, I’ve seen candidates apply, go through a phone screen, have several rounds of interviews, and be issued an offer within as little as one week’s time. In other situations, I have seen candidates move through the process much more slowly.

all this might take about 10-12 days, and then the company sends an offer letter and its upto the candidate then to accept it and join.. though i have also seen companies that they go at their own pace.. still in IT recruitment process won't take more than 4-5 weeks. It actually depends on the company, the business company does and the urgenncy of the job position to be filled. And of course how propmtly a candidate responds for scheduling interviews etc and later when job offer is given.
I'm asking because I applied at one company a week ago, and they emailed me yesterday for an interview next Wed, but a couple of days ago I found an ad for another job that is only like 2 miles away from my house with an oil... show more let's say from posting position open for hire to interviews to hiring someone. It actually depends on the company, the business company does and the urgenncy of the job position to be filled. And of course how propmtly a candidate responds for scheduling interviews etc and later when job offer is given.
I'm asking because I applied at one company a week ago, and they emailed me yesterday for an interview next Wed, but a couple of days ago I found an ad for another job that is only like 2 miles away from my house with an oil company that would be perfect (they're both for a clerical job).
