anthrax. Infection by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which in humans is caused by contact with infected animals or animal products, and ingestion or inhalation of spores of the bacterium. Worldwide concern is focused on the potential use of anthrax as a bioterrorist weapon, in particular as an inhalational agent.
Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis.
1 Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent of anthrax, is a large, gram-positive, non-motile, spore-forming bacterial rod. 2  The three virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis are edema toxin, lethal toxin, and a capsular antigen. 3  Human anthrax has three major clinical forms: cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal.
What is Bacillus anthracis? 1  Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent of anthrax, is a large, gram-positive, non-motile, spore-forming bacterial rod. 2  Bacillus anthracis spores do not have a characteristic appearance such as color, smell, or taste.
It is not intended for diagnosis. Anthrax Also Known As: Woolsorter's disease Woolsorter's pneumonia Ragsorter's disease Description. Anthrax is caused by the gram-positive, aerobic spore-forming bacteria, Bacillus anthracis.
Anthrax. Anthrax is the disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which lives in soil. The bacterial cell lives as a hardy spore to survive harsh conditions. The spores germinate into thriving colonies of bacteria once inside an animal or person.
[ edit intro ]. Bacillus anthracis is the pathogen that causes anthrax Originally known as an important animal pathogen, it was the first bacterium to be used for the preparation of a vaccine based on attenuated bacteria by Louis Pasteur in 1881.
