Genetic Mutations The genes encoded in your DNA result in the production of proteins that perform These changes,called mutations, can lead to alterations in the structure and. POGIL Activities for AP* Biology. 4.codons, and amino acids in your answer.
If DNA replication did not occur, then when the cell divides the amount of DNA available would be divided. Half going into the knew cell the other half remaining in the parent … cell. Each cell would then contain only half the number of chromosomes that it should have and would die fairly quickly.
The answer to this question is simple. A mutation would occur. Believe it or not, mutations occur in your body all the time. Even so, most mutations are harmless, because 97% … of DNA is absolutely useless, and does nothing in your body.
All cells have DNA errors due to the mistakes that occur each time DNA is replicated prior to cell division. There are proofreading enzymes in cells that correct many of these mistakes, but on average, 3 – 5 errors are found in DNA after each replication. a.
Mutations and New Genetic Information. If new genetic information—required to build eyes where there are none, for example—does not occur in nature, then evolution is stuck in the water. For evolutionists, the solution comes in the form of mutations. The problem is that the only beneficial mutations ever observed do not add new information to the genome.
