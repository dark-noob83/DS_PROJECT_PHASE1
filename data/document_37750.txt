CRISP began with a one day stand-down between March 12, 2012 and March 23, 2012, to ensure 100 percent compliance among the Department's 334,000 employees with mandatory security and privacy awareness training. Each VA staff office was responsible for scheduling the stand-down for its workers.

Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, commonly known by its acronym CRISP-DM, was a data mining process model that describes commonly used approaches that data mining experts use to tackle problems. The first version of the methodology was presented at the 4th CRISP-DM SIG Workshop in Brussels in March 1999, and published as a step-by-step data mining guide later that year. Between 2006 and 2008 a CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG was formed and there were discussions about updating the CRISP-DM process model.

The CRISP Portal is a free tool available to clinical staff. For example, if you are a primary care provider and your patient was admitted to a participating hospital, you could use the portal to look up his/her radiology report and discharge summary. All 46 acute care hospitals in Maryland and 6 acute care hospitals in DC have agreed to work with CRISP. To see which of these hospitals are currently providing clinical information, please click here. CRISP is also receiving data from all major lab and radiology centers.
CRISP-DM stands for cross-industry process for data mining. The CRISP-DM methodology provides a structured approach to planning a data mining project. It is a robust and well-proven methodology. We do not claim any ownership over it. The CRISP-DM model is shown below.

A consumer can also appoint someone to make health care decisions should they be unable to do so. CRISP has partnered with MyDirectives.com to allow consumers in Maryland to create an electronic advance directive. Once completed, practitioners using CRISP will have access to your electronic advance directive. To get started creating your electronic advance directive, go to: https://mydirectives.com
However, 3-4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. A review and critique of data mining process models in 2009 called the CRISP-DM the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects.. The first version of the methodology was presented at the 4th CRISP-DM SIG Workshop in Brussels in March 1999, and published as a step-by-step data mining guide later that year. Between 2006 and 2008 a CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG was formed and there were discussions about updating the CRISP-DM process model.
