Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is the sensory impression of food or other substances on the tongue and is one of the five traditional senses. Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds.

Taste is the ability to respond to dissolved molecules and ions called tastants. Humans detect taste with taste receptor cells. These are clustered in taste buds and scattered in other areas of the body. Each taste bud has a pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. 1  salty. 2  sour. 3  sweet. 4  bitter.
Figure 1: Receptors that detect infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbes by binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Abbreviations: lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), lipoproteins (LP), glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI). Linear chains of amino acids form proteins, and protein diversity arises from different amino acid combinations. Just as the twenty-six letters of the alphabet create a wide variety of words when combined, the twenty different amino acids create a variety of proteins when combined.
A taste receptor is a type of receptor which facilitates the sensation of taste. When food or other substances enter the mouth, molecules interact with saliva and are bound to taste receptors in the oral cavity and other locations. Molecules which give a sensation of taste are considered sapid. Taste receptors are divided into two families: The TAS1R2 + TAS1R3 heterodimer receptor functions as the sweet receptor by binding to a wide variety of sugars and sugar substitutes. TAS1R2+3 expressing cells are found in circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae near the back of the tongue and palate taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth.
The result is the tertiary structure or conformation of the protein, and it serves a unique, particular function. A receptor has a three-dimensional shape that enables it to bind with another molecule called a ligand (which might be a hormone, a neurotransmitter, etc.). Linear chains of amino acids form proteins, and protein diversity arises from different amino acid combinations. Just as the twenty-six letters of the alphabet create a wide variety of words when combined, the twenty different amino acids create a variety of proteins when combined.
Sour receptors detect the protons (H +) liberated by sour substances (acids). This closes transmembrane K + channels which leads to depolarization of the cell [ Link ], and the release of the neurotransmitter serotonin into its synapse with a sensory neuron. Humans detect taste with taste receptor cells. These are clustered in taste buds and scattered in other areas of the body. Each taste bud has a pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. 1  salty. 2  sour. 3  sweet. 4  bitter.
A small number of Toll-like receptors can detect a broad range of human pathogens, as well as a variety of other molecules that indicate tissue damage, by a process called pattern recognition. Linear chains of amino acids form proteins, and protein diversity arises from different amino acid combinations. Just as the twenty-six letters of the alphabet create a wide variety of words when combined, the twenty different amino acids create a variety of proteins when combined.
