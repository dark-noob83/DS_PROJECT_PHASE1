The broaching process. Tooling is the heart of any broaching process. The broaching tool is based on a concept unique to the process-- rough, semi-finish and finish cutting teeth combined in one tool or string of tools. A broach tool frequently can finish machine a rough surface in a single stroke.
The broaching process, similar to shaping with multiple teeth, is used to machine internal and external surfaces such as holes of circular, square, or irregular shapes, keyways and teeth of internal gears. A broach is a long multi-tooth cutting tool with successively deeper cuts.
Broaching is a machining method in which a series of cutting teeth each remove a portion of stock as the cutting tool (broach) moves past or through the work piece. Combining both roughing and finishing in one operation Broaching removes stock to precise tolerance faster than any other known metal cutting process.
Broaching is one of the most precise and productive process in the metalworking area and despite the high costs of broachs, its largelly applied in the automobiles industry. This article is the part 1 of the Broaching series, in a total of 3 articles.
Rotary Broaching Defined. Rotary broaching, also known as wobble broaching, is an exclusive, fast, amazing and accurate method of producing internal and external polygon forms on the end of a workpiece. The Rotary Broach Tool Holder can be used on any CNC, Swiss, milling, screw or other turning machine.
