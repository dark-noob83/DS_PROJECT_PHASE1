You might have been told that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit) but the boiling point of water actually depends on the oxygen content and atmospheric pressure. The higher the altitude, the lower the temperature at which water boils.
The Celsius scale was  originally defined around the boiling and freezing points of water.   100 degrees Celsius at 1 atm pressure.    At sea level (101.325 kPa of atmospheric pressure) pure water boils  at 100 deg. C   The boiling point of water is 99.97 degrees Celsius, or 211.946  degrees Fahrenheit.

2nd answer: Water boils at 212 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale, which is 100 degrees on the Celsius scale, but only at sea level at a specific air pressure. If you boil water, say, half-way up Mount Everest, the boiling point temperature is so low that it is very difficult to cook food.

The boiling point of water is 100°C or 212° F at 1 atmosphere of pressure (sea level), but water boils at a lower temperature as you gain altitude (e.g., on a mountain) and boils at a higher temperature if you increase atmospheric pressure (lived below sea level).
100°C, 212°F or 373.15 Kelvin Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 373.15 Kelvin under standard conditions at sea level (at one atmosphere of pressure). The boiling point of water and any other substance depends on the atmospheric pressure, which changes with elevation.
Celsius is a measurement of temperature in which 0 degrees represents the freezing point of water, and 100 degrees represents water’s boiling point at the standard atmosphere, which is the mean barometric pressure at the mean sea level. This temperature scale was developed by Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius in 1742.
