The largest recorded temperature change in one place over a 24-hour period occurred on January 15, 1972 in Loma, Montana, when the temperature rose from −54 to 49 °F (−47.8 to 9.4 °C). The most dramatic temperature changes occur in North American climates susceptible to Chinook winds. Among the U.S. states, Hawaii has both the lowest state maximum of 100 °F (37.8 °C) and the highest state minimum of 12.0 °F (−11.1 °C). Indeed, tropical ocean island locations such as Hawaii often have the lowest recorded temperature ranges, sometimes with a difference of as little as 62 °F (34.4 °C).
For the United States, the extremes are 134 °F (56.7 °C) in Death Valley, California in 1913 and −79.8 °F (−62.1 °C) recorded in Prospect Creek, Alaska in 1971. Among the U.S. states, Hawaii has both the lowest state maximum of 100 °F (37.8 °C) and the highest state minimum of 12.0 °F (−11.1 °C). Indeed, tropical ocean island locations such as Hawaii often have the lowest recorded temperature ranges, sometimes with a difference of as little as 62 °F (34.4 °C).
The lowest ever recorded in the conterminous 48 states, -69.7°F, occurred at Rogers Pass, in Lewis and Clark County, Mont., on Jan. 20, 1954. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the U.S. was -80°F / -62°C on January 23, 1971 in Prospect Creek, Alaska. Contiguous states: Rogers Pass, Montana, January 20th, 1954. -27.2 degrees C, is the coldest recorded temperature in the UK. It was recorded in Scotland. 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982 Braemar (Aberdeenshire) also 30 Dec … ember 1995 Altnaharra (Highland).
Lowest Temperatures. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the United States was -80 degrees Fahrenheit (-62 degrees Celsius) on January 23, 1971 at Prospect Creek Camp, located near the Arctic Circle along the Alaska pipeline. The lower 48 states of the US hit their official coldest temperature of -70 °F on January 20, 1954 at Rogers Pass, Montana. The pass sits at 5,470 feet (1,667 metres) elevation in the Rocky Mountains, northwest of Helena.
In the United States, the lowest temperature on record,–79.8°F, was recorded on January 23, 1971, at Prospect Creek Camp, which is located in the Endicott Mountains of Northern Alaska at latitude 66° 48′N, longitude 150° 40′W. Greenland Ranch, California, with 134°F on July 10, 1913, holds the record for the highest temperature ever officially recorded in the United States.
As for the USA's coldest mark on record, it's -80 degrees, set in Prospect Creek, Alaska, on Jan. 23, 1971, according to Christopher Burt, weather historian for the Weather Underground. Excluding Alaska, the lowest temperature was the -70-degree temperature recorded in Rogers Pass, Mont., in January 1954. 
The coldest temperature ever recorded east of the Mississippi River was -60°F in Tower, Minn., on Feb. 2, 1996. Hawaii is the only state that's never recorded a below-zero temperature. Many are surprised at Hawaii's 12°F reading. State by state low temperature records. Each state's low temperature record. As you would expect, the coldest temperature ever officially recorded in the USA was in Alaska. It was -79.8°F-rounded off to -80°F-observed at Prospect Creek Camp in the Endicott Mountains of northern Alaska on Jan. 23, 1971.
