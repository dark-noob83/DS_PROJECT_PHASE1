Early-onset Alzheimer's is an uncommon form of dementia that strikes people younger than age 65. Glenn E. Smith, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., answers questions about this condition.arly-onset Alzheimer's: When symptoms begin before age 65. When Alzheimer's begins in middle age, misdiagnosis may be more likely. This rare form of Alzheimer's affects work, finances and family.

Of all the people who have Alzheimer's disease, about 5 percent develop symptoms before age 65. So if 4 million Americans have Alzheimer's, at least 200,000 people have the early-onset form of the disease. Early-onset Alzheimer's has been known to develop between ages 30 and 40, but that's very uncommon.arly-onset Alzheimer's: When symptoms begin before age 65.

1 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in people over age 65 with cause possibly related to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 2  Almost all brain functions, including memory, movement, language, judgment, behavior, and abstract thinking, are eventually affected. 1 Huntington's disease is a heredity disorder caused by a faulty gene. 2  Children of those with the disorder have a 50% chance of getting the disease. 3  Symptoms begin in those 30 to 40 years of age, beginning with personality changes such as anxiety and depression.
Some people with early-onset Alzheimer's have the common form of the disease, and experts don't know why these people get the disease at a younger age than others do. For most, however, early-onset Alzheimer's runs in the family.arly-onset Alzheimer's: When symptoms begin before age 65. When Alzheimer's begins in middle age, misdiagnosis may be more likely.

1 Alzheimer’s disease —Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in people over 65, although the disease also occurs in people much younger. 2  Alzheimer’s affects approximately 50 percent of those over 85.3  Presently, researchers cannot definitely say what causes the disease, and there is no cure.
Causes of dementia depend on the age when symptoms begin. In the elderly population (usually defined in this context as over 65 years of age), a large majority of dementia cases are caused by Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or both.bout 3% of people between the ages of 65–74 have dementia, 19% between 75 and 84 and nearly half of those over 85 years of age. In 2013 dementia resulted in about 1.7 million deaths up from 0.8 million in 1990. As more people are living longer, dementia is becoming more common in the population as a whole.
One out of every 10 persons 65 years and older is a victim of Alzheimer's disease, although early-onset victims may be in their 40s and 50s. Approximately 20 percent of Americans between the ages of 75 and 84, and almost half of those 85 years and older suffer from Alzheimer's disease.eople over the age of 65 are most frequently affected. The incidence of Alzheimer’s disease increases with age and by the age of 85 years nearly half of all people are affected by the disease.
Alzheimer's is not just a disease of old age. Younger-onset (also known as early-onset) Alzheimer's affects people younger than age 65. Up to 5 percent of the more than 5 million Americans with Alzheimer’s have younger-onset. People who have early onset Alzheimer's may be in any stage of dementia – early stage, middle stage or late stage. The disease affects each person differently and symptoms will vary.
