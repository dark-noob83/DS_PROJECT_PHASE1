The pituitary glands are made of the anterior lobe and posterior lobe. The anterior lobe produces and releases hormones. The posterior lobe does not produce hormones per se—this is done by nerve cells in the hypothalamus—but it does release them into the circulation. Hormones of the Pituitary Gland.
Pituitary Gland Attached to the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland is a pea-sized, reddish-gray body that stores hormones from the hypothalamus and releases them into the bloodstream. The pituitary consists of an anterior lobe and a posterior lobe, each of which have distinct functions.
Overview of Hypothalamic and Pituitary Hormones. The pituitary gland is often portrayed as the master gland of the body. Such praise is justified in the sense that the anterior and posterior pituitary secrete a battery of hormones that collectively influence all cells and affect virtually all physiologic processes. The pituitary gland may be king, but the power behind the throne is clearly the hypothalamus. As alluded to in the last section, some of the neurons within the hypothalamus-neurosecretory neurons-secrete hormones that strictly control secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary.
The posterior pituitary is, in effect, a projection of the hypothalamus. It does not produce its own hormones, but only stores and releases the hormones created by the hypothalamus, whereas the anterior pituitary produces and secretes its own hormones.
Although the hypothalamus does not produce the hormones of the anterior pituitary as in the posterior pituitary, it plays an important role in their production. Releasing hormones synthesized by hypothalamic neurons travel down axons and diffuse into the primary plexus of the hypophyseal portal system.
