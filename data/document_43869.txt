Greater Omentum-This consists of a double layer of avascular peritoneum which connects to the stomach. Web-like structure; lift out of the way to expose other organs. It contains a large quantity of fat deposits and lies upon the abdominal organs.
The stomach has five layers, starting with the innermost mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, sub serosa and serosa being the outermost layer of the stomach. The serous membrane is what forms the peritoneum membrane of the abdominal cavity. The parietal peritoneum has an extended fold of large size which hangs from it.
The peritoneum is a membrane made up of two layers. One layer lines the cavity and the other layer lines the organs. The peritoneum helps support the organs in the abdominal cavity and also allows nerves, blood vessels, and lymph vessels to pass through to
The greater and lesser omentums: The omentum is a fatty apron that hangs over the intestines and helps to cushion them. The greater omentum and the lesser omentum are also composed of double layers of peritoneum.
The greater omentum of man was found to possess a connective tissue framework with blood and lymphatic vessels and was also found to be embedded in adipose tissue. The latter is made up of fatty organs differentiated in size. Round to oval organs are formed by fat cells.
The omentum is a membranous double layer of fatty tissue that covers and supports the intestines and organs in the lower abdominal area. The omentum is made up of the greater omentum which is an important storage for fat deposits and the lesser omentum which connects the stomach and intestines to the liver. Milky spots on the greater omentum contain white blood cells that assist immunity by removing cellular debris.
