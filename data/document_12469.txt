At $0.10 per kWh, this gives a yearly savings of $100. This is where more energy efficient appliances and air conditioning come in, as well as solar adaptation by awnings, tinted or upgraded windows and use of fans to lessen the cooling needs of the house. Taking a prototypical 25 miles per gallon (mpg) car average at 15,000 miles a year requires 600 gallons of gas, which in energy is equivalent to 23,400 kWh, although it will generate more equivalent natural gas greenhouse gases by a ratio of 1.40, leading to an equivalent GHG generation of natural gas of 33,000 kWh.
Perhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates. In China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access. The variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh.
Saving 2/3 of this cuts out 200*(2/3)*30=4000 kWh. This cuts the 12,000 kWh down to 8,000 kWh equivalent for gas. At the rate of $1.20 per therm over baseline, the 200 therms saved results in a $240 savings per year. Taking a prototypical 25 miles per gallon (mpg) car average at 15,000 miles a year requires 600 gallons of gas, which in energy is equivalent to 23,400 kWh, although it will generate more equivalent natural gas greenhouse gases by a ratio of 1.40, leading to an equivalent GHG generation of natural gas of 33,000 kWh.
In the US typical household power consumption is about 11,700 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access. The variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh.
The average electricity consumption is 4,800 kWh per household [36]. A smaller than average household is taken arbitrarily to be 3,000 kWh (i.e. roughly two-thirds of the average), and a larger than average household to be 7,000 kWh (i.e. roughly 50% more). A smaller than average household is taken arbitrarily to be 12,000 kWh (two-thirds of the average gas meter), and a larger than average household to be 27,000 kWh (50% more). Mark Linas [6] makes the following suggestions: small house: 10,000 kWh; medium house: 20,500 kWh; and mansion: 28,000kWh.
Domestic energy consumption or domestic consumption of energy is the amount of energy that is spent on the various appliances used within housing. The amount of energy used per household varies widely depending on the standard of living of the country, climate, and the age and type of residence. In the United States as of 2008, in an average household in a temperate climate, the yearly use of household energy can be composed as follows:
How much electricity does an American home use? In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. 
Household electricity use: 6,000 kWh per household per year for 3 residents average per household. So the household use per capita is 2,000 kWh or about of per capita electricity from all applications. Household Natural Gas use: 400 therms per household x 30 give 12,000 kWh equivalent electricity. Since much of the electricity is generated by natural gas, it is not totally unreasonable to compare these two in kilowatt hours. Taking a prototypical 25 miles per gallon (mpg) car average at 15,000 miles a year requires 600 gallons of gas, which in energy is equivalent to 23,400 kWh, although it will generate more equivalent natural gas greenhouse gases by a ratio of 1.40, leading to an equivalent GHG generation of natural gas of 33,000 kWh.
The energy contained in gas is measured in kilowatt-hours (abbreviated to kWh) and for natural gas is 11.2 kWh per cubic metre. Older gas meters measure gas in hundreds of cubic feet - 100 cubic feet equal 2.83 cubic metres. A smaller than average household is taken arbitrarily to be 12,000 kWh (two-thirds of the average gas meter), and a larger than average household to be 27,000 kWh (50% more). Mark Linas [6] makes the following suggestions: small house: 10,000 kWh; medium house: 20,500 kWh; and mansion: 28,000kWh.
These total inefficiencies were 91,400 GWh, i.e. 8.7%, and so the CO. emissions need to be adjusted by this amount from 0.185 to 0.203 kg / kWh. The average UK annual gas consumption is 16,000 kWh per household [36], but per meter is 18,000 kWh [36] (a larger amount as not every household has a supply of natural gas). A smaller than average household is taken arbitrarily to be 12,000 kWh (two-thirds of the average gas meter), and a larger than average household to be 27,000 kWh (50% more). Mark Linas [6] makes the following suggestions: small house: 10,000 kWh; medium house: 20,500 kWh; and mansion: 28,000kWh.
