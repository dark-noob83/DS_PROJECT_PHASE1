Megapascal (MPa) is a metric pressure unit and equals to 1 000 000 force of newton per square meter which is know as a Pascal. 1 MPa equals to 10 Bar. Because of its high pressure ratings is often used in hydraulic and simular systems. Megapascal is generally used to measure the pressure of heavy machines such as hydraulic system. Since the pressure of these machines can't be measured in pascals hence megapascals is used to describe the heavy pressures. Megapascal can easily be converted in other unit of pressure.

145.03773773 Psi (Psi). Megapascal. The megapascal (symbol:MPa) is a non-SI unit for pressure, and is a x1000000 multiple of the Pascal unit. 1 MPa equals 1,000,000 Pa. It is primarily used for higher range pressure measurement and mainly used to describe the pressure ranges and ratings of hydraulic systems. Psi. The megapascal (symbol:MPa) is a non-SI unit for pressure, and is a x1000000 multiple of the Pascal unit. 1 MPa equals 1,000,000 Pa. It is primarily used for higher range pressure measurement and mainly used to describe the pressure ranges and ratings of hydraulic systems
The pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure, internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength, defined as one newton per square metre. It is named after the French polymath Blaise Pascal. The unit is named after Blaise Pascal, noted for his experiments with a barometer. The name pascal was adopted for the SI unit newton per square metre (N/m 2) by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971.
1 megapascal [MPa] = 1 newton/millimeter² [N/mm²]. A megapascal (MPa) is a decimal multiple of the pascal, which is the SI derived unit of pressure, stress, Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength. It is a measure of force per unit area, defined as one newton per square meter. 
Megapascal-a unit to measure heavy pressure. Megapascal is the mega unit used to measure the intensity of pressure which means force per unit area. The term pascal has been derived from the Blaise Pascal. One unit of megapascal is equal to 1,000,000 pascal units. Megapascal is generally used to measure the pressure of heavy machines such as hydraulic system. Since the pressure of these machines can't be measured in pascals hence megapascals is used to describe the heavy pressures. Megapascal can easily be converted in other unit of pressure.
The abbreviation is Pa. Megapascal is a metric pressure unit and equals to 1 000 000 force of newton per square meter which is a pascal. 1 MPa equals to 10 Bar. Mostly used in hydraulic systems because of its high pressure ratings. The abbreviation is MPa. For other pressure unit conversions, please go to Pressure Conversion. Pascals to Megapascals conversion table shows the most common values for the quick reference. Alternatively, you may use the converter below to convert any other values. 1 Pascal = 0.000001 Megapascal. Pascal is a pressure unit in metric system and equals to a force of newton per square meter.
Common multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1 hPa ≡ 100 Pa) which is equal to 1 mbar, the kilopascal (1 kPa ≡ 1000 Pa), the megapascal (1 MPa ≡ 1,000,000 Pa), and the gigapascal (1 GPa ≡ 1,000,000,000 Pa). The unit is named after Blaise Pascal, noted for his experiments with a barometer. The name pascal was adopted for the SI unit newton per square metre (N/m 2) by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1971.
MPa – Megapascal Pressure Unit. The Megapascal is a x1000000 multiple of the Pascal unit which is the SI unit for pressure. 1 Megapascal equals 1,000,000 Pascals. Primarily used for higher range pressure measurement due to its larger value (e.g. 1 MPa = 10 bar), the MPa is mainly used to describe the pressure ranges and ratings of hydraulic systems.
