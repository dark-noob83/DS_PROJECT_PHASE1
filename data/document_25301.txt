Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis—based on your medical history, symptoms and exposure to ticks. Because the typical diagnostic tests for Lyme are so insensitive, a negative test result does not mean you don’t have Lyme.
Western Blot Test. The Western blot test for Lyme disease is usually used following a positive or indeterminate ELISA (or IFA) test which is more sensitive, but less specific, than the Western blot. This type of test is a serological assay for detecting antibodies to Borrelia bacteria that cause Lyme disease.
Share. Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis—based on your medical history, symptoms and exposure to ticks. Because the typical diagnostic tests for Lyme are so insensitive, a negative test result does not mean you don’t have Lyme. There are many reasons why someone who actually has Lyme may have a negative test result.
Yes, it is possible to have a negative Western blot and have Lyme Disease. The Western Blot is a test that tells you what antibodies exist in the blood serum against proteins of a certain molecular weight.
A positive result on the ELISA screening test does not mean that the person has HIV infection. Certain conditions may lead to a false positive result, such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and lupus. A positive ELISA test is always followed by a Western blot test.
The Western blot test is a better test than the ELISA because it is more specific. For example, at a good lab, a positive IgG Western blot is 100% specific for exposure to the agent of Lyme Disease.
A blood test for antibodies to the bacteria is the preferred test for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. However, if a person has central nervous system symptoms, such as meningitis, then IgM, IgG, and western blot testing may sometimes be performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) .
