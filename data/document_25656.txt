A water-chiller refrigeration ton is defined as: 1 ton of refrigeration = 1 TONScond = 12000 Btu/h = 200 Btu/min = 3025.9 k Calories/h = 12661 kJ/h = 3.517 kW. A ton is the amount of heat removed by an air conditioning system that would melt 1 ton (2000 lbs.) of ice in 24 hours: 288000 BTU/24 hr = 12000 BTU/hr.
For centrifugal chillers over 400 tons, prices range from $200 to $500 per ton for the chiller itself; for centrifugal chillers less than 400 tons, prices range from $250 to $600 per ton for the chiller itself. A VFD can add from $30 to $80 per ton (see Table 2). 
An example of the dollar savings expected for refurbishing a tower vs. replacement is when Bond Water Technologies completely refurbished four (4) 200 ton cooling towers (800 tons total) at a cost of approx. $80,000.00 vs. the cost of new towers quoted at $100,000.00, plus installation costs. Cooling Tower Replacement can be a costly proposition and the average life expectancy of a commercial cooling tower, according to most manufacturers, is 15 – 20 years, before they need to be rebuilt or replaced. Many cooling towers were installed in 1980’s and are 30 years old now
Here a correction factor of 1.0 is assumed for the competitor’s tower and 0.8 for the Tower Tech tower. For a 1600 ton load, a conventional tower may require $9,600 per year in chemicals. Annual savings of $1,900 might be realized on the Tower Tech design. At a water cost of $1.50/1000 gal and a disposal cost of $2.00/1000 gal, this equates to a yearly water bill of $13,600. FOOTNOTES 1 A reduction in water flow to a tower may lead to accelerated scale buildup.
The additional cost is simply the cost to treat the portion of the makeup water associated with drift and blowdown replacement, Replacement chemical cost = $0.004 x waste gallons Here, a treatment cost of $4.00 per 1000 gallons of tower water is assumed. At a water cost of $1.50/1000 gal and a disposal cost of $2.00/1000 gal, this equates to a yearly water bill of $13,600. FOOTNOTES 1 A reduction in water flow to a tower may lead to accelerated scale buildup.
If we assume 13 weeks per season, this equates to 1.3 million cooling ton-hours in the summer (13 weeks x 5 days/week x 20 hours/day x 1,000 tons of total cooling capacity x 100% utilization), 975,000 cooling ton-hours in the spring and autumn and 650,000 cooling ton hours in winter. This involves identifying how much of your system’s total cooling capacity is utilized and how often to arrive at an annual number of cooling ton-hours. For example, suppose a site has two 500-ton cooling towers that it operates 5 days per week for 20 hours per day.
Some annual cost examples include•50-ton and smaller electric centrifugal chiller = $6/ton, 4•50-ton to 1,500-ton electric centrifugal chiller = $4.50/ton, 4•,500-ton and larger electric centrifugal chiller = $2.50/ton, and 1•00-ton and larger air-cooled screw chiller = $10/ton. •ypically in the $3-$4 per 1,000-gal range for both makeup and blowdown volumes. TTypically only for condenser water chemicals on a per-ton-hour basis for annual cooling load. • rule-of-thumb number is $0.0025/ton-hr (check with local provider for costs and recommended methods based on Acity water quality)
A cooling tower ton is defined as: 1 cooling tower ton = 1 TONSevap = 1 TONScond x 1.25 = 15000 Btu/h = 3782 k Calories/h = 15826 kJ/h. The equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 Btu/h due to the heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor. 1 ton of refrigeration = 1 TONScond = 12000 Btu/h = 200 Btu/min = 3025.9 k Calories/h = 12661 kJ/h = 3.517 kW. A ton is the amount of heat removed by an air conditioning system that would melt 1 ton (2000 lbs.) of ice in 24 hours: 288000 BTU/24 hr = 12000 BTU/hr.
