The creatine kinase normal range varies from males to females. For adult males, the normal values are between 38 and 174 units per liter of blood whereas for adult females, the normal level is between 90 and 140 units per liter of blood. An elevation beyond this point is likely to be diagnostically relevant.
Increased CK-MB can usually be detected in someone with a heart attack about 3-6 hours after the onset of chest pain. The level of CK-MB peaks in 12-24 hours and then returns to normal within about 48-72 hours. If there is a second heart attack or ongoing damage, then levels may rise again and/or stay elevated longer.
Creatine Kinase. Creatine kinase formerly known as creatine phosphokinase is primarily found in muscle cells including the heart, striated muscles and the brain. The normal range of creatine kinase for men is 38 - 174 units/L and for women 96 - 140 units/L. Men typically have more muscle mass than women which accounts for the higher range values. African Americans have been found to have higher normal range for creatine kinase as well.
The normal value for CK-MB is 3-5% of total CK, but peak CK-MB level can range from 15-30% of total CK in post-myocardial infarction. Therefore, percentage criteria were proposed to distinguish between skeletal muscle and myocardial damage.
Creatine kinase, more commonly known as CK, is an enzyme that is present in all muscle tissue of the body including the heart and the brain. The normal creatine kinase levels in a man are between 38 and 174 units/L; while a woman's creatine kinase levels range from between 96 to 140 units/L.
