1 Reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees F and continue cooking covered for another 2 hours. 2  Remove from oven and turn the roast over, place back in oven for another 1-2 hours or until roast is tender (could take longer than 2 hours, as you are cooking at a low temperature). 1 Remove from oven and turn the roast over, place back in oven for another 1-2 hours or until roast is tender (could take longer than 2 hours, as you are cooking at a low temperature). 2  Let the roast stand for 20 minutes before slicing.

Example. To cook an eight pound beef roast in a convection oven, set the oven temperature to 325º F. If the desired final temperature of the roast is 140º F. then once that internal temperature is reached, the roast must be held at 140º F. for a minimum of 12 minutes to ensure a safe product. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make a dry rub by combining chili powder, salt, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, sugar, dry mustard, and bay leaf. Season the raw brisket on both sides with the rub. Place in a roasting pan and roast, uncovered, for 1 hour. Add beef stock and enough water to yield about 1/2 inch of liquid in the roasting pan. Lower oven to 300 degrees F, cover pan tightly and continue cooking for 3 hours, or until fork-tender. Trim the fat and slice meat thinly across the grain. Top with juice from the pan.
Red Meats. For beef, lamb, bison and game meats rest roast at cool room temperature if possible, 30-60 minutes for small roasts and 60-90 minutes for larger roasts. Estimate roasting time. Allow 15 minutes per pound of roast for rare, 20 minutes per pound for medium rare to medium. 
The proper beef roast cook times and the correct beef cooking oven temperatures are extremely important. The optimum flavor and tenderness of various beef roasts can be consistently achieved when care is taken to follow the recommended time and temperature guidelines for cooking beef roasts. The oven temperature used to cook a beef roast is usually set somewhere between 300 degrees and 450 degrees Fahrenheit. The recommended cooking temperature for your roast is usually determined by the type of beef cut that you plan to roast.
4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 1 hour 45 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour 30 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°
