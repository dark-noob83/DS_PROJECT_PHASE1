The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. Body temperature also varies at different parts of the body. Oral temperatures, which are the most convenient type of temperature measurement, is at 37.0 °C. This is the accepted standard temperature for the normal core body temperature.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . 
According to the body temperature scale in Celsius, the temperature is normal when it is 37 degrees Celsius. Temperatures up to 37.3 and down to 36.7 are considered to be within the normal body temperature scale in Celsius. Hyperthermia occurs when the temperature rises above 37.3 degrees. 
Confidence votes 6.9K. The equivalent to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is 37 degrees Celsius. This is the average normal human body temperature, which is slightly lower in adults. The range is 36.8 degrees plus or minus 0.7 degrees. Normal temperature range will vary, sometimes considerably, for individuals. The average human body temperature is 98.6º F or 37º C, but it can vary somewhat. Average adult temperature is 98.2º F (36.8º C). Older people average a bit less. These va … lues can also vary with time of day.
A baby’s temperature is no different. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, normal body temperature for a health baby ranges between 97 degrees and 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees to 38 degrees Celsius). A rectal temperature reading above this range indicates a fever. 
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally.

The normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). In adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 33.2–38.2 °C (91.8–100.8 °F) for normal temperatures, depending on the gender and location measured. Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures.
