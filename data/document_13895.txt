History. Namded after Ytterby, a village in Sweden near Vauxholm. Yttria-- earth containing yttrium-- was discovered by Gadolin in 1794. Ytterby is the site of a quarry which yielded many unusual minerals containing rare earths and other elements. This small town, near Stockholm, bears the honor of giving names to erbium, terbium, and ytterbium as well as yttrium.
Definition of YTTRIA. : yttrium oxide Y2O3 obtained as a heavy white powder and used especially formerly in incandescent gas mantles.
Yttria (yttrium oxide, Y 2 O 3), was discovered by Johann Gadolin in 1794 in a mineral called gadolinite from Ytterby. Ytterby is the site of a quarry in Sweden which contains many unusual minerals containing erbium, terbium, and ytterbium as well as yttrium.
Yttrium is a chemical element with symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a  rare earth element .
Definition of YTTRIUM. : a metallic element usually included in the rare-earth group that occurs usually with other rare earth elements in minerals and is used especially in phosphors, YAG lasers, and superalloys â€” see element table.
The largest use of the element is as its oxide yttria, Y 2 O 3, which is used in making red phosphors for color television picture tubes; it also has other uses. Yttrium metal has found some use alloyed in small amounts with other metals.
Anders Gustaf Ekeberg confirmed this in 1797, and named the oxide yttria. Yttrium is an element that's symbol is Y and has the number 39. It is a silver metallic transition metal that has properties similar to lanthanoids and is a rare earth mineral.
