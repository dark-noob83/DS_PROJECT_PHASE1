By Debbie Hadley. Gardeners who want to attract butterflies to their gardens often plant butterfly bush (genus Buddleia), a fast growing shrub that blooms prolifically. While butterfly bush is easy to grow, inexpensive to buy, and a good attractant for butterflies, it's one of the worst choices for a butterfly garden.
Butterfly Host Plants are important when you create your butterfly garden to provide a site for the butterfly to lay eggs and also food source for the emerging caterpillar.
Buddleia is native to Asia. In North America, butterfly bush is a highly invasive, exotic plant that crowds out native plants, including native butterfly plants. A number of states now ban the planting of butterfly bush on public lands. Some states even prohibit the sale or commercial cultivation of Buddleia.
The butterfly plant (Buddleja davidii), commonly called a butterfly bush, is a shrub that produces flowers that are attractive to many types of butterflies. Butterfly plants are of Chinese and Japanese origin, but are now the main features of American butterfly gardens designed to lure in these showy insects.
The butterfly bush is a perennial, woody shrub with purple flowers. It is a very popular ornamental plant, often found in gardens. It also is common along riverbanks and river gravel bars where it out-competes native plants and alters soil nutrients.
And like many flowering plants, it is a good nectar plant. But when the only plant you plant for butterflies is butterfly bush, you're not going to have butterflies anymore, Tallamy warns.
Creating a Butterfly Garden involves planning your garden to attract, retain, and encourage butterfly populations to visit. You should select a variety of nectar-producing plants (butterfly food plants) with the goal of providing flowers in bloom throughout the season. This will encourage a continuous succession of new visitors to your butterfly garden.
