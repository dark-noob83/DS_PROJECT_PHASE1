Because it can act anywhere on the substrate, α-amylase tends to be faster-acting than β-amylase. In animals, it is a major digestive enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0. In human physiology, both the salivary and pancreatic amylases are α-amylases. An amylase (/ˈaemɨleɪs/) ˈæmɨleɪs is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch into. sugars

Genetics & enzymes  Recall:DNA RNA Proteins  Proteins, therefore Enzymes, have a genetic basis! Salivary Amylase  Salivary Amylase-Digestive enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reaction: Starch  Maltose  Example: you put a cracker in your mouth and let it stay there (no chewing!). Mix well & Label this tube. Never add anything to this tube;Only remove. This is your enzyme for all experiments!!! 1.5 ml saliva + 1.5 ml buffer =3 ml “Stock Saliva/Buffer”. Procedure Overview: 4. Fill 5 test tubes with 5 ml each Starch Solution.
Confidence votes 7.7K. Starch is the substrate. Salivary amylase (like all amylases) is an enzyme that breaks down bonds between glucose residues in starch molecules. More specifically, the substrate for an amylase is an α-1,4-glycosidic bond. The products are sugars such as maltose and, in smaller amounts, glucose and maltotrios
The Basic Reaction Substrate enzyme Product. Today’s Reaction Starch Salivary Amylase Maltose (polysaccharide) (disaccharide) =glucose + glucose SubstrateProductENZYME! Today’s Reaction Starch Maltose  In today’s experiment, you will monitor the breakdown of starch into maltose.  The speed of the reaction (reaction rate) will be dependent upon the temperature.  The reaction rate will also partially depend on your salivary amylase genes. Mix well & Label this tube. Never add anything to this tube;Only remove. This is your enzyme for all experiments!!! 1.5 ml saliva + 1.5 ml buffer =3 ml “Stock Saliva/Buffer”. Procedure Overview: 4.

Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar.
