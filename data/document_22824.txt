Boston ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata) aren't from Boston, but are native to Florida, Central America and other tropical areas. The plants became wildly popular during the Victorian era after a florist, F.C. Becker, began propagating them in 1894.
Boston ferns prefer daytime temperatures that range from 65 to 75 degrees F. Evening temperatures should be a little cooler. Cooler temperatures reduce the chance of fungus developing. Temperatures ranging between 55 and 65 are ideal.
Culture. U.D. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones for the Boston fern are 9, 10 and 11, all of which have average low temperatures of 20 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Ideally, the temperature for outdoor ferns is between 65 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but the Boston fern will tolerate much colder temperatures.
Night-time temperatures should be on the cool side, below 60AF. Humidity Low humidity around the home, usually averaging 10 to 15 percent, can be a problem for many tropical indoor plants. Thirty percent humidity is about as low a level as a fern can tolerate. Forty to 50 percent humidity is a more desirable range.
Step 2. Maintain a consistent temperature of about 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 65 to 70 degrees F at night. Keep a thermometer near the Boston fern to ensure the temperature does not leave this range.
Boston ferns die if exposed to lower temperatures. The best indoor temperature range for these voluptuous plants is between 68 and 78 F, notes Colorado State University Extension. Outdoors, the plants can take considerably higher temperatures as long as you grow them in shade and give them enough water.
