Cost of Lunch in Paris. The average cost of a main dish at lunch is roughly €10-15, but if you opt for a prix fixe menu that includes 2-3 courses (and sometimes a beverage) you might be looking at €15-18 per person. The total bill for two people, including beverages, is going to be about €40.
To sum this up...average costs could be anything from 30 Euro to 200 Euros. I would just decide on the budget and look for places to eat that fall into the amount of money you have. Maybe eat in the apartment 2 meals one day and then splurge another day.
Cost of Dinner in Paris. The average cost for a main dish at dinner time is €18-28, but you can spend as much as €35 per person if you’re ordering a 3-course meal at a nicer restaurant.
In Paris cafes, you are paying for the food and drink as well as the location and atmosphere. On the same block, a cafe on the street corner with a great view may command higher prices than the small cafe in the middle of the block. Prices are displayed outside so you can comparison shop.
We are trying to figure out a tentative average daily cost of food for each of the 3 cities. 1. Paris: one of our shortlisted hotels (a 4 star one) doesn't include breakfast in its deal for Feb'13 - other one (3 star) does include it, and is cheaper too..
If you are planning to visit many museums, look into purchasing the Paris Museum Pass. A 2-day pass costs 39€. The break-even point for the pass is if you plan visit 2 or more museums a day. Plan carefully-the logistics of visiting many museums in one day can be difficult. Budget Tip: Buy a crepe or panini from a street vendor for 4€.
Cost of Breakfast in Paris. The average current cost for an “American breakfast” in Paris (i.e. coffee, a croissant or toasted baguette, a couple of eggs, orange juice and sometimes even ham) is between €10-15.
