Salaried Nonexempt Employees. Salaried nonexempt employees receive a salary rate for a fixed number of hours. However, when they exceed the fixed number of hours and work more than 40 hours in a week, they receive overtime compensation. The basis of the calculation of their overtime compensation is the equivalent hourly rate the employee earns. For a 37 1/2-hour workweek, the $59,000-a-year employee earns the equivalent of $30.25 per hour. The overtime rate for salaried nonexempt employees is the same as hourly, nonexempt employees: 1 1/2 times the hourly rate.
The proposed rule also increased the minimum salary threshold for the highly compensated employee. exemption to the overtime requirements. Previously, an employee earning at least $100,000 in total. annual compensation was exempt from overtime as long as they could meet at least one of the duty tests. 
The new minimum salary basis requirement will be raised to $ 50,440 per year ($970 per week) and that could mean an additional 5 million employees will become non-exempt and eligible for overtime when the new regulations take effect. The Secretary of Labor has been asked to propose new FLSA regulations which will likely reduce the number of employees who qualify for exempt status. Although there have been numerous delays in announcing the new rules, it appears they will be announced sometime in 2015 and implemented in 2016.
Specifically, the U.S. Department of Labor proposed this week that the salary threshold needed to maintain such exempt classifications should increase from $23,660 to $50,440 per year (or $970 per workweek). This amounts to more than a doubling of the current salary requirement. The White House recently announced that the long-awaited proposed amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations concerning the so-called “white collar” exemptions will include a substantial increase to the salary required to maintain exempt status for most executive, administrative, and professional employees.
It has been increased only once since 1975. The salary threshold for the exemption to the overtime protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act has eroded to such a level—$455 per week, or $23,660 for someone who works year-round—that it is currently less than the poverty threshold for a family of four. Workers under age 35 would also be disproportionately affected. For example, of the 21.7 million who are currently exempt, 22 percent are age 25–34, but of those who would be newly covered if the salary threshold were raised to $984, 31 percent are age 25–34, a much larger share.
Currently, the white collar exemptions in 29 CFR Part 541 require employers to pay employees a salary of at least $455 per week ($23,660 annually) and to perform certain exempt duties. Similarly, the highly-compensated exemption under the FLSA has been increased from $100,000 to $125,148 annually, which is tied to the 90th salary percentile. Unlike the 2004 regulations, these amounts are not stagnant but will be automatically updated each year to the applicable 40 percent or 90 percent thresholds.
The immediate result will be that employers in every state will be required to review the exempt status of their employees. The proposed salary basis test is greater even than that of California's, which is currently the highest at $37,440. Similarly, the highly-compensated exemption under the FLSA has been increased from $100,000 to $125,148 annually, which is tied to the 90th salary percentile. Unlike the 2004 regulations, these amounts are not stagnant but will be automatically updated each year to the applicable 40 percent or 90 percent thresholds.
The announcement makes it clear that the goal is to significantly narrow the number of individuals who qualify as exempt. A major target of the proposed revisions is the current $455-per-week salary threshold for executive, administrative and professional employees. That threshold is roughly equivalent to $11.38 per hour for a forty-hour week – not much more than the $10.10 minimum wage that the administration seeks, and which it claims is the equivalent of $561 in today’s dollars.
Some states have a higher minimum weekly wage for salaried employees; Connecticut is one such state where the minimum for salaried workers is $475, instead of the federal threshold of $455.

The highly-compensated exemption currently requires employers to pay a salary of over $100,000 annually. The proposed amendments increase the salary basis test from $455/week to $970/week ($50,440 annually) beginning in 2016. This new salary represents the 40th percentile of earnings for all full-time salaried workers throughout the United States. Similarly, the highly-compensated exemption under the FLSA has been increased from $100,000 to $125,148 annually, which is tied to the 90th salary percentile. Unlike the 2004 regulations, these amounts are not stagnant but will be automatically updated each year to the applicable 40 percent or 90 percent thresholds.
