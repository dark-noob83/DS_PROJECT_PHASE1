Trust me. The least appreciated people most of us deal with in Vegas Hotels are the desk clerks. They have a lot of discretion. Now there are no guarantees, I must add, but if you know a thing or two and know how to act it can certainly be to your advantage at check-in. First of all, be nice, not phony or rude.
Remember that tips run Vegas. Tip the check-in clerk. A $100 tip could get you an upgrade from a single ground level room ($150 a night) to a deluxe suite with a strip view for $300 a night instead of the normal $600 a night! Also tip the bellboy and cabbie-they'll give you inside tips that will save you much more than what you left as a tip.
