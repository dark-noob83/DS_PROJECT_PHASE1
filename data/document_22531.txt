The first ship to arrive in the Swan River Estuary was HMS Challenger captained by Charles Fremantle (1800-1869). On 2 May 1829 he claimed the whole of Australia outside New South Wales for Britain. Stirling arrived in June. Perth was founded in 1829 largely because the British feared the French would establish a colony in Western Australia. In 1827 Captain James Stirling (1791-1865) sailed to the Swan River in his ship HMS Success. Stirling believed the area would be ideal for a settlement.
Between 1788 and 1850 the English sent over 162,000 convicts to Australia in 806 ships. The first eleven of these ships are today known as the First Fleet and contained the convicts and marines that are now acknowledged as the Founders of Australia. This is their story. Before 1788, Australia was populated by about 300,000 aborigines. On 3rd June a ship was sighted-the Lady Juliana, a transport with 225 female convicts-the first of the ships in the Second Fleet. This was followed on 20th June by the Justinian, which was loaded entirely with provisions for the colony.

Willem de Vlamingh's ships, with black swans, at the entrance to the Swan River, Western Australia, coloured engraving (1796), derived from an earlier drawing (now lost) from the de Vlamingh expeditions of 1696–97. The first ship to reach the Swan River was HMS Challenger. After anchoring off Garden Island on 25 April 1829, its Captain Charles Fremantle declared the Swan River Colony for Britain on 2 May 1829. The Parmelia arrived on 31 May carrying Stirling and his party and HMS Sulphur arrived on 8 June.
Most likely the first visitor to the Swan River area was Frederick de Houtman on 19 July 1619, travelling on the ships Dordrecht and Amsterdam. His records indicate he first reached the Western Australian coast at latitude 32°20' which would equate to Rottnest or just south of there. The first ship to reach the Swan River was HMS Challenger.

The First Fleet arrived in Port Jackson, the location of Sydney, Australia on 26 January 1788, after leaving Portsmouth, England, in May 1787. Originally, the First Fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Governor Arthur Phillip declared this area unsuitable for settlement for four reasons: The First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 Ma … y 1787, and first  arrived at Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. The Fleet then moved on  to Port Jackson and Sydney Cove, arriving there on 26
When Australia's first inhabitants arrived on the northwest coast 40,000 to 60,000 years ago the sea levels were much lower. The Kimberley coast at one time was only about 90 km from Timor, which itself was the last in a line of closely spaced islands for humans to travel across. In 1826, the first British military outpost was established at King George Sound. This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829, with townsites at Fremantle and Perth, which later became the state's capital.
The human history of Western Australia commenced between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago with the arrival of Indigenous Australians on the northwest coast. In 1826, the first British military outpost was established at King George Sound. This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829, with townsites at Fremantle and Perth, which later became the state's capital.
