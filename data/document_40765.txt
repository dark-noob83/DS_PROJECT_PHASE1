The Achilles tendon is a tough band of fibrous tissue that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone (calcaneus). The Achilles tendon is also called the calcaneal tendon. The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (calf muscles) unite into one band of tissue, which becomes the Achilles tendon at the low end of the calf.
Achilles Tendon. The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscle to the heel bone. The calf muscle is actually two muscles, the gastrocnemius muscle and the soleus muscle. The soleus lies underneath the gastrocnemius. The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the body.
The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the human body. The Achilles tendon connects the heel bone (calcaneus) to the muscles at the back of the calf (using gastrocnemius and soleus muscles).
