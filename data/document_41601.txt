Variable costs are those costs that vary depending on a company's production volume; they rise as production increases and fall as production decreases. Variable costs differ from fixed costs such as rent, advertising, insurance and office supplies, which tend to remain the same regardless of production output.
So our sales would be $400 and our cost of the goods we sold (cost of sales) would amount to $300. This would result in a gross profit of $100 (sales minus cost of sales). Cost of goods sold is not the same as purchases, as you will see from our examples below.
The graph below shows total revenue (SP x Q) as a function of sales volume (Q), when the unit sales price (SP) is $12. The following graph shows the total cost function when fixed costs (FC) are $4,000 and the variable cost per unit (VC) is $5.
Variable costs are costs that change as the output of the company changes. For example, a company that manufactures homes will have higher costs for lumber as the number of homes that are built increases. Because the cost increases over the number of homes produced, this is a variable cost.
The total cost at a volume of 50 units is $215. The variable cost at 50 units would be 50*3.9=$195. The fixed cost would be the difference between $195 and $215=$20. You could arrive at the same figure by using the total cost at 10 units ($59). Compare this cost with the variable cost of 10*3.9=$39.
For example, if a bicycle business had total fixed costs of $1,000 and only produced one bike, then the full $1,000 in fixed costs must be applied to that bike. On the other hand, if the same business produced 10 bikes, then the fixed costs per unit decline to $100. Variable costs behave differently.
As the cost of sales excludes overheads, it has a higher proportion of variable costs than the operating costs as a whole. It may contain some fixed costs such as labour costs. Nonetheless, in many cases the cost of goods sold does consist almost entirely of variable costs.
However, variable costs applied per unit would be $200 for both the first and the tenth bike. The company's total costs are a combination of the fixed and variable costs. If the bicycle company produced 10 bikes, its total costs would be $1,000 fixed plus $2,000 variable equals $3,000, or $300 per unit.
