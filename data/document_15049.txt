The Animalia Kingdom is a diverse group of organisms that share certain characteristics (we'll get to that shortly). Some members of this kingdom seem like they would fit in elsewhere, like sponges or coral. The Animalia Kingdom is the largest of all kingdoms with more than one million species! Characteristics of Animalia Kingdom. It's hard to imagine that a sponge attached to a rock and a lion are in the same kingdom, but they share certain characteristics that land them together. For instance, creatures in the Animalia Kingdom are: 1  Multicellular, which means that they are made up of more than one cell.
Animal Kingdom Classification. Animals are characterized being multicellular and eukaryotic. Classification of animals is about organizing organisms into groups. Members of a group have shared characteristic, that is common to all members of that group and it is this character that defines the group. All the organisms of the Animal kingdom are multicellular but they do not exhibit the same pattern if organization of cells. The patterns of cellular organization seen in animals are: 1  Cellular Level of Organization-In these animals the cells are arranged in the form of loose cell aggregates.
1 Eukaryotes: this is the type of cells animals have. 2  Eukaryote cells are more complex than the simpler prokaryote cells found in bacteria. 3  No cell wall: plants, fungi and prokaryote cells have a cell wall, which is a rigid outer layer that gives cells structure.

1 Plants are autotrophic because they make their own food through photosynthesis. 2  Because they cannot make their own food, members of the Animalia Kingdom must ingest, or eat, other organisms. 3  Eukaryotes: this is the type of cells animals have.

Plants are all multicellular and consist of complex cells. In addition plants are autotrophs, organisms that make their own food. With over 250,000 species, the plant kingdom is the second largest kingdom. Plant species range from the tiny green mosses to giant trees. But the use of the microscope led to the discovery of new organisms and the identification of differences in cells. A two-kingdom system was no longer useful. Today the system of classification includes six kingdoms.
The Animal Kingdom. Though there is great diversity in the animal kingdom, animals can be distinguished from the other kingdoms by a set of characteristics. 1 Animals typically reproduce sexually. 2  Animals are made up of cells that do not have cell walls. 3  Animals are capable of motion in some stage of their lives. 4  Animals are able to respond quickly to external stimuli as a result of nerve cells, muscle or contractile tissue, or both.
1 Heterotrophic, which means they have to get their own food. 2  Plants are autotrophic because they make their own food through photosynthesis. 3  Because they cannot make their own food, members of the Animalia Kingdom must ingest, or eat, other organisms. 4  Eukaryotes: this is the type of cells animals have.

Kingdom Animalia Characteristics. General characteristics of the Kingdom Animalia are as follows: Animals are eukaryotic, multicellular and heterotrophic organisms. They have multiple cells with mitochondria and they depend on other organisms for food. Habitat-Most of the animals inhabit seas, fewer are seen in fresh water and even fewer on land. The Kingdom Animalia is characterized by eukaryotic and heterotrophic organisms. They are multicellular and lack cell wall. They depend directly or indirectly of plants for their food. Food is ingested and digested in their internal cavity and food reserves are stored as glycogen or fat
Though other types of life may share some of these characteristics, the set of characteristics as a whole provide a distinction from the other kingdoms. The set of characteristics provided by Audesirk and Audesirk are: 1  Animals are multicellular. 1 Animals typically reproduce sexually. 2  Animals are made up of cells that do not have cell walls. 3  Animals are capable of motion in some stage of their lives. 4  Animals are able to respond quickly to external stimuli as a result of nerve cells, muscle or contractile tissue, or both.
