Epithelial membranes are attached to the underlying connective tissue by a layer of proteins and polysaccharides known as the basement membrane. True. False. 21. The eccrine (or merocrine) sweat glands, located in the axillae (underarms) and pubic region, secrete a protein-rich fluid. True. False. 22. Blood is usually classified as a type of connective tissue. True. False. 23. Ligaments connect bone together at joints whereas tendons connect muscle to bone. True. False. 24.
