Table I compares the estimated annual savings fortankless gas heaters vs. storage gas heaters as a func-tion of Energy Factor. Comparing the two types ofwater heaters using their average Energy Factors (EFs= 0.59 and EFt = 0.725), the expected annual energysavings for a tankless water heater is $28.56. 
It calculated average one-time costs (purchase plus installation) and annual operating costs based on average utility rates for both types. The installation estimates: $865 for a 50-gallon storage-tank heater and $1,470 to $2,500 for a gas-fueled, tankless water heater. To see how a tankless investment might pay off, take the median, or $2,000, as the average installed cost, plus a few hundred more to disconnect and remove the existing conventional tank. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. The compact alternative, often billed as the more efficient European system, is a tankless, or on-demand
Assumptions.  1 Base model has an efficiency that just meets the national minimum standard for gas and electric water heaters. 2  Lifetime energy cost is the sum of the discounted value of the annual energy costs based on assumed water heater life of 13 years. 1 Lifetime energy cost is the sum of the discounted value of the annual energy costs based on assumed water heater life of 13 years. 2  Future electricity price trends and a discount rate of 3.2% are based on Federal guidelines. 3  $0.09 per kWh for electricity is the Federal average price in the U.S
The DOE computes average annual operating costs of $388 for a storage-tank heater, and $272 for a tankless heater. That's $116 less. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. The compact alternative, often billed as the more efficient European system, is a tankless, or on-demand water heater.
2.45 KWH x 12 ¢ per KWH = 29 ¢ per shower. For a family of four, that comes to a total annual cost of daily showers of only $423.40. That represents a savings of $262.80 just for your showers when you choose an energy-efficient Ecosmart tankless hot water heater over a standard tank water heater. 
“From interviews with eight local contractors, installed costs for whole-house gas tankless water heaters as a retrofit were estimated from $2,000 to $5,000, with typical price range of $2,500 to $3,400. These costs are considerably higher than estimated by others. On average, the tankless water heaters used 37% less energy than the tank-type heaters. The annual savings ranged from $42 per year for families that used small volumes of hot water to $121 per year for a high-use family.
Up-front costs are high. The tankless water heaters we tested cost $800 to $1,150, compared with $300 to $480 for the regular storage-tank types. Tankless models need electrical outlets for their fan and electronics, upgraded gas pipes, and a new ventilation system. That can bring average installation costs to $1,200, compared with $300 for storage-tank models. Tankless units might need more care. During our long-term testing, an indicator on the tankless model warned of scale buildup. We paid $334 for special valves and a plumber to flush out the water heater with vinegar.
Another very attractive pro is the savings tankless water heaters offer. Because water heating accounts for almost 30 percent of a home's energy bills, a tankless water heater can cut these costs by up to 50 percent savings. These savings amount to about $80 annually. 
365 X 41045/.57 X $0.00000619 = $163. For electric water heaters, including heat pump units. You need to know or convert the unit cost of electricity by kilowatt-hour (kWh). 365 days/year x 12.03 kWh/day ÷ EF x Fuel Cost ($/kWh) = annual cost of operation. Example: A heat pump water heater with an EF of 2.0 and an electricity cost of $0.0842/kWh. 365 X 12.03 ÷ 2.0 X $0.0842 = $185. To estimate the annual operating cost of a storage, demand (tankless or instaneous), or heat pump (not geothermal heat pump) water heater, you need to know the following about the model: 1  Energy factor (EF) (see above).
