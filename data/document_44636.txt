I. Introduction. In general, fronting is the process by which a primary insurer cedes all or virtually all of the insurance risk of loss to a reinsurer who also controls the underwriting and/or claim handling process either directly or through a managing general agency. Often, the reinsurer is not licensed in the United States.
Often, the fronting insurer is licensed to do business in a country where the risk is located, but the reinsurer is not. The reinsurer in this scenario is often a captive or an independent insurance company that cannot sell insurance directly in a par-ticular country.
That risk is then fully transferred from the fronting company to a captive insurance company through a reinsurance agreement, known as a fronting agreement. Thus, the insured obtains a policy issued on the paper of the commercial insurance company.
A captive insurer is an insurance company that is wholly owned and controlled by its insureds; its primary purpose is to insure the risks of its owners, and its insureds benefit from the captive insurerâ€™s underwriting profits.
The risk of loss is retained by the self-insured or captive insurer through an indemnity or reinsurance agreement. However, the fronting company (insurer) would be required to honor the obligations imposed by the policy if the self-insurer or captive failed to indemnify it.
BREAKING DOWN 'Fronting Policy'. The insurance company that underwrites the original policy is called the fronting company. The fronting company receives a percentage of the premium despite ceding all of the risks to the reinsurer. By issuing the insurance policy, the fronting company appears to be the insurer, though in reality it transfers all risk to the reinsurer. In a fronting policy, the deductible is the same as the liability.
