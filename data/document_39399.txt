The group number of an element in the periodic table is the same as the number of electrons in its outer shell. An element in group 1 has 1 electron in its outer shell. An element in group 2 has 2 electrons in its outer shell. An element in group 7 has 7 electrons in its outer shell. An element in group 0 has a full outer shell. The number of electrons in the outer shell gives the element its chemical properties and controls its chemical reactions.
the periodic table should tell you: specifically, though, the period tells you the number of electron energy shells the elements in it have; for example, elements in the 2nd period (or row) have 2 energy shells.
The groups in the periodic table tell you what each element within them will react with, the number of valance electrons the element has, and what family it is in. (Ex/ everyt … hing in group twelve will react with something that will let it lose two electrons.
When you look at the periodic table, the symbols and numbers look like the image on the left. The symbols are abbreviations of the origins of the word for each element. For example, the origin of lead's symbol, Pb, is the Latin word 'plumbum' meaning 'liquid silver'.
The atomic number of an atom  is the number of protons in the nucleus … of that atom, and it is the  elemental identity of that atom. Only the number of protons  identifies an element. All the time, and every time. Nothing else.
The atomic number on the periodic table (or anywhere else) tells  you which element is being specified. The atomic number of an atom  is the number of protons in the nucleus … of that atom, and it is the  elemental identity of that atom. Only the number of protons  identifies an element. All the time, and every time.
The periodic table is a classification system for the elements. Each element has unique properties and you can predict an element's physical and chemical properties based on its position in the periodic table.
