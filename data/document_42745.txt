The average Air Force warplane is 23.5 years old compared with 8.5 years in 1967. In 2001, the average plane was 22 years old. The Air Force says it wants to buy new planes to lower the average age of its fleet to 15 years over the next two decades. That will cost an estimated $400billion. There are 356 A-10s in service. The plane is often used to support ground forces in close combat.
Today's U.S. Air Force is the smallest and oldest since its inception. Of its roughly 5,000 aircraft, the average age is 25.

The oldest aircraft type is B-52, with average age of 44. [1] Up to 2012 the USAF will procure 612 aircraft but even then the average is of the fleet is expected to be around 28 years. Source: T. A. Mehuron, The Graybeard Fleet, Air Force Magazine, February 2004, p. 12.
All this in a period when the Air Force is the smallest and oldest since its inception in 1947. Of its roughly 5,000 aircraft, the average age is twenty-five years old. Today’s Air Force is already struggling, and tomorrow’s is entirely at risk.
