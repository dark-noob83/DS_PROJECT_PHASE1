The answer is yes and no. Yes, carbon IS found in all organic matter, but NOT in inorganic matter. Although there are many definitions of organic, in the scientific disciplines, the basic definition comes from chemistry. In chemistry, organic means chemical compounds with carbon in them.
Carbon. By definition, organic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds that contain Carbon (C) with exception of carbonates, bicarbonates, metallic cyanides and carbides. Carbon.
 Proteins are organic compounds that consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and, in some cases, sulfur. They are made up of repeating units called amino acids. They provide cells with energy, form tissues, speed up chemical reactions throughout the body, and perform many other cellular functions.
