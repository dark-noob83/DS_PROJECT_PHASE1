When the microscope was invented around 1590, suddenly we saw a new world of living things in our water, in our food and under our nose. But it's unclear who invented the microscope. Some historians say it was Hans Lippershey, most famous for filing the first patent for a telescope. Other evidence points to Hans and Zacharias Janssen, a father-son team of spectacle makers living in the same town as Lippershey.

History of the Light Microscope. Light microscopes date at least to 1595, when Zacharias Jansen (1580–1638) of Holland invented a compound light microscope, one that used two lenses, with the second lens further magnifying the image produced by the first.
Like many inventions today there are disputes in origins of the original inventors. The same dispute applies to who invented the microscope. Dating back to the first century when glass was first invented, the Roman's were investigating the use of glass and how viewing objects through it, made the objects appear larger.
Compound microscope was invented in 17 th century. As to who invented the compound microscope is a question of controversy. There are three persons who claim to have invented it; Hans Lippershey, Zacharias and Hans Jansen and Giovanni Faber. The microscope was originally invented by Galileo who called it “Little Eye” but Giovanni Faber renamed it as “microscope”.
