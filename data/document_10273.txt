Carbon dioxide rich blood, which is red blood cells lacking oxygen but high in carbon dioxide concentration.These blood cells have circulated through the body and given up much of its oxygen while collecting waste carbon dioxide.
The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and is the only artery in the body that carries deoxygenated blood. The pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, and it is the only vein that carries oxygen-rich blood. 1 person found this useful.
The only artery that carries blood rich in carbon dioxide is the Pulmonary Artery.   Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart around the body (Systemic Circulation), … during what oxygen gets downloaded into the cells, and at the same time, carbon dioxide is taken up into the blood.
The circulatory system is your body’s transportation system. It carries nutrients and oxygen to all of your cells while removing carbon dioxide and other wastes from the cells. Distinguish between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the ventricles are contracting.
Systemic circulation delivers oxygen-rich blood to the body organs, tissues and cells. Some people also include a coronary circulation system that provides blood to nourish the heart cells. This system is part of the systemic circulation.
The circulatory system includes the heart, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins. The system is responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to organs, tissues and cells of the body, and for removing carbon dioxide and other waste products.
The heart and its network of blood vessels are called the circulatory system. The artery that carries oxygen rich blood cells away from your heart is called the aorta and the vein that takes it back again is called the vena cava. Your heart is made of two pumps.
