How much does it cost to renovate a property? According to Archicentre, the average renovation project in NSW is valued between $75,000 and $150,000. If you want to add an 80-square-metre ground-floor extension with inclusions, you’ll be looking at $164,526 to $310,896. Less than half of the expense will go towards materials. Labour will cost about 33 per cent of the overall amount, while fees, levies, permits, taxes and GST will eat up 21 per cent.
As a general guide, renovating a standard home will cost in the region of £500 to £1,000 per square metre, while new construction costs start at around £1,000 to £1,500 per square metre, depending on the design and quality of finish. Another method for gauging the overall cost of renovating a property is to start with the cost of new construction, let’s say £1,000 per square metre, and deduct the cost of things that won’t need to be renovated, for example the roof, walls and floors etc., if they are in good condition.
