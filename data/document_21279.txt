‘Atuk’, an as-yet-unproduced comedy about an Inuit moving to the big city, is one example. Four comedians had shown interest or been cast as the lead character at various times throughout the 1980’s and 90’s: John Belushi, Sam Kinison, John Candy and Chris Farley. The Freelings youngest daughter and the series’ focal point, Carol-Anne was played in all three movies by Heather O’Rourke. She would pass away suddenly in February 1988, prior to the release of ‘Poltergeist III’, at just 12 years old.
The ad I think is a tribute to Chris Farley's comic talents. Chris Farley performed that scene for Tommy Boy and his scene in the ad did not alter the performance to make him look bad at all. I think the ad is done in good taste. Chris Farley was an extremely funny guy no matter what he did! Spade is hanging on for dear life to get a paycheck. The commercial is kind of tacky but since I like Chris Farley, I don't have a problem with it at all. I just wish Spade was not in the commercial.

Last October, we had the spot with with Craig T. Nelson and Heather O'Rourke from Poltergeist, which was unfortunate, given that O'Rourke (who played Carol Anne) died tragically in 1988 at age 12. Now, a year later (hey, Halloween's coming up again), we get this Tommy Boy homage, with Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley, of course, died of a drug overdose in 1997. The whole dead-celebs thing is a gray area in advertising. Sometimes it seems less off-putting than other times. UPDATE: Asylum.com procured this statement from David Spade : When DIRECT TV came to me and the Farley family with this idea about 'Tommy Boy,' we talked and thought it would be a cool way to remind people just how funny Chris was.
DirecTV's Spade-Farley ad criticized as in poor taste. By Breeanna Hare, CNN. David Spade starred in Tommy Boy and Black Sheep with his friend and colleague Chris Farley. What some viewers find especially shocking is that Spade, who wrote in a 1998 Rolling Stone article that he didn't attend Farley's funeral because he couldn't be in the same room where Chris was in a box, went along with the promotion.
I never 'got' Chris Farley, thought he was not funny, and fat and he thought that was funny – I don't think this ad is any different, other than they chose a 'iffy' dead guy. some people liked him, lots thought he was gross, and if he died of an overdose, that's his problem/fault. Scott. I love the commercial. Chris Farley was an extremely funny guy no matter what he did! Spade is hanging on for dear life to get a paycheck. The commercial is kind of tacky but since I like Chris Farley, I don't have a problem with it at all. I just wish Spade was not in
