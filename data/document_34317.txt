These are the returns that are required to be filed on the death of a person for whom you are the executor: 1. T1 Terminal Return for the year of death. This is a personal tax return for the person who died, as opposed to his or her estate. It will cover the period starting on January 1 of the year of death and ending on the date of death.
If a person dies after December 31, but before the filing due date for his or her return (usually April 30), and that person had not yet filed a return for the previous year, the due date for that return is six months after the date of death.

Here is what happens to your non-registered and registered assets when you die:
