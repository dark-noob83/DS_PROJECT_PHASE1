From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The hectare (/ˈhɛktɛər/ or /ˈhɛktɑr/ ; symbol ha) is an SI accepted metric system unit of area equal to 100 ares (10,000 m 2) and primarily used in the measurement of land. An acre is about 0.4047 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres. In 1795, when the metric system was introduced, the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto-  + are) was thus 100 ares or 1⁄100 km 2.
