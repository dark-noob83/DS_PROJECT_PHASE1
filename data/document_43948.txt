Fungal diseases are often caused by fungi that are common in the environment. Most fungi are not dangerous, but some types can be harmful to health. Mild fungal skin diseases can look like a rash and are very common. Fungal diseases in the lungs are often similar to other illnesses such as the flu or tuberculosis. Some fungal diseases like fungal meningitis and bloodstream infections are less common than skin and lung infections but can be deadly. 1  Types of fungal diseases Read about different types of fungal diseases.
Symptoms of Fungal Root Rot Rhizoctonia sp. Symptoms: Root rot occurs when the medium breaks down, drainage is poor and/or plants are overwatered. Rot sets in quickly when roots are damaged by injury or salt buildup from hard water or over fertilizing. 
Understanding the difference between bacteria, fungus and virus will help with the diagnosis. Plant diseases can be difficult to diagnose. So often, they display the same symptoms as plants that are perfectly healthy, except for stresses imposed upon them by our poor cultural practices. When a plant is diseased, it is because of a bacteria, fungus, or virus. Not all bacteria are bad for plants and soil. In fact, most are beneficial, and there are millions! However, there are approximately 200 types of bacteria that cause diseases in plants. They are most active in warm and humid environments, so this is when you’ll see the most evidence of their presence.
Most plant diseases – around 85 percent – are caused by fungal or fungal-like organisms. However, other serious diseases of food and feed crops are caused by viral and bacterial organisms. Certain nematodes also cause plant disease. Here are a few examples of common signs and symptoms of fungal, bacterial and viral plant diseases: Fungal disease signs: 1  Leaf rust (common leaf rust in corn). 2  Stem rust (wheat stem rust).
A plant disease is usually defined as abnormal growth and/or dysfunction of a plant. Diseases are the result of some disturbance in the normal life process of the plant. Diseases may be the result of living and/or non-living causes. Biotic diseases are caused by living organisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. 
You are not actually seeing the disease pathogen, but rather a symptom that is being caused by the pathogen. Here are a few examples of common signs and symptoms of fungal, bacterial and viral plant diseases: Fungal disease signs: 1  Leaf rust (common leaf rust in corn). 2  Stem rust (wheat stem rust). 3  Sclerotinia (white mold)
But, unlike bacteria, there are thousands of fungi that are harmful to plants. For this reason, you are likely to encounter fungal problems most often. Because fungi are present in the soil and above ground symptoms of fungal attack can appear above and below ground. Not all bacteria are bad for plants and soil. In fact, most are beneficial, and there are millions! However, there are approximately 200 types of bacteria that cause diseases in plants. They are most active in warm and humid environments, so this is when you’ll see the most evidence of their presence.
Symptoms are abnormal states that indicate a bodily disorder. It is important that all concerned, Master Gardeners, Master Gardener coordinators, county agents, and UF plant pathologists use the same terminology when describing disease symptoms. Obviously, it is showing symptoms of wilt. This is an isolated plant among many healthy-looking ones in a large watermelon patch. Therefore, it is likely to be a disease rather than merely a lack of water. This is one of the most important diseases of watermelon in Florida-Fusarium wilt (a fungus disease).
Most bacteria that are associated with plants are actually saprotrophic, and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, are able to cause disease. Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world. Organisms that cause infectious disease include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants. Not included are ectoparasites like insects, mites, vertebrate, or other pests that affect plant health by consumption of plant tissues
