Balanced and Unbalanced forces: - You must consider all forces acting on an object to predict changes in the object s motion. - The overall force acting on an object when all the forces are combined is called net force. - Balanced forces means that the velocity of the object is staying constant, even if it is a 0m/s. They have no effect. - If you have two forces in the same direction, the forces can be added. - Forces in opposite directions are subtracted from each other.
In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate.
Background: Newton’s 2nd Law – If an unbalanced (net) force acts on an object, that object will accelerate (or decelerate) in the direction of the force. Newton’s 3rd Law – For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. A body at rest is considered to have zero speed (a constant speed).
The friction force is the force exerted by a surface as an object moves across it or makes an effort to move across it. There are at least two types of friction force-sliding and static friction. Though it is not always the case, the friction force often opposes the motion of an object.
If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
Balance forces are two forces acting in opposite directions on an object, and equal in size. Anytime there is a balanced force on an abject, the object stays still or continues moving continues to move at the same speed and in the same direction.
