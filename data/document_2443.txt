Overall, autoimmune diseases are common, affecting more than 23.5 million Americans. They are a leading cause of death and disability. Yet some autoimmune diseases are rare, while others, such as Hashimoto's disease, affect many people.
Autoimmune diseases are caused by the overreaction of an individual’s immune system. The immune system provides the body with protection from threats such as parasites, bacteria, fungus and viruses. In the case of an autoimmune disease, the body mistakes normal body tissue to be a threat and attacks it.
