Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy, is a complication of type 1 or type 2 diabetes caused by damage to the kidneys' delicate filtering system. Your kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood.
Nephropathy means kidney disease or damage. Diabetic nephropathy is damage to your kidneys caused by diabetes. In severe cases it can lead to kidney failure. But not everyone with diabetes has kidney damage. The kidneys have many tiny blood vessels that filter waste from your blood.
Kidney disease in type 1 diabetes is slightly different than in type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, kidney disease rarely begins in the first 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, some patients already have kidney disease by the time they are diagnosed with diabetes.
One of the more common long-term complications of diabetes is diabetic renal disease (renal refers to the kidneys). Also known as diabetic nephropathy, this condition is a result of direct vascular abnormalities that accompany diabetes.
High blood pressure is the other leading cause of kidney disease in people with diabetes. High blood pressure also is a result of damage from kidney disease. If you have high blood pressure, your kidneys may already be damaged. Even a small rise in blood pressure can quickly make kidney disease worse.
Diabetic nephropathy -- kidney disease that results from diabetes -- is the number one cause of kidney failure. Almost a third of people with diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy. People with diabetes and kidney disease do worse overall than people with kidney disease alone. This is because people with diabetes tend to have other long-standing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and blood vessel disease (atherosclerosis).
