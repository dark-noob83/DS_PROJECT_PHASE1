Although the origin of the environmental justice movement is traced to the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Robert Bullard’s work entitled Dumping in Dixie published in the 1990’s is considered to be the first book addressing the reality of environmental injustice.
The movement was sanctioned in April 1970 with a nationwide quasi-holiday, the first Earth Day.. New organizations formed to rally the masses: Friends of the Earth (1969), the Natural Resources Defense Council (1970), and Canadian-born Greenpeace (1971).
Two Traditions in American Conservation. The traditional conservation movement took form in the 1890s, marked by the founding of the Sierra Club in California in 1892 and the first state Audubon societies in Massachusetts and New York in 1896.
The 1960s was a period of growth for the environmental movement. The movement began with a newfound interest in preservationist issues. In that decade, membership in former conservationist organizations like the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club skyrocketed from 123,000 in 1960 to 819,000 in 1970.
Still others might point to May 28, 1892 as the day when the U.S. environmental movement began. That is the date of the first meeting of the Sierra Club, which was founded by noted preservationist John Muir and is generally acknowledged as the first environmental group in the United States.
April 22, 1970, the date of the first Earth Day celebration in the United States, is often cited as the start of the modern environmental movement.
Today, a common practice in celebration of Earth Day is still to plant new trees. Cherry trees blooming in Antelope Valley California, as captured by our friend Kerri Willerford. Thanks Kerri! The first Earth Day – April 22, 1970 – marked the beginning of the modern environmental movement. Approximately 20 million Americans, especially on college campuses, participated in a national teach-in on environmental issues and protests against environmental deterioration on the first Earth Day.
The environmental movement is an international movement, represented by a range of organizations, from the large to grassroots and varies from country to country.
