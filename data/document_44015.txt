Macromolecules play vital roles within your body. Macromolecules are large molecules within your body that serve essential physiological functions. Encompassing carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, macromolecules exhibit a number of similarities. For example, all except lipids are long chains made up of smaller building blocks, and digestion reduces the size of macromolecules so your body can absorb their component parts. However, they also demonstrate distinct differences.
Your cells contain two types of nucleic acids, ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, or RNA and DNA, respectively. They differ from the other macronutrients in that they are not a source of calories in your diet, and their role is strictly to direct the synthesis of new protein molecules. For example, all except lipids are long chains made up of smaller building blocks, and digestion reduces the size of macromolecules so your body can absorb their component parts. However, they also demonstrate distinct differences.
The smallest component in carbohydrates is sugar, and in proteins, it is amino acid. Both carbohydrates and proteins give out energy of 4 Kcal per gram. Both can be used as energy sources. But proteins are used for different other messenger molecules and nucleic acid and vitamins. Use in sports and muscle activity is similar in both molecules, but the make up of muscles is mainly proteins. Related posts: 1  Difference Between Carbohydrates and Lipids. Monosaccharide is the simplest and they are called simple sugars. These include glucose and sucrose. They are used in the human body as an energy source and a base product for synthesis. Glucose is the main form in the body, and it can be stored as glycogen.
there are more but these are the important ones. The difference between Carbohydrates (sugars) and Lipids: 1) sugars disolve in water lipids don't 2) sugars are made-up of subunits that form large polymers and lipids are not and don't form polymers. 3)Lipids store more energy than sugars. 
The simple answer is lipids are generally molecules that mix poorly with water and proteins are the basic building blocks of tissues. Proteins can be and are often larger than … lipids, usually falling into the macromolecule category. 
Carbohydrates, lipids and proteins make up the three macronutrients. Their dietary requirements are high relative to the micronutrients, also known as vitamins and minerals. All macronutrients are organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sometimes other elements. For example, proteins and carbohydrates are water-soluble, but most lipids are not, so lipids require some extra work for the body to process.
However, there are some differences between lipids and carbohydrates. 1. Lipids are made up of extra nitrogen and sulphur and envelope a wide range of sub varieties of molecules. 2. Lipids include vitamins, whereas carbohydrates do not. 3. Lipids have a function in cellular signaling, whereas carbohydrates do not. 4. Carbohydrates release energy of 4 kcal per gram, whereas lipids release 9 kcal per gram. Thus, these two types of biochemical are present in the human body and are taken in the form of food.
The four major classes of organic molecules include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids .​. Carbohydrates. The term carbohydrate is actually a descriptor of what these molecules are composed of; carbon hydrates, in a ratio of one carbon molecule to one water molecule (CH2O)n. 
Carbohydrates and lipids, such as those in an avocado, are digested in different ways. Both carbohydrates and lipids offer important nutrients to your diet. Carbohydrates offer a ready source of fuel to your cells, while lipids can store energy in your fat tissue for later use. Lipids also provide fat-soluble vitamins and are a structural part of membranes and hormones.
use the info that you need or discard it. Take care Carbohydrates: Technically speaking, a carbohydrate is a compound made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The most basic carbohydrates are called simple sugars and include honey, jams, jellies, syrup, table sugar, candies, soft drinks, fruits, and fruit juices. Glucose (also called dextrose) is a common simple sugar found in fruits, honey, and vegetables. Lipids contain a lot of calories in a small space. Since Lipids are generally insoluble in polar substances such as water, they are stored in special ways in you body's cells. Lipids can also function as structural components in the cell. Phospholipids are the major building blocks of cell membranes.
