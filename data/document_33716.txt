This measurement should be 0.12-0.20 seconds, or 3-5 small squares in duration. The second measurement is the width of the QRS which should be less than 3 small squares, or less than 0.12 seconds in duration. Image: Normal Intervals. 1  P-R interval = 0.12 - 0.20 sec (3 - 5 small squares). 2  QRS width = 0.08 - 0.12 sec (2 - 3 small squares). 3  Q-T interval 0.35 - 0.43 sec.
1 Normal QRS width is 70-100 ms (a duration of 110 ms is sometimes observed in healthy subjects). 2  The QRS width is useful in determining the origin of each QRS complex (e.g. sinus, atrial, junctional or ventricular).
1 2. 2. 2  The average duration of the QRS complex in 100 normal adults was 0.0777 second. 3  Fifty of the patients were males with an average duration of the QRS time interval of 0.0833 second, and 50 were females with a shorter time interval of 0.0722 second.

P Wave. The P wave represents atrial depolarization. In a normal EKG, the P-wave precedes the QRS complex. It looks like a small bump upwards from the baseline. The amplitude is normally 0.05 to 0.25mV (0.5 to 2.5 small boxes). Normal duration is 0.06-0.11 seconds (1.5 to 2.7
