Fluxus emerged in New York led by artist George Maciunas, and there were also Fluxus groups in Europe and Japan. The Happenings artists were not part of an organized group with a leader like the Fluxus group and the term Happenings is not the name of a movement but the name of certain performance pieces.
There is no single process that can really express the feelings and emotions of an artist. Fluxus, a global network of artists, fused together different elements to produce unique and distinguished art pieces. The group, which originated back in the 1960s, consisted of composers, designers and artists.
Maciunas is credited with naming the group Fluxus, which means to flow.. The first Fluxus event was organized by Maciunas at the AG Gallery in New York in 1961, where he was co-owner. The event was called Bread & AG, and consisted of readings by poet Frank Kuenstler.
Fluxus was a loosely organized group of artists that spanned the globe, but had an especially strong presence in New York City. George Maciunas is historically considered the primary founder and organizer of the movement, who described Fluxus as, a fusion of Spike Jones, gags, games, Vaudeville, Cage and Duchamp..
Fluxus is an international avant-garde group or collective that was founded and flourished in the1960s but still continues today.
Fluxus Manifesto, 1963, by George Maciunas. Fluxus is an international network of artists, composers and designers noted for blending different artistic media and disciplines in the 1960s.

â€¢ Fun-Humor is an integral part of what Fluxus represents. Fluxus artists are a rather small group of creative people but their members are very high esteemed in the industry and with big followers. These include the names Eric Andersen, Ay-O, Giuseppe Chari, Terry Riley, John Armleder and Al Hansen, among many others.
