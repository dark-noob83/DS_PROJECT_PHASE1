Students review the parts of their body. BACKGROUND: The human body is composed of organs that are part of different body systems that allow the human body to work. The design of the body will be explored as well as the different tissues that combine to make the different organs such as the heart and lungs.
One of the most important systems in your body, the nervous system is your body's control system. It sends, receives, and processes nerve impulses throughout the body. These nerve impulses tell your muscles and organs what to do and how to respond to the environment.
Human anatomy is the study of the systems of the body which is made up of cells, tissues, and organs. Human anatomy is important to study to help explain how organs and other structures of the body work. There are eight systems in the human body.
The circulatory system is the body's transport system. It is made up of a group of organs that transport blood throughout the body. The heart pumps the blood and the arteries and veins transport it. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left side of the heart and enters the biggest artery, called the aorta.
At this level, children can begin to view the body as a system, in which parts do things for other parts and for the organism as a whole. Through the use of an online interactive activity, children learn about the concept of separate components working together to build a body system.
The muscular system is made up of tissues that work with the skeletal system to control movement of the body. Some muscles—like the ones in your arms and legs—are voluntary, meaning that you decide when to move them. Other muscles, like the ones in your stomach, heart, intestines and other organs, are involuntary.
The organ systems of the body include the musculoskeletal system, circulatory system, digestive system, endocrine system, integumentary system, urinary system, lymphatic system, immune system, respiratory system, nervous system and reproductive system.
