Inheritance and Genetics Information. Inheritance of Narcolepsy: There is strong evidence that narcolepsy may run in families; 8 to 12 percent of people with narcolepsy have a close relative with the disease. (Source: excerpt from Narcolepsy: NWHIC).
One of the causes of narcolepsy is a genetic mutation. In 1999 researchers identified the gene that causes the disorder. The narcolepsy gene allows cells in the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates sleep behavior) to receive messages from other cells. As a result of the mutation, the cells cannot communicate properly, and abnormal sleeping patterns develop.
STANFORD-After a decade-long search, a Stanford-led team has identified a gene that causes the sleep disorder narcolepsy-a breakthrough that brings a cure for this disabling condition within reach, the scientists say.
Narcolepsy is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal manifestations of REM sleep including cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Narcolepsy is both a significant medical problem and a unique disease model for the study of sleep.
Narcolepsy is the only known neurological disorder that affects the brain and sleep in such a dramatic way, said Mignot, who is director of Stanford's Center for Narcolepsy. It affects both humans and animals and has both genetic and sporadic forms.
Narcolepsy has a genetic component and tends to run in families. Experts estimate that around 8 - 10% of people with narcolepsy have a close relative who has the disorder. The risk for narcolepsy among first-degree relatives (parents or sibling) is 1 - 2%.
Most people with narcolepsy have the HLA-DQB1*06:02 variation, and many also have specific versions of other, closely related HLA genes. It is unclear how these genetic changes influence the risk of developing the condition. Variations in several additional genes have also been associated with narcolepsy.
