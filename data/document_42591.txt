Domestic adoption. For those looking to adopt a baby but who don't want to fly around the world to adopt one, private domestic adoption is a comparable and sometimes cheaper option, with costs ranging from $20,000 to $30,000. The time it takes from start to finish can be shorter, too -- around a year. 
Cost. The difference in cost between international adoption and domestic adoption is a common misconception that many adoptive families share. Many mistakenly believe that international adoption costs far less than domestic adoption; however, this is not true. Both types of adoption have similar total costs, typically ranging from around $25,000 to $50,000, but they both have their own unique costs. One of the first dilemmas families face is whether to pursue domestic adoption or international adoption. There are many factors adoptive parents must consider: cost, wait time, children available, medical and social history and legal concerns.
Fees for intercountry adoption range from $7,000 to $25,000, including agency fees, dossier and immigration processing fees, and court costs. However, there may be additional costs for the following items which are usually not included in the fees: 1  Child foster care (usually in South and Central American adoptions). Domestic Independent Adoptions. Adoptive families who pursue independent adoptions report spending $8,000 to $30,000 and more depending on several factors. Independent adoptions are now allowed in most states, but advertising in newspapers, magazines, etc. seeking birth parents is not allowed in all states.
In every domestic adoption the fees involved can vary and they can have a large range. All too often the adoption agencies, adoption facilitators, and attorneys do not outline all the costs ahead of time and that means you could spend much more than you originally planned. If you adopt a healthy U.S. newborn or infant through one of our programs, the average TOTAL of all the fees listed in the above sections will be approximately $40,000 to $55,000. The range is large and depends on the medical coverage for the baby and birth mother.
The truth is that most families successfully adopt within two years of beginning the process. The cost of a domestic adoption varies widely, from under $15,000 to more than $50,000. According to surveys conducted annually by Adoptive Families, the median total cost of a domestic adoption is $30,000 to $45,000, which tends to be considerably less than that of a typical international adoption. Pingback: $30,000 is the cost recently given by Holt International for an adoption from the Philippines, so the numbers given here would not be significantly less than an international adoption from this agency.
