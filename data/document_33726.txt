1 On average, the cost of choosing a gender is going to greatly depend on the type used. 2  Sperm sorting, for instance, can cost as little as $1,000 to $3,000 per each attempt, while an IVF can cost at least $12,000 to $25,000 per attempt. 1 There are two common types of gender selection methods: sperm sorting and in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis. 2  Sperm sorting is a technique that has been used for more than 30 years now.
The least expensive high-tech method of gender selection, Ericsson Method plus IUI, can range in price from $600 to $1,200 per attempt. However, this method is not very accurate, according to fertility experts. However, a recent 2010 study that followed nearly 400 women from eight fertility clinics in California found that the average cost of one cycle of IVF was much higher — $24,373. Adding PGS/PGD to a cycle of IVF typically adds an average of $3,550 to the procedure. PGS/PGD for gender selection is typically not covered by insurance
Gender Selection Costs. Whether it’s the concern of passing on a genetic disorder or a case of family balancing, gender selection gives parents the freedom to choose the preferred sex of their child.
In vitro fertilization (IVF) is necessary in order to use PGD; IVF also includes the use of fertility drugs. The cost of an IVF cycle typically averages $8,158. The medications for an IVF cycle cost an additional $3,000 - $5,000 on average. The PGD procedure alone runs an average of $3,550. In addition, the cost of embryo cryopreservation averages between $700 and $900, while the storage of the embryos costs $600 to $1,000 annually. IVF with PGD for gender selection is not covered by insurance. Whether it’s the concern of passing on a genetic disorder or a case of family balancing, gender selection gives parents the freedom to choose the preferred sex of their child.

The cost of IVF averages between $8,000 and $12,000 depending on fertility drugs and other factors involved in the cycle. The cost of PGD (to determine which embryos are boy and girl) is usually around $4,000 additional. So, the total is betweeen $12,000-$16,000. You may have insurance coverage for the IVF depending on which state you live in, but the cost of PGD is not covered by insurance.

The cost of gender selection is basically the cost of an assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedure, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI), plus the cost of the gender selection method — Ericsson Method or preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) .
