Gregg now works with Parkinson's More Than Motion, a campaign from pharmaceutical company UCB, Inc., to educate people about the different symptoms of the disease.

Repetitive motion disorders (RMDs) are a family of muscular conditions that result from repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or daily activities. RMDs include carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis, tendonitis, epicondylitis, ganglion cyst, tenosynovitis, and trigger finger. RMDs are caused by too many uninterrupted repetitions of an activity or motion, unnatural or awkward motions such as twisting the arm or wrist, overexertion, incorrect posture, or muscle fatigue.
Repetitive motion syndrome is a term used to describe symptoms such as pain, swelling, or tenderness that occur from repeating the same motion over and over. Experts disagree about using the term as a specific medical diagnosis. Repeated use of the same motion may cause tissues to swell and become fatigued. 
Diagnosis : Most cases of motion sickness are mild and self-treatable disorders. If symptoms such as dizziness become chronic, a doctor may be able to help alleviate the discomfort by looking further into a patient's general health. Severe cases of motion sickness symptoms, and those that become progressively worse, may require additional, specific tests. Diagnosis in these situations deserves the attention and care of a doctor with specialized skills in diseases of the ear, nose, throat, equilibrium, and neurological system. Prognosis :
Parkinson’s disease is primarily a movement (motor) disorder that causes movement symptoms. But it can also cause “non-motor” symptoms, such as changes in mood. It’s important to remember that different people can have different symptoms of Parkinson’s. Early on, symptoms are usually very mild. Common Movement Problems. Movement problems are the most common symptoms of Parkinson’s. Early on, movement problems usually affect only one side of the body, often with shakiness (tremors), stiffness, or problems with coordination.

Sleep problems are a feature of the disease and can be worsened by medications. Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness, disturbances in REM sleep, or insomnia. A systematic review shows that sleep attacks occur in 13.0% of patients with Parkinson's disease on dopaminergic medications.
