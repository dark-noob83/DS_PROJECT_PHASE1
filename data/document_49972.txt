If you already own your lot, your equity in the property can be included as part of the collateral for the construction loan. If you bought the land with a lot loan, then the construction loan typically would be used to payoff and refinance that first loan.
Home Equity Loan. If the equity in your home or other properties is high enough, consider taking out a home equity loan to purchase the land. Interest on this type of loan is tax deductible. This option allows you to pay cash for the land and puts you in a better position when applying for a construction loan.
Land Loan. If you want to build a house on the land, approach the lender for a land loan. Certain banks offer terms that are better than construction loans for the period of construction and then wrap both loans into a mortgage once the building is complete.
A fundamental basis for this difference is that, before providing financing for your purchase of vacant land or a construction loan to build your home, a bank needs to understand your plans for the property.
Improved property, zoned for your intended use, will be easier to get a loan for than unimproved property. Land purchased with immediate plans for construction is the easiest type of land loan to secure because the lender will be paid off when a mortgage is obtained on the structure. Beyond home equity loans, here's a list of other options you can consider.
FHA loans are loans that are insured against default by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) which allows YOU to get a better loan through lenders approved to do FHA loans. Easy FHA takes this already great loan program and makes it an easy and fast process.
