Balance Disorders. The body's ability to balance is very complicated. Your eyes, your muscles and the inner ear's gyroscope mechanism send information to your brain. The brain then interprets this information and tells your body how to move to stay balanced and upright.
Balance disorders are disturbances in co-ordination that makes a person feel unsteady, dizzy or have a sensation of movement or spinning. The problem more often than not lies within the ears. Within the ear is a part called the inner ear.
What causes a balance disorder? A balance disorder may be caused by viral or bacterial infections in the ear, a head injury, or blood circulation disorders that affect the inner ear or brain. Many people experience problems with their sense of balance as they get older.
Diagnosis of a balance disorder is complicated because there are many kinds of balance disorders and because other medical conditions--including ear infections, blood pressure changes, and some vision problems--and some medications may contribute to a balance disorder.
