Bronchi are the main passageway into the lungs. When someone takes a breath through their nose or mouth, the air travels into the larynx. The next step is through the trachea, which carries the air to the left and right bronchus.
Glossary of Terms. Bronchus / Bronchi / Bronchioles. The airways of the lungs. When a person takes in a breath of air, the air travels through the nose or mouth, into the larynx, then into the trachea, which is the main passageway into the lungs. The trachea divides into a right and left main bronchus.
An interactive Flash diagram of the bronchioles. The bronchioles are the smallest air-conducting passages in the lung, less than 1 mm in diameter, and they connect the larger airways to the alveoli where gas exchange takes place.
The bronchi are the tubes which carry air from the trachea to the inner recces of thelungs, where it can transfer oxygen to the blood in the alveoli. Two main bronchi, the right and left bronchus, branch off of the low end of the trachea in what is called the tracheal bifurcation.
Bronchioles are small airways that branch off the bronchi in the  lungs. Their role is to transport air to the alveoli where gas  exchange can take place. The areas of gas e â€¦ xchange, the alveoli,  are part of respiratory bronchioles. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon  dioxide in order to oxygenate the blood.
