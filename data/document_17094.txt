Calculate target heartrate by subtracting your age from 220 (220-30=190). Subtract your average resting heart rate from target heartrate (190-70=120). The lower boundary of the percentage range is 50% of this plus your resting heart rate [(120 x .5) + 70 = 130]. The higher boundary is 85% plus your RHR [(120 x .85) + 70 =178]. Using the Karvonen Formula for percentage of heartrate reserve, this 30-year old man should be working between 130 and 178 BPM
If that's the case for you, then taking your heart rate during exercise and using a target heart rate training zone might be just the ticket. Target heart rate zones range anywhere from 50% to 100% of your maximum heart rate (your maximum heart rate is based on your age). Aerobic exercise is anything less than 85%, and anaerobic exercise is anything above that. If you plug in other values, you can get other ranges. 1  220-age = Max HR. 2  Subtract resting heart rate from Max HR = Heart Rate Reserve (HRR). 3  Multiply HRR times percent you want to train at. 4  Add back resting heart rate. 5  Assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm, 27 years old, and 70% training range: 6  220 - 27 = 193.
Normal resting heart rates range from 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention. The normal resting adult human heart rate ranges from 60–100 bpm. Tachycardia is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 BPM is common and is considered normal.
You can calculate your target heart rate by following these three steps: If you are 50 years old, your MaxHR is 220 - 50, or 170 beats per minute. Multiplying 170 by 0.85 gives you a maximum target rate of 144. Multiplying 170 by 0.50 gives you a minimum target rate of 85. Thus, your target heart range is 85 to 144.
Target Heart Rate Zone Calculator. The safest and most effective pace for your heart to be beating during exercise is at 50-85 percent of its maximum capacity. This calculator provides you with an approximate target range for your heart rate during exercise, based on this recommendation. How to measure your resting heart rate (RHR) (hide). 
A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute. Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) — especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.
Recommended target range: to beats per minute. Note: these calculations are based on averages. It is recommended that you exercise within 55 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate for at least 20 to 30 minutes to get the best results from aerobic exercise.
To determine your desired target heart rate zone, use an online calculator. Or, here's a simple way to do the math yourself. If you're aiming for a target heart rate of 70 to 85 percent, which is in the vigorous range, you would calculate it like this: 1  Subtract your age from 220 to get your maximum heart rate. 2  Multiple that number by 0.7 (70 percent) to determine the lower end of your target heart rate zone. 
1 Multiply your maximum heart rate reserve by 0.7 to determine 70% of your heart rate reserve. 2  Add this number to your resting heart rate. 3  Voila. 4  Voilà your target heart rate range is between your lower and upper limit of your heart.  rate If you are 50 years old, your MaxHR is 220 - 50, or 170 beats per minute. Multiplying 170 by 0.85 gives you a maximum target rate of 144. Multiplying 170 by 0.50 gives you a minimum target rate of 85. Thus, your target heart range is 85 to 144.
