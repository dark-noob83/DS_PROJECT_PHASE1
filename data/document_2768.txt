Simply stating Not a valid URL form or what ever it was and not pointing at the field in question is not good enough. sanibelaccom1 2012-05-21 20:51:32 UTC #8.

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) (commonly informally referred to as a web address, although the term is not defined identically) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).
In your supplementary question you asked if www.example.com/file[/].html is a valid URL. That URL isn't valid because a URL is a type of URI and a valid URI must have a scheme like http: (see RFC 3986). If c is not a URL code point and not %, parse error. If your use case is web development, you should look at what HTML5 has to say. In particular, several of Unicode character ranges are valid in HTML5, although it might still not be a good idea to use them.

alanpmcd. The href parameter must reference a valid Facebook page, but http://facebook.com/script.yorkshire is not a valid Facebook page.

URL tags help you identify what traffic is coming from specific ad campaigns you're running by letting you know which link a person clicked to get to your ad destination. Keep in mind that although you can add URL tags to your ads on Facebook, you'll need to use a third-party analytics tool to track the results...
