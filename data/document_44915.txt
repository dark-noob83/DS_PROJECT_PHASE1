Hardwood floors have two main costs. The cost of the flooring, which ranges from about $4.50 per square foot and up. The cost of labor which typically runs between $3.00 to $5.00 per square foot. There will be added costs if the contractor has to tear up an old floor. So measure the room dimensions. Say $5.00 per sqft for flooring and $4.00 per sqft for labor = $9.00 per sqft total.

Another alternative is a much thinner wood (about 3/8 thick) which is about $3.00 per sqft.
