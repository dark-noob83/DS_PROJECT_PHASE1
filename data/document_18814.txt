Diatoms are unicellular algae which form distinct and beautiful cell walls from silica. They are widely distributed throughout the upper layers of the oceans of the world, and can also be found in fresh water or moist environments, such as the undersides of plants.
Diatoms are algae with distinctive, transparent cell walls made of silicon dioxide hydrated with a small amount of water (Si02 + H20). Silica is the main component of glass and hydrated silica is very like the mineral opal, making these algae, often called algae in glass houses more like algae in opal houses.
Similar to many other algae, they can live as unicellular organisms, colonial, or filamentous. Unlike most algae, though, they have a solid shells made of silica. Because of such shells, diatoms have major economic importance in industry while also having a major role in biological and chemical processes. Almost all of the extant and extinct species of Bacillariophyta are aquatic.
Generally most green algae are highly palatable and a good food source for zooplankton. Diatoms appear as yellow-green or yellow-brown algae that occur singly or more rarely in colonies. The cell wall comprises two separate valves or shells formed of silica (a major component of glass).
Lesson Summary. Diatoms are single-celled algae that form a silica-based cell wall. They are broken up into two major groups, the centric diatoms and the pennate diatoms, based on the form of their frustule. Diatoms live in all aquatic environments, including the ocean, freshwater lakes, and moist soils.
Nearly all diatoms are microscopic-cells range in size from about 2 microns to about 500 microns (0.5 mm), or about the width of a human hair (note that one micron is equal to 10 -6 meter).
