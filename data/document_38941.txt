A ghostwriter given credit charges an average of $73 an hour, while those without credit tend to charge $70 an hour. However, the high end of hourly rates is where it falls back in line with the pay per project costs, with rates upward of $100 an hour with credit and $115 an hour without credit.
Affordable Ghostwriters. U.S. ghostwriters typically charge from $20,000 to $80,000 for a 200- to 300-page book. The Canadian Writer's Union has set a minimum fee of $25,000 for a book of the same length. A professional ghostwriter can accurately estimate how much time and money a project will require.
A report from the Writers Market indicates that ghostwriting fees range from a low of $5,000 to a high of $100,000, with an average of $36,000. You can find writers on some of the online job sites who’ll work for incredibly low fees.
Pay Per Project. Because most ghostwriters are freelancers, they tend to charge on a per project basis. In book publishing, the average cost per project is $22,800, with earnings ranging up to $80,000 per manuscript. But these figures only account for the rate when the writer is given credit for his work.
1 The price will depend on how much research and interviewing will be required. 2  If someone has 300 pages of notes, requiring less research on my part, I’d probably charge the lower figure. 3  After talking to several ghostwriters, I have seen the range be anywhere from $15,000 to $150,000 for a non-celebrity book.
1 Some ghostwriters charge by the hour and some by the project. 2  Either way, a ghostwriter is a professional. 3  Think about what you pay other professionals: For example, I pay my “computer guy” $75/hour.
Ghostwriters charge a wide range of fees for their services. A quality book takes time, research, and ability, if you want it written well. Experienced, published ghostwriters might charge $10,000 to $20,000 for their services and proven successes. Technical writing or specialized subject matter (such as law, medicine, etc.) will usually demand a higher rate, as much as $40,000 to $50,000. Less experienced ghostwriters might charge $5,000 or less.
