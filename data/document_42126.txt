Corn beef brisket requires long, slow, moist cooking, either on the stove top or in the oven. (How to Cook Like Your Grandmother has an excellent photo-tutorial on cooking corned beef in the oven.) I’ll show you the stove-top version. Set the brisket in a large heavy pot with a lid. Cover the brisket with water. 
So, even though you'll be baking it, put the corned beef in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil while you also preheat an oven to 350°F. Discard the water and repeat. Seriously. You want to draw out more of the salt before you bake it. Set the corned beef fat side-up in a baking pan and cover with foil. Bake for 2 hours. Unwrap, position an oven rack in the top third of the oven, and bake until the top is browned and crispy, about 30 minutes.

Cooking. To cook prepared corned beef, place it in a large pot along with the liquid and spices that accompanied it in the package. Pour in enough water to cover the beef, then bring the water to a boil on the stovetop. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cover the pot. A three-pound corned beef will take about three hours to become perfectly tender. Check the meat occasionally, adding more water if necessary.
Drain the water and pat the corned beef dry. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Layer a large piece of tin foil in a baking pan then place the corned beef fat side up on top of the foil. Combine the mustard and honey together and mix until well combined. Pour 1/4 of the sauce into a serving dish and set aside for dipping.
