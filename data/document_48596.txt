Alternative Treatment for Melanoma. While the best treatment for melanoma is dependent on the stage of the cancer as well as the individualâ€™s overall health, alternative methods offer safe, natural treatment options. Eggplant, bloodroot and essiac tea deliver natural components to treat and eliminate the affected skin cells.
Melanoma is the most common type of skin cancer; however, with effective treatment, melanoma can most often be eliminated. Nonetheless, avoiding overexposure to the sun and protecting the skin when exposed is important for preventing the condition.
Safe use of supplements and botanicals. It is important to remember that vitamins, minerals, herbs and other therapies have strong effects on the body. Some supplements may interact with your medications or cancer treatments, or may be contraindicated for your cancer type.
