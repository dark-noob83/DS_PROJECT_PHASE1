30 minutes before the end of the cooking time remove the prime rib roast from the oven and check the internal temperature. For the roast to be rare the internal temperature should be 120°F to 125°F but remove from the oven when it is 115°F to 120°F and allow to stand for 20 minutes. 1 Cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. 2  Remove every 30 minutes and turn the roast in the marinade. 3  Remove from the refrigerator and allow the prime rib to set out for approximately two hours before cooking. 4  Allow it to reach room temperature before placing in the oven.
Preheat oven to 450°F. Place the roast (ribs down) on the rack in a roasting pan. Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450°F), and then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325° F) for the rest of the cooking time. About 1/2 hour before the estimated end of the roasting time, begin checking the internal temperature (use a good instant-read digital meat thermometer. 
Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 1 hour 45 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour 30 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°. 4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare
1 Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 2  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 3  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 4  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5
Sear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast. Prime Rib Roast (standing rib roast), at room temperature (very important) 2 tablespoons butter, room temperature. Preparation: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Pat the room-temperature standing rib roast (prime rib roast) dry with paper towels or napkins. Smear the cut ends only of the roast with the butter.

1 After 20 minutes of high heat cooking reduce heat to 350°F and continue to roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes OR until the meat thermometer reads 130°F for rare doneness OR 140°F for medium-rare doneness, that is the way a prime rib really should be served, check your roast after 1 hour cooking time. 1 Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F. 2  Medium-rare; cook 14-16 minutes per pound or to 140°F (I would not recommend cooking a prime rib any more than medium-rare). 3  Since every oven cooks differently cooking times are only approximate.
1 *NOTE* if desired you can cover the roast loosely with foil the first hour and then uncover and cook for the remaining time. --------------------------------------------. 2  APPROXIMATE COOKING TIMES for the prime rib cooked at 350°F after the 20 minute cooking time at 450°F. 3  Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F. 1 Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F. 2  Medium-rare; cook 14-16 minutes per pound or to 140°F (I would not recommend cooking a prime rib any more than medium-rare). 3  Since every oven cooks differently cooking times are only approximate.
