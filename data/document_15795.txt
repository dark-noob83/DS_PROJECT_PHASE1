Pain and swelling in the wrist will usually cause a person with a scaphoid fracture to see a doctor. X-rays can show if a bone is broken and whether there is displacement (a gap between broken bones). Sometimes, a broken scaphoid does not show up on an x-ray right away. Scaphoid fractures that are closer to the thumb usually heal in a matter of weeks with proper protection. This part of the scaphoid bone has a good supply of blood, which is necessary for healing. Your doctor will place your arm and hand in a cast. The cast will usually be below the elbow.
A scaphoid fracture is usually caused by a fall on an outstretched hand, with the weight landing on the palm. The end of one of the forearm bones (the radius) may also break in this type of fall, depending on the position of the hand on landing. Fractures of the scaphoid occur in people of all ages, including children. Scaphoid fractures that are closer to the thumb usually heal in a matter of weeks with proper protection. This part of the scaphoid bone has a good supply of blood, which is necessary for healing. Your doctor will place your arm and hand in a cast. The cast will usually be below the elbow.
The scaphoid is one of the small bones in the wrist. It is the wrist bone that is most likely to break. The scaphoid is located on the thumb side of the wrist, in the area where the wrist bends. The scaphoid is located at the base of the thumb, just above the radius bone. Scaphoid fractures that are closer to the thumb usually heal in a matter of weeks with proper protection. This part of the scaphoid bone has a good supply of blood, which is necessary for healing. Your doctor will place your arm and hand in a cast. The cast will usually be below the elbow.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A scaphoid fracture, a fracture of the scaphoid bone also known as the carpal navicular, is the most common type of carpal bone fracture. Scaphoid fractures usually cause pain at the base of the thumb accompanied by swelling in the same area. Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a common complication of a scaphoid fracture. Risk of AVN depends on the location of the fracture. 1  Fractures in the proximal 1/3 have a high incidence of AVN (~30%). 2  Waist fractures in the middle 1/3 is the most frequent fracture site and has moderate risk of AVN.
A scaphoid fracture is usually caused by a fall on to an outstretched hand. Symptoms can include pain and swelling around the wrist. Diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture can sometimes be difficult, as not all show up on X-rays. Treatment is usually with a cast worn on your arm up to your elbow for 8 to 12 weeks. In the proximal row are the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum and pisiform bones. The distal row is the row below this. In the distal row are the hamate, capitate, trapezoid and trapezium bones. The scaphoid bone is one of the largest of the carpal bones and is on the thumb side of
These are also called navicular fractures (the scaphoid also being called the carpal navicular) as navicular is the traditional name for the scaphoid bone, although this can be confused with the navicular bone in the foot. Treatment depends on the location of the fracture. Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a common complication of a scaphoid fracture. Risk of AVN depends on the location of the fracture. 1  Fractures in the proximal 1/3 have a high incidence of AVN (~30%). 2  Waist fractures in the middle 1/3 is the most frequent fracture site and has moderate risk of AVN.
