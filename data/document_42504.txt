There are 1,048,576 bytes in a megabyte, and 1,0458,576 kilobytes in a gigabyte. This is one reason why your operating system will claim that there is less memory on your hard drive than what the manufacturer claims. Likewise, the standard definition for gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 (10^9) bytes. Dividing, this means there are 1,000,000 (1 million) kilobytes (kB) in a gigabyte (GB) .
No, its 1000 kilobytes = 1 Mega byte 1000 megabytes= 1 Gigabyte 1000 Gigabyte = 1 Terra byte. ================================= 1024 cache kilobytes = 1 MegaByte 1024 cache Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte 1024 cache Gigabytes = 1 Terrabyte ======================================...
5 Million kilobytes = 5 GB There are 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte. and 1024 megabytes in a gigabyte. Technically 5000000 kilobytes exactly equals about 4.7498GB. Also, 5G … B exactly equals 5242880KB, which is greater than 5000000KB. Likewise, the standard definition for gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 (10^9) bytes. Dividing, this means there are 1,000,000 (1 million) kilobytes (kB) in a gigabyte (GB) .
1000 kilobytes are in a megabyte and 1000 megabytes are in a gigabyte. These are the storage industry standards. However, megabytes as displayed by an operating system are ac … tually measured in binary form, thus 1,024 kilobytes are in one megabyte, and 1,024 megabytes are in a gigabyte. There are actually two answers to this, depending on what method  you want to use to determine the answer.   Standard definition The standard definition for kilobyte is 1 … ,000  (10^3) bytes, just like there are 1,000 meters in a kilometre.    Likewise, the standard definition for gigabyte is 1,000,000,000  (10^9) bytes
For Instance: How many bytes in a kilobyte shows how many bytes in a kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte and terabyte. How many kilobytes in a megabyte will also tell you how many bytes are in the gigabyte and terabyte. How many gigabytes in a terabyte will also propagate all of the other conversion fields. How many megabytes are in a gigabyte will also show how many bytes in a gigabyte and kilobyte...and so on. Hope this helps!

Report Abuse. There are 1024 bytes in a kilobyte, 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte, and 1024 megabytes in a gigabyte. 1024 x 1024 = 1048576 People just use 1000 Kb to an Mb etc. as a rough number that is easier to work with. It is 1024 because this is 2^10 and is much more easily displayed in binary code, the number system that computers work with. lewie_morgan92 · 10 years ago. Thumbs up
