Starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, cereals, rice and pasta should make up about a third of the food you eat, as shown by the eatwell plate. Where you can, choose wholegrain varieties, or eat potatoes with their skins on for more fibre. Starch is the most common form of carbohydrate in our diet. Low-carbohydrate (low-carb) diets usually involve cutting out most starchy foods. These diets tend to be high in fat, and eating a high-fat diet (especially saturated fat from foods such as meat, cheese and butter) could increase your risk of heart disease.
Types of Vegetables. Starchy vegetables include several types of roots, bulbs and kernels. Corn, peas, parsnips, potatoes, pumpkin, squash, zucchini and yams are all examples of starchy vegetables.

On the other hand, there is also another type of vegetable: the non-starchy vegetables. These plant foods are nutrient-dense (having more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants) but contain lower amounts of carbohydrate and energy compared to the starchy vegetables. Generally, there are two types of vegetables according to their carbohydrate content: the starchy vegetables are those with high carbohydrate content, while the non-starchy vegetables are those with low carbohydrates.

Green plants produce starch and many staple foods like potatoes, rice, and corn contain large amounts of this organic compound. Starch in vegetables are digested primarily by gastric amylase, an enzyme found in the gastrointestinal tract, and the digested starch is then stored in the cells to be used as energy. Generally, there are two types of vegetables according to their carbohydrate content: the starchy vegetables are those with high carbohydrate content, while the non-starchy vegetables are those with low carbohydrates.
Starchy vegetables, such as corn, potatoes, squash, peas and yams, offer a variety of healthy benefits. Acorn squash, butternut squash, winter squash, white potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, corn and green peas are all rich in potassium, a mineral that helps preserve bone health and reduce blood pressure.

Starchy vegetables are high-carbohydrate plant foods that contain a rich energy source for man. Starch is a carbohydrate formed from the bonding of several glucose units, and is the most common form of stored energy from plants that is present in the human diet. Generally, there are two types of vegetables according to their carbohydrate content: the starchy vegetables are those with high carbohydrate content, while the non-starchy vegetables are those with low carbohydrates.
