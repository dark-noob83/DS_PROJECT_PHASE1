Example: Bill purchases a home from Sandra with a September 1 closing date. The real estate tax year in the area was the calendar year. The real estate tax due for the year was $900 and was paid by Sandra on August 1. The sales contract Bill and Sandra sign should pro-rate payment of these taxes based on the number of days each own the house during the year of sale. Bill will own the property for 122 days, which amounts to 33% of the year (366 days in a year ÷ 122 days = .3333).
Betting on the house: Rules for property sales. Real estate agent Shelley Bridge vividly recalls how a love affair once cost a young man more than $20,000 in federal taxes. The man, with Bridge’s help, had previously bought a house for around $200,000. Having fallen in love several years later, he moved in with his girlfriend and put his house up for rent.
In the 2012 tax year, a single person can exclude his first $250,000 in gains from taxes, and a married couple filing jointly can exclude $500,000. This means that you can sell the house and do whatever you want with the income without paying taxes on it. If you sold the property at a profit, you will have to pay 25 percent federal depreciation recapture tax and Callifornia state income tax on the total accumulated depreciation.
To find your profit, subtract your total cost basis from your net sales proceeds, which is equal to your selling price less any closing costs. For example, if you bought a house for $120,000, paid $3,000 in closing costs and spent $15,000 to put in a swimming pool, your cost basis would be $138,000. If you sold it for $250,000, but paid $16,250 in closing costs and commissions, your taxable profit would be $95,750. If you sold the property at a profit, you will have to pay 25 percent federal depreciation recapture tax and Callifornia state income tax on the total accumulated depreciation.
Example 2: Assume that Sandra hadn't paid any real estate taxes when the sale closed and Bill pays them all after the closing. Bill still may only deduct his $300 pro rata share of the taxes and Sandra still gets a $900 deduction even though she did actually pay the taxes. The sales contract Bill and Sandra sign should pro-rate payment of these taxes based on the number of days each own the house during the year of sale. Bill will own the property for 122 days, which amounts to 33% of the year (366 days in a year ÷ 122 days = .3333).
Your estate will have to pay federal estate taxes if its net value when you die is more than the exempt amount set by Congress at that time. In 2011 and 2012, the federal exemption is $5 million (adjusted for inflation in 2012) and the tax rate is 35%. 
5. Pay your real estate tax in the year for which you wish to deduct it. If you pay the tax in 2009, you cannot deduct it on your 2008 federal income tax return. In most cases, homeowners simply deduct the full amount of a year’s property tax. When you buy or sell a home during the year, though, special rules apply. These rules dictate how you must proceed with reporting and claiming any federal income tax deduction for partial-year property tax payment.
Bill should reimburse Sandra for 33% of the $900 property tax she paid--that is, Bill should pay $300. Homeowners may deduct as an itemized personal deduction state and local real estate taxes they pay on their main home and vacation homes. The sales contract Bill and Sandra sign should pro-rate payment of these taxes based on the number of days each own the house during the year of sale. Bill will own the property for 122 days, which amounts to 33% of the year (366 days in a year ÷ 122 days = .3333).
Your capital gains are taxed as regular income if you held the property for less than one year or as long-term capital gains if you held it for more than one year. For the 2012 tax year, the IRS taxes long-term gains at 15 percent, and California taxes them as regular income. If you sold the property at a profit, you will have to pay 25 percent federal depreciation recapture tax and Callifornia state income tax on the total accumulated depreciation.
If you’ve depreciated the property, you might pay a different rate. For example, if you buy a rental house at $300,000, take depreciation deductions of $100,000 over the years, and then sell it for $320,000, your gain for taxes is $120,000. But you pay at a 25 percent rate on the first $100,000. Real estate agent Shelley Bridge vividly recalls how a love affair once cost a young man more than $20,000 in federal taxes. The man, with Bridge’s help, had previously bought a house for around $200,000. Having fallen in love several years later, he moved in with his girlfriend and put his house up for rent.
