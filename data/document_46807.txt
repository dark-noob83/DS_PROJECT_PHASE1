As birth rate is less than the death rate, Bulgaria has a declining population. In South Africa, the birth rate is 25 / 1,000 and death rate is 15 / 1,000. South Africa has an increasing population with a population growth rate of 1 per cent.
Population will decline if death rate is greater than birth rate. Population will increase if death rate is less than birth rate. LEDCs [LEDC: A Less Economically Developed Country (LEDC) has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income).
The third factor affecting birth rates is the increase of women in the labor force. By 2005, 48 percent of the labor force will be women as opposed to 43 percent in 1983. As women move their focus from homemaking to becoming defined members of the labor force, the birth rate declines.
1 Births-usually measured using the birth rate (number of live births per 1,000 of the population per year). 2  Deaths-usually measured using the death rate (number of deaths per 1,000 of the population per year). 3  Migration-the movement of people in and out of an area.
National birth rates are expressed as number of live births per year per 1,000 of the population, with population taken at the (estimated) mid-year figure. The estimated bir … th rate for China in 2009 was 14 births for every 1,000 people. (14/1,000) The death rate is expressed in a similar way.
natural increase = birth rate-death rate. The rate of natural increase is given as a percentage, calculated by dividing the natural increase by 10. For example, if the birth rate is 14 per 1,000 population, and the death rate is 8 per 1000 population, then the natural increase = 14 - 8 = 6.
That year there were 57,922 births, compared to 70,589 births in 1965. Children born in 1975 became 16 years old in 1991-eligible for the labor force-and since 1991 Alabama employers have been feeling the effects almost annually of declining birth rates.
In the history of our species, the birth and death rate have always been able to balance each and maintain a population growth rate that is sustainable. Since the time of the Bubonic Plague in the 1400’s, the growth of population has been on a constant increase.
