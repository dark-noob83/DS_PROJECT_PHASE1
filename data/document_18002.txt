Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve symptoms of arthritis, primary dysmenorrhea (pain during your period), fever, and pain and inflammation from other conditions. Low-dose ibuprofen (200 mg) is available over the counter.
Ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation caused by many conditions such as headache, toothache, back pain, arthritis, menstrual cramps, or minor injury. The dose of ibuprofen can range from 200 mg every 4 to 6 hours up to 800 mg every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose anyone should ever take is 800 mg every 6 hours or a total of 3200 mg per day. However, anything over the recommended over-the-counter dose of 200 mg should only be taken on the advise of your doctor.
