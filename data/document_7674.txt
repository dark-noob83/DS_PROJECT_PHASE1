The cecum is the cul-de-sac at the beginning of the large intestine that descends from the union of the ileum and the large intestine.

Cecum-definition and function. Cecum-the first segment of the COLON (large intestine) into which the ILEUM, the final segment of the SMALL INTESTINE, empties digestive matter.
While passing through the small intestine, bile is produced in the liver and then it is stored in the gall bladder. Next, pancreatic enzymes from the pancreas, as well as other digestive enzymes that are produced in the lining of the small intestine continue to break chyme (food) down even further.
The cecum is part of the digestive tract. It is the first part of the large intestine that digesting food enters after leaving the small intestine, and is shaped like a sac.
The ileum (last part of the small intestine) connects to the cecum (first part of the colon) in the lower right abdomen. The rest of the colon is divided into four parts: â€¢ The ascending colon travels up the right side of the abdomen.
