An Arabidopsis thaliana chlorophyll(ide) a oxygenase gene (cao), which is responsible for chlorophyll b synthesis from chlorophyll a, was introduced and expressed in a photosystem I-less strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.
Chlorophyll molecules embedded in the thylakoid membrane absorb light energy. These molecules are the most important pigments for absorbing the light energy used in photosynthesis. A chlorophyll molecule has a hydrophobic tail that embeds the molecule into the thylakoid membrane.
* Photosystem I and photosystem II are similar in â€¦ that they both contain chlorophyll molecules, which can convert light energy into chemical energy. * In both photosystems, a photon causes an electron to reach a high energy level.
Confidence votes 63. I have studied photosyn. and to the best of my knowledge chl. a and b are in both photosystems. The difference between absorption in photosystem II (p680) and I (p700) is caused by the amount of a (best at 450-500nm) or b (best at 470-600nm).Photosyn. I should have more b and photosyn. should have more a.
The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy by resonance energy transfer to a specific chlorophyll pair in the reaction center of the photosystems.

The photosystem I was named I since it was discovered before photosystem II, but this does not represent the order of the electron flow. When photosystem II absorbs light, electrons in the reaction-center chlorophyll are excited to a higher energy level and are trapped by the primary electron acceptors.
