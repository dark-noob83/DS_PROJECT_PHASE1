For example, county clerks in Kentucky require that the grantee sign quitclaim deeds on the consideration statement. The grantee's signature must also be acknowledged by the notary public. Some states, such as Georgia and Pennsylvania, also require witnesses to sign the deed.
In some states, deeds must also be signed by witnesses who watch the owner sign the deed. The person who signed the deed should record (file) the deed, with its notarized signature, in the land records office in the county where the property is located.
Some states also require the witnesses sign quitclaim deeds, in addition to a notary public, in order for them to be valid. These states are listed below: 1  Arkansas. 2  Georgia. 3  Michigan. 4  Ohio. 5  South Carolina. 6  Vermont.
If signed in another state, then a certified acknowledgment that the deed was signed in conformity to the laws of the state where the deed was signed is sufficient. Unlike a will, a New York deed does not need to be witnessed. Normally the grantor/seller is the only person who needs to sign the deed. The signature must be an original signature. Also, a valid deed must contain a legal description of the property and contain the names and addresses of all parties referenced in the document.
A deed must always be notarized and filed in the public records; it may also have to be witnessed. The person who will sign the deed (the person who is transferring the property) should take the deed to a notary public, who will watch the person sign the deed and will sign and stamp it. The notarization means that a notary public has verified that the signature on the deed is genuine.
