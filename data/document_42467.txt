However, a true long-range, heavy-class solution was still to come-and finally made available-by the arrival of the Gotha bomber series, the classic German heavy bomber of World War 1. The Gotha aircraft was a two-engined, biplane design forged of a steel skeleton, wood framing and fabric skin. The German Air Service utilized the Gotha series of heavy bombers to good effect throughout World War 1. With the Germans having gained critical territory up to the Belgian coast in 1914, thoughts to the bombing of targets within the British mainland became more of a reality.
The Gotha G.V was a heavy bomber used by the Luftstreitkraefte (Luftstreitkr채fte Imperial German Air) service During World War. i The Gotha included an important innovation in the form of a gun tunnel whereby the underside of the rear fuselage was arched, early versions allowing placement of a rearward-facing machine gun protecting from attack from below, removing the blind spot.

On the night raids, when a lower ceiling sufficed, a greater weight of bombs could be carried.

In World War I, Gotha was the manufacturer of a highly successful series of bombers based on a 1914 design by Oskar Ursinus, but heavily reimagined by Hans Burkhard. Whilst Germany was prohibited from military aircraft manufacture by the Treaty of Versailles, Gotha returned to its railway endeavours, but returned to aviation with the rise of the Nazi government and the abandonment of the Treaty's restrictions.
Gothaer Waggonfabrik (Gotha, GWF) was a German manufacturer of rolling stock established in the late nineteenth century at Gotha. During the two world wars, the company expanded into aircraft building. Whilst Germany was prohibited from military aircraft manufacture by the Treaty of Versailles, Gotha returned to its railway endeavours, but returned to aviation with the rise of the Nazi government and the abandonment of the Treaty's restrictions.
In G.Vs the Gotha Tunnel was expanded, the bomb bay and the gangway were replaced with a fuel tank.

The design of this new Gotha bomber, like others previous, was attributed to engineer Hans Burkhard (Oskar Ursinus and Helmut Friedel designed the original G.I model). The aircraft achieved first flight in 1917 and formally entered operational service in August of that year. The German Air Service utilized the Gotha series of heavy bombers to good effect throughout World War 1. With the Germans having gained critical territory up to the Belgian coast in 1914, thoughts to the bombing of targets within the British mainland became more of a reality.
The German High Command decreed that 30 Gotha bombers were to be ready for a daylight raid on London on February 1st, 1917, but the machines were not actually available until May, and the first daylight raid on London was carried out by a formation of 14 Gotha's on June 13th, 1917. On daylight attacks the Gotha's flew between 10,000 ft and 16,000 ft-too high to enable the defense to intercept them as they flew up the Thames estuary towards London. On the night raids, when a lower ceiling sufficed, a greater weight of bombs could be carried.
Perhaps the most famous Gotha product of World War II, however, was an aircraft that never entered service, the Horten Ho 229. This was an exotic jet-powered, flying wing fighter aircraft designed by the Horten brothers, who lacked the facilities to mass-produce it. Whilst Germany was prohibited from military aircraft manufacture by the Treaty of Versailles, Gotha returned to its railway endeavours, but returned to aviation with the rise of the Nazi government and the abandonment of the Treaty's restrictions.
