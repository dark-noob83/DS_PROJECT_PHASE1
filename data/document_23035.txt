Mourning Doves raise three or more broods in a single breeding season. Both parents build a flimsy platform nest of twigs located from 5 to 25 feet up in a tree or bush. Two white eggs hatch in about 14 - 16 days. One egg is laid in the evening, and the second on the next morning. Its flight speed has been clocked at 40-55 mph, but a strong tailwind will result in higher ground speeds, making it a difficult bird for a hunter to hit.

- Can lay up to 6 clutches. - Both male and female incubate. - Incubation is approx 14 days. - Fledging is approx 11-15 days. So at the sight of the 4th pair of eggs, I grabbed an old IP camera, set it above their nest and had it take a shot every minute and upload it to the interwebs. I saved all the shots to make a time lapse movie.
Female mourning doves feed the young most during the first 15 days after hatching but after that males take over the responsibility for feeding the young. The young continue to stay near the nest and beg for food after they have fledged, but can survive on their own after 21 days old if there is food nearby. Incubation lasts 14 to 15 days. Young mourning doves are fed regurgitated food by both parents.
