A A. There is growing concern about osteoporosis, a bone disease affecting the elderly and especially postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis is a bone disease where there is a gradual decrease in the bone density, which causes further risks of symptoms like falls and frequent bone fractures.
As the disease is genetic, the possibility that osteoporosis can be hereditary is clear, and a person with a family history of bone fracture or loss of bone density issue has a greater risk of developing the condition.
Osteoporosis is a common disease with a strong genetic component. In recent years, some progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of osteoporosis. Genetic factors contribute to osteoporosis by influencing not only bone mineral density but also bone size, bone quality, and bone turnover. Meta-analysis has been used to define the role of several candidate genes in
Juvenile primary osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) that begins in childhood. Osteoporosis is caused by a shortage of calcium and other minerals in bones (decreased bone mineral density), which makes the bones brittle and prone to fracture.
Genetics and osteoporosis. It is important for individuals to know their genetic predisposition to osteoporosis. Genetics plays an important role—it is estimated that about 75% of an individual’s peak bone mass is influenced by genetics.
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass, alterations in the microarchitecture of bone tissue, reduced bone strength, and an increased risk of fracture (Kanis et al. 1994). Osteoporosis is a common condition that affects up to 30% of women and 12% of men at some point in life.
