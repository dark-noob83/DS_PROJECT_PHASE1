You are correct that polyatomic ions exist, but dioxygen, the most stable allotrope of oxygen and the molecule found in air, is not one of them. When we say oxygen gas or oxygen molecules, we are talking about neutral $\ce{O2}$ (or I suppose you could explicitly write $\ce{O_{2}^{0}}$).
Best Answer: N2+ is more stable since N has to lose 5 electrons so as to be stable and oxygen has to lose 6 so as to gain stability. Thus oxygen remains with 4 if it loses 2 and nitrogen remains with 3 on losing 2.
It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic O2. Ground-level ozone is an air pollutant with harmful effects on the respiratory systems of animals.
Best Answer: Oxygen molecule is 2 oxygen atoms in a covalent bond, whereas an oxygen atom is an atom with 8 electrons (6 valence electrons). Thus, clearly, any element in a bonded state is always more stable than when in an un-bonded state. (Needn't include electronic configuration to explain this).
Answer by John Rigoni. Confidence votes 7. Unstable, because oxygen is a diatomic element meaning that O (charge of -2) cannot stand alone, when not in a compound it must be O2. So it has a charge of -4.
Ozone (O 3) is a triatomic molecule, consisting of three oxygen atoms. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic O 2 (oxygen gas). In order to understand the difference between oxygen and ozone, it is important to understand what an allotrope is.

Water Isotopes (return to top). Oxygen has three stable isotopes, 16 O, 17 O, and 18 O; hydrogen has two stable isotopes, 1 H and 2 H (deuterium), and one radioactive isotope, 3 H (tritium), which is discussed separately. Oxygen and hydrogen are found in many forms in the earth's hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere.
