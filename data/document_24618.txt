There are many questions about how long orcas live in captivity compared to how long they live in the ocean. In the 2013 documentary film Blackfish Howard Garrett said the following: We knew by 1980, after a half a dozen years of research, that they [killer whales] live equivalent to human life spans.. 
How long do killer whales live? How do they die? Killer whales have no natural predators (they are the top predators of the oceans) and can live to about 50-80 years old. Killer whales have been hunted by humans but not with enthusiasm as it takes 21 killer whales to produce the same amount of oil as 1 sperm whale. How do killer whales have their young? Killer whale males reach breeding age when they are around 22 feet (6.7 meters) long while females can breed when they are about 16 feet (4.9 meters) long.
The whale species is known to have several of the longest known living animals in the world with several species living for 100 years or more, however estimating the life expectancy of 80 – 90 or so various species of Cetacea (cetaceans include all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise) can be a very challenging task. 1 The Bowhead whale has an average lifespan of 100 – 200 years. 2  The Fin whale has an average lifespan of 60 – 100 years. 3  The Gray whale has an average lifespan of 50 – 70 years. 4  The humpback whale has an average lifespan of 4
While animals such as the beluga whale and killer whale can be found in captivity the largest living animal in the world, the blue whale, is too large to be held in captivity, however over the years the blue whale has become very popular among whale watchers. These whales are estimated to live to at least 80 years. 1 The Bowhead whale has an average lifespan of 100 – 200 years. 2  The Fin whale has an average lifespan of 60 – 100 years. 3  The Gray whale has an average lifespan of 50 – 70 years. 4  The humpback whale has an average lifespan of 4
Some whales have a lifespan similar to humans, particularly the blue and the fin whales as they reach up to 85 years old. The life cycle of a whale varies from type to type, but the best known species have the following: 1  Humpback whales live about 45-100 years. 2  Gray whales live 25 to 80 years. 3  Blue whales live over 80-90 years. 4  Fin whales live about 85-90 years. 5  Minke whales live 40 to 50 years.
1 127 of these orcas are now dead. 2  In the wild, male orcas live to an average of 30 years (maximum 50-60 years) and 46 years for females (maximum 80-90 years). 1
At least 151 orcas have been taken into captivity from the wild since 1961 (including Pascuala and Morgan). 1  127 of these orcas are now dead. 2  In the wild, male orcas live to an average of 30 years (maximum 50-60 years) and 46 years for females (maximum 80-90 years). 1
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Wild killer whale females can live up to 80 years (although that is rare, usually it's more like 50-60); males average around 30 years. In captivity they often die before they reach the age of 20. Report Abuse. In the wild, the average female killer whale will live around 50 years, although some have survived much longer. Males don't live as long, averaging 30 years. Once again, though, there are cases of them living much longer. In captivity, they live about 25 years. Sometimes they can live into their 40s, but that is rare
Orcas in the wild have an average life expectancy of 30 to 50 years—their estimated maximum lifespan is 60 to 70 years for males and 80 to over 100 for females. The average age of death for orcas who have died at SeaWorld is 13 years old. © Free Morgan Foundation.
