How Ingredients change bread characteristics. As I described in How to Make Bread and then again in Basic Bread Recipe, most bread recipes include 4 ingredients (not counting the sugar that the yeast ate) and a very straightforward mixing method.
This is the easiest bread recipe. With only 4 ingredients (water, flour, yeast, salt) and no-kneading you can have fresh bread our of your own oven! If you are scared of using yeast, this bread will get your feet wet! I feel like I have been away for ages. I don’t like that.
Flour is the primary ingredient of any bread recipe. It is the bread that we see. Flour contains gluten, a protein that provides for the elasticity, and the basic structure of bread. As the mixture is heated, the starch in bread sets, and adds to the structure.
Bread can be hard or soft, flat or raised, crisp or chewy. Tortillas, injera, naan and khobuz are some examples of soft, chewy flat breads. Lavash, while also flat, can be chewy or crisp. Bread is made from a combination of flour, sugar, yeast, salt, water and oil.
If you’ve ever made bread from scratch, you know that it’s made with simple ingredients: flour, water, yeast, and salt. Commercially-made bread, though, often includes a long list of ingredients (some of which are on Naturally Savvy's Scary Seven™ list of foods to avoid).
Yeast. Yeast is the heart of the bread-making process. It’s the essential ingredient that makes the dough rise and gives home-baked bread its wonderful taste and aroma. Other ingredients are added to complete the reactions that result in a perfectly baked loaf of hot, crusty homemade bread.
