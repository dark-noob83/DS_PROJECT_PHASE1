Woodpeckers. There are eight species of woodpeckers in Alabama. The state bird is a woodpecker called the “Northern Flicker” or “Yellowhammer.” Other woodpeckers in Alabama include the red-cockaded, the downy, and the hairy woodpecker. These three species are about the same size (7-9 inches) and are mostly black and white.
The yellowhammer was designated the official state bird of Alabama in 1927. The yellowhammer (correct name: northern flicker) has been a symbol of Alabama since the Civil War (The Yellowhammer State is one of Alabama's nicknames). Alabama is the the only state that chose a woodpecker as their official state bird.
Alabama soon became known as the “yellowhammer state.”. APPEARANCE: The yellowhammer is a medium-sized bird measuring 11 to 14 inches in height and 17 to 21 inches in wingspan.
Alabama is the only state with a woodpecker for a state bird. The yellowhammer was adopted on September 6, 1927. It is more properly called a Northern Flicker.
The largest Alabama woodpecker is the pileated woodpecker measuring 16.5 inches in height. Woodpeckers make a distinct sound as they drum the trunks of dead and dying trees looking for insects to eat, excavating nest cavities, or simply announcing their presence.
Alabama State Bird-Yellowhammer-Colaptes auratus. The yellowhammer, also known as the northern flicker or yellow-shafted flicker, became the official state bird of Alabama in 1927. Soldiers from Alabama were nicknamed “yellowhammers” in the Civil War due to their grey-and-yellow uniforms, which matched the colors of the bird.
