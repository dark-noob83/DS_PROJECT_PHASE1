Width. Again, limits are probably specified in the local building code. Typically the minimum width permitted in residences is around 2 feet 8 inches. Three feet is better, and 3′6″ is the standard for normal occupancy. If a stair is more than 44 inches wide, a handrail is required on both sides. Increasing the unit run even an inch or two can greatly increase the size of the staircase. With a rise of 12 feet and a unit rise of 7.2 inches, increasing the unit run from 9″ to 11″ makes the staircase two feet longer–probably 6 square feet of floor area carved out of the living room.
Since in one step on a staircase a foot travels by two risers and a tread, Blondel arrived at the formula two times the unit rise, plus the unit run = 25.5, or unit rise = (25.5 - unit run) over 2. This formula works well only for moderate values for unit rise (or unit run). Increasing the unit run even an inch or two can greatly increase the size of the staircase. With a rise of 12 feet and a unit rise of 7.2 inches, increasing the unit run from 9″ to 11″ makes the staircase two feet longer–probably 6 square feet of floor area carved out of the living room.
The width of one stair, after all, will need to be consistent with the rest of the stairs. The stair’s width usually varies depending on the type of building the staircase is in, but for a normal residence, the standard tends to be 3 feet, 6 inches (106.7 cm). The minimum, in most places, is 2 feet 8 inches (81.3 cm). Rise is the overall height of the entire staircase, from the lowest point to the highest point. Staircases vary in shape, but their rise is an important measurement for determining where landings are placed. Typically, a landing must be provided for every 12 feet (365.8 cm) of rise, as per fire safety codes.
The rise is from 7 to 8 depending on the total rise Take the total rise and divide by 7 1/2, average step, and that gives you you # of steps Then take total rise and divide by # of steps, this tells you the exact size of your step Now take size of rise and X by # of steps. 
1 The height of the handrail, measured from the nose of the tread, is recommended to be between 34 and 38 inches (86 to 97 cm). 2  The comfortable size of handrail diameter is between 1.25 and 2.68 inches (3.2 to 6.8 cm). 1 The comfortable size of handrail diameter is between 1.25 and 2.68 inches (3.2 to 6.8 cm). 2  Doors are normally not allowed to swing over steps. 3  The arc of doors should be on the landing or floor completely.
Unit run is the horizontal measurement of from the front to the back of a single stair, which is known as the tread.. Standard code requires that each stair tread fall between 9 inches and 11 inches (22.9 cm and 27.9 cm) to allow people to safely ascend and descend stairs. Rise is the overall height of the entire staircase, from the lowest point to the highest point. Staircases vary in shape, but their rise is an important measurement for determining where landings are placed. Typically, a landing must be provided for every 12 feet (365.8 cm) of rise, as per fire safety codes.

by Sean O'Hara on. I received a question about stair width from one of our clients and thought it made sense to clarify the typical stair design rules for houses. These are the rules that are in the 2006 International Residential Code. Stairways have to be at least 36″ clear width above the handrail height. Handrails can’t project more than 4.5″ into each side. You need at least 80″ of head height throughout the stair. The maximum height of a riser is 7.75″ and the treads have to be at least 10″ deep. Treads also need to be a minimum of 4″ tall.
For the safety reasons and for the comfort of usage, stair measurements are recommended to follow some guidelines: 1  The run length should be 9 inches (23 cm) or longer for enough foot space. 2  The riser height should be 8.25 inches (21cm) or lower. 1 The comfortable size of handrail diameter is between 1.25 and 2.68 inches (3.2 to 6.8 cm). 2  Doors are normally not allowed to swing over steps. 3  The arc of doors should be on the landing or floor completely.
