Introduction. When Gustave Eiffel’s company built Paris’ most recognizable monument for the 1889 World’s Fair, many regarded the massive iron structure with skepticism.
The Tower is built with wooden scaffolds and small hoists directly fixed to the Tower. Image taken in January 1888. A total of 12 temporary wooden scaffolds (30 m in height) and four larger scaffolds (45 m in height) were used to assemble the first floor.
The Eiffel Tower is not just a monument to aerodynamics and aesthetics, it is a model of organization and management. Completed in just two years, two months and five days, the project finished ahead of schedule. Slated to open on May 6, 1889, the Eiffel Tower was ready on March 30 of that year.
The Eiffel Tower in Paris was built by Gustave Eiffel in just 26 months. It took 18,038 parts, 3,000 workshop drawings, 700 engineering plans and 2,500,000 rivets to raise this structure weighing 7,300 tons and measuring 1,050 feet high.
Come and visit us! The tower was built as the theme structure of the Universal Exposition of 1889, which was held in Paris. The city originally signed a contract for an operating concession for 20 years, and after that (in 1909) the concession would revert back to the City of Paris.
It took just two years, two months and five days to build the Eiffel Tower. Construction work began in January 1887 and was finished on 31 March 1889. A record speed considering the rudimentary means available at that time. The assembly of the Tower was a marvel of precision, as all the chroniclers of the period agreed.
At that time, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world at 321 metres in height. (1051 feet). To begin with, the Eiffel Tower was not at all popular with the people of Paris. They did not like its shape, they thought it looked ugly.
