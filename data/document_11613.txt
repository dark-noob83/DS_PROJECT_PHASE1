The curriculum in a gaelscoil is virtually the same as an English-language school, teaching subjects like math, history and science all in the Irish language. Outside of the Gaeltacht, gaelscoileanna often teach children who do not speak Irish at home or in their daily lives. “We are a much more confident nation and language is a very powerful tool to express ones identity especially in Europe,” said Breandan Mac Craith of Irish language organization Foras na Gaeilge to The Epoch Times. Students in gaelscoileanna perform better in tests than other students, performing well even in English.
In most gaelscoileanna, the first two years of lessons are taught entirely in Irish to immerse children in the language. English is then gradually worked into the curriculum and many students turn to English-language education when they reach secondary school. Most gaelscoileanna are created by groups of parents who can demonstrate a need for a gaelscoil in their area. If they can show that there are at least 17 children interested in attending a gaelscoil, provide a suitable site for a school and satisfy other conditions, the state will fund the creation a new gaelscoil. “We are a much more confident nation and language is a very powerful tool to express ones identity especially in Europe,” said Breandan Mac Craith of Irish language organization Foras na Gaeilge to The Epoch Times.

Students in the Gaelscoileanna acquire the Irish language through language immersion, though they study the standard curriculum. Gaelscoileanna, unlike English-medium schools, have the reputation of producing competent Irish speakers. English-medium schools, in contrast, produce relatively few fluent Irish speakers, despite the Irish language being an obligatory subject in the Republic of Ireland in both primary and secondary school. The function and future of the Gaelscoileanna in the Republic of Ireland will be affected by the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010–2030, published in November 2009.
