On June 11, 1948, Albert I-the first monkey astronaut-launched into space on a V-2 Blossom III rocket from White Sands Proving Ground, a NASA space station in New Mexico. The first of four monkeys (Albert I-IV) launched into space between June 1948 and December 1949, Albert was the original monkey pioneer. Albert's journey would begin a fruitful period of research for NASA which would culminate in Neil Armstrong's momentous journey to the moon. 
1959: Monkeys survive space mission Two monkeys have become the first living creatures to survive a space flight. Able, a seven-pound female rhesus monkey, and Baker, a one-pound female squirrel monkey, were fired 300 miles into space in the nose-cone of a Jupiter missile AM-18 from Cape Canaveral in Florida. 1959: Monkeys survive space mission
The container of flies flew aboard a V2 rocket to a height of 106 miles (171 km), and the capsule was recovered with the flies alive and well. The first monkey to be sent successfully into space was Albert II, a male rhesus monkey, who made it to a height of 83 miles (134 km) on June 14, 1949. Without the sacrifice of these animals, there would have been much loss of human life during the space program. The first monkeys to survive the flight into space were two monkeys named Able and Miss Baker. They flew to a height of 360 miles (580 km) on May 28, 1959 aboard a Jupiter rocket.
The first mammal in space was Albert II, a Rhesus monkey. Albert I's mission had been unsuccessful, but the second Albert reached a distance of 83 miles on June 14, 1949. Albert was anesthetized during flight and implanted with sensors to measure his vital signs. Unfortunately, Albert II died upon impact at re-entry. 
The first ever primate astronaut was Albert, a rhesus monkey, who on June 11, 1948, rode to over 63 km (39 mi) on a V2 rocket. Albert was followed by Albert II who survived the V2 flight but died on impact on June 14, 1949, after a parachute failure. Albert II became the first monkey in space as his flight reached 134 km (83 mi) - past the Karman kármán line of 100 km taken to designate the beginning of. space
The first monkeys to survive space were Able and Miss Baker who were sent up in 1959. The Russians sent dogs up into space in addition to monkeys, which is why they did not send nearly as many monkeys into space as America did. Thus the first monkey that they actually sent into space was not until 1983. The monkeys that the Russians sent into space were named according to the letters of the alphabet.
Before humans went into space, several animals were launched into space, including numerous non-human primates, so that scientists could investigate the biological effects of space travel. The United States launched flights containing primate cargo primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985. Albert was followed by Albert II who survived the V2 flight but died on impact on June 14, 1949, after a parachute failure. Albert II became the first monkey in space as his flight reached 134 km (83 mi) - past the Karman kármán line of 100 km taken to designate the beginning of. space
Baker, a squirrel monkey, was launched into space along with a rhesus monkey named Able. Unlike Albert II, they survived their 16-minute mission. Able, a rhesus monkey, took off along with her companion Baker, becoming the first monkeys to survive the trip into space. Astronaut Alan Shepard may have been America's first man in space when he went up in 1961, but he wasn't the nation's first simian in space. That honor belongs to another Al -- Albert II, a rhesus monkey that blasted aloft in 1949 aboard a V2 rocket.
Who was the first monkey launched into space? Albert II, a rhesus monkey, became the first ever primate to reach space (altitude above 100 km) on the 14th of June 1949. his capsule reached an altitude of 134 km aboard a V … -2 rocket.
