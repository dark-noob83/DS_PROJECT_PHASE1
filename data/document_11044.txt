7. Cipher's. There are a number of different code ciphers for different things in gaming, like message encryption and simple secrete lettering between senders. One of the most simple of ciphers is a number Cipher that consists of the 26 letters of the alphabet being coded each by number a-1, b-2, and so on.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
vs. Check Point Pointsec. A cipher (pronounced SAI-fuhr) is any method of encrypting text (concealing its readability and meaning). It is also sometimes used to refer to the encrypted text message itself although here the term ciphertext is preferred. Its origin is the Arabic sifr, meaning empty or zero.
A block cipher is a method of encrypting text (to produce ciphertext) in which a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to a block of data (for example, 64 contiguous bits) at once as a group rather than to one bit at a time. The main alternative method, used much less frequently, is called the stream cipher.
