Static electricity is the buildup of electrical charges on the surface of some object or material. Static electricity is usually created when materials are pulled apart or rubbed together, causing positive (+) charges to collect on one material and negative (−) charges on the other surface.
Static electricity is the accumulation of electrical charges on the surface of a material, usually an insulator or non-conductor of electricity. It is called static because there is no current flowing, as there is in alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC)
The difference is static electricity is a accumulation of both +ve and-ve charges while static charge consists only of either +ve or-ve charges. Source(s): Zebrain · 8 years ago. Thumbs up.
Answers. Best Answer: Static electricityNOUN: An accumulation of electric charge on an insulated body. Electric discharge resulting from the accumulation of electric charge on an insulated body. Static electricity occurs when there are an excess of positive (+) or negative (-) charges on an object's surface. This condition is caused from rubbing certain materials together. Static electricity is not caused by friction, as is popularly thought.
