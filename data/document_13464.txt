Here's a much more inefficient algorithm: Convert the hex number into a decimal string (there are libraries to do that), then for each digit in the string, copy the digit into a 4-bit integer. It's a complete waste of hardware space if done on an ASIC, and perhaps a time suck if done in software, but hey, it works.
Convert text into hexadecimal format. Computers store text as numbers, and with hex you display the numbers not as a decimal number, but in base 16. Hex or base 16 or hexadecimal is a numeral system that uses 16 symbols. The symbols include 0-9 and a-f (sometimes A-F). An example of a hexadecimal number is 3BF2.
2. Use the following table to convert each 4-digit binary string to a single hex digit: 1 (1), 10 (2), 11 (3), 100 (4), 101 (5), 110 (6), 111 (7), 1000 (8), 1001 (9), 1010 (A), 1011 (B), 1100 (C), 1101 (D), 1110 (E), and 1111 (F). The digits in () are the hex equivalents to the preceding binary number.
A quick review of how ordinary numbers are written will help you convert the number: 1  Each digit in a decimal number is in a certain place. Moving from right to left, there's the ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and so on. 2  To put it mathematically, the places represent 10 0, 10 1, 10 2
Two Methods: Sample Converter Converting Binary to Hexadecimal. This article will explain how to convert binary (base 2) to hexadecimal (base 16). Since both bases are powers of 2, this procedure is much simpler than the more general conversions such as converting decimal to binary. Ad.
Use the following table to convert each 4-digit binary string to a single hex digit: 1 (1), 10 (2), 11 (3), 100 (4), 101 (5), 110 (6), 111 (7), 1000 (8), 1001 (9), 1010 (A), 1011 (B), 1100 (C), 1101 (D), 1110 (E), and 1111 (F). The digits in () are the hex equivalents to the preceding binary number.
