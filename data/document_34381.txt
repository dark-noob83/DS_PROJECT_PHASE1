When patients and their doctors decide whether to proceed with a knee replacement, it's always a quality-of-life issue, says Mark Figgie, chief of the Surgical Arthritis Service at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. + More. Getting a new knee because the original has worn out and may have become painfully arthritic is an increasingly common surgery in America. First-time knee replacement surgeries rose 63 percent between 1997 and 2004, according to a 2008 paper in Arthritis Care & Research. If that clip keeps up, some 1.4 million such surgeries will be performed in 2015, the researchers estimated
About 85 percent of artificial knees still work after 20 years. Their endurance is one reason that this procedure is so popular. Most people who undergo a knee replacement are between the ages of 50 and 80. The average age is about 70. 
There are no absolute age or weight restrictions for total knee replacement surgery. Recommendations for surgery are based on a patient's pain and disability, not age. Most patients who undergo total knee replacement are age 50 to 80, but orthopaedic surgeons evaluate patients individually. 
1 Half the patients now receiving knee replacements are younger than 65 years of age, and most of them are in the workforce. 2  Study found lifetime societal savings of about $12 billion from the more than 600,000 total knee replacement surgeries performed each year in the U.S. Total knee replacement (or total knee arthroplasty (TKA)) is one of the most successful and life-enhancing surgical procedures. It relieves almost all pain for 90 percent of patients who have the procedure, allowing them to return to work and tremendously enhancing their quality of life.

Reviewed by Laura J. Martin, MD. Feb. 17, 2011 (San Diego) -- Knee replacement patients tend to remain active 20 years after their surgery, despite some age-related declines, according to a new survey of 128 patients. In this group there were 171 knee replacements, done at an average age of about 64. The researchers evaluated the patients with standard measures that looked at how well they could do everyday activities, such as climb stairs and walk.
Indeed, information presented at the AAOS meeting today found that the average age for Americans getting total knee replacements has declined. Comparing the years from 1990 to 1994 with 2002 to 2006, researchers learned that the average age has gone from 70 years to 68. + More.

The average hospital charge for a total knee replacement (TKR) in the United States is $49,500. A partial knee replacement (PKR) typically costs about 10 to 20 percent less than a TKR. The main reason is that the operation requires a shorter hospital stay. For example: an average of 2.3 days, compared to 3.4 days.
