The dose limit for the embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant woman is based on a consideration of the possibility of greater sensitivity to radiation of the embryo/fetus and the involuntary nature of the exposure. For adults, an annual limit that does not exceed: 1  5 rems (0.05 Sv) for the total effective dose equivalent (TEDE), which is the sum of the deep dose equivalent (DDE) from external exposure to the whole body and the committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) from intakes of radioactive material.
The annual occupational dose equivalent limit for the lens of the eye, a particularly radiosensitive organ, is 150 mSv (15 rem or 15,000 mrem). The annual occupational dose equivalent limit for the skin and extremities is 500 mSv (50 rem or 50,000 mrem). According to the NCRP. the annual occupational whole-body dose equivalent limit is 50 mSv (5 rem or 5000 mrem). The annual occupational whole-body dose equivalent limit for students under the age of 18 years is 1 mSv (100 mrem or 0.1 rem).
5.5.1. A limit of 0.5 rem (5 mSv) during the entire pregnancy due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman. The dose equivalent to an embryo/fetus must be taken as the sum of: 5.5.1.1. An annual limit of 50 rem (0.50 Sv) to an individual organ or tissue other than the lens of the eye, as determined by the deep-dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent. 5.3.3. An annual limit of 15 rem (0.15 Sv) to the lens of the eye. 5.3.4.
Objective Determine whether the dose limit for the embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant occupational worker should be reduced over the gestation period and develop regulatory requirements accordingly. III. 3 IV. Discussion The ICRP Publication 103 (2007) recommends that the dose to the embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant worker provide the same general level of protection as that offered for a member of the public; this dose is 1 mSv (100 mrem).
For minor workers, the annual occupational dose limits are 10 percent of the dose limits for adult workers. For protection of the embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant woman, the dose limit is 0.5 rem (5 mSv) during the entire pregnancy. For adults, an annual limit that does not exceed: 1  5 rems (0.05 Sv) for the total effective dose equivalent (TEDE), which is the sum of the deep dose equivalent (DDE) from external exposure to the whole body and the committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE) from intakes of radioactive material.
Policy. The dose to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman, will be limited to 500 mRem. Substantial variations in a uniform monthly exposure rate should be avoided. Limits of exposure to the general population will be applied to a nursing infant. 
ยง 20.1201 Occupational dose limits for adults. (a) The licensee shall control the occupational dose to individual adults, except for planned special exposures under ยง 20.1206, to the following dose limits. (1) An annual limit, which is the more limiting of--. (i) The total effective dose equivalent being equal to 5 rems (0.05 Sv); or. (ii) The sum of the deep-dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue other than the lens of the eye being equal to 50 rems (0.5 Sv).
