Causes of Pleural Effusions. The pleura is a thin membrane that lines the surface of the lungs and the inside of the chest wall outside the lungs. In pleural effusions, fluid accumulates in the space between the layers of pleura.
Pleural fluid analysis is used to help diagnose the cause of inflammation of the pleura (pleuritis) and/or accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion).
Pleural effusion, also called “water on the lung,” is an excessive buildup of fluid between your lungs and chest cavity. There’s always a small amount of liquid inside your lungs. This fluid works to coat the membranes (pleura) that line the outside of your lungs and lubricate the chest cavity to aid in breathing.
A pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity. Your body produces pleural fluid in small amounts to lubricate the surfaces of the pleura.
Fluid that accumulates in the pleural space because of trauma or disease is called pleural effusion. This condition may result from heart failure, cancer, pulmonary embolism, or inflammation. 1  If blood is in the accumulating fluid, the condition is called hemothorax;; 2  if pus is present, it is called empyema;.
Pleural fluid analysis is a test that examines a sample of fluid that has collected in the pleural space. This is the space between the lining of the outside of the lungs (pleura) and the wall of the chest. When fluid collects in the pleural space, the condition is called pleural effusion.
