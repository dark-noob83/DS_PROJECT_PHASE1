Crispy Skin. Place the chicken on direct heat to finish cooking through. This makes the skin extra crispy. At about 160 degrees F the chicken is finished. Remove chicken from the grill and let rest 5 to 10 minutes. The internal temperature will rise about 5 degrees while resting. 
Cooking it at Too High a Temperature. If you cook the chicken on too hot a grill, the skin will burn before the flesh cooks.
