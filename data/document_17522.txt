Many muscles of the thigh and lower leg attach to the fibula through tendons. One of the hamstrings, the biceps femoris muscle, has its insertion at the head of the fibula and pulls on the fibula to flex the leg at the knee. Click to read more below. The fibula is the long, thin and lateral bone of the lower leg. It runs parallel to the tibia, or shin bone, and plays a significant role in stabilizing the ankle and supporting the muscles of the lower leg. Compared to the tibia, the fibula is about the same length, but is considerably thinner
In human anatomy, the fibula is a bone of the leg. It is situated lateral to the tibia (larger shin bone) and between the patella (knee) and ankle. The fibula is not as long, … thick, or strong as the tibia, and does not provide weight support. The muscle is called a flexor if the centers of the connected … bones are brought closer together when the muscle contracts, and the movement is called flexion.
Fibula is lateral bone of the leg. It is weaker and smaller than tibia (the medial bone of leg). It is not directly involved in transmission of weight of body. It consists of a proximal end, a long shaft and a distal end forming lateral malleolus. The overall shape of fibula varies in form, being variably molded by attached muscles.
The gastrocnemius is one of the calf muscles, but attaches to the femur at the back of the knee, and runs down to attach to the calcaneus (heel bone) through the achilles tendon. It acts as a secondary knee flexor. This tendon continues below the patella to connect to the tibia. These muscles extend, or straighten, the knee. The hamstrings are the muscles on the back of the thigh. This muscle group is composed of the biceps femoris (outside), the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus (inside).
The knee is composed of four bones that make up three separate joints, which work together to allow movement through various positions in dance. These four bones are the Femur (thigh bone), Tibia (shin bone), Patella (knee cap), and fibula. This tendon continues below the patella to connect to the tibia. These muscles extend, or straighten, the knee. The hamstrings are the muscles on the back of the thigh. This muscle group is composed of the biceps femoris (outside), the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus (inside).
Introduction. The fibula is one of two long bones in the lower leg. A long bone is defined as one whose body is longer than it is wide, with growth plates (epiphysis) at either end, having a hard outer surface of compact bone and a spongy inner surface known as cencellous bone containing bone marrow. The fibula and tibia are the two long bones of the lower leg and run parallel to each other. They are similar in length but the fibula is much thinner than the tibia. This is suggestive of the weight bearing contributions of each bone.
All three begin at one common tendon attached to the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis (sit bones). The semimembranosus and semitendinosus connect to the tibia on the inside of the leg, and the biceps femoris connects to the top of the fibula on the outside of the leg. These muscles flex, or bend, the knee. This tendon continues below the patella to connect to the tibia. These muscles extend, or straighten, the knee. The hamstrings are the muscles on the back of the thigh. This muscle group is composed of the biceps femoris (outside), the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus (inside).
