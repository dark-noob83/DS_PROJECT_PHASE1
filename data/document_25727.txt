LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Carole Radziwill and boyfriend 2015 Adam Kenworthy are still together and still dating. But Countless Luann is telling news that Carole Radziwill’s timeline is false. Luann in a vague expression implies that her niece was still dating Adam Kenworthy when Carole Radziwill started romancing Adam. Carole disputes the same.
Carole Radziwill is still very much dating Adam Kenworthy, the much-younger private chef who used to work for LuAnn de Lesseps and date her niece. Carole and Adam actually enjoyed a Fourth of July weekend getaway in Lake Waccabuc, in upstate New York.
Luann says Sonja loves her and she loves Sonja. Andy brings up Luann’s tweets about Carole. Luann posted that Adam and the niece were still together and planning a trip together when Carole started screwing him. Luanne backpedals and basically says that Adam attended the niece’s birthday celebration in September. Carole’s position is that the niece and Adam broke up a year ago and still remain friends.
Carole addressed her relationship with Adam, and vehemently denied Luann de Lesseps claims about his relationship status with Lu’s niece. Andy tells Carole about Luann’s Tweets, claiming that her niece and Adam were still seeing each other and were even planning a trip together.
