A mala, which is Sanskrit for garland, is a string of beads—typically 108, in addition to one guru bead—which are used as a meditation tool while chanting, reciting or silently repeating a mantra. Malas help the wearer focus their mind and are often used to recite mantras in sets of 108 repetitions.
A mala is a string of 108 beads with one bead as the summit bead called a 'sumeru'. It is a tool used to keep your mind on the meditation practice. Malas are generally made from different materials such as tulsi (basil) wood, sandal wood, rudraksh seeds or crystal.
mala ‎(plural malas or mala). 1  A bead or a set of beads commonly used by Hindus and Buddhists for keeping count while reciting, chanting, or mentally repeating a mantra or the name or names of a deity.
The middle (second) finger is used to rotate the mala by one bead towards oneself with each repetition of the mantra. In the other method, the mala is hanging on the middle finger, with the thumb used to rotate the mala just as explained-one bead at a time. Either way, the index finger is never used to touch the mala.
Simply stated, mala beads are a set of beads that has traditionally been used in prayer and meditation — often called prayer beads.
Malas, strands of 108 beads plus a “guru” bead traditionally used for meditation and prayer, are the newest trend in wearable yoga, with designers making mala necklaces that combine gemstones imbued with potent energies and sacred meaning to infuse your practice.
Anatomy of a Mala: A mala is a string of beads used for prayer. Malas are made on the principle of the sacred number 108, so they will have either 108 beads or a divisible of that number: 54 or 27 beads. They are usually strung on silk thread with knots between each bead to maintain consistent space between each bead.
