A typical slab may be 50 square feet but with waste and granite remnants, it may yield only 35 square feet of stone counters. Most kitchens need multiple granite slabs-Countertops can be seamed. The size of the slabs can affect how many seams end up in your kitchen counters and where they must be placed. When you choose your stone, you'll want to know how many slabs you need and what thickness of stone to buy. An average granite slab size is about 9 to 10 feet wide and 5 to 6 feet tall (slabs are displayed vertically).
We need to find out how many square feet the granite will cover, so, since there are nine (9) square feet in a square yard, we will multiply twelve (12) by nine (9). Twelve (12) multiplied by nine (9) equals one-hundred-eight (108). So there the answer is. One cubic yard of decomposed granite will cover one-hundred-eight (108) square feet in a three-(3)-inch layer. But we need to double-check our work. So taking the number one-hundred-eight (108), we will divide it by four to find out how many cubic feet of granite there are, and we reach the number twenty-seven (27).
That is the amount of cubic feet of granite. There are twelve (12) inches in a foot. There are one-hundred-forty-four (144) square inches in a square foot [twelve (12) multiplied by twelve (12)]. One-hundred-forty-four (144) multiplied by twelve (12) equals (=) one-thousand-seven-hundred-twenty-eight (1,728). One cubic yard of decomposed granite will cover one-hundred-eight (108) square feet in a three-(3)-inch layer. But we need to double-check our work. So taking the number one-hundred-eight (108), we will divide it by four to find out how many cubic feet of granite there are, and we reach the number twenty-seven (27).
2. Multiply your total length by 26, the width in inches of standard countertops, to find total countertop area in square inches. So, 44 inches times 26 inches yields 3,744 square inches. Multiply 144 inches by 4 inches to find your total backsplash area in square inches. That's 144 times 4 inches, yielding 576 square inches of backsplash. Add the two totals together to find total square footage: 3,744 plus 576 equals 4,320 square inches. Divide 4,320 by 144 to convert to square feet: 30 square feet of granite. 
We have included the base square foot price for many of the materials that we offer on this website. For example, if your kitchen is 40 square feet, you would usually only need to purchase a full slab (there are roughly 50-60 square feet of material in a slab). The amount of usable square feet we can get out of slab varies depending on the layout of the job. 
Thickness can vary between 3/4 or 1-1/4. This roughs out to slightly over 39 SF per slab. Due to the fact that the slab is rough edged the width is important. At 4 1/2 feet wide, figure if you are lucky that you can get two 24 widths out of it for a 24 deep counter. Length too is rough. So figure 8 feet for length. Based on this, you are looking at 32 square feet of flat countertop with no backsplash from it. The thing to remember is that granite slabs vary
That is the amount of cubic feet of granite. There are twelve (12) inches in a foot. There are one-hundred-forty-four (144) square inches in a square foot [twelve (12) multiplied by twelve (12)]. One-hundred-forty-four (144) multiplied by twelve (12) equals (=) one-thousand-seven-hundred-twenty-eight (1,728).

One square foot is one foot wide by one foo â€¦ t tall (1 ft x 1 ft = 1 sq ft). Actually you can't measure how many feet are in a square foot since one is distance and the other area. for example, a rectangle that is 0.25ft by 4 ft would have a area of one square foot and a perimeter of 8.5 feet. One cubic yard of decomposed granite will cover one-hundred-eight (108) square feet in a three-(3)-inch layer. But we need to double-check our work. So taking the number one-hundred-eight (108), we will divide it by four to find out how many cubic feet of granite there are, and we reach the number twenty-seven (27).
