If the DHCP Start and End addresses are, for instance, 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.20, then the router will hand out addresses in that range to DHCP clients. All the other addresses on the network (192.168.0.21 through 254) can be used when you want to statically assign an address to a device.
DHCP server on the WiFi router may only support 50 or so devices, that is combining all WiFi and Wired connections. This number can be changed but can be misleading. Each DHCP client leases the IP address for a length of time. Typically 24 hours.
Computers and other devices connect to a WiFi network via a wireless access point (or wireless router on home networks). Is there a limit for how many devices can connect to and share a WiFi network?
Any router can support up to 254 additional devices. Actually 255 devices but 1 IP is reserved for the router itself. Double check that the DHCP is not limited to x number of addresses. I've seen some limit theirs to 5 ip addresses only. This is usually an option set within the router itself and can be adjusted.
The new Xfinity Wireless Gateway includes the 5.0 Ghz radio frequency. This new frequency is being used by many of the latest consumer electronic products (like the iPhone 5, iPad 4 and Kindle Fire HD) and results in better speed and performance from connected devices.
If the SSID is not listed or if you are unsure if your device supports 5 GHz WiFi, check the device manufacturerâ€™s documentation. Although the Business Wireless Gateway simultaneously broadcasts both 2.4 and 5 GHz, WiFi devices can connect to only one WiFi network at a time.
But most you can get is well over 200 devices on your network. From a technical perspective, the limit on how many devices can be connected to the Internet from behind a consumer router is not defined by the DHCP scope. The DHCP scope sets limits on how many devices can concurrently obtain IP addresses automatically from the router.
