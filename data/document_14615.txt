1 When you declare a variable by using the WithEvents keyword, Visual Basic .NET automatically connects to the events of that object at run time. 2  To handle a specific event for that object, add the relevant handler by using the Class and Method lists of the Visual Studio .NET environment while you are in Code view. - 3 or-.
The WithEvents statement and the Handles clause are often the best choice for event handlers because the declarative syntax they use makes event handling easier to code, read and debug. However, be aware of the following limitations on the use of WithEvents variables:

Using WithEvents and the Handles Keyword. Although event handling in VB .NET has changed, as I described, using the Handles keyword is the closest model to pre-.NET Visual Basic and it is the model used by default by the Windows forms designer.
The WithEvents statement and the Handles clause provide a declarative way of specifying event handlers. An event raised by an object declared with the WithEvents keyword can be handled by any procedure with a Handles statement for that event, as shown in the following example: VB. Copy. VB.
Code-behind (mypage.aspx.vb): WithEvents: This is not always required. This is used to provide the linkup of the event handlers so that you can create a method and use Handles cmdClickMe.Click to wire in the event.
