Preparing your Household for Move. Shipping large household goods can be easy if you know what to expect. First, you will want to decide whether you will ship your item by freight or through a moving service. Most household items can be shipped using either type of transportation service, so choose the kind that is right for you. 
The costs of renting a tow bar for a POV or insuring HHG aren't reimbursable. If you choose to personally arrange your move, a cost comparison between the actual expense (GBL) and the commuted rate methods will be done using the Commuted Rate Schedule (CSR) for Transportation and Storage of Household Goods. You're responsible for any excess weight. To estimate the weight of your household goods (HHG), multiply each room of furniture by 1,500 pounds. Don't forget to include items located in your garage, basement, etc.
Longer move, higher price tag. To get an idea of moving costs, consider these examples: The fee for moving an average 1,000-square-foot, 3-bedroom apartment (goods weighing 5,500 pounds) from Chicago to Miami would be approximately $4,400 to $4,900. The same 1,400-mile move for a 2,800-square-foot, 4-bedroom household (20,500 pounds) would likely cost $14,600 to $15,600. Same distance, different loads. For comparison, consider that moving a 1,000-square-foot, 3-bedroom apartment (5,500 pounds, same as above) 200 miles from Chicago to Indianapolis would cost roughly $3,200 to $3,700. Same load, different distance. Reputable movers use a rate book published by the Household Goods Carriers Bureau.

1 Moving out of a studio apartment with the help of 2 local movers will cost you around $150-$200 if the entire loading, transportation and unloading operations are complete within 3-4 hours. You may also be charged for packing materials. Make sure you keep this in mind when you speak with them to estimate moving costs. The average cost of movers for 2 men and a truck is between $90 and $120 per hour. If you decide to hire movers for labor only (without a moving truck), the professionals will charge about $60 to $80 per hour of labor.
