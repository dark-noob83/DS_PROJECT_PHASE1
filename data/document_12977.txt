I live in Ippy, it's not a bad place but definitely not the best. The town centre is run down, lots of empty shops. Shopping is generally rubbish, but Norwich is easily accessible which is great Night life isn't great either, a lot of pubs and clubs are shut now. There are things to do though, depends what you're into.
And, to top it all, people who live in Ipswich are becoming happier with their lot than those in any other place nationwide... apart from Aldershot! The rosy picture is painted in the Cities Outlook report by the Centre for Cities think tank.
