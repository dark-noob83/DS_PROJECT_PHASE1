HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a condition that develops as a result of HIV infection. HIV (Human Immunde Deficiency Virus) is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.) HIV is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, vagina … l fluid and breast milk.
HIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and biological properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.
Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. HIV is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4 + T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.
The most common names for HIV/AIDS refers to the wasting (cachexia) which typically occurs in the latter stages of the disease. This is often referred to as the ‘ thins ‘ or ‘ slim’s disease ‘, a term very often used in Africa in the native tongue. 1 CD4 count usually refers to the CD4 T-cell count which is an indication of the progression of the infection. 2  HIV targets these T-lymphoctyes and over time, the CD4 cell population drops.
HIV is the virus, which is transmitted from person to person and is the causative microbe responsible for HIV infection. The virus targets the body’s immune cells. AIDS is the syndrome that results once the immune system has been significantly compromised and is unable to maintain adequate functioning. 1 CD4 count usually refers to the CD4 T-cell count which is an indication of the progression of the infection. 2  HIV targets these T-lymphoctyes and over time, the CD4 cell population drops.
HIV antibody testing is used to screen for and diagnose HIV infections. Since there is no cure, early treatment of HIV infection and immune system monitoring can greatly improve long-term health and survival. Also, if a person knows his HIV status, it may help change behaviors that can put him and others at risk. Different types of antibody tests may be used for HIV screening: 1  All HIV tests used in the U.S. detect HIV-1, and some tests have been developed that can also detect HIV-2. ( 2 HIV-1 is the most common type found in the United States, while HIV-2 has a higher prevalence in parts of Africa.).

Common Names for HIV/AIDS. There are many common names for HIV/AIDS which varies among different cultures, languages and regions in the world. Example: isandulela ngculazi is the Zulu word for AIDS, widely used in South Africa which has the highest HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate. 1 CD4 count usually refers to the CD4 T-cell count which is an indication of the progression of the infection. 2  HIV targets these T-lymphoctyes and over time, the CD4 cell population drops.
