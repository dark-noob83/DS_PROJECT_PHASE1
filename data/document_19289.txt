The beginning of the fight for women’s suffrage in the United States, which predates Jeannette Rankin ’s entry into Congress by nearly 70 years, grew out of a larger women’s rights movement.
Equal Rights Amendment. The Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution was first proposed in the United States Congress in December 1923. It was promoted by Alice Paul and National Women's party, but opposed by many of their colleagues who had worked to pass the Nineteenth Amendment (women's suffrage) in 1920.

The Equal Rights Amendment. As founder of the National Women's Party, Alice Paul first introduced the Equal Rights Amendment to Congress in 1923. Paul would work for the passage of the ERA until her death in 1977.
Phyllis Schlafly was perhaps the most visible opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment. Her Stop ERA campaign hinged on the belief that the ERA would eliminate laws designed to protect women and led to the eventual defeat of the amendment.
