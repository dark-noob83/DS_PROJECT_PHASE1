‘A biological species is a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding organisms that can produce viable offspring.’. Advantages: This is a species concept based on a mechanism. Either individuals can or cannot produce viable offspring, although failure may be down to individuals.
The biological species concept defines a species as members of populations that actually or potentially interbreed in nature, not according to similarity of appearance.
The Morphospecies Concept ¥Morphological distinctiveness is thecenterpiece of this concept Morphological Species Concept : a species is a diagnosable cluster of individuals within which there is a pattern of ancestry and descent, and beyond which there is not. (Eldredge and Cracraft, 1980).
Definition of MORPHOSPECIES. : a taxonomic species based wholly on morphological differences from related species.
Exam 2 Lecture 12. UIC BioS 101 Nyberg. 11. The Morphospecies Concept. Humans are a visual species and applying visual criteria is a ‘natural’ way to distinguish types. Morphological features can be seen and preserved in dead individuals. Preserved individuals in museums provided a reference collection, fostering commonality in name usage.
Biological Species Concept. The biological species concept defines a species as members of populations that actually or potentially interbreed in nature, not according to similarity of appearance. Although appearance is helpful in identifying species, it does not define species. Appearance isnt everything.
Ernst Mayr invented the biological species concept in 1942. A biological species is a group of individuals that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring to the exclusion of others.
