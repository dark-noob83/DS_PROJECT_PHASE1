Relate this to the importance of the function for each animal! - Do sheep have spinal nerves? - How are the brains similar (structurally)? - What are the differences in appearance? - Why does the human brain have... 
The human brain is divided into two hemispheres while the sheep brain is not. Further, the human brain is again divided into four lobes based on function and such lobes are not seen on a sheep brain. Speaking of the function of the brain, the human brain has a broader capacity to function than a sheep brain.
Compared to a human brain, the sheep brain has a relatively smaller cerebral cortex and consequently a relatively smaller overall size. The other major parts are identical in terms of gross anatomy. http://www.western.edu/faculty/pstark/ps... http://psych.hanover.edu/classes/neurops... Source(s): McmC · 7 years ago. 
The human brain is larger. The positioning of the hind brain is different, due to the erect position of humans. Convolutions are increased in humans (increases surface area). The sheep's brain has a smaller cerebellum (lesser motor control/less complex learned motor behaviors). There is a larger pineal gland in sheep (related to circadian rhythms/seasonal reproduction). The difference between a sheep and human mammillary body in the  brain is that in humans there are two lobes in a sheep there is one  lobe. 1 person found this useful.
A sheep is a mammal of whom the structure and function of the brain is similar to a human brain. Compared to the human cortex-the outer layer of the brain-, the sheep brain has a smaller cortex. The sheep brain is small and weighs less. And, it is elongated in shape. Further, the human brain is again divided into four lobes based on function and such lobes are not seen on a sheep brain. Speaking of the function of the brain, the human brain has a broader capacity to function tha
However, there are several differences in human and sheep brains, but almost all mammals brains are similar. The human brain of an adult weighs about 1,300 to 1,400 grams, and in length is almost 15 cm long. A sheep’s brain is elongated in shape, whereas a human brain is rounded. The human brain stem is towards the backbone and downwards, because in the human body the backbone is vertical; compared to a sheep’s backbone which is horizontal, and its brain is directed outwards. The human brain, when compared to the sheep’s brain, has a much larger frontal lobe. Summary: 1. The human brain is heavier and longer than a sheep’s brain. 2. The sheep’s brain has a more developed olfactory bulb when compared to the human brain. 3
The human brain, which is the most complicated of all brains, is certainly different from the brains of other animals. Sheep is an animal whose brain is noticeably similar to the human brain, yet there are some distinct differences between the two. Further, the human brain is again divided into four lobes based on function and such lobes are not seen on a sheep brain. Speaking of the function of the brain, the human brain has a broader capacity to function tha
The difference between a sheep and human mammillary body in the  brain is that in humans there are two lobes in a sheep there is one  lobe.
