Generally, you can contribute up to $5,000 to an IRA in 2011 ($6,000 if you'll be age 50 or older by the end of the year), as long as you have taxable compensation at least equal to the amount of your IRA contribution. 
At that point all withdrawals from the Roth are tax free. The individual contribution limit of $5,000 or $6,000 applies to your combined Roth and traditional IRA contributions. For example, if your annual limit is $5,000 and you put $3,000 into a Roth IRA, you can only add $2,000 to your traditional IRA. Although a husband and wife may contribute just as much to traditional and Roth IRAs, only the traditional IRA contributions may be deducted on their joint tax return. Individuals may contribute up to $5,000 each year to a traditional IRA. When you reach the age of 50, the IRS increases the limit to $6,000. The money you put into a traditional IRA is tax deductible unless your adjusted gross income exceeds IRS income limits, discussed below. Only individuals can open and own IRAs.
As you probably know, a 401(k) can only be owned by one person. There is no such thing as a joint 401(k) or IRA. The most one can contribute to all of their own 401(k) plans in calendar year 2008 is $15,500. If you turn 50 prior to the end of 2008, then the max becomes $20,500. The same limits hold true for your wife. Being married and filing jointly have no impact on these limits. 
Best Answer: Both you and your wife can each contribute up to $15,500 to your respective employer 401(k) plans, assuming that these are the only employer retirement plans you participate in during the year. She can contribute up to $15,500 to her 401(k) and you can still contribute up to $15,500 to your 401(k) plan. Your filing status and the spouse's compensation have no bearing on the contribution limit to your 401k's. You can make nondeductible contributions to traditional IRAs and then move that money into a Roth IRA in 2010 with no tax due. The income limits are lifted for Roth conversions in 2010
Contribution Limits. Standard Roth IRAs have a contribution maximum of $5,000 per tax year per person. Individuals who earn less than $5,000 per tax year, however, can only contribute up to the amount of income they earned for the tax year. The maximum contribution amount is raised to $6,000 if the taxpayer is 50 years of age or older
Contribution Limits. The maximum anyone under the age of 50 can contribute to an IRA is $5,000 per year. The maximum limit for couples is $10,000, and it doesn't matter if that comes from one person or both.
Tax Reporting. The deduction for contributions to a traditional IRA by both a husband and a wife is reported together as the IRA deduction. You can use either Form 1040 or Form 1040A, but not Form 1040EZ. The deduction goes on the line entitled IRA Deduction.. For example, if the husband contributes $4,000 and the wife contributes $4,000, report an $8,000 IRA deduction. You can claim the deduction without having to itemize and give up the standard deduction. Not everyone qualifies to deduct their contributions to a traditional IRA. If neither the husband nor the wife participates in a employer-sponsored plan, both spouses can deduct their full contribution.
A husband and spouse may contribute to one another's traditional or Roth IRA. Because each spouse can contribute $5,000 or $6,000 per year, the combined contributions may total $10,000 to $12,000, depending on their ages. Individuals may contribute up to $5,000 each year to a traditional IRA. When you reach the age of 50, the IRS increases the limit to $6,000. The money you put into a traditional IRA is tax deductible unless your adjusted gross income exceeds IRS income limits, discussed below. Only individuals can open and own IRAs.
Best Answer: Yes, you are correct. If your AGI is less than $89K, you and your wife can each contribute $6K to a traditional IRA and take the full deduction. If your AGI is more than $89K your deduction is limited. You have until April 15, 2011 to make these contributions for 2010.
