If you are cooking a roast bone-in, the bone will act as an insulator and will require a longer cooking time than a boneless roast. If you are cooking the roast directly in a roasting pan, rack or not, start the roast at 450°F and then reduce the heat to 325°F. Also, the shape of the roast will have an impact on the cooking time. Our roast was rather long and thin, so it cooked up fairly quickly. A thicker roast may take longer than expected.

Step 1: Trim roast (we used a leg of lamb). Weigh and calculate cooking time-for lamb allow 25 to 30 minutes per 500g. Place on a trivet (roasting rack) in a baking dish. This allows the meat juices to drain form the roast. Use these juices to make gravy. Trim roast (we used a leg of lamb). Weigh and calculate cooking time-for lamb allow 25 to 30 minutes per 500g.

As always, there are many different recipes for cooking a leg of lamb. Elise cooks her leg of lamb with the bone in by starting at 425 degrees for 20 minutes then turns the oven down to 300°F and continues to roast the meat for about 10-12 minutes per pound for medium rare lamb. 
Sear the lamb roast for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time.
