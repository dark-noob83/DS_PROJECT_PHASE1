It occurs in almost pure form in cotton fiber and in combination with other materials, such as lignin and hemicelluloses, in wood, plant leaves and stalks, etc. As a carbohydrate, is primarily the chemistry of alcohols; and it forms many of the common derivatives of alcohols, such as esters, ethers, etc. These derivatives form the basis for much of the industrial technology of cellulose in use today.
Cellulose is an organic compound with the formula (C 6H 10O 5) n, a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of β(1→4) linked D-glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The cellulose content of cotton fiber is 90%, that of wood is 40–50% and that of dried hemp is approximately 45%. Cellulose is mainly used to produce paperboard and paper. Some animals, particularly ruminants and termites, can digest cellulose with the help of symbiotic micro-organisms that live in their guts, such as Trichonympha. In humans, cellulose acts as a hydrophilic bulking agent for feces and is often referred to as a  dietary fiber .
A plant uses glucose to make cellulose when it links many simple units of glucose together to form long chains. These long chains are called polysaccharides (meaning many sugars. and pronounced pahl-lee-SAK-uh-rydes), and they form very long molecules that plants use to build their walls. Cellulose. Cellulose is the substance that makes up most of a plant's cell walls. Since it is made by all plants, it is probably the most abundant organic compound on Earth. Aside from being the primary building material for plants, cellulose has many others uses.
Raw cotton is 91 percent cellulose, and its fiber cells are found on the surface of the cotton seed. There are thousands of fibers on each seed, and as the cotton pod ripens and bursts open, these fiber cells die. Cellulose and plant cells. Since cellulose is the main building material out of which plants are made, and plants are the primary or first link in what is known as the food chain (which describes the feeding relationships of all living things), cellulose is a very important substance.

Since cellulose is insoluble in water, it is easily separated from the other constituents of a plant. Cellulose has been used to make paper since the Chinese first invented the process around. 100. Cellulose is separated from wood by a pulping process that grinds woodchips under flowing water. Cellulose and plant cells.

Cellulase is any of several enzymes produced chiefly by fungi, bacteria, and protozoans that catalyze cellulolysis, the decomposition of cellulose and of some related polysaccharides; specifically, the hydrolysis of the 1,4-beta-D- glycosidic linkages in cellulose, hemicellulose, lichenin, and cereal beta-D-glucans. Important example are, the cellulase produced mainly by symbiotic bacteria in ruminants like cattle and sheep and in hindgut fermenters like horses that allows them to digest the cellulose from their grass diet. Cellulases are also produced by a few other types of organisms, such as some termites.
Cellulose is the major constituent of paper and cardboard and of textiles made from cotton, linen, and other plant fibers. Cellulose can be converted into cellophane, a thin transparent film, and into rayon, an important fiber that has been used for textiles since the beginning of the 20th century. uses of cellulose   Cellulose is a fibrous material found in most plants. Cotton for example is almost pure cellulose. Cellulose is used for making fibers for clothing etc.
