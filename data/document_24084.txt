My recipe for cooking brisket in the oven. 
The best cooking temperature for brisket depends on the method that is being used to cook it and the desired doneness of the meat afterward. When using a barbeque or similar cooking method, it is typically best for someone to cook brisket at about 225°F (about 107°C) to 250°F (about 121°C). Low heat allows the meat to cook slowly, which results in an excellent outer crust without burning or the meat becoming dry. The best temperature for brisket cooked on a grill is around 225°F (about 107°C) to 250°F (about 121°C), though cooking on a grill or in a smoker can be done as low as about 210°F (about 99°C). In an oven, the temperature can be set higher, to around 250°F (about 121°C) or 300°F (about 149
