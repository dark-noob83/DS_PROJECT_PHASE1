That's the question really, on average how long should a set of tyres last during normal driving, 20,000km, 30,000km, 50,000km? Thanks.
However, what is also important is tyre mileage. With an average of around 27,000 miles per year, summer tyres should be replaced at three and a half years and winter tyres after a maximum of seven years (assuming that the tyres have only been used each winter).
For a motorbike, 5000 k's can be good with some tyres. For car tyres, you may get only 10000 k's, or even less, if you are harsh. But if you treat them right, a good tyre could last 80000 to 100000 k's. All tyres have a tread wear indicator. Once you tyre is close to this indicator you should be looking at replacing them.
Wear and tyre performance. Performance, particularly wet grip, gets worse as the tread wears. This is more marked as the tyre wears below 3mm of tread and approaches the legal limit. Check tread depth more often once it gets down to 3mm and aim to replace tyres before the tread wears below 2mm.
Typically, each manufacturer will list how long its tires last on the labels. Carefully pay attention to these labels as it may be that a few extra US Dollars per tire will get you an additional 15,000 or 20,000 miles (24,000 or 32,000 km). Typically, tires last anywhere between 25,000 and 50,000 miles (40,000 to 80,000 km). There are a number of variables that must be taken into account, however. These include road, weather, and driving conditions. Also, some simple maintenance may be able to increase how long tires last by as much as 50 percent, so a tired rated at 50,000 miles (80,000 km) may be able to go 75,000 miles (120,000 km).
