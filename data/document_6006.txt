For dry-type transformers having a 220 [degrees] C insulating system and a winding hot-spot temperature of 220 [degrees] C, and with no unusual operating conditions present, the 20-yr life expectancy is a reasonable time frame. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer.
The temperature rise of a transformer is due to the power loss dissipated by the transformer in the form of heat. The power loss of a transformer consists of core loss and of winding coil losses, and can be predicted accurately. With these assumptions, the temperature rise of a transformer can be estimated by the following formula: δT = (Pσ/A T) 0.833. Where: δT = temperature rise in °C. Pσ = total transformer losses (power lost and dissipated as heat) in mW; A T = surface area of transformer in cm 2.
For start-up temperatures below –20°C (–4°F), it is recommended to energize the transformer, hold at no-load for at least 2 hours and slowly increase the load in 25% increments, allowing a minimum of 30 minutes between each increase. 
You should note that at loadings below 50% of full load, there is essentially no payback for either the 115 [degrees] C or the 80 [degrees] C transformer over the 150 [degrees] C transformer. Also, at loadings below 40%, the lower temperature rise transformers become less efficient than the 150 [degrees] C transformers. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer.
Most 150 [degrees] C rise dry-type transformers are built with 220 [degrees] C insulation systems. Operating such a transformer at rated kVA on a continuous basis with a 30 [degrees] C average ambient should equate to a normal useful life. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer.
For example, if an insulation is rated at 105 [degrees] C maximum, the manufacturer must allow a 10 [degrees] C differential between average and hot spot temperatures in a winding. If the room ambient is 40 [degrees] C, then the allowable temperature rise is as follows. Average rise = 105 [degrees] C (hot spot) minus 10 [degrees] C minus 40 [degrees] C (ambient) = 55 [degrees] C. Thus the transformer must be capable of withstanding a 55 [degrees] C average temperature rise. The total maximum temperature allows for a maximum ambient of 40 [degrees] C. If the ambient temperature is below this, the transformer will run cooler; if above, it will run too hot, unless a special lower temperature rise design is used. Impregnation.

The lower temperature rise transformers are more efficient, particularly at loadings of 50% and higher. Full load losses for 115 [degrees] C transformers are about 30% less than those of 150 [degrees] C transformers. The 80 [degrees] C transformer requires operation at 75% or more of full load for a 2-yr payback, and at 100% load to payback in 1 yr over the 150 [degrees] C transformer.
