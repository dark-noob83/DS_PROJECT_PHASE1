1 There are a lot of variables that impact the total cost, but a rough estimate for having a contractor insulate an open attic to modern standards is $0.50-$2.25 a square foot depending on local climate and the desired R-value of the materials. 1 A complete insulation job on a typical family home can run $2,000-$10,000 or more, but averages $2,500-$5,500, depending on materials, the regional climate and the local economy.
To calculate the total cost of an insulation project use the $/board foot column. A board foot is 1 inch by 1 foot by 1 foot. In other words, it is a square foot by 1 inch thick. So to figure the cost use the following equation: [square feet of area] x [inches of insulation thickness] x [cost per board foot] = [total cost for the installation]. 
For a cost analysis of hiring professionals, you can expect to pay roughly the same amount for materials as you would to do it yourself. However, because of how much work is involved with the process of installing insulation into floors and walls, the job can be costly. For labor costs expect to pay between $40 - $70 an hour. Because insulating walls and floors with blown-in insulation is more time-consuming and labor-intensive, the complete job will total between $1,200 and $1,800, a grand total that might make some want to complete it themselves, no matter the time it takes them.
Blown-in insulation is one of the most common ways to insulate the attic, crawl space, or walls of a home.

1 Cost: The average cost per square foot is between $0.64 - $1.19. 2  So, for a 500 square foot area, your estimate will vary between $145 to $200, if you do it yourself. 3  For a professional job, add between $150 to $300 for labor, and you're looking at around $300 to $500 for 6 hours of work. 1 There is little learning curve involved with the application, and a DIY job will cost you about $500. 2  Calling in the pros, on the other hand, will run you about $1,500 to $2,000 for an average 1500 square foot home.
1 A rough estimate for hiring someone to blow insulation into a flat roof, cathedral ceiling or wall cavities is $2-$3.50 a square foot, or $1,000-$3,500 for filling 1,000 square feet of empty wall or roof space. 1 A complete insulation job on a typical family home can run $2,000-$10,000 or more, but averages $2,500-$5,500, depending on materials, the regional climate and the local economy.
