According to standards set forth in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) document RFC-1918, the following IPv4 address ranges have been reserved by the IANA for private internets, and are not publicly routable on the global internet: 1  10.0.0.0/8 IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 -- 10.255.255.255.
up vote -1 down vote. For IPV4 the non-routable addresses ranges are from 10.1.1.1 to 10.255.255.254, from 172.16.1.1 to 172.31.255.254, and from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.255.254. These IP addresses will not be recognized outside of a private network. share | improve this answer. answered Nov 26 '13 at 15:49.
The private address segments (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255) are commonly referred to as non-routable addresses. I think what you are asking for is a reserved IP address that is reserved specifically to never be assigned.
Both of these address ranges (192.168.0.0 and 172.20.0.0) are considered private IP address spaces and are non-routable on the global Internet. You use them for private use on your home or office networks. This is all defined in RFC 1918. There is also the 10.0.0.0 network.
Note that only a portion of the 172 and the 192 address ranges are designated for private use. The remaining addresses are public, and routable on the global Internet. It is important to use caution when setting filters to exclude these private address ranges.
There are a few IP addresses that are reserved for private (non-routable) networking, 192.168.0.0, 10.0.0.0, and 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0. Remember that the zeros can be any number from 1 to 254. The most common private network is 192.168.0.0.
Report Abuse. Both of these address ranges (192.168.0.0 and 172.20.0.0) are considered private IP address spaces and are non-routable on the global Internet. You use them for private use on your home or office networks. This is all defined in RFC 1918. There is also the 10.0.0.0 network.
