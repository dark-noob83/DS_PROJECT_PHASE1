A batter hit by a pitch with the bases loaded is also credited with an RBI per MLB rule 10.04(a)(2). A pitch ruled a hit by pitch is recorded as a ball in the pitcher's pitch count, since by definition the ball must be outside the strike zone and not have been swung at.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. (Redirected from List of top 50 Major League Baseball hit by pitch leaders). Hughie Jennings holds the record for most times hit by a pitch. Below is the list of the top 100 Major League Baseball players who have been hit by a pitch the most during their MLB careers. Hughie Jennings holds the Major League record for most hit by pitches, getting hit 287 times in his career. Craig Biggio (285), Tommy Tucker (272), Don Baylor (267), Jason Kendall (254), Ron Hunt (243), and Dan McGann (230) are the only other players to be hit by more than 200 pitches during their careers.
The all-time record for a player being hit by a pitch is held by Hughie Jennings, who was hit by 287 pitches between 1891 and 1903. The modern-day record is held by Craig Biggio of the Houston Astros, who had 285 as of the end of the 2007 season when he retired.
A durable power hitter, Don Baylor will probably be most noted as the major league record holder for being hit by a pitch.
Per baseball official rule 6.08(b), a batter becomes a baserunner and is awarded first base when he or his equipment (except for his bat): 1  is touched by a pitched ball outside of the strike zone, 2  and he attempts to avoid it (or had no opportunity to avoid it), 3  and he did not swing at the pitch.
In the case where a batter swings and the pitch hits him anyway, the ball is dead and a strike is called. If the batter does not attempt to avoid the pitch, he is not awarded first base, and the pitch is ruled either a strike if in the strike zone or a ball if out of the strike zone.
