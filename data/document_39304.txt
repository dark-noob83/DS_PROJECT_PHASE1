Populus alba, commonly called abele, silver poplar, silverleaf poplar, or white poplar, is a species of poplar, most closely related to the aspens (Populus sect. Populus). It is native from Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula through central Europe (north to Germany and Poland) to central Asia.
The tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), also known as yellow poplar, is a fast-growing tree that has a life expectancy of 300 years if growing in optimal conditions. In urban/suburban settings, most specimens will more likely live between 100 to 200 years. Tulip poplars are not poplars but members of the magnolia family. They are tall, fast-growing shade trees that easily grow to 70 to 90 feet and can grow to more than 100 feet.
