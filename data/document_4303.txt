That is quite impressive but it pales in comparison with the orbital speed of the Earth, The average distance of the Earth from sun is 93.5 million miles. This means that in 365.25 days the Earth travels 587.5 million miles. This works out to about 67 thousand miles per hour. This is the speed we travel 24 hours a day, 365.25 days a year. The orbital velocity is 2πR/T where R is the average radius of the orbit and T is the length of the year.
1. Mercury is the fastest planet, which speeds around the sun at 47.87 km/s. In miles per hour this equates to a whopping 107,082 miles per hour. 2. Venus is the second fastest planet with an orbital speed of 35.02 km/s, or 78,337 miles per hour. 3. Earth, our home planet of Earth speeds around the sun at a rate of 29.78 km/s. This means that we are traveling at 66,615 miles per hour. 4. Mars, with an orbital speed of 24.077 km/s, or 53,858 miles per hour, travels considerably faster than the prior planets. 5.
The distance of Venus from the sun as it orbits around is 108,000,000 kilometers (0.7 AU). It takes Venus 224.65 days to complete its orbit, which means a year on Venus is approximately 224.65 Earth days. While all planets’ orbits are elliptical, Venus’ orbit is the only one which is closest to circular. Venus takes 242 earth days to rotate on its axis, so a day on Venus is about 242 Earth days. This is the slowest rate of a planet in our Solar System. 243 earth days in Venus takes longer than a Venusian year which is 224.7 earth days. The sun also rises in the west and sets on the east in Venus.
Venus has the most circular orbit of any planet in the solar system. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus. Since it orbits closer to the sun than Earth does, Venus orbits faster and completes a circuit every 7.4 months. But its day is much longer than Earth’s. Venus rotates once every eight months, so its day is actually longer than its year. This is the sidereal day—the rotation of Venus relative to the stars. 
Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million kilometres (about 0.7 AU) and completes an orbit every 224.7 days. Venus is the second planet from the Sun and orbits the Sun approximately 1.6 times (yellow trail) in Earth's 365 days (blue trail). Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows.
Venus revolves or orbits around the Sun once every 0.615 Earth years, or once every 224.7 Earth days. Venus travels at an average speed of 78,341 miles per hour or 126,077 kilometers per hour in its orbit around the Sun. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 2  Learn how. 
So, the Earth takes one day to rotate on its axis, and it takes one year to revolve around the Sun in orbit. Venus, on the other hand, takes 243 days to turn once on its axis, and it takes almost 225 days to travel once around the Sun in orbit. As you can see, a day on Venus is longer than its year. 
The orbit of Venus is the most circular in the entire Solar System. In mathematical terms, the eccentricity of Venus is less than 0.01. A year on Venus lasts 223 days. As Venus travels around the Sun, it ranges in distance from 107 million km to 109 million km. The average distance is 108 million km. This is 72% the distance of Earth to the Sun. Venus can get as close as 40 million km from the Earth. This is called an inferior conjunction every 584 days, on average
Venus has an orbit with a semimajor axis of 0.723 astronomical units (108 million kilometers), and an eccentricity of 0.007. Its small eccentricity and comparatively small size of the orbit give Venus the smallest range of aphelion and perihelion distances of the planets, 1.46 Gm. The planet orbits the Sun in 225 days and travels 4.54 AU in doing so, making the average orbital speed 35 km/s. 
Its average distance from the sun is 58,000,000 km-so in going once round it travels 360,000,000 km (approximately), and it does this on 88 days, so the average speed is 4.0 … 9 million km per day, or 170,000 km/hour, or 47 km/sec. 2 people found this useful. Shamus Jenner.
