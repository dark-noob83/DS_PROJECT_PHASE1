Taxpayers can pay using American Express, Discover, MasterCard or Visa. Payments can typically be made via phone, the Internet or through tax preparation software. The IRS website page  Pay taxes by credit or debit card  provides details and current prices. For taxes due April 15, 2015, the  convenience fee  ranges from 1.87 percent to 2.35 percent of the payment for credit cards. Those using a debit card will pay a flat fee of $2.49 to $3.95.
The fees may be different for credit card payments made directly from tax preparation software products that offer an electronic-filing option. For example, if you do your own taxes with TurboTax and use a credit card to pay through the software's e-filing option, you'll pay a 2.49 percent convenience fee. The IRS website's  Pay by Debit or Credit Card when you E-file  page provides fees for other e-filing options.
Pay by credit or debit card You can use all major cards (American Express, Discover, MasterCard or Visa) to pay your federal taxes. For information on paying your taxes electronically, including by credit or debit card, go to www.irs.gov/e-pay or see the list of service providers below.
You can pay by internet, phone, or mobile device whether you e-file, paper file or are responding to a bill or notice. It's safe and secure-the IRS uses standard service providers and business/commercial card networks, and your information is used solely to process your payment.
If you have a tax liability to pay, you have the option of remitting your taxes by credit card. This payment option is available to you, regardless if you electronically file your tax return or file a paper return.
If you don't have a bank account, you can pay your TurboTax fees with either a credit card or a pre-paid debit card. Another payment option is to deduct your TurboTax fees from your federal refund with the Refund Processing Service. We are unable to accept checks, money orders, or cash as payment.
