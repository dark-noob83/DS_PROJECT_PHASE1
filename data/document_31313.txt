Hans Selye (1907- 1982) was a Hungarian endocrinologist, first to give a scientific explanation for biological stress. Hans Selye explained his stress model based on physiology and psychobiology as General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS). His model states that an event that threatens an organism’s well-being (a stressor) leads to a three-stage bodily response: Stage 1: Alarm. Conclusion. Hans Selye's theory profoundly influenced the scientific study of stress. Stress is a state produced by a change in the environment and the nature of the stressor is variable. The individual appraises and copes with the stress, to reach the goal of adaptation

In 1936 Hans Selye created the stress model General Adaptation Syndrome , which thoroughly explains the stress response and how aging and disease are caused by chronic exposure to stress. 1. In this phase, the initial reaction of the body to stress is that it labels the stressor as a threat or danger to balance,that is why it immediately activates its fight or flight response system, and releases the “stress” hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol.
Hans Selye was born in Vienna in 1907. He earned a medical degree and Ph.D., from German University in Prague and a D. Sc. from McGill University in Montreal. His scientific research resulted in 38 books and over 1600 technical articles. Hans Selye is often considered one of the early pioneers of modern stress theory.
G.A.S. Spells Stress As with so many wondrous discoveries of science and medicine, it was by chance that Hungarian-born Hans Selye (1907-1982) stumbled upon the idea of the General Adaptation Syndrome (G.A.S.), which he first wrote about in the British journal Nature in the summer of 1936.

History Hans Selye was born in Vienna in 1907. He earned a medical degree and Ph.D., from German University in Prague and a D. Sc. from McGill University in Montreal. His scientific research resulted in 38 books and over 1600 technical articles. In his work, Selye - ' the father of stress research ,' developed the theory that stress is a major cause of disease because chronic stress causes long-term chemical changes.
His last inspiration for general adaptation syndrome (GAS, a theory of stress) came from an endocrinological experiment in which he injected mice with extracts of various organs. He conducted much important scientific work on the hypothetical non-specific response of an organism to stressors. Although he did not recognize all of the many aspects of glucocorticoids, Selye was aware of their role in the stress response.
General Adaptation Syndrome. Selye defined stress as: “Stress is the nonspecific response of the body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions.”. Selye identified three stages of adaptation which a person goes through in his General Adaptation Syndrome in 1936. Hans Selye is often considered one of the early pioneers of modern stress theory.
