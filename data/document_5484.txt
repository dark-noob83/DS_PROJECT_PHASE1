Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Located at 23.5 degrees North and 23.5 degrees South of the Equator, this area of Planet Earth (between those two lines) is known as the Tropics, and is colored with a lighter blue color on the globe.
The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun reaches a subsolar point, a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year. The tropics are distinguished from the other climatic and biomatic regions of Earth, the middle latitudes and the polar regions on either side of the equatorial zone.
The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5° north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the tropics.. This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky.
