the phosphate group of one nucleotide links to the deoxyribose unit of another to form the backbone of the dna strand the nucleobases form the ladder rungs when the two strands align and twist to form the classical double helix structureucleotides that form the strands of the dna structure are complex molecules which consist of both a phosphate moiety and a nucleobase adenine guanine cytosine or thymine joined to a five carbon sugar
structure and function of genes g enetic information is stored in dna and the expression of this information requires several steps that flow in one direction genes are segments of dna encoding information that ultimately direct the production of rna molecules that serve a variety of functions that includetructure of dna the molecular structure of dna forms a double helix with a backbone of each strand of the helix consisting of a repeating sugar phosphate sugar phosphate polymer the sugar is deoxyribose
dna structure an overview the dna structure consists of two chainlike molecules polynucleotides that twist around each other to form the classic double helix the cell s machinery forms polynucleotide chains by linking together four nucleotides nucleotides that form the strands of the dna structure are complex molecules which consist of both a phosphate moiety and a nucleobase adenine guanine cytosine or thymine joined to a five carbon sugar deoxyribose
dna structure this page looking at the structure of dna is the first in a sequence of pages leading on to how dna replicates makes copies of itself and then to how information stored in dna is used to make protein moleculesthis material is aimed at 16 18 year old chemistry students
the twisted ladder metaphora dna molecule is often likened to a spiral or twisted ladder in this analogy the rungs of the ladder are the base pairs a t and g c the sides of the ladder are the sugar phosphate backbones of the two strands this refers to b form dnaach strand is composed of nucleotides a nucleotide consists of a base a purine or pyrimidine a sugar between the other two components named deoxyribose and a phosphate group nucleotides are linked to each other via phosphodiester bonds forming a sugar phosphate backbone to each strand
dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is a long molecule that contains our unique genetic code like a recipe book it holds the instructions for making all the proteins in our bodies your genome is made of a chemical called deoxyribonucleic acid or dna for shortdna contains four basic building blocks or bases adenine a cytosine c guanine g and thymine t the order or sequence of these bases form the instructions in the genomedna is a two stranded molecule
the structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder with the base pairs forming the ladder s rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces of the ladder an important property of dna is that it can replicate or make copies of itselfhe other is rna in humans dna is the genetic material rna is transcribed from it in some other organisms rna is the genetic material and in reverse fashion the dna is transcribed from it dna is a double stranded molecule held together by weak hydrogen bonds between base pairs of nucleotides
nucleic acid structure refers to the structure of nucleic acids such as dna and rna chemically speaking dna and rna are very similar nucleic acid structure is often divided into four different levels primary secondary tertiary and quaternary
dna structure dna is o ne of the nucleic acids information containing molecules in the cell ribonucleic acid or rna is the other nucleic acid dna is found in the nucleus of every human cell see the sidebar at the bottom of the page for more about rna and different types of cellshe base pairs in dna are adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine dna has a spiral staircase like structure the steps are formed by the nitrogen bases of the nucleotides where adenine pairs
structure of dna the molecular structure of dna forms a double helix with a backbone of each strand of the helix consisting of a repeating sugar phosphate sugar phosphate polymer the sugar is deoxyribose
