If you give money or property to your children and don’t get something of equal value in return, the IRS calls it a gift, whether you designate it as a gift or not. Each year you can give your adult children some money without filing a gift tax return or otherwise reporting the gift to the IRS. This is the annual exclusion. For example, the 2012 annual exclusion was $13,000. If you give a gift of a future interest, you can’t claim it in your annual exclusion.

For instance, if you give your daughter $20,000 on December 17, $6,000 of it is taxable. You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax. But if you give your daughter $10,000 in December and wait to hand over the other $10,000 until January 1, both gifts are tax-free.
