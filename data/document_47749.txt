You can block someone using the Instagram app on your phone or tablet, but not on the web. When you block someone, they can't see your profile or posts. People aren't notified when you block them. To block or unblock someone: 1  Tap their username to open their profile. 2  Tap (iPhone/iPad), (Android) or (Windows). 3  Tap Block User.
When you block a user on Twitter they do not get notified that you have blocked them. By blocking a user on twitter means that they are not: 1  able to follow you. 2  able to add to any lists. 3  able to see your profile picture on their profile page or in their timeline.
No they don't get a notification or something saying that they have been blocked. The only thing that will happen is when they try to look at their friends you wont be there and if they click on you it will say you must be friends with this person HOPE I HELPED! :D BEST ANSWER ME PLZ!
People will not be notified when you block them. If you can't find someone using this method, try going to the person's profile and selecting Block from the menu on their cover photo.
No they won't be able to tell that you have blocked them I had to do this with someone I knew as well, I have just looked on Face Book and found this info A block prevents specific people from viewing your profile.
