Production and circulation: The cerebrospinal fluid is produces by the choroid plexus within the ventricular system of the brain, which is made of two lateral ventricles, a third ventricle and a fourth ventricle. From here it enters the subarachnoid space and circulate both upward (over the surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres) and downward (around the spinal cord). Eventually the cerebrospinal fluid enters the bloodstream by passing into the arachnoid villi and diffusing through their walls.
Within the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid circulates from the two lateral ventricles(in the cerebral hemispheres) into the third ventricle and then through the cerebral aquedu … ct of the midbrain into the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, some fluid continues down the central canal of the spinal cord, but the bulk of it circulates into the subarachnoid space via three openings in the walls of the fourth ventricle. the fluid returns to the blood in the dural sinuses via the arachnoid villi.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spine. It is produced in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain. It acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain's cortex, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. Hydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles, or cavities, of the brain, which may cause increased intracranial pressure (ICP) inside the skull. It may lead to enlargement of the cranium if hydrocephalus occurs during development.
The Cerebrospinal Fluid is absorbed into the venous blood in the dural sinuses through the arachnoid villi. Arachnoid villi connect the subarachnoid space to the superior sagi … ttal sinus. From the fourth ventricle, some fluid continues down the central canal of the spinal cord, but the bulk of it circulates into the subarachnoid space via three openings in the walls of the fourth ventricle. the fluid returns to the blood in the dural sinuses via the arachnoid villi.

The Ventricles CSF is produced mainly by a structure called the choroid plexus in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. CSF flows from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen (also called the foramen of Monro). CSF then flows into the subarachnoid space through the foramina of Luschka (there are two of these) and the foramen of Magendie (only one of these). Absorption of the CSF into the blood stream takes place in the superior sagittal sinus through structures called arachnoid villi.
THE NORMAL CSF. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced from arterial blood by the choroid plexuses of the lateral and fourth ventricles by a combined process of diffusion, pinocytosis and active transfer. A small amount is also produced by ependymal cells. The total volume of CSF in the adult ranges from140 to 270 ml. The volume of the ventricles is about 25 ml. CSF is produced at a rate of 0.2 - 0.7 ml per minute or 600-700 ml per day. The circulation of CSF is aided by the pulsations of the choroid plexus and by the motion of the cilia of ependymal cells.

CSF then circulates through the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid space of the meninges. CSF is returned to the venous system via the arachnoid granulations connecting the subrachnoid space with the superior sagittal sinus at the superior portion of the neurocranium.
