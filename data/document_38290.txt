While the normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, conditioned athletes and other highly fit individuals might have normal resting heart rates of 40 to 60 beats per minute.
A good resting heart rate for athletes is a heart rate that is around 50-60 beats per minute or lower. Moreover, a rate of around 50 heartbeats per minute is said to be quite good. To bring the heart rate lower than 45 beats, you need to do rigorous exercising for a long period on a consistent basis.
Most people have a resting heart rate of around 60 to 100 beats per minute, according to the American Heart Association. A resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats each minute when you are sitting or lying down and are calm and peaceful.
Even if you’re not an athlete, knowledge about your heart rate can help you monitor your fitness level — and it might even help you spot developing health problems. Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Normal heart rate varies from person to person. Knowing yours can be an important heart-health gauge.
The average resting heart rate is 66 to 72 beats per minute (bpm). A well-trained endurance athlete has a resting heart rate of 40 bpm. Miguel Indurain, a five-time Tour de France winner and Olympic gold medalist in 1996, recorded a resting heart rate of 28 bpm.
A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute. To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe.
