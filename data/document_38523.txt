The type of antifungal used depends on the specific type of fungus (e.g., tinea, candida [yeast]) that is causing the infection. There are many different types of fungal infections. Common types include the following: 1  Athlete's Foot (Tinea Pedis). 2  Ringworm (Tinea Corporis).
1 Distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO) is the most common type of fungal nail infection. 2  It is caused by the same fungi that cause most cases of athlete's foot (dermatophytes). 3  DSO infects the skin under the end of the nail (nail bed) and in the nail.
