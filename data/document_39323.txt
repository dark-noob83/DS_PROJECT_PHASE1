1 Legal blindness is a level of vision loss that has been legally defined to determine eligibility for benefits. 2  The clinical diagnosis refers to a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction, and/or a visual field of 20 degrees or less.
A person is considered legally blind if they cannot see at six metres what someone with normal vision can see at 60 metres or if their field of vision is less than 20 degrees in diameter. Government departments use the term 'legally blind' to define a person whose degree of sight loss entitles them to special benefits.
Legal blindness occurs when a person has central visual acuity (vision that allows a person to see straight ahead of them) of 20/200 or less in his or her better eye with correction. With 20/200 visual acuity, a person can see at 20 feet, what a person with 20/20 vision sees at 200 feet. In determining legal blindness, visual field (the part of a person's vision that enables them to see what is happening to the side of them) is also considered.
In order to be considered legally blind, someone must have vision of 20/200 (6/60) in his or her best eye with correction, and/or have a visual field that is limited to 20 degrees or less, in contrast with the 180 degree visual field enjoyed by people with healthy eyes.
Visual acuity is a number that indicates the sharpness or clarity of vision. A visual acuity measurement of 20/70 means that a person with 20/70 vision who is 20 feet from an eye chart sees what a person with unimpaired (or 20/20) vision can see from 70 feet away.
Here are the USA standards for legal blindness: Visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the better eye with corrective lenses (20/200 means that a person at 20 feet from an eye chart can see what a person with normal vision could see at 200 feet). -or-. Visual field restriction to 20 degrees diameter or less (tunnel vision) in the better eye.
If a person is totally blind (no light perception) in one eye yet can see better than 20/200 in the other eye there is no legal blindness. A person may even be missing an eye and not qualify as legally blind! Driving vision standards require 20/40 vision or better in at least one eye.
