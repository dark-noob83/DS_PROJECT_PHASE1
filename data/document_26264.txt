Design-driven manufacturing: 3D Printing Manufacturing Methods. Additive Manufacturing refers to a process by which digital 3D design data is used to build up a component in layers by depositing material. The term 3D printing is increasingly used as a synonym for Additive Manuafcturing.
Additive Manufacturing. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the process of making objects from 3D model data by joining materials layer by layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies, such as traditional machining.
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is any of various processes used to synthesize a three-dimensional object. In 3D printing, successive layers of material are laid down under computer control.
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is the fabrication of parts by binding or joining material together. Parts are usually built layer by layer until a completed object exists.
The term AM encompasses many technologies including subsets like 3D Printing, Rapid Prototyping (RP), Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM), layered manufacturing and additive fabrication. AM application is limitless. Early use of AM in the form of Rapid Prototyping focused on preproduction visualization models.
Additive manufacturing, sometimes abbreviated as AM, is a process that involves production of parts through successive additions of layers, which is the opposite of traditional subtractive manufacturing, where parts and pieces are removed during construction of a product.
Additive layer manufacturing is a modern fabrication process that can use a wide range of materials to create products ranging from medical implants to parts of an aircraft wing.
