Greetings to all LDWA members. Welcome to the website of the East Yorks group of the LDWA. Here are two Group photos, one from a walk near Aldbrough in 2011 and the other our annual Pilgrimage of Grace, at Aughton Church, where the ladies of Aughton provide refreshments.
Long Distance Walks. The UK has an excellent range of long distance trails, ranging in length from about 70 miles, to over 600 miles. 1  Coast to Coast. 2  Cleveland Way.
Long-distance walks. Every year, over the course of the spring and summer, we complete a long-distance walk across Yorkshire. But don't worry, we don't do it all in one go! Normally, we split it into a series of day walks, and we do one of them every month.
Introduction: The Wolds Way National Trail is a long distance footpath that follows a natural chalk escarpment which runs from Hull to Filey. At just over 76 miles long the walk crosses beautiful East Yorkshire countryside. The walk begins near the Humber Bridge and ends at Filey Brigg.
The first European long distance path to be designated, and opened, in the UK (in 1996) was the E8, which runs from Hull to Liverpool.
