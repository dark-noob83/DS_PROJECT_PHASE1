Vitamins. THIAMIN-B1 Chief Functions in the Body: Part of the coenzyme TPP(thiamin pryophosphate) used in energy metabolism. RIBOFLAVIN-B2 Chief Functions in the Body: Part of coenzymes FMN(flavin mononucleotide) and FAD(flavin adenine dinucleotid
1 Function in the Body: Part of coenzymes FMN and FAD used in energy metabolism. 2  Deficiency Disease: Ariboflavinosis. 3  Deficiency Sysmptoms: Sore throat; cracks & redness at corners of mouth; painful smooth, purplish red tongue; inflmmation characterized by skin lesions coverned with greasy scales.
Coenzyme A is derived from adenine, ribose, and pantothenic acid (a vitamin of the B complex). The two flavin coenzymes, riboflavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), occur universally in living organisms and play important roles in biochemical oxidations and reductions.
NIACIN-B3 Chief Functions in the Body: Part of coenzymes NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (its phosphate form) used in energy metabolism. BIOTIN Chief Functions in the Body: Part of a coenzyme used in energy metabolism, fat synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and glycogen synthesis.
Riboflavin has two active coenzyme forms, ri-boflavin 5â€™-phosphate (R5P; flavin mononucleotide [FMN]) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Dietary sources include milk, eggs, meats, yogurt, broccoli, almonds, cheese, soy, fortified grains, and dark green vegetables, in descend-ing order of concentration.
Coenzyme A. Coenzyme A is not tightly bound to the enzymes to which it is associated and is able to freely be released. It plays an important role in the metabolism of protiens, carbohydrates and fats which are important reactions that allow the energy from food to
Folate function. Part of coenzyme form THF that transfers 1-carbon compounds that rise during metabolism. Converts vitamin B12 to one of its coenzyme forms, synthesizes the DNA required for rapidly growing cells and regenerates the amino acid methionine from homocysteine.
