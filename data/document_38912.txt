NOW these 2 pipes meet in our throat section and when you drink a sorta valve is used to control which pipe is open or closed. When u choke drinking water, its because water is going down ur Air pipe.
0 OK, the other night when I was at work (Im a NA) one of my elderly cardiac patients called me into her room so I could help her drink her water--all of a sudden she started choking on it....turned beat red, couldn't breathe, etc. Then all of a sudden she threw it all up and was fine before I could even do anything.
You probably can't choke on water, because it is a liquid and will run right down your throat. But if you have something hard in your throat, you might choke on that! The wate … r might run down the wrong pipe and make you cough. That is basically all the discomfort that water can cause to you.
When you drink, the water can go into your windpipe, and the choking is your body's way of trying to get it out so you don't drown. This could be your problem. I agree that you should try drinking slower, and if that does not help, you should have a doctor check that out. Miranda · 6 years ago. Thumbs up. 2.
You would be very hard to fully choke on water. By that i mean die from it. Not unless ur or sum 1 is trying to do it delibretly, or it's caused by blood or other fluid created from your own body. I've choked on water many times and it's not pleasent, but just cough a lot.

Like most people, I have swallowed water down the wrong pipe.. However, in the past 6 or 7 years-I have had an experience where a drink goes down the wrong pipe and I literally cannot breath.
