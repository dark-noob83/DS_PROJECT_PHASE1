Save. If you are on the PlayStation Network, then you have a PSN name, which identifies you to your friends online, anyone you play with or against in online games, and anyone whom you interact with in PSN's Home. Of course, players sometimes choose PSN names that they later want to change for one reason or another.
If you want to continue to use the current email address with the new account you would have to change the email for the initial account first. Then you can link the first email to your second account.
