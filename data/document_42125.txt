1. Here in Fiji, its $60.00 per kg, some buyers buy them for $65.00 - $70.00. (That`s only the inner core-the main product of sandalwood) The chips are sold at $1.00 per kg to $5.00. This is sold at the black market price though. I don`t know about the legit market price.
A well grown sandalwood tree after 10 years may harvest for 125 kilogram of lumber or 100 kilogram of heartwoods. Base on the present market price sandalwood lumber is sold at conservative price of RM 500 per kg. A ten years sandalwood tree can be sold at RM50,000.00. A well manage plantation each acre of land is able to plant about 300~400 sandalwood trees.
According to conventional Sandalwood planting, 100 kg timber or 40 kg heartwood will be harvested on every tree after 30 years' growth. Based on 60 to 70 sandalwood trees per mu (1mu=0.0667 hectares), at least 6,000 kg timber or 2,400 kg heartwood will be harvested per mu in 30 years. As the growth period extends, the economic value of Sandalwood will accordingly improve.
The current price of sandalwood is Rs.12000 to Rs.13000 INR per kg + tax. Sandalwood is sold as small chips / billet. Less expensive sandalwood is also available and its not advised to buy these, since after extracting Sandalwood oil they sell dead wood (No therapeutic uses) with some fragrance.
Sandalwood oil prices have risen to $2,000 per kg recently. Sandalwood from the Mysore region of Karnataka (formerly Mysore), and Marayoor forest in kerala, Southern India is high quality.
