April 2015 Higher audit threshold for charities In March 2015, the government announced changes to charity law that allow more charities to become audit exempt. The changes apply to financial years ending on or after 31 March 2015. The threshold for the audit requirement is now £1,000,000 of income. If your charity has income between £500,000 and £1,000,000 and gross assets below £3,260,000 you may no longer require an audit. Previously this only applied to charities with less than £500,000 income. For charity groups, the audit threshold has also increased to £1,000,000. For charities that are now exempt from audit, they will still need an independent examination by a qualified accountant. All charities with more than £25,000 income must have an independent examination.

3. High Itemized Deductions for Your Income. Don’t try to claim $25,000 in charitable contributions if your income is $125,000. “The IRS has a range in which they consider certain deductions reasonable,” says David Vishnia, a CPA in New York. 6. This is a gimme for the taxman, so check your numbers. Then check them again. It doesn’t matter if you underpay your taxes because you added the numbers wrong, any underpayment will be due, with interest — currently 4 percent compounded daily, though it's set to decrease to 3 percent for tax year 2011.
The IRS allows you to deduct charitable contributions up to 50% of your adjusted gross income. If your deductions are greater than 50% of your AGI, you can carry over the remaining deduction to the next tax year. Keep in mind, however, that the IRS may raise an eyebrow if your charitable donations are disproportionately high compared to your income.
In order to claim a deduction for charitable donations, you have to itemize deductions on Schedule A, Form 1040. You need to enter dollar amounts for both cash and noncash contributions. If you donated clothing, household goods or other items valued at more than $500, you'll also need to complete Section A of Form 8283. If your deductions are greater than 50% of your AGI, you can carry over the remaining deduction to the next tax year. Keep in mind, however, that the IRS may raise an eyebrow if your charitable donations are disproportionately high compared to your income.
For individuals, it depends on your income. In fiscal year 2013, returns reporting income of under $200,000 stood a 0.88 percent chance of an audit. Those with incomes of $200,000 and more had a 3.26 percent chance. And if your income was $1 million or more, you had a 10.85 percent chance. 
A contribution to charity is nice, and tax deductible, but it may send up an audit flag. Ever on the lookout for questionable numbers on tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service has a system of audit flags that score each return for the probability of financial falsehoods. The donation must be to a qualified charity; the IRS keeps a complete database of these.The agency also wants you to keep records and receipts of cash contributions, and if you contribute more than $500 worth of non-cash goods, you must file Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions.
“If your return doesn’t fit the IRS’s profile, the computer kicks it out, and a human being looks at it.” The average charitable contribution is $3,790 for people with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 who claimed charitable donations, according to the most recent IRS statistics. 6.

Non-Cash Contributions. Donating non-cash items to a charity will raise an audit flag if the value exceeds the $500 threshold for Form 8283, which the IRS always puts under close scrutiny. If you fail to value the donated item correctly, the IRS may deny your entire deduction, even if you underestimate the value.
