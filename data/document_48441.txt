Coriolis mass flowmeters measure the mass flow of liquids, such as water, acids, caustic, chemicals, and gases/vapors. Because mass flow is measured, the measurement is not affected by fluid density changes.
Coriolis Flow meter Capabilities. Coriolis flow meters rely on the Earth’s coriolis effect to measure fluid mass flow rates. Inside of the Coriolis Flowmeter’s flow-body, flow is diverted into two parallel sensor flow tubes which are vibrated in opposition to one another by energizing a drive coil.
In a Coriolis mass flowmeter, the “swinging” is generated by vibrating the tube(s) in which the fluid flows. The amount of twist is proportional to the mass flow rate of fluid passing through the tube(s). Sensors and a Coriolis mass flowmeter transmitter are used to measure the twist and generate a linear flow signal.
Coriolis flow meter. A mass flow meter, also known as inertial flow meter and coriolis flow meter, is a device that measures how much liquid is flowing through a tube. It does not measure the volume of the liquid passing through the tube, it measures the amount of mass flowing through the device.
Recent advances in the development and performances of Coriolis meters have meant that the measurement of the mass flow rate of gases, such as natural gas for custody transfer applications, is now a reality.
Jeans. About Coriolis Meters. The French mathematician Gustave Coriolis formulated the principle that underlies Coriolis flowmeters. Coriolis showed in 1835 that an inertial force needs to be taken into account when the motion of bodies in a rotating frame of reference is described.
Theory of Operation A Coriolis meter is comprised of two main components, a sensor (primary element) and a transmitter (secondary). Coriolis meters directly infer the gas mass flow rate by sensing the Coriolis force on a vibrating tube(s).
