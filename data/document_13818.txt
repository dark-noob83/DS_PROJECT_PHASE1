In speleogenesis, a division of speleology, 'phreatic action' forms cave passages by dissolving the limestone in all directions, as opposed to ' vadose action', whereby a stream running in a cave passage erodes a trench in the floor. The term 'phreatic surface' indicates the location where the pore water pressure is under atmospheric conditions (i.e. the pressure head is zero). This surface normally coincides with the water table.
A classic active phreatic cave is that behind the Fontaine de Vaucluse in France, while Holloch, Switzerland, is a major system consisting mostly of relict phreatic passages [9]. 2. Cave passage developed in the phreatic zone and still actively forming. 1. Cave conceived and developed by dissolution, usually below the water table, where all voids are water filled within the phreas.
Disclaimer. 1. A cave that underwent most of its development above the water table. Within the vadose zone, drainage is freeflowing under gravity, and cave passages therefore have air above any water surface. The gravitational control of vadose flow means that all vadose cave passages drain downslope, they exist in the upper part of a karst aquifer, and they ultimately drain into the phreatic zone or out to the surface.

Abstract. Isolated caves are a special cave type common in most karst terrains, formed by prolonged slow water flow where aggressivity is locally boosted. The morphometry and distribution of isolated caves are used here to reconstruct the paleohydrology of a karstic mountain range. Passage density is relatively low, as the chamber commonly comprises the entire cave (passage density would be larger if extension passages exist). Chamber caves may reach large dimensions; the largest in the study area is Atarot Cave (Fig. 7 A), measuring 203 m (length) over 146 m (maximum width), and 20347 m 2 area.
Phreatic cave passages (or phreatic tubes) are formed below the water table by water flowing under pressure. They can vary in size from a few centimetres to several metres in diameter. Later as water levels drop a stream flows in the bottom of the phreatric tube and downward cutting begins. Avens are vertical tubes found in the roof of cave passages. They are not formed by water finding its way down a vertical joint from the top, but from the bottom by water, under extreme pressure swirling around. This means that there is often no way on at the top of an aven. A Breakdown Chamber.

Phreatic is a term used in hydrology to refer to aquifers, in speleology to refer to cave passages, and in volcanology to refer to eruption type. The term 'phreatic surface' indicates the location where the pore water pressure is under atmospheric conditions (i.e. the pressure head is zero). This surface normally coincides with the water table.
