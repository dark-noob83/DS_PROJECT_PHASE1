About Ecuador. Ecuador is situated along the north west coast of South America, and it borders the countries of Peru and Columbia. Ecuador’s capital is Quito which is less than 15 miles from the equator. The Galapagos Islands are considered a province of Ecuador.
Although the equator runs through hundreds of places, one country that takes particular pride in its unique geographical location is Ecuador. In fact, the official name of Ecuador-the Republic of Ecuador literally translates to Republic of the Equator.
RELATIVE LOCATION: Ecuador sits directly on the Equator, and subsequently is positioned in the northern, southern and western hemispheres. It's located on the northwestern edge of South America, and bordered by Colombia, Peru and the Pacific Ocean.
Due to Ecuador’s varied regions and because of is located on the equator, it is an excellent travel destination year-round. Rather than rotating through four seasons, most of Ecuador experiences oscillating wet and dry periods.
