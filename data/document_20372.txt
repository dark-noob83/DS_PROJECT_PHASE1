Project Home (deluxe) – $1,000 – $3,000/square metre. Custom Built Homes – $1,500 – $3,000/square metre. The cheapest you can build a house for in Australia is somewhere around $155,000. Front to back slope – $6,000/metre slope Side by side slope – $9,000/metre slope. 4 bedroom homes range from $130,000 (160sqm) to $190,000 (300sqm) when looking at the most basic range of properties.
The cost “per square meter” estimate, which currently ranges from PhP 23,000 to PhP 35,000, is a rough and aggressive ballpark figure based on prevailing cost of construction in the Philippines.

A That is a hard question to answer. How long is a piece of string? As a rule of thumb, for construction costs in South Australia, you will need to allow between $1000 and $1500 per square metre for a brick-veneer and cement roof tile custom-designed home.

A lot of builders and home owners talk about the cost to build a house in terms of dollars per square metre. The way this is calculated is by taking the total cost of the build and dividing it by the total floorspace of the home (not the land). The cheapest you can build a house for in Australia is somewhere around $155,000. Front to back slope – $6,000/metre slope Side by side slope – $9,000/metre slope. 4 bedroom homes range from $130,000 (160sqm) to $190,000 (300sqm) when looking at the most basic range of properties.
BUILDING A BUILDING B. Example of how building Cost per square meter can vary. Area on plan = 400m Length of walling = 80m Assume 3m high walling @ Currency 200.00/m. Then cost/m = 80 x 3 x 200 400 = Currency 120.00/m-cost per square meter. Area on plan = 400m Length of walling = 208m Assume 3m high walling @ Currency 200.00/m. Then cost/m = 208 x 3 x 200 400 = Currency 312.00/m-cost per square meter. The length of building B thus resulted in an additional expense of Currency 76,800.00 over that of Building A influencing cost per square meter. Reasons for the increase in costs are: 1  Building B has a higher perimeter/floor area ratio (to be discussed in more detail later) and requires 6% more external walling to enclose the same floor area than A. 2  Setting out costs will be increased by as much as 50%. 3  Excavations will cost between 6% and 20% more.
NOTE: if your house is 100 sq mt ground floor plus 50 sq mt next floor; the TOTAL floor area is 150 sq mt. Just multiply 150 with Php 25,000. NOTE: Php 25,000 per square meter floor area is for a very nice, good quality, middle class home in the Philippines, complete; you get the keys. (cost is not including lot). NOTE: The cost per sq mt is just a statistical figure derived over the last years.
Report Abuse. The way to estimate construction cost is by multiplying the cost/square meter (cost to build) with the floor area. In the Philippines, it will cost P25,000 per square meter to build a house using A-1 materials, with A-1 finish. P25,000 will mean a concrete house with granite kitchen tops, ceramic floors or narra wood parquet, and American Standard toilets and lavatories, including painting, lightting fixtures, etc. It is hard to give an exact cost because of so many variables.
