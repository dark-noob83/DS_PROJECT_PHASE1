You can grow most any variety as long as you plant at the proper time (personally we love candy-striped 'Chioggia'). In Louisiana, the best planting dates for beets are 1/15 - 2/28 (spring) or 8/15 -10/1 (fall) because, as you know, they need cooler weather. We'd probably go with a fall planting.
Growing beets can be tricky in very warm climates, and they must be harvested at the right time for peak flavor. If you are interested in how to grow beets in your vegetable garden here’s a simple guide to get you started on the right path.
Planting in Successions: Beets are the kind of crop that is best planted in small successions over a period of weeks in the spring and fall. If you plant a 25-foot row of beets all at once, you have all those beets ready for harvest all at the same time. It is better to spread that harvest period out so you can enjoy them longer. Beets can be sown in two or three successions at about three-week intervals to ensure a continuous harvest until late spring.
Harvest the Beets. Beets are a relatively fast-growing crop, maturing in about 40 to 70 days after planting. Beets should be harvested while the root is still young and tender, about 2 or 3 across. Occasionally dig up a beet to see whether it's the right size.
Summer: The problem with beets is that they don’t like being too hot. In temperatures over 80 degrees they tend to taste bitter and the roots become woody. That is why you want to plant beets as early as you can in your area so you can enjoy the harvest right up to the time the temperatures become too hot.
Step 1. Dig rows for your beet seeds with a shovel or hoe as soon as you can begin working the ground, or at least 30 days before your last expected frost. Beet seeds germinate in cool weather, so it is the best time to plant them. Rows should be 6 inches wide and the soil should be loosened to a 3-inch depth.
