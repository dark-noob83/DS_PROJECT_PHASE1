History [edit]. 's-Hertogenbosch station opened on 1 November 1868 as the northern terminus of the southern portion of the Utrecht–Boxtel railway (Staatslijn H), with service south to Boxtel. Only in 1870 were the two parts of Line H joined together, allowing for direct service to Utrecht Centraal. The second 's-Hertogenbosch station was characterised by its neo-Renaissance style, with a second floor for railway employees. During World War II, at 16 september 1944, the station caught fire and burnt down; it was never rebuilt to its former glory
