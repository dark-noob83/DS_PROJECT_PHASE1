The median for this type of construction is between $160 and $170 per square foot. Not surprisingly, New York tops the charts for most expensive city to build in for all of these building types. Convenience stores are generally less expensive to construct than the other building types because of their simpler nature. In that case, the cost was closer to $40-$60 per square foot. And if the building itself has structural or MEP issues, you could easily wind up approaching a new construction cost per square foot of $100 or more. I hope that helps.
Prices for post-construction cleanup vary, of course, but the average price for a residential job is $500-$800.

That is a fairly small size for an office building, which puts upwards pressure on the price per square foot. While the chart would suggest a cost in the neighborhood of $160 per square foot, the small square footage could easily push you up into the $200 per square-foot range.
The median cost for this commercial building type hovers around $100 per square foot. Because of the new trends in fast food being more boutique and less assembly line, the cost for a typical fast food restaurant is on the rise.

This post builds on one of earlier posts about commercial roof maintenance costs. How much does a commercial roof replacement cost? One study reports on a roof with average dimensions of 10,000 square feet, a new commercial roof can cost over $42,500, or over $4.25 per square foot. That study also found 80% of the roofs tracked had been replaced before they needed to be.
