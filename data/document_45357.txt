Types. The cost of a water softener primarily depends on the type of softening method it uses. The three main types of water softening methods include salt-based, salt-free and magnetic water softeners. In general, salt-based water softeners cost about $400 to $2,700, depending on the model. Salt-free water softeners range in price from about $1,300 to $3,000. Magnetic water softeners may cost just under $100, or as much as $800.
Installation Costs. The cost of installation will depend on the type of water softener that is chosen, but most plumbers charge a fee of about $600 for this service. Smaller water softeners that take a short time to install may only require an installation fee of $100.
