In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's rho, named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter (rho) or as, is a nonparametric measure of statistical dependence between two variables.
The Spearman's rank-order correlation is the nonparametric version of the Pearson product-moment correlation. Spearman's correlation coefficient, (, also signified by r s) measures the strength of association between two ranked variables.
A monotonic relationship is an important underlying assumption of the Spearman rank-order correlation. It is also important to recognize the assumption of a monotonic relationship is less restrictive than a linear relationship (an assumption that has to be met by the Pearson product-moment correlation).
The null hypothesis is that the Spearman correlation coefficient, ρ (rho), is 0. A ρ of 0 means that the ranks of one variable do not covary with the ranks of the other variable; in other words, as the ranks of one variable increase, the ranks of the other variable do not increase (or decrease).
Spearman's rho is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It differs from Pearson's correlation only in that the computations are done after the numbers are converted to ranks. When converting to ranks, the smallest value on X becomes a rank of 1, etc. Consider the following X-Y pairs:
Spearman's Rho Calculator. Spearman's Rho is a non-parametric test used to measure the strength of association between two variables, where the value r = 1 means a perfect positive correlation and the value r = -1 means a perfect negataive correlation.
The Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ranked variables. For a sample of size n, the n raw scores are converted to ranks, and ρ is computed from: where, is the difference between ranks.
