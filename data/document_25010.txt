Common Trade Names: Waspalloy®, Allvac® Waspalloy®. Waspalloy™ is a nickel-base alloy with excellent high temperature strength and good resistance to oxidation at a temperature up to 1200 °F. Waspalloy™ has higher stability and strength ranges than those available for alloy 718. Waspalloy™can be heat treated in three-steps: solution treatment, stabilization and age-hardening. Available forms are seamless pipe, welded pipe, seamless tube, welded tube, bar, wire, sheet, plate, forgings, pipe fittings and flanges.
This alloy offers high ductility in notched sections. In fact, the notched rupture strength of alloy A-286 is superior to many other commercial alloys with comparable high temperature properties. An advantage of this alloy is that it can be precipitation hardened and strengthened by heat treatments.

Waspaloy is a registered trademark of United Technologies Corp that refers to an age hardening austenitic (face-centred cubic) nickel-based superalloy. Waspaloy alloy is typically used in high temperature applications, particularly in gas turbines.
Description. Waspaloy is a precipitation hardening, nickel-based alloy which has been used in elevated temperature applications. The alloy has been used for gas turbine engine parts which require considerable strength and corrosion resistance at temperatures up to 1600°F (871°C).
