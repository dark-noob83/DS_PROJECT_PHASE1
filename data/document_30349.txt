There are over 800,000 named species in the Phylum Arthropoda, named from the Greek arthros (= jointed) and poda (= foot), including the familiar arachnids, crustaceans, and insects, together with a host of less familiar critters, like centipedes, millipedes and sea spiders. All arthropods have jointed appendages. Arthropods excrete by means of malphigian tubules, projections of the digestive tract that help conserve water. Terrestrial forms excrete nitrogen as uric acid, as do birds. Their waste is nearly dry, a superb adaptation to life on land. Arthropods have an open circulatory system, and separate sexes.
An arthropod (from Greek arthro- , joint + podos, foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages. Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, and include the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and caterpillars that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total metamorphosis to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.
An arthropod is an invertebrate that has an exoskeleton, a segmented body, and jointed attachments called appendages.

Crabs, lobsters, spiders, insects, centipedes, and millipedes these creatures all belong to the phylum Arthropoda, the most successful group of animals on Earth. Indeed, arthropods far outnumber all other types of animals combined, with an estimated 1 million species.

Trilobites, which flourished during Cambrian Period and were important animals in marine ecosystems for the remainder of the Paleozoic Era, had a pair of appendages on each body segment. 3 sections-head, thorax and abdomen. Exoskeleton. Paired, jointed appendages (may be legs, antennae, wings).
The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and caterpillars that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total metamorphosis to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.
The arthropod leg is a form of jointed appendage of arthropods, usually used for walking. Diagram of biramous leg of a trilobite; Agnostus spp. The appendages of arthropods may be either biramous or uniramous. A uniramous limb comprises a single series of segments attached end-to-end. A biramous limb, however, branches into two, and each branch consists of a
Invertebrate animals that have a SEGMENTED body, a tough EXOSKELETON, & JOINTED APPENDAGES. They are the most diverse and most successful animals of all time—3/4 of a million species have been identified. An external skeleton much like a suit of armor that protects and supports the animal’s body. Arthropods are classified based on the # & structure of their body segments & appendages-particularly their mouthparts. Growth & development of insects usually involves metamorphosis, a process of changing shape and form.
