Pulmonary artery: One of the two vessels which are formed as terminal branches of the pulmonary trunk and convey un-aerated blood to the lungs. The two pulmonary arteries differ in length and anatomy. The right pulmonary artery is the longer of the two.
Pulmonary artery is one of the two vessels branching from the pulmonary trunk is an integral part of the whole heart anatomy and is the vessel that transports de-oxygenated blood to the lungs coming from the right ventricles. The right pulmonary artery is longer of the two arteries.
The main pulmonary artery is responsible for transporting oxygen-depleted blood away from the heart and back toward the lungs. The main artery splits into the left pulmonary artery and the right pulmonary artery, each of which directs the blood to the corresponding lung. Along with the umbilical arteries, these are the sole arteries in the body that transport oxygen-depleted blood. The umbilical arteries are located in the uterus.
The pulmonary arteries carry blood from the heart to the lungs, to drop off carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen. There are two pulmonary arteries, one going to the left lung and one to the right. Knowledge provided by me-I'm a Paramedic. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs.
The pulmonary artery transports blood from the heart to the lungs. While most major arteries branch off from the aorta, the main pulmonary artery extends from the right ventricle of the heart and branches into left and right pulmonary arteries.
