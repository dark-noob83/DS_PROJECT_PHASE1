Lots of parents wonder whether their child is bigger or smaller than other kids the same age. To give you a benchmark, here are the values from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile for weight and height – meaning that half of kids fall within these ranges.
Boys Average Weight. The average weight for 12-month-old boys is just less than 23 lbs., with a normal range of 17.5 to 27 lbs. Twenty-four-month-old boys average about 28 lbs., and have a normal range from 23.5 to 33.5 lbs. The average 36-month-old boy is about 31.5 lbs., and ranges from 26.5 to about 38 lbs.
Girls’ Average Height. You can review the average height of a toddler-aged child using growth charts, such as those available online at Kids Growth. The average height for a 12-month-old girl is 30.5 inches, and the normal range goes from just over 27 inches to about 31 inches.
By age 2, their weight will be about 27 to 28 pounds and they will stand about 34 inches tall, on average. Your toddler's size can be compared to the growth charts developed by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control for growth assessment, just like when she was a baby, until she turns 3 years old.
The average newborn is 19.5 inches long and weighs 7.25 pounds. Boys have a head circumference of about 13.5 inches and girls measure in at 13.3 inches, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. 1  Baby Growth Charts: Calculate Height and Weight. 2  Charting Baby's Development.
