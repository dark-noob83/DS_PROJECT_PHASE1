GRINDAVIK, ICELAND--(Marketwire-Aug 3, 2011) - Scientists from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's world-famous geothermal spa and premium skin care brand, have developed two new skin care products based on Blue Lagoon's unique white Silica mud: Silica Mud Exfoliator and Silica Foot and Leg Lotion. The geothermal seawater is known for its healing power on psoriasis and beneficial effect on the skin. Blue Lagoon skin products became available in 1995. The line includes products for face and body that cleanse, boost and nourish the skin. Blue Lagoon skin care is available online on www.bluelagoon.com.
The Blue Lagoon is one of the top tourist attractions in Iceland, so it is no surprise that it is home to its own range of skincare and body products. They are made from natural minerals and algae that can be found in the lagoon’s waters. Icelandic wool is famous for its quality and warmth, since it is tough enough to keep the extreme cold at bay. The wool is also semi waterproof, and very common in Iceland due the large amount of sheep. Also called Lopapeyasa, the sweaters are easily recognized by their yoke design
