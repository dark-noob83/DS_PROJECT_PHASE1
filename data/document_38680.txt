• For the best grip, a router bit should be fully inserted into the collet and then backed out about 1/16″ (leaving between 3/4″ and 1″ of the shaft in the collet). The gap allows the collet and bit to be pulled down as the nut is tightened.
Collet chucks are best suited to workpieces smaller than 3 inches in diameter. A collet chuck may also impose a limitation on the workpiece length. Specifically, a collet chuck limits the machine's range of axial (Z-axis) travel, because its length is longer than that of a jaw chuck.
The collet chuck can be used effectively as a part-time solution. Swapping the jaw chuck for a collet chuck should take no more than 20 minutes. The collet chuck offers a mechanical clamping method that applies its force all around the circumference of the part, instead of at certain points. One advantage is low runout.
Even when a jaw chuck is used for the first operation, a collet chuck may be used for the second operation because of its precision clamping. A jaw chuck with bored soft jaws repeats within 0.0006 to 0.0012 inch TIR. A collet chuck typically provides repeatability of 0.0005 inch TIR or better.
A collet /ˈkɒlɨt/ is a holding device—specifically, a subtype of chuck —that forms a collar around the object to be held and exerts a strong clamping force on the object when it is tightened, usually by means of a tapered outer collar. It may be used to hold a workpiece or a tool.
The way a collet was designed to be used usually differs from the way that collets are used in practice. This is unfortunate given the critical role that collets play. A collet is the wedge between the toolholder and the cutting tool. This wedge, not the toolholder itself, is what does the actual tool holding.
• A collet is the steel sleeve that holds a router bit in a router. The collet works with the router shaft (connected directly to the motor) and the collet nut.
