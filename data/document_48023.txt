This Site Might Help You. RE: How to convert serial number in excel to a date? If there is the serial number, such as 39224, how do I convert it to a format of day-month (ex 5-May) I understand the aesthetics of the serial number, being the number of days since Jan 1 1900. But I can only figure out how to do either the month, day, OR year. I need to do Day AND month.
So for dates before 03/01/1900, the Excel number is effectively the number of days after 12/31/1899. However, Excel will not format any number below 0 (-1 gives you ##########) and so this only matters for 01/00/1900 to 02/28/1900, making it easier to just use the 12/30/1899 date as a base. If you change the format of the cells to General then this will show the date value of a cell as behind the scenes Excel saves a date as the number of days since 01/01/1900.
