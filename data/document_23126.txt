normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain s ventricles which are hollow fluid filled chambers nph is called normal pressure because despite the excess fluid cerebrospinal fluid pressure as measured during a spinal tap is often normal
the term hydrocephalus is derived from the greek words hydro meaning water and cephalus meaning head as the name implies it is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain although hydrocephalus was once known as water on the brain the water is actually cerebrospinal fluid csf a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord
hydrocephalus is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid csf the clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord this excessive accumulation results in an abnormal dilation of the spaces in the brain called ventricles
hydrocephalus is the buildup of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain normally this fluid cushions your brain when you have too much though it puts harmful pressure on your brain hydrocephalus can be congenital or present at birth
hydrocephalus is a condition that occurs when fluid builds up in the skull and causes the brain to swell the name means water on the brain brain damage can occur as a result of the fluid buildup this can lead to developmental physical and intellectual impairments
the term hydrocephalus is derived from the greek words hydro meaning water and cephalus meaning head as the name implies it is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain
hydrocephalus also called water on the brain is a condition in which there is an abnormal build up of csf cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities ventricles of the brain the buildup is often caused by an obstruction which prevents proper fluid drainage
