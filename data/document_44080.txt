Its spread is blamed on Anopheles, a type of mosquito which is usually found in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. When the culprit mosquito sinks its sting into a personâ€™s skin, the malaria parasites are circulated in the blood resulting in malaria fever.
Malaria parasites spread by successively infecting two types of hosts: female Anopheles mosquitoes and humans. See an animated PowerPoint slide of the malaria parasite lifecycle.
How the disease spreads. Malaria is spread when an infected Anopheles mosquito bites a person. This is the only type of mosquito that can spread malaria. The mosquito becomes infected by biting an infected person and drawing blood that contains the parasite. When that mosquito bites another person, that person becomes infected.
Malaria is caused by a type of parasite known as plasmodium. There are many different types of plasmodia parasites, but only five cause malaria in humans. The plasmodium parasite is mainly spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which predominantly bite at night.
Malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite. The parasite can be spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. There are many different types of plasmodium parasite, but only five types cause malaria in humans. These are:
Diagram of Adult Female Mosquito. Larger Picture. Malaria is transmitted among humans by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Female mosquitoes take blood meals to carry out egg production, and such blood meals are the link between the human and the mosquito hosts in the parasite life cycle.
How malaria is spread. The plasmodium parasite is spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes, which are known as 'night-biting' mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between dusk and dawn. If a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it can also become infected and spread the parasite on to other people.
