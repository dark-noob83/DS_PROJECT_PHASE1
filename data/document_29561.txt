Supplement. The phosphate group is important in living things in different ways. Firstly, it is an important structural component of nucleotide, which is the basic structural unit of DNA and RNA. Secondly, it is a component of energy-rich molecules, such as ATP.
Phosphate group: A functional group characterized by a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms (three single bonds and one double bond). One of these oxygen atoms must be bonded to another atom; if not, the structure is a phosphate ion. Generic phosphate group molecular structure.
Introduction [edit]. A phosphate group consists of a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms. It is usually ionized and attached to the carbon skeleton by one of its oxygen atoms. Compounds with phosphate groups are called organic phosphates and they are frequently involved in energy transfer reactions.
Phosphate group. phosphate group. (Science: chemistry) A phosphate group on a larger molecule, where the phosphorus is single bonded to each of the four oxygen s, and the other bond of one of the oxygen s is attached to the rest of the molecule. phosphate group.

Summary. A phosphate group is just a phosphorus atom bound to four oxygen atoms, but it has many important roles. Along with sugars and bases, it makes up nucleic acids, like DNA and RNA. As part of energy carriers, like ATP, it provides energy for moving our muscles.
