1 For example, if you have a regular-sized cupcake recipe that says it takes 21 minutes to bake, it will take only about 14 minutes for mini cupcakes, give or take 1-2 minutes. 2  Mini cupcakes take about 1/2 the time to bake compared to a recipe for a 9×13 (quarter sheet) cake. 1 Mini cupcakes take about 1/2 the time to bake compared to a recipe for a 9×13 (quarter sheet) cake. 2  For example, if you have a 9×13 cake that takes 30-35 minutes to bake, take the smaller number and divide it by 2.

—N.I., South Kingstown, Rhode IslandGenerally, the oven temperature will not need to be adjusted when baking mini or jumbo muffins, but the baking time will most likely need to be altered. Mini muffins will take anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes while jumbo muffins will bake from 20 to 40 minutes. Check jumbo muffins for doneness after 20 minutes, then every 5 to 10 minutes. Keep in mind that the baking time will vary according to the recipe. The variation is due to the oven temperature and the amount of batter in each muffin cup.
While most cupcakes take about 15-20 minutes to bake, most mini cupcakes take from 9-14 minutes or so to reach donenss. Check your minis at 9 or 10 minutes with a toothpick and bake longer as needed. 
Here’s my foolproof rule for baking mini cupcakes: 1  Mini cupcakes take about 2/3 of the time to bake compared to regular cupcakes. 2  For example, if you have a regular-sized cupcake recipe that says it takes 21 minutes to bake, it will take only about 14 minutes for mini cupcakes, give or take 1-2 minutes. 1 Mini cupcakes take about 1/2 the time to bake compared to a recipe for a 9×13 (quarter sheet) cake. 2  For example, if you have a 9×13 cake that takes 30-35 minutes to bake, take the smaller number and divide it by 2.
Once you have your batter, fill up the mini muffin pan as you would a regular muffin pan (filling each cup somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 full) and pop the tray in the oven. While most cupcakes take about 15-20 minutes to bake, most mini cupcakes take from 9-14 minutes or so to reach donenss. Check your minis at 9 or 10 minutes with a toothpick and bake longer as needed
