The More the Merrier. Some cattlemen recommend bottle feeding a calf three to four times per day. Consuming small, frequent meals enables a calf to better absorb nutrients. Mix 0.25 lbs of milk replacers with 1.5 quarts of water if you are feeding four times daily. 
Most farmers milk twice a day, 365 days a year. If a farmer were to skip a milking, the cow's udder would be sore and swollen from being full of milk. So you have an idea of what a rigorous and full time job a dairy farmer has. The farmer has some flexibility when making a schedule of cow milking times. Usually, cows are milked in the early morning and again in the late afternoon. It is possible to milk a cow by hand. However, milking a whole herd of cows twice a day in this manner would take a great deal of time and energy.
The average cow in the U.S. produces about 21,000 lbs. of milk per year, that’s nearly 2,500 gallons a year! On a daily basis, most cows average about 70 lbs. of milk per day, or about 8 gallons per day. 8 gallons is about 128 glasses of milk per day. Interestingly, a herd of 800 cows can produce a large tanker truckload of milk each day. Over a year, that would be about 20 million lbs. of milk or 2.3 million gallons of milk. **Productivity of the average cow in select countries. 
Normally, a cow is bred to give birth to a calf every year, at which time she will begin and continue to produce milk for a period of up to 12-15 months. Production peaks about two months after the calving date. Some 60 to 90 days after calving, the cow will be rebred for her next calf. We milk the cows robotically, which allows a cow to choose how often (typically three times a day) she wishes to be milked. The average cow produces approximately 54 lbs. of milk per day (about 7 gallons).
The production of these cows during the summer of 1921 averaged 80 gallons per day for 20 head.. So, that would be 4 gallons a day per cow, during peak (summer) production back when BGH was not available. Of course, breeding has also probably increased milk productivity since then, as well. The amount of milk produced will differ depending on the breed of the cow. However, assuming that 20L of milk per day per cow is reasonably average and that a glass of milk … is 250ml, one cow would produce around 80 glasses of milk daily. 2 people found this useful.

1 It would take you 1 hour to milk six cows by hand. 2  However, with a milking machine, you could milk 100 cows in the same time. 3  It takes each cow about 4 to 5 minutes to milk. The farmer has some flexibility when making a schedule of cow milking times. Usually, cows are milked in the early morning and again in the late afternoon. It is possible to milk a cow by hand. However, milking a whole herd of cows twice a day in this manner would take a great deal of time and energy.
A cow can poop up to 15 times a day. Heat-The body temperature of a cow is 101.5 degrees Farenheit (38.6 degrees Celsius). Milk-Female cows produce an average of 8 gallons (30.1 liters) per day, but may range from 4 to 20 gallons (15.1-7.5 liters). A gallon of milk weighs 8.6 lbs. In 1880 the average cow produced 2,003 lbs. (909 kg)of milk per year. In 1982 the average cow produced 12,316 lbs. (5,591 kg) of milk per year
As a rule of thumb, a cow will eat 2 to 2.5 pounds of hay per day for each 100 pounds of body weight (about one 30- to 40-lb. bale per day). If you feed grain, the usual is 16% dairy ration, which will balance well with most pasture or hay. Another rule of thumb is to give 1 lb. of grain for every 3 lbs. of milk. Average milk production is about 2 gallons each day when the calf nurses during the days but not at nights, or 4 to 5 gallons each day when a calf is not nursing. The butterfat content is 4 to 5% even when the cow gets little or no grain.
