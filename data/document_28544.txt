Fortunately a number of companies have recently developed new pasta recipes that are lower in calories, lower in carbs, and much higher in fiber than traditional pasta. Linda's Diet Delites offers a number of these new pasta styles, each with their own unique advantages.
Pasta is a high-carb food. Whole-grain pasta is made from grains that have the germ, bran and endosperm all intact. These components are what give whole grains their high nutrient value. Regular pasta is commonly made from semolina or durum flour that has been refined.
This is a low carb casserole that uses Dreamfields low carb pasta. With only 5 grams of digestible carbs per serving, now you don't have to miss out on your favorite meals when doing a low carb diet!! The total carb count for this casserole is only 13 grams per serving!!! Submitted by: DAPHNE_ANN.
Too bad there's no such thing as no-carb pasta. Oh wait, there is. The Japanase have a noodle by the name of shirataki that's made from a type of yam that's packed with dietary fiber but has no carbohydrates (some shirataki noodles are made out of tofu, which have a small amount of carbs). Shirataki are typically sold in wet form -- the noodles are bagged in liquid.
The carb value of pasta and whole-grain pasta is constant, but the amount of carbs in your meal can change. For example, if you use a sweet red sauce for either form of pasta, the carb content in your meal will increase.
Whole-grain spaghetti has 40 grams of carbs and 5 grams of fiber, so the net carb content is 35 grams. Fiber content is one of the main areas where these two types of pasta differ. Because whole grains have the bran, germ and endosperm, they retain more fiber and nutrients.
