The vihuela, essentially a flat-backed lute, evolved in the mid-15th century Kingdom of Aragon and was in common use in Spain and Italy by the late 15th through to the late 16th centuries. The viol developed from the vihuela when players in the second half of the 15th century began using a bow instead of plucking.
It is hard to imagine how the guitar could have evolved from the kithara, which was a completely different type of instrument-namely a square-framed lap harp, or lyre. (Right) It would also be passing strange if a square-framed seven-string lap harp had given its name to the early Spanish 4-string quitarra.
Lutes continued to evolved at the end of the Renaissance and into the Baroque period. Music demanded additional low notes from the lute in order to play thorough bass. The new function of the lute as a continuo instrument prompted the need for longer bass strings, generating a number of experimental lutes.
