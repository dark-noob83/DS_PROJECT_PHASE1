where do tsunamis most often occur in the world tsunamis occur most often in the pacific ocean and indonesia because the pacific rim bordering the ocean has a large number of active submarine earthquake zones
tsunamis are most likely to occur along areas of high tectonic activity which is the trigger of tsunamis in the first place areas of high tectonic activity are near the edge s of plates like the pacific north american plate and the indian plate
tsunamis occur as a result of seismic activity earthquakes at tectonic plate boundaries specifically ocean trenches or mid ocean ridges here earthquakes and volcanic eruptions under the water will cause the displacement of massive amounts of water and hence a tsunami
february 27th 2012 default most tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes but not all underwater earthquakes cause tsunamis in order for the underwater earthquake to cause a tsunami the earthquake must rank at 6 75 or higher on the richter scale
tsunamis can actually occur anywhere but there are areas of the world where they are more likely to happen most tsunamis occur around the pacific ocean due to high seismic activity japan for example is so prone to tsunamis that they even practice tsunami drills
tsunamis in the pacific ocean tsunamis occur most frequently in the pacific particularly along the pacific ring of fire this zone is found at the northern edge of the pacific plate and refers to the geologically most active fields of the earth several times a year strong earthquakes of at least 7 on the richter scale result in tsunamis
almost 80 % of the world s tsunamis occur in the pacific ocean tsunamis occur most often along countries which border the pacific rim of fire or ring of fire
generally the danger of a tsunami occurring exists where earth and lake quakes are possible in areas where tectonic plates collide with each other drift past each other or collide as well as in other areas with geological faults mostly beaches and coastlines are affected by tsunamis
report abuse most tsunamis occur in the pacific ocean as it is located on a plate mostly made of water the pacific ocean is also surrounded by the ring of fire a highly active volcano and earthquake zone
