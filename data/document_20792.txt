An obligation is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether legal or moral. There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of etiquette, social obligations, and possibly in terms of politics, where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled.
An obligation is something you may not like or even enjoy doing but you do it out of respect or some profound sense of duty.
: to make (a person or organization) do something because the law requires it or because it is the right thing to do.
As a transitive verb, one which requires an object, oblige can mean to restrict by external force or circumstances. To be obliged is to be in someoneâ€™s debt because of a favor or service. As an intransitive verb, one which does not require an object, oblige means to take action as a favor, or without reward. A person who obliges is an obliger, though the noun form is hardly ever used.
