Elevation (n) - the altitude of a place above sea level or ground level. Section (n) - a distinct part or subdivision of anything, as an object, country, community, class, or the like. Both are used in mapping. 0 11 months ago.
I was always taught that an elevation is looking at the side of something. You can show everything you would see from front to back and can include hidden lines for things behind. A section however is what you would see if you cut an object. You would only show what you can see at the cut line nothing in front and nothing behind. Like most things you can apply a bit of draughting licence. You can deviate from this a little for clarity or other reasons.
ABD ss4 difference between section and elevation in Create Building views. A section is a cut through the 3d-model. An elevation is different. It shows the face of something, or perhaps more correct, the projection of an object/s to a plane. But my testing suggests it produces SECTIONS, not elevations. It does exclude a wc chair-but not other geometry at the location of the callout that don't reach to the wall at the direction of the callout.
