E)table salt. B. DNA ---- hydrogen bonds play an an important role in the structure and shape of most large Bio-molecules like DNA. In fact, the bonds actually hold together the DNA molecule itself. Dry Ice is CO2. [ It's not water, it doesn't have hydrogen Air has no hydrogen. Hydrogen chloride is an ionic compound.
Key concepts: A hydrogen bond is formed by the interaction of a hydrogen atom that is covalently bonded to an electronegative atom (donor) with another electronegative atom (acceptor). Hydrogen bonding confers rigidity to the protein structure and specificity to intermolecular interactions.
A hydrogen-bond donor includes the hydrogen atom and the atom to which it is most tightly linked with. The hydrogen-bond also play a very important roles in proteins' structure because it stabulizes the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins which formed by alpha helix, beta sheets, turns and loops.
A hydrogen bond is formed by a dipole-dipole force between an electronegative atom (the hydrogen acceptor) and a hydrogen atom that attaches covalently with another electronegative atom (the hydrogen donor) of the same molecule or of a different molecule.
This partial positive charge is attracted to the partial negative charge of the hydrogen bond acceptor (an electron density rich atom). The chemical bond formed between the hydrogen-bond donor, hydrogen atom, and hydrogen-bond acceptor has a straight, linear structure.
Only nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine atoms can interact with hydrogen to form hydrogen bond; this is different than a hydrogen covalent bond. In a hydrogen bond, the lone pair electrons on oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine interact with the partial positive hydrogen that is covalently bonded to one of those atoms.
