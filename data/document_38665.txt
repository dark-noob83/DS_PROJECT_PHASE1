Although the hypothalamus does not produce the hormones of the anterior pituitary as in the posterior pituitary, it plays an important role in their production. Releasing hormones synthesized by hypothalamic neurons travel down axons and diffuse into the primary plexus of the hypophyseal portal system. The posterior pituitary is, in effect, a projection of the hypothalamus. It does not produce its own hormones, but only stores and releases the hormones created by the hypothalamus, whereas the anterior pituitary produces and secretes its own hormones.
A major organ of the endocrine system, the anterior pituitary (also called the adenohypophysis or pars anterior), is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior lobe (posterior pituitary, or the neurohypophysis) makes up the pituitary gland (hypophysis). Hypothalamic Control. Hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is regulated by releasing hormones secreted by the hypothalamus. Neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus project axons to the median eminence, at the base of the brain.
Hormones secreted from the pituitary in turn influence neurons throughout the brain (including the hypothalamus), and endocrine glands located in other parts of the body such as the adrenal, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, heart, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, testes, ovaries, and placenta. The pituitary gland is closely allied with the hypothalamus, both functionally and physically. Some hypothalamic neurons project directly to the neural lobe of the pituitary. Others project to the median eminence, where they connect with blood vessels that supply
1 The anterior pituitary or adenohypophysis is a classical gland composed predominantly of cells that secrete protein hormones. 2  The posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis is not a separate organ, but an extension of the hypothalamus. These hypothalamic hormones reach the anterior pituitary through the following route: 1  A branch of the hypophyseal artery ramifies into a capillary bed in the lower hypothalamus, and hypothalmic hormones destined for the anterior pituitary are secreted into that capillary blood.
While the anterior pituitary (a) is made up almost entirely of cells, the posterior pituitary (p) contains few cells and a lot of nerve cell processes--the axons of hypothalamic neurons. Supporting cells called pituicytes make up about one fourth or 25% of the volume of the posterior pituitary. If you can't see the anterior and posterior pituitary glands next to each other on a slide, they both become much harder to identify. The anterior pituitary can be confused with the pancreas or parotid glands, or even the liver. If you look closely, you can see that the cells are arranged in clusters.
The Hypothalamus and the Pituitary Gland. The hypothalamus is the region of the brain that controls hormone release, and is thus part of the neuroendocrine system. The pituitary gland is closely allied with the hypothalamus, both functionally and physically. Some hypothalamic neurons project directly to the neural lobe of the pituitary. Others project to the median eminence, where they connect with blood vessels that supply the pituitary.
The pituitary gland is often portrayed as the master gland of the body. Such praise is justified in the sense that the anterior and posterior pituitary secrete a battery of hormones that collectively influence all cells and affect virtually all physiologic processes. The pituitary gland may be king, but the power behind the throne is clearly the hypothalamus. As alluded to in the last section, some of the neurons within the hypothalamus-neurosecretory neurons-secrete hormones that strictly control secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitar
The pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland that sits in a protective bony enclosure called the sella turcica (Turkish chair/saddle). It is composed of three lobes: the anterior, intermediate, and posterior lobes. In many animals, these lobes are distinct. Hypothalamic Control. Hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is regulated by releasing hormones secreted by the hypothalamus. Neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus project axons to the median eminence, at the base of the brain.
Pituitary Gland. The pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is about the size of a pea and sits in the small, bony cavity (sella turcica) at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland is divided into two sections: the anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) and the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis). The posterior pituitary is, in effect, a projection of the hypothalamus. It does not produce its own hormones, but only stores and releases the hormones created by the hypothalamus, whereas the anterior pituitary produces and secretes its own hormones.
