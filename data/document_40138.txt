What is the Structure of the Nucleolus. Nucleolus is a central nuclear location where all the ribosomal RNAs are processed, synthesized and collected with ribosomal proteins. And thus in a cell, nucleolus is known as the factory for ribosome production. Through this article we will try to understand what is the nucleolus, and also know its function in a cell. Advertisement. In general biology, there are two major types of cells in living organisms: the prokaryotic cells and the eukaryotic cells.
The nucleolus is by far the most easily recognized substructure in the eukaryotic nucleus, and can be seen by using a variety of dyes as well as by phase contrast microscopy. Indeed, in budding yeast, the single nucleolus takes up nearly half of the nucleus. Cells from other species often have multiple nucleoli. 
The Nucleolus. The nucleolus is a prominent sub-nuclear structure that is not bound by a membrane and resides within the nuclear matrix. Though known to exist since the eighteenth century, the primary function of the nucleolus was not discovered until the 1960s. This is because nucleoli are formed at certain chromosome sites usually referred to as nucleolus organizer regions (NOR s), and two copies of five different human chromosomes contain NORs. The DNA found at chromosomal NORs encodes the genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
It is not surrounded by a membrane but sits in the nucleus. The nucleolus makes ribosomal subunits from proteins and ribosomal RNA, also known as rRNA. It then sends the subunits out to the rest of the cell where they combine into complete ribosomes. Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, do not have a nucleus or a nucleolus. In such cells, ribosomes are made in the cytoplasm. The DNA for making these ribosomes is in the nucleoid.

Definition of NUCLEOLUS. : a spherical body of the nucleus of most eukaryotes that becomes enlarged during protein synthesis, is associated with a nucleolus organizer, and contains the DNA templates for ribosomal RNA — see cell illustration.
The nucleolus is the nuclear subdomain that assembles ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells. The nucleolar organiser regions of chromosomes, which contain the genes for pre‐ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), serve as the foundation for nucleolar structure. Key Concepts. 1  The nucleolus, whose primary function is to assemble ribosomes, is the largest structure in the cell nucleus. 2  The nucleolus organiser regions of chromosomes, which harbour the genes for pre‐rRNA, are the foundation for the nucleolus.
The nucleolus is contained within the cell nucleus. The nucleolus (/nuːˈkliːɵləs/ ; plural nucleoli /nuːˈkliːɵlaɪ/) is the largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, where it primarily serves as the site of ribosome synthesis and assembly. Nucleoli also have other important functions like assembly of signal recognition particles and playing a role in the cell's response to stress. Nucleoli are made of proteins and RNA and form around specific chromosomal regions. Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause of several human diseases
It is the nucleus that also contains the nucleolus structure to help synthesize the ribosomes in the cell. Nucleolus is also referred to as nucleole, which means, a cellular structure found in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. What is the Nucleolus of a Cell. Both animal and plant cells contains a nucleolus. As aforementioned, the nucleolus is a cellular structure present in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. In cell biology, the nucleolus is defined as a sub-organelle of the nucleus of a cell (which itself is an organelle).
