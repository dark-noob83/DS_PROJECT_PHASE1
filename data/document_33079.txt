Veins can be classified as pulmonary veins and systemic veins. The pulmonary veins are a set of veins that deliver oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart and the Systemic veins drain the tissues of the body and deliver deoxygenated blood to the heart.
-Carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the air sacs (alveoli) within the lungs and returns oxygenated blood from the air sacs to the left atrium. - CO2 passes from the blood into the air sacs and is exhaled. - Inhaled O2 passes from the air within the lungs into the blood.
Arteries carry oxygenated blood (with the exception of the pulmonary artery and umbilical artery). Veins carry deoxygenated blood (with the exception of pulmonary veins and umbilical vein).
There are two types of blood vessels in the circulatory system of the body: arteries that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to various parts of the body and veins that carry blood towards the heart for purification.
Veins have generally been discussed in qualitative, relative terms, as “more compliant than arteries”, subject to “lower pressures”. Arteries have thicker walls than veins and contain more smooth muscle tissue and elastin.
Abstract. Veins have historically been discussed in qualitative, relative terms: “more compliant” than arteries, subject to “lower pressures”. The structural and compositional differences between arteries and veins are directly related to the different functions of these vessels.
Anatomy of Arteries vs Veins. Anatomy of an artery. Arteries that carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body are known as systemic arteries while those that carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs are known as pulmonary arteries.
Since the vein is more compliant and contains blood at a lower pressure, it is less likely to assume a circular shape than an artery. We calculated the eccentricity of the two vessels as 22 1 abeccentricity = − (7) where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis.
