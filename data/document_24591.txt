On an average day, most human beings can properly fuel by eating the daily recommended intake of calories (2,000 - 2,500), fat (70g - 95g), carbohydrates (230g - 300g) and other nutrients. But elite athletes are a different breed.
An athlete would need to add to this total all the additional calories expended from workouts. For example, a 160-lb. individual running at 8 mph would burn 986 calories in an hour. This amount needs to be matched in the diet. The body also requires 500 calories a day just to add muscles.
Consume more calories than your caloric expenditure in order to see muscle gain. For example, if you're a 150-pound man whose body fat is between 18 and 22 percent, you have a BMR of 1,620 calories. As a weightlifting athlete at the same weight, you should consume at least 2,120 calories per day to gain muscle.
For a male student athlete child between the ages of four and eight they should be consuming between 1,600 and 2,000 calories. The student athlete child between the ages of 9 and 13 should consume between 2,000 and 2,600 calories, and if they are between 14 and 18 they should consume between 2,800 and 3,200 calories. It is also important that the types of calories the athlete consumes are balanced between carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
The number of calories you need to eat each day depends on several factors, including your age, size, height, sex, lifestyle, and overall general health. As an example, a physically active 6ft 2in male, aged 22 years, requires considerably more calories than a 5ft 2ins sedentary woman in her 70s.
A typical female student athlete child between the ages of 9 and 13 should consume 1,800 to 2,200 calories a day, and if they are between the ages of 14 and 18 they should be consuming 2,400 calories.
