A: The length of a forensic science program will depend on which degree program you're enrolled in. An associate degree program will generally take around two years to complete, while a bachelor's degree will take four years. A: In order to become a forensic scientist, you will need an education in forensic sciences. If you are just looking for an entry level in the criminal justice sector, you can go for a 6 month certificate or diploma. A 4 year bachelor's degree can also get you entry-level positions with forensic departments.
The cost varies depending on the university and the master’s program itself. The cost varies by program as well. The average cost of an MBA, for example, is $40,000. At most universities, this is what master’s degree graduates will pay. Some institutions have programs for less, and MBA programs at Harvard or Stanford could cost in excess of $120,000. 
Masters Degree in Forensic Science. 1  Traditional. 2  1 and 1/2 to 2 and 1/2 years with a maxed-out class load – super-full-time: this may depend on the school, prior permission may be required. 3  2 to 3 and 1/2 years is the norm – usually full time: may depend on the school. 
Salary and Qualifications. The average annual salary for a forensic scientist with a master's degree was $61,000 as of 2013, according to the job site Simply Hired. This was more than $5,000 above the $55,730 the BLS reported for all forensic scientists in 2012. While the minimum educational requirement for this job is a bachelor's degree, a master's degree is preferred by some employers.
On the average, a bachelor’s degree in forensic science and technology can cost about $33,000 a year for tuition and fees, books and supplies and room and board. However, the ranges can vary from $11,000 to about $54,000 annually for these expenses. Hamline University, for example, offers the post baccalaureate certificate in Criminal Justice and Forensic Science which can be finished in 16 months. The program has a total tuition and fees cost of $25,300 and books and supplies of $2,400.
How much does it cost to go to school for a Forensic Science and Technology major and what are the most affordable colleges? The average annual out-of-state cost for a bachelor program in Forensic Science and Technology is $34,585 with an estimated average four year degree total cost of $138,340. For two year Forensic Science and Technology associate programs, the average total cost per year is $17,629 with an average two year total program cost of $35,258.
Okay. you need at least a bachelor's degree from a university (BS or BA) in chemistry, biology, or a combination and courses in forensic science. That would get you an entry level job in a state police lab, for example. More useful is a masters degree i forensic science or some training in forensic science with a major in chemistry, or anatomy/physiology to work in a medical examiner's office, for example. If you want to control your own destiny as a forensic scientist you need a PHD or an MD. Both require, in addition to an undergraduate degree (4 years) at least 4-6 years graduate work, including 1-3 years of postdoctoral training (for PhDs) or residency (for MDs).
