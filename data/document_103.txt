The Russell Sage study also examined net worth at the 95th percentile. (For households at that level, 95 percent of the population had less wealth.) It found that for this well-do-do slice of the population, household net worth increased 14 percent over the same 10 years. Their net worth is greater than or equal to that of 95 percent of all households, not greater than 94 percent.

Family net worth plummets nearly 40%. Income and net worth fell from 2007 to 2010. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The average American family's net worth dropped almost 40% between 2007 and 2010, according to a triennial study released Monday by the Federal Reserve.
Average net worth for the top 10% of households by income was $3.3 million in 2013, the survey found. That's more than five times the average wealth of the next 10% of households: $631,400. Fed Chair Janet Yellen highlighted the dearth of assets for lower-and middle-income families in a speech Thursday. She noted that the bottom fifth of American households had a median net worth of just $6,400 in 2013. Many had no or negative net worth. The next fifth had a median net worth of just $27,900.
That is why median net worth and average net worth is different. If four people have $5 and 2 people have $6 and three people have $7 and one person has $1,000,000, the average worth of the group is $100,000.30/person. Whoo hoo everyone is rich! Posted by Financial Samurai 144 Comments. According to The Wall Street Journal, the average net worth per person in America was $182,000 back in 2010. Then came a 2014 Credit Suisse survey highlighting the average net worth in America is a whopping $301,000 (see pic)!
Again, these people skew our average upward. The typical (median, or 50th percentile) millionaire household has a net worth of $1.6 million. * On average, our total annual realized income is less than 7 percent of our wealth. In other words, we live on less than 7 percent of our wealth. * Most of us (97 percent) are homeowners. 
Ten years later, it was just $56,335, a decline of 36 percent, according to a study by the Russell Sage Foundation. But even as the average American householdâ€™s wealth declined, the net worth of wealthy households increased substantially. 
Household net worth fell from 2007 to 2009 by a total of $17.5 trillion or 25.5%. This was the equivalent loss of one year of GDP. By the fourth quarter of 2010, the household net worth had recovered by a growth of 1.3 percent to a total of $56.8 trillion. An additional growth of 15.7 percent is needed just to bring the value to where it was before the recession started in December 2007. For example, a household in possession of an $800,000 house, $5,000 in mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000.
Where Americans stash their wealth. Americans have gotten poorer over the past decade. The median net worth of American households came in at $68,828 in 2011, down from $81,821 in 2000 (in inflation-adjusted dollars) and far below the peak of $108,585 in 2005, according to recently released Census Bureau stats. The composition of that wealth has changed over time. 
The typical American household has been getting poorer, too. The inflation-adjusted net worth for the typical household was $87,992 in 2003. Ten years later, it was only $56,335, or a 36 percent decline, according to a study financed by the Russell Sage Foundation. Their net worth is greater than or equal to that of 95 percent of all households, not greater than 94 percent.
