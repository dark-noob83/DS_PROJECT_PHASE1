Carbon dioxide is not produced in the air. It is produced on the ground, largely by the oxidation reduction (burning) of carbon rich organic matter, like forest fires. Animal … exhalations and plant decay are other sources of carbon dioxide release.
Decomposers. Decomposers, such as microbes and fungi, play an important role in the carbon cycle. They break down the remains of dead plants and animals and, in doing so, release carbon dioxide through respiration.
The carbon cycle. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is controlled by the carbon cycle. Processes that remove carbon dioxide from the air: 1  photosynthesis [photosynthesis: The chemical change that occurs in the leaves of green plants. 2  It uses light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.
Answer 2: Plants break down sugar to energy using the same processes that we do. Oxygen is needed to break the sugar into carbon dioxide, releasing energy the plants can use to stay alive. However, plants also take in energy from the sun and use it to make sugar, a step that converts carbon dioxide to oxygen.
During their lifetimes, plants generally give off about half of the carbon dioxide (CO 2), that they absorb, although this varies a great deal between different kinds of plants. Once they die, almost all of the carbon that they stored up in their bodies is released again into the atmosphere.
HOWEVER, Plants generally produce a NET NEGATIVE amount of carbon dioxide. Animals br … eathe in Oxygen, use this to burn stored energy and perform work within the body, and in the process bond the oxygen to carbon producing carbon dioxide which is exhaled. Plants do the same thing. they absorb oxygen, and use it in the process of burning energy to fuel growth, repair, produce fruit, etc. The misconception is common that plants do not use oxygen and do not create
