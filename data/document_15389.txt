Target, the second-largest retailer in the U.S., will lift its minimum wage to $9 an hour in April. The move comes just one month after Wal-Mart said it would raise its starting wage to $9 per hour this spring and $10 next year, giving around 500,000 workers a raise. Though Target said it would not comment on employee wages, Dow Jones reported and Reuters confirmed the bump Wednesday.
The average Target salary ranges from approximately $15,000 per year for Loader to $200,000 per year for Group Manager. Average Target hourly pay ranges from approximately $7.45 per hour for Sales Specialist to $64.00 per hour for Pharmacist. Salary information comes from 11,583 data points collected directly from employees, users, and jobs on Indeed.
