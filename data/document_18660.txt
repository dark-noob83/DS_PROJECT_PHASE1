Molecular compounds or covalent compounds are those in which the elements share electrons via covalent bonds. The only type of molecular compound a chemistry student is expected to be able to name is a binary covalent compound.
Magnesium itself is not a bond at all. Magnesium oxide would be an ionic bond because it is between a metal and a non-metal. Magnesium bromide is an example of a covalent bond … because one or more pairs of electrons are shared by two adjacent atoms. Answered. In Elements and Compounds.
Magnesium powder and an oxidizing agent is used as flash powder. Magnesium oxide, MgO is called magnesia and is used medically for neutralizing excess stomach acid and as a laxative (milk of magnesia is MgO in water). Magnesium sulfate, MgSO 4 .7H 2 O is called Epsom salt and is used as a cleansing agent.
In Elements and Compounds. Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a compound which is formed when oxygen (a gas & non-metal) from the air reacts with magnesium (a metal) to form a white powder known as magnesium oxid … e, a non-metal. Usually, heat is what makes the two elements (magnesium and oxygen) react. In food, magnesium oxide is used to prevent caking.
Magnesium oxide, or MgO, is an ionic compound: the result of a metal reacting with a non-metal.
