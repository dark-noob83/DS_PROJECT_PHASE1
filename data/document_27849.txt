Positive and Negative Coterminal Angles. While a positive angle is the measure of the rotation of its terminal side from positive x axis in anti clockwise direction, a negative angle is the measure of the rotation of the terminal side in the clockwise direction. Example: If θ = 45º, then θ' = 45 - 360 = -315 is a negative Coterminal Angle of 45º. More negative Coterminal angles can be found by subtracting multiples of 360 from θ. like 45 - 720 = -675º, 45 - 1080 = -1035º etc. If a given angle is negative, then a positive coterminal angle is got by adding 360 to it.
Two angles in standard position are called coterminal angles if they have the same terminal side. As coterminal angles result due to the rotation of the terminal side, they differ in multiples of 360º. Coterminal angle to a given angle can be found by adding or subtracting multiples of 360 to the given angle. Example: If θ = 45º, then θ' = 45 - 360 = -315 is a negative Coterminal Angle of 45º. More negative Coterminal angles can be found by subtracting multiples of 360 from θ. like 45 - 720 = -675º, 45 - 1080 = -1035º etc. If a given angle is negative, then a positive coterminal angle is got by adding 360 to it.
If you graph angles x = 30 and y = - 330 in standard position, these angles will have the same terminal side. See figure below. Coterminal angles A c to angle A may be obtained by adding or subtracting k*360 degrees or k* (2 Pi). Hence. A c = A + k*360 if A is given in degrees.

A calculator to find the exact value of a coterminal angle to a given trigonometric angle. Since there are an infinite number of coterminal angles, this calculator finds the one whose size is between 0 and 360 degrees or between 0 and 2Pi depending on the unit of the given angle. 
A c = - 17 Pi /3 + 6 Pi = Pi / 3. Find a coterminal angle A c to angle A = 35 Pi / 4 such that A c is greater than or equal to 0 and smaller than 2 Pi.

To find a positive and a negative angle coterminal with a given angle, you can add and subtract 360° if the angle is measured in degrees or 2π if the angle is measured in radians. Example 1: Find a positive and a negative angle coterminal with a 55° angle. 55° – 360° = –305°. 55° + 360° = 415°. A –305° angle and a 415° angle are coterminal with a 55° angle. Example 2: Find a positive and a negative angle coterminal with a angle. A angle and a angle are coterminal with a angle.
How to find the coterminal angle. Two angles a are coterminal if their sum is a multiple of 360°. What that means is that two angles are coterminal when they start and end in the same place. Examples of Coterminal angles are. 1  180° and − 180°. 2  170° and − 190°. 3  100° and − 260°. 4  360° and 720 5  °. 360° and − 360°
