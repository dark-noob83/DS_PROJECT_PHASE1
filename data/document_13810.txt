Symptoms of bacterial diseases often include fever and chills. For more information on symptoms, refer to symptoms of bacterial diseases. Bacterial infections can lead to serious, even life-threatening complications, such as sepsis, kidney failure, toxic shock syndrome, and death.
Symptoms of bacterial diseases vary depending on the type of bacterial infection, the area of the body that is infected, and other factors, such as the patient’s age and health history. The symptoms of bacterial diseases can also resemble symptoms of other diseases, such as colitis, influenza, and viral infections.
Bacterial diseases: Introduction. Bacterial diseases include any type of illness or disease caused by bacteria, a type of microbe. Microbes are tiny organisms that cannot be seen without a microscope and include viruses, fungi, and some parasites as well as bacteria.
Influenza, more commonly known as “the flu,” is caused by a contagious virus. Symptoms include body aches, sore throat, headache, fever, coughing, and chills. Perhaps because influenza is so common, misconceptions about the disease abound.
Symptoms and Types. Symptoms for a bird will depend on the type of bacteria, its location in the body and the organs it is affecting. Common symptoms in most bacterial diseases include listlessness, weight loss and loss of appetite. More specifically, stomach infections show digestive symptoms, such as a lack of appetite, and diarrhea. Liver infections display digestive and urinary problems.
The symptoms of bacterial diseases can also resemble symptoms of other diseases, such as colitis, influenza and other viral infections. The classic symptom of a bacterial infection is fever, although not all people with a bacterial infection will have a fever.
