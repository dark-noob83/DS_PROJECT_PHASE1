How many words per page is a good average for a novel. My book King of Princes has 320 pages and an average of 280 words per page on font size 16, Times New Roman. Therefore most of the pages are over 300 words to a page. Page breaks etc bring down the average. Any suggestions.
According to Amazon’s great Text Stats feature, the median length for all books is about 64,000 words. The figure was found through looking at a number of books’ text stats, until Brave New World‘s 64,531 word count landed in the exact center of all books–50% of books have fewer words and 50% of books have more words.
Just use the word count feature. Publishers go by word count, not page count. If you have double-spaced, 1-inch margins in a size 12 Times New Roman font, you'll have about 250 words per page, with is industry average for a MANUSCRIPT page. You don't need to worry about book pages. Publishers fiddle with formats, writers don't need to.
Each page contains about 34 lines, with an average word count of 11 words per line, thus 375 words per page. Excluding endnotes and index, the book has about 200 pages of text, which means its total word count is about 74,000 words.
I believe that the average words per page for a paperback book is 350 words. So, to figure out how many pages your manuscript would be as a paperback book, you would have to divide the word count of your novel by 350. Here is an example.
Word counts vary depending on font, double or single-spaced, whether there is more narrative or dialogue, and so on. I tend to get about 500 words, single-spaced, per page which is probably a fair estimate. Although drafts are often double-spaced to aid editing, books are single-spaced.
Each page (one sided) in novel format averages 250 words. Of course this depends on the amount of dialogue. But the average is 250. So if you're writing something on any sort of word processor and want to know how many pages as a novel it would be than go to 'tools', then 'word count'.
