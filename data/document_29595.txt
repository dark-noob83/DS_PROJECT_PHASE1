An annuity is a contract between an individual and a financial institution like an insurance company where the individual provides a lump-sum payment to the insurer. In return, the insurer invests the money on a tax-deferred basis and gives it back to the policyholder in the form of regular guaranteed income.
The current rate for this annuity program is 8.5 percent when the policy is issued at age 85 for a male applicant, but it's important to read the fine print.

You can't hang your hat on the annuity payout rate in deciding whether to buy the annuity.
