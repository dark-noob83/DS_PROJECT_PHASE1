Over 2/3 of the state is public land, much of it managed by the BLM and Forest Service. These areas are generally open to mineral exploration, and Idaho has a rich history. Gold has been found throughout the state, with rich discoveries found throughout dozens of mining districts.
Where in these states should you look for gold? Government records, in the form of geological reports and maps, will tell you where and in what quantity gold has been recovered in the past.
Two types of gold can be found in Idaho: load gold and placer gold. Load gold is larger chunks or nuggets; most of these remain embedded in quartz and are difficult to retrieve with a gold pan -- but it's not out of the question. Placer gold is common in Idaho.
There is still gold in the creeks and streams in Idaho. The best chance to find Gold in these creeks and streams, placer deposits, and near old mines and prospects, is to know where the occurrence of gold has been found. Before you dig or pan for Gold you will need a map to show you where to look.
