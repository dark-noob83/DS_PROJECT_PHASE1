The Kelvin (K) is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. The temperature 0 K is commonly referred to as absolute zero.. On the widely used Celsius temperature scale, water freezes at 0 °C and boils at about 100 °C.
The temperature scale commonly used in science is the Celsius or centigrade scale. The Kelvin scale is most often used in the thermodynamic and astronomical fields (and especially when dealing with temperatures close to absolute zero). There are two temperature scales used by scientists.
The SI system uses the Kelvin temperature scale, which begins at 0° (at absolute zero) and uses the same degree size as the Celsius or centigrade scale. Water freezes at 273.15 °K, which is the equivalent of 0° Celsius.
The SI (metric system) scale for temperature is the Kelvin scale, which uses the same degree unit as the Celsius scale but sets its beginning point of 0 K at absolute zero (defined as -273.15° Celsius). For general purposes, Celsius is indistinguishable, but there are no negative temperatures on the Kelvin scale.
