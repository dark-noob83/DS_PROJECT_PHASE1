Residual Heat or Carry-Over Cooking: Remember, the rib roast will continue to cook as it sets. The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit. Prime Rib Roast (standing rib roast), at room temperature (very important) 2 tablespoons butter, room temperature.

Serves 4 to 8 people depending on the size of the roast. Note: For medium-rare prime rib, we want to take the roast out of the oven at 120°F, and it will continue cooking until it reaches 130°F. If you prefer a medium prime rib, take it out at 130°F with a target temperature of around 140°. 1 Roast for 20 minutes, then lower the heat to 325°F and roast until the meat's internal temperature reaches 120°F, which will be another hour to three and a half hours, depending on the size of your roast.
