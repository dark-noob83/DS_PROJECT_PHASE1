First remember the syntax for the VLOOKUP Function is: VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup]). In our formula we know everything except the table_array argument. Remember we don’t know what sheet contains our lookup_value. The COUNTIF part of the formula is checking each sheet in the SheetList to find a match. If it finds a match it counts 1, the other sheets return a zero. Our formula now looks like this: The {1;0;0} above represents the count of matches on the 3 rows in the SheetList.
In a blank cell type the Vlookup formula. In the cell, enter this formula: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup). 1  You can use any cell to write this is, but remember that whatever cell you choose is entered as the “lookup value” in your function code.
There are situations when you have data on many sheets. In this lesson you will teach yourself how to do vlookup in this case. Your task: So, you have your data both in Sheet1 and Sheet2. You want to create a vlookup formula which will analyze data in these two sheets. Your formula will look like this: =VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet2!A1:B200,2). Explanation: The trick is to write Sheet2!A1:B200 instead of just A1:B200. Sheet2! is the information that you analyze data from the sheet which name is Sheet2. 
Step 3. Replace A2 in the formula with the cell reference of the first cell in the column from Step 1. Step 4. Replace Sheet1 with the name of the sheet that contains the array VLOOKUP will search. The name of the sheet is the name displayed on the sheet's tab at the bottom of the sheet. Step 5. Replace F10 with the first cell from the array column with the data VLOOKUP searches. Replace 2 with the column reference number for the column in Step 6. If this column is immediately to the right of the column from Step 5, this number is 2. If one column stands between the two, this number is 3; if two do, the number is 4.
The idea being that if VLOOKUP doesn’t find a match on the first sheet, it will check the next sheet and so on. The good news is we can, the bad news is it’s a bit complicated….but if you’ve only got a few sheets I‘ll show you an easier formula at the end. The COUNTIF part of the formula is checking each sheet in the SheetList to find a match. If it finds a match it counts 1, the other sheets return a zero. Our formula now looks like this: The {1;0;0} above represents the count of matches on the 3 rows in the SheetList.
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet1!A:B,2,0),IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet2!A:B,2,0),IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet3!A:B,2,0),*** Missing ***))). You can change the search area and extracting column number of each origin sheet, but make sure your key is always in the first column (the nearest column to column A or column A itself). up vote 3 down vote. Assuming your key is in column A (in all sheets, including the target sheet), and the data to extract is in B columns, type the following formula in column B of the target sheet: You have to give priorities to the origin sheets. Here I assume that you are about to look in sheet1, then in sheet2 and finally in sheet3
Specs: Windows XP. I am looking to do something similar to a Vlookup, but I have 9 sheets through which I want excel to look. Basically, I have a list of names with data that carries through 9 sheets, and then a shorter summary of specific names. I need to get the data on to the summary sheet for each name. 
Col_index_num. The column index number is the number of the column in the Table_array that contains the data you're looking for. VLOOKUP will try to find the Lookup_value in column 1. Col_index_num tells Excel which column in Table_array to return if it finds the Lookup_value in column 1. Range_lookup Range Lookup is an optional argument in VLOOKUP that can be either True or False. Let's try with an example for a better understanding. The following is the syntax for VLOOK: VLOOKUP(Lookup_value, Table_array, Col_index_num, [Range_lookup]). Lookup_value. Lookup Value is the value you want to search for. Lookup_value can be either an actual value, such as 1234, or it can be a reference to the value stored in a cell, such as A2.
