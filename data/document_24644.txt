Control on higher ground. The available Hill Descent Control feature helps monitor throttle, speed and braking when you need it most, while Hill Start Assist keeps brakes applied for a short time after you’ve removed your foot from the brake, to give you time to accelerate.
Hill Start Assist. Hill Start Assist has been driving me mad! HSA holds the brakes on for about 3 seconds if you're on a hill and come to a complete stop. For automatic transmissions, it engages on an 8% slope; for manual, at 3%. Kudos, Jeep engineers, on the effort.
