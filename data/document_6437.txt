According to the ASPCA, kittens typically weigh approximately 3.5 ounces right at birth. However, this weight may vary depending on a few different factors, namely the number of kittens in the litter and the specific breed type.
The weight of a newborn kitten varies based on his breed and the number of littermates he has, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. After birth, a healthy kitten should gain weight daily; if yours is not, you should take him to the vet.
The daily intake of food is based on the kitten's energy requirement. Caloric requirements for the newborn kitten are approximately 420 kilocalories per kilogram at birth, and by five to six weeks of age it needs only 240 to 275 kilocalories per kilogram. (A kilogram is 1000 grams, or 2.2 pounds.
A kitten's weight should double within the first 14 days of life. Kittens should be weighed daily or every other day for the first two weeks of life and then 2-3 times a week until weaning. Failure of weight gain is often the first sign of illness in kittens. The kittens will begin to imitate the queen eating and drinking around 3-4 weeks of age.
Kittens should be weighed at birth on a gram scale (newborns usually weigh between 90 and 110 grams [3.15 and 3.85 ounces), and then on a daily basis for the first two weeks. When properly fed, they will usually double their weight within the first week.
An average birth weight for kittens is about 3 ½ ounces, depending on breed and litter size. During the first weeks of life, a kitten’s body weight may double or even triple. Gaining ¼ to half an ounce daily until they are weaned is considered healthy.
Breed type may affect a newborn kitten's birth weight. The image of a newborn kitten is a sweet one indeed. Just one glance at a tiny and fluffy feline ball of joy may be able to soften even the hardest of hearts, even just for a second. At birth, wee kittens don't usually even weigh in at 4 ounces.
