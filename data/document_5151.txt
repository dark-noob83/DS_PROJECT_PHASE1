On July 6, the average rate for a weekly rental of a compact car booked a week in advance from an airport location was $396.50, up from $296.43 a year ago. There is sticker shock, says Neil Abrams, president of Abrams Consulting.
In early July, the average rate for a one-day rental of a midsized car booked a week in advance from an airport location was $99.81, up from $75.96 a year ago. That extra $23.85 per day can put a real dent in your vacation budget.
The average weekly cost of an Enterprise rental car will depend mostly upon the size and features of your selected vehicle. An economy car, such as a Chevy Aveo, gives you great mpg, but is the smallest of the options available. This car will cost an average of $125 to $150 per week.
Standard. Cars in the standard-or full-size rental class range in price from $55 to $75 per day. Standard cars offer the most room for the best price. In addition to two adults in the front, the back seats of full-size cars are roomy enough to comfortable fit two adults and a child.
The average cost of a house for rent in Florida ranges from $800 to $1500 per month depending on factors such as size, outdoor space, local ameneties and location.
On July 6, the average rate for a weekly rental of a compact car booked a week in advance from a non-airport location was $198.03, up from $174.34. And if higher rates weren't bad enough, there are also fewer cars available for renting this summer.
Intermediate-or mid-size rental cars are a step up from the compact class in both pricing and roominess. Intermediate cars cost approximately $50 to $70 per day and can comfortably accommodate two adults and two children.
Standard car: The average cost of $84.40 can be deceiving. Three rental firms had prices around $52, while the others charged about $133 for the same period. You might get a Dodge Charger, Chevrolet Malibu or Ford Fusion.
