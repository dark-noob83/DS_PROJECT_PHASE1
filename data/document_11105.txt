The pewter beads and findings we carry contain an alloy composed of 92% tin, 7% antimony and % copper. Tin is refined from ore that contains other metals, including lead. A chemical process is used to remove the lead, but trace amounts still remain.
Pewter is a predominantly tin-based alloy, typically containing between 90-98% tin composition. Additional metals are added to create the pewter alloy, traditionally antimony (1-8%) and copper (.25-3%). Modern pewter no longer contains lead.
Modern pewters are available that are completely free of lead, although many pewters containing lead are still being produced for other purposes. A typical European casting alloy contains 94% tin, 1% copper, and 5% antimony. A European pewter sheet would contain 92% tin, 2% copper, and 6
Modern pewter is still a tin-based alloy, but instead of potentially toxic lead, the tin is mixed with copper and antimony. These two metals strengthen the tin without lending the additional weight and potential toxicity of lead.
Antimony, Tin & Copper (no lead). This mark is similar to having Sterling on fine silver. The 1958 standard was 92% Tin, 5% Antimony and 3%Copper. This standard would change in a few years to 92% Tin, 6% Antimony and 2% Copper.
Pewter used for food vessels must be lead free and contain 92% tin, 6.7% antimony, and 1.2 % copper as required by both U.S. Government regulations and the APG (American Pewter Guild).
Silver is also sometimes used. Copper and antimony act as hardeners while lead is common in the lower grades of pewter, which have a bluish tint. It has a low melting point, around 170–230 °C (338–446 °F), depending on the exact mixture of metals.
Malleable Metal Alloy. Lead Pewter Alloy 85–99% tin, with the remainder consisting of copper, antimony, bismuth and lead. Lead-Free Pewter Alloy: An alternative to lead, the low copper content of this alloy pours more easily at the casting temperature than standard pewter. Todays newly manufactured pewter should be a lead free alloy usually being hardened with additions of antimony and copper, containing over 90% tin.
