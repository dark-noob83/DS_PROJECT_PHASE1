An average CFL bulb which provides 800 lumens will use only 13 to 15 watts compared to a similar incandescent bulb which uses 60 watts. Click calculate to find out the electricity cost of a single CFL light bulb running at 14 Watts for 5 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh, you can also modify the calculator. Cost Per Hour:
Part I: The Cost of an Incandescent Bulb. An incandescent light bulb costs about 50 cents and lasts about 750 hours. If you were to leave a 100-watt bulb burning for 24 hours each day, 365 days per year, it would use 876 kilowatt hours per year.
For example, a CFL bulb has a lifespan of approximately 10,000 hours. During that lifespan, it will use 140 kilowatt hours of electricity. At 20 cents per kilowatt hour, the lifetime electricity cost of a CFL is $28. To compare, an incandescent bulb will only last around 1,200 to 2,500 hours. If measured over the 10,000-hour lifespan of a CFL, incandescent bulbs will use around 600 kilowatt hours of electricity, which will cost $120.
A high-efficiency fluorescent bulb costs about $2-$5 and lasts about 8,000 hours. A 25-watt fluorescent bulb puts out roughly the same amount of light as a 100-watt incandescent light. If you were to leave a 100-watt bulb burning for 24 hours each day, 365 days per year, it would use 216 kilowatt hours per year.
The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity varies across the country, but average cost (including all charges) is about 15 cents. Your light bulb therefore costs about $32.40 per year to operate (216 kWh X 15 cents). 1  216 kWh x 0.15 cents = $32.40.
