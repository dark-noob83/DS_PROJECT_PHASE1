The IRS allows you to deduct qualified medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income for the year. Your adjusted gross income (AGI) is your taxable income minus any adjustments to income such as deductions, contributions to a traditional IRA and student loan interest. For example, if you have a modified adjusted gross income of $45,000 and $5,475 of medical expenses, you would multiply $45,000 by 0.10 (10 percent) to find that only expenses exceeding $4,500 can be deducted. This leaves you with a medical expense deduction of $975 (5,475 - 4,500)
The year in which you take a deduction for medical expenses depends on the year in which you pay the costs -- not the year you incur the costs. For example, say that you have surgery on Dec. 20, 2013, but don't pay the bill until Jan. 5, 2014. The medical expenses deduction is an itemized deduction, which means you can't claim it unless you give up your standard deduction and itemize. Plus, the medical expenses deduction isn't a dollar-for-dollar deduction.
You can claim medical expenses for yourself, your spouse and qualifying dependants (special rules applicable for qualifying dependants). You are allowed to claim medical expenses for any 12-month period ending in the year and not claimed for the previous year. 
You can claim for any 12 month period, ending in the tax year of your return, as long as you didnâ€™t claim the same expenses in the previous year. This may not make a difference to someone with regular prescriptions and other medical expenses. Where it could be useful is if your medical expenses in the previous year were too low to claim, but maybe the majority of your expenses were in the last three months of that year. This means that you need to carefully consider how you want to set up your 12-month period to claim tax benefits for you
1 On Schedule A, report the total medical expenses you paid during the year on line 1 and your adjusted gross income (from line 38 of your Form 1040) on line 2. 2  Enter 10% of your adjusted gross income on line 3. 3  Enter the difference between your expenses and 10% of your adjusted gross income on line 4. For example, if you have a modified adjusted gross income of $45,000 and $5,475 of medical expenses, you would multiply $45,000 by 0.10 (10 percent) to find that only expenses exceeding $4,500 can be deducted. This leaves you with a medical expense deduction of $975 (5,475 - 4,500)
If you missed out on a deduction for medical expenses in past years for any reason, even simply not knowing about the deduction, you can file an amended return for the prior three years. Filing an amended return requires completing Form 1040X to claim your additional deduction. The medical expenses deduction is an itemized deduction, which means you can't claim it unless you give up your standard deduction and itemize. Plus, the medical expenses deduction isn't a dollar-for-dollar deduction.
The first amount is exempted from claims. Of your total medical expenses, you have to subtract 3% of your net income (line 236 of your tax return) or $1,962, whichever is less. So if your net income is $40,000, you cannot claim the first $1,200 of your medical expenses. If your net income is $80,000, 3% is $2,400. Where it could be useful is if your medical expenses in the previous year were too low to claim, but maybe the majority of your expenses were in the last three months of that year. This means that you need to carefully consider how you want to set up your 12-month period to claim tax benefits for
Instead, you can only deduct the portion of your medical expenses in excess of 10 percent of your adjusted gross income, or AGI. For example, if you have an AGI of $60,000, the first $6,000 of your medical expenses isn't deductible. If you have $7,500 in medical expenses, you could only write off $1,500. The medical expenses deduction is an itemized deduction, which means you can't claim it unless you give up your standard deduction and itemize. Plus, the medical expenses deduction isn't a dollar-for-dollar deduction.
