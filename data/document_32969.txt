Ducks lay an egg every day or two until they have a full clutch (usually 8 to 15); only then will the mother start to sit on them. It takes the eggs 28 days to hatch from when she starts sitting all the time.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Ducks are approximately 6-8 months old when they start to lay eggs. I have 2 Peking Drakes,3 Peking Hens and 6 Mallard mix Hens and I feed my ducks the same food I feed my chickens as they are all in the same pens.
Muscovy will lay up to 180 eggs a year and hatch about four sets of ducklings if they get lots of high protein feed. Muscovy ducks are great mothers and do a good job raising their young. Muscovy take longer to hatch than other poultry... an egg takes 33 to 35 days to hatch. A chicken, for example, hatches in 21 days.
My ducks lay 1 egg per day, everyday. I think there was only one month in which they didn't lay any eggs. Ducks don't normally sit on their nest of eggs till they have a full clutch(which is approx. 12-15 eggs). One of my girls started laying not to long ago and after there was about 7 or 8 eggs i gathered them.
They start laying between the ages of 6-8 months old. They will usually lay an egg a day or an egg every two days. Normal flock feed with lil veggies as treats. I own ducks. And have had ducks my whole life.
