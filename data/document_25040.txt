A lot of factors go into that decision. The NBA Development League has a three-tiered salary system for simplicity of making deals with players. The “A” salary is $25,000, “B” salaries are $19,00 while “C” salaries are $13,000 according to multiple league sources and agents who spoke to D-League Digest.
Looks like I should have gotten better at basketball while I had the chance. The figures are staggering, with NBA's average player salary clocking in at $5.15 million, $1.85 million more than players in Major League Baseball who average close to $3.2 million a year. Major League Soccer rounds out the bottom of the list, with players making a relatively meager average salary of $0.16 million.
That’s just barely over six figures. The average salary of a WNBA player for the 2012 season was $72,000 while the league minimum rests just above $35,000 for rookies. Players with three or more years experience earn at least $51,000. $72,000 is still a decent check to people earning thousands lesser.
Something interesting to note is that, according to Stein, the per-team salary cap has actually decreased, from $178,000 to a now $173,000. With ten players per team, that's an average D-League salary of $17,300.
For more, see below: Salaries remain flat: $25,500, $19,000 and $13,000 for the league's three player classifications, which means D-League players are virtually playing for free -- and a modest per diem on the road of $40 compared to $120 in the NBA -- although they do receive housing and insurance benefits.
