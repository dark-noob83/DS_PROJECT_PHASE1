Polysaccharides are the most abundant carbohydrates. A polysaccharide molecule can contain thousands of glucose units. These highly complex carbohydrates include starches, cellulose, and glycogen. Starch is the usual form in which carbohydrates are stored as energy by plants. Plants can split starch into its simpler glucose units for use as energy when needed.
The carbohydrate energy storage molecule of animals is glycogen.  Glycogen is a substance deposited in bodily tissues as a store of  carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates contain three major categories of molecules: monosaccharides (or simple sugars), disaccharides, and polysaccharides. 1. Monosaccharides: This group, also known as simple sugars, is the simplest carbohydrate form.
The storage form of carbohydrates in animals is called glycogen. It's a multibranched polysaccharide. The quick-energy form of carbohydrate found is animals is glucose. Gluc … ose is a simple monosaccharide with the formula C6H12O6.

The storage form of glucose in plants is starch. Starch is a polysaccharide. The leaves of a plant make sugar during the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in light (photo = light), such as when the sun is shining. The energy from the sunlight is used to make energy for the plant.
