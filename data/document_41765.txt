Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides: 1  An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language, with the ability to convert PostScript language files to many raster formats, view them on displays, and print them on printers that don't have PostScript language capability built in; AFPL Ghostscript is distributed with a license called the Aladdin Ghostscript Free Public License that allows free use, copying, and distribution by end users, but does not allow commercial distribution.
Ghostscript is a suite of software based on an interpreter for Adobe Systems' PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF) page description languages. Ghostscript can also be used as a file format converter, such as PostScript to PDF converter; this is often combined with a PostScript printer driver in virtual printer PDF creators.
Introduction to GNU Ghostscript. Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides: 1  An interpreter for the PostScript language and the PDF file format, 2  A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the PostScript language, and.
Like Ghostscript, MuPDF consists both of an interpreter and a graphics library (sometimes called 'Fitz'). The name MuPDF is used both to refer to the PDF interpreter/viewer, the associated tools for manipulating PDF files and to the package of MuPDF and MuXPS together. This consists of an XPS interpreter hooked up to the Ghostscript graphics library. GhostXPS is available both under the GNU Affero GPL license and for commercial licensing from Artifex. Binaries for GhostXPS for various systems can be downloaded from www.ghostscript.com/download.

Ghostscript is a suite of software based on an interpreter for Adobe PostScript and is designed for rasterization or rendering of such page description language files, for the display or printing of document pages, and the conversion between PostScript and PDF files. 
Ghostscript can be used as a raster image processor (RIP) for raster computer printers —for instance, as an input filter of line printer daemon —or as the RIP engine behind PostScript and PDF viewers. Ghostscript can also be used as a file format converter, such as PostScript to PDF converter. 1 Moonshiner is a graphical front-end for using Ghostscript to convert from PostScript to PDF, aiming to be a Linux work-alike for Adobe's Distiller. 2  Okular runs under Unix/X11 and Microsoft Windows (using KDE4 for Windows). 3  It is a KDE4 application.
Part of the Printers glossary: Ghostscript is a program for UNIX systems that interprets a PostScript file (which is a file formatted for a PostScript printer) so that, using a related program, Ghostview, you can view it on a display screen.
