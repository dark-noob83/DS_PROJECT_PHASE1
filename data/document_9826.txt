A firkin, derived from the Dutch word vierdekijn (meaning fourth), is actually a small barrel of beer that is one-fourth the size of a stand full barrel of beer; as opposed to a standard beer barrel, which contains 30.96 gallons, a firkin full of cask ale will contain a volume of 10.79 gallons. 
I get asked a lot what the heck a firkin is and why do people serve beer in one. Well, here is the answer. A firkin is a unit of measure and also the size of a particular kind of keg used for cask conditioning; one quarter of a barrel, 72 pints, 9 imperial gallons. Firkins can be wooden or metal. The most curious thing about them is the manner in which they are tapped. 
The tun is a cask that is double the size of a butt and is equal to six barrels and has a capacity of 216 imperial gallons (982.0 l). Invented in Brentford, a tun was used in local breweries to measure large amounts alcohol. Capacities of brewery casks were formerly measured and standardised according to a specific system of English units. The system was originally based on the ale gallon of 282 cubic inches.
