Allele frequency, or gene frequency, is the relative frequency of an allele (variant of a gene) at a particular locus in a population, expressed as a fraction or percentage. Specifically, it is the fraction of all chromosomes in the population that carry that allele.
Methods: The Hardy-Weinberg model consists of two equations: one that calculates allele frequencies and one that calculates genotype frequencies. Because we are dealing with frequencies, both equations must add up to 1. The equation p + q = 1. describes allele frequencies for a gene with two alleles.
(April 2014). Allele frequency, or gene frequency, is the relative frequency of an allele (variant of a gene) at a particular locus in a population, expressed as a fraction or percentage. Specifically, it is the fraction of all chromosomes in the population that carry that allele. Given the following:
An allele frequency is calculated by dividing the number of times the allele of interest is observed in a population by the total number of copies of all the alleles at that particular genetic locus in the population. Allele frequencies can be represented as a decimal, a percentage, or a fraction.
Allelic Frequency. If you are told that the frequency of a recessive allele in a population is 10%, you are directly given q, since by definition q is the frequency of the recessive allele.
The allele frequency is distinct from the genotype frequency, although they are related, and allele frequencies can be calculated from genotype frequencies. In population genetics, allele frequencies are used to describe the amount of variation at a particular locus or across multiple loci.
allele frequency. The allele frequency represents the incidence of a gene variant in a population. Alleles are variant forms of a gene that are located at the same position, or genetic locus, on a chromosome.
