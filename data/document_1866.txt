The coronary sinus empties into the right atrium. Relative to the role of the heart chambers, the atria are receiving chambers, the ventricles are the discharging chambers. Membrane that lines the heart and forms valve flaps is called the endocardium. The first heart sound is a result of closure of the atrio-ventricular valves; closure of the semi-lunar valves causes the second heart sound. The heart chambers that have just been filled when you hear the first heart sound are the ventricles, and the chmabers that have just emptied are the atria.
· Pulmonary circulation: blood is pumped from the right side of the heart through the lungs to the left side of the heart. · Systemic circulation: blood is pumped from the left side of the heart through the tissues of the body and returned to the right side of the heart. · Pulmonary circulation: blood is pumped from the right side of the heart through the lungs to the left side of the heart. · Systemic circulation:blood is pumped from the left side of the heart through the tissues of the body and returned to the right side of the heart.

The heart is the hollow, muscular organ in the thoracic cavity (chest) that maintains the circulation of blood throughout the body. It is surrounded by a membrane called the pericardium. Blood passes from the left atrium through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle. The left ventricle, the largest and most muscular of the four chambers, is the main pumping chamber of the heart.
Oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs and enters the heart through the left atrium. Blood passes from the left atrium through the mitral valve and into the left ventricle. The left ventricle, the largest and most muscular of the four chambers, is the main pumping chamber of the heart. When the left ventricle contracts, blood is pumped through the aortic valve into the main artery of the body (aorta)
The Human Heart. The heart is a hollow, cone-shaped muscle located between the lungs and behind the sternum (breastbone). Two-thirds of the heart is located to the left of the midline of the body and 1/3 is to the right (see Figure 1). The apex (pointed end) points down and to the left. It is 5 inches (12 cm) long, 3.5 inches (8-9 cm) wide and 2.5 inches (6 cm) from front to back, and is roughly the size of your fist. The average weight of a female human heart is 9 ounces and a male's heart is 10.5 ounces
The heart is a four-chambered, hollow organ. It is divided into the left and right side by a muscular wall called the septum. The right and left sides of the heart are further divided into: 1  two atria-top chambers, which receive blood from the veins and. 2  two ventricles-bottom chambers, which pump blood into the arteries. 
Heart: The heart is a hollow, __cone__-shaped, muscular pump within the _thoracic_____ cavity. The average adult heart is __14_____ cm long and _____9______ cm wide. The heart lies in the ___mediastinum_____ under the sternum; its apex extends to the ___fifth_ intercostal space. At the base of the heart, the inner layer folds back to become the _parietal___ pericardium that lines the. tough outer layer. Between the two pericardia is a potential space called the __pericardial_ cavity and filled with _serous fluid.
The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, and also assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. The heart is located in the middle compartment of the mediastinum in the chest. 
1. The pulmonary circuit is made up of vessels that convey blood from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, alveolar capillaries, and pulmonary veins leading from the lungs to the left atrium. C. Systemic Circuit (p. 367). 1. 1. The branches of the ascending aorta are the right and left coronary arteries that lead to heart muscle. 2. Principal branches of the aortic arch include the brachiocephalic, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries.
papillary muscle. - located in right and left ventricles-project from the walls into the ventricular cavity-cone shaped muscles that project into the walls of a ventricle-they are attached to string-like structures called the chordae tendineae. -The contraction of the papillary muscles closes these valves.
