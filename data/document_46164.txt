During normal usage of the brakes, brake pads wear out and become thinner. If the thickness of brake pads is less than 3mm, it is time to change the pads. Depending on where you drive (city driving tends to wear pads out quicker) brake pads usually last between 30,000-35,000 miles. Some vehicles (eg. BMWâ€™s) are equipped with a low-pad-warning system. In these vehicles, you will also need to replace the brake sensors as part of the brake pad service.

Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: some people might try to charge upwards of $150 for new brake pads.. If you look on the shop website if its a major place, you can find a place that can do it for $99 or sometimes $69. Ideally you want them to put new brake pads and resurface/machine the rotors. Not a hard job, - if you do it yourself, -- it does not require much more than basic mechanical ability! As to cost it is dependent on whether the brake pads are just worn down, - or whether they are shot and you are stopping metal to metal!
