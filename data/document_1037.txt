To sum things up children should be at least 4 years old and weigh at least 40 pounds before they are to be placed in a booster seat. The booster seat needs to be able to utilize both a lab and shoulder belt and the child needs to be in the back seat as long as a back seat is available.
Booster Seats. After age 4 and 40+ pounds, children can ride in a booster seat with the adult lap and shoulder belt until the adult safety belt will fit them properly (usually when the child is 4'9 tall, 10 12 years old). MUST have a lap/shoulder belt to use a booster seat.
A backless booster. A booster seat is used to lift up a child and properly position the vehicle's lap/shoulder belts on children who are too small to fit the adult seat belt. Boosters are rated for use from 30-40 lbs to 80-100 lbs. Booster seats do not have a harness.
Children (ages 4-7) and who weigh at least 40 pounds but less than 80 pounds, and are less than 4'9 tall must be secured in a child passenger restraint system or booster seat appropriate for that child.
3. Booster Seats. Once a child reaches 4 years of age and weighs at least 40 pounds, she can move to a booster seat. A child is required by law to use the booster seat until she is 8 years old or 4’9” tall. Both backless and high back booster seats are available.
Children older than 5 and more than 40 pounds must ride in a booster seat until the child is 8 years old or is taller than 4 feet 9 inches. Anyone over the age of 8 must be protected by a safety belt. Reminders:
