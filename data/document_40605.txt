Which is the the definition recognised by all historians. AD would be since the birth of Christ. So that would be 2008 years ago. (Oh! Happy New Year by the way). So the amount of years between the start of BC (recorded history) 5,500 years ago and now would be 7,508 years. But that tricky bit is still there. BC ended 2008 years ago at year zero at exactly the same time as AD began, also in year zero, 2008 years ago
Year zero does not exist in the Anno Domini (or Common Era) system usually used to number years in the Gregorian calendar and in its predecessor, the Julian calendar. In this system, the year 1 BC is followed by AD 1. However, there is a year zero in astronomical year numbering (where it coincides with the Julian year 1 BC) and in ISO 8601:2004 (where it coincides with the Gregorian year 1 BC) as well as in all Buddhist and Hindu calendars. 
As many as there are useful. The BC indicates the years before the Christian Era. For recorded human history that could go back as far as 8000 to 9000 years BC. Any further could not be very accurate therefore not be very useful. Answer2:
B.C. stands for Before Christ.. Therefore 200 B.C. is two hundred years before Christ. This year, 2013, is two thousand thirteen years after Christ, or 2013 A.D. (which means â€¦ After Christ, but in Latin). The BC indicates the years before the Christian Era. For recorded human history that could go back as far as 8000 to 9000 years BC. Any further could not be very accurate therefore not be very useful. Answer2:
Best Answer: 199. There was no year zero. The year 1 BC was followed immediately by the year 1 AD. If you use the other convention of numbering BC years as negative numbers, year 1 BC = 0, and year 2 BC = -1, and so forth. That means that 100 BC = -99, so the difference between -99 and +100 is 199. Just as stated. Report Abuse. There was no year 0. So you've got 100 years from 100 BC to 1 BC, and another hundred years from 1 AD to 100 AD, or a total of 200 years.
The terms anno Domini (AD or A.D.) and before Christ (BC or B.C.) are used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The term anno Domini is Medieval Latin, which means in the year of the Lord but is often translated as in the year of our Lord. However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD 2015, but 68 BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium, as in fourth century AD or second millennium AD (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).
There were two hundred years. Count: from 100 bc to 1 bc= 100 (count numbers from 1 to 100) from 1 ad to 100 ad =100 (again count 1 to 100) of coursce there was no 0 year. this answer assumes that both years 100 bc and 100 ad are inclusive in your counting. Report Abuse. There was no year 0. So you've got 100 years from 100 BC to 1 BC, and another hundred years from 1 AD to 100 AD, or a total of 200 years.
