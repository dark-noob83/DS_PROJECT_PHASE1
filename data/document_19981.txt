How to Calculate an Approximate Value on a Savings Bond Without the Serial Number. The Treasury Direct website has several tools to help you find out what your savings bond is worth. The U.S. Department of Treasury issues savings bonds with a unique serial number that's used to track the bond's owner and value. As of 2012, there are 14 different types of savings bonds. The most common -- several of which no longer earn interest -- are Series E, EE, H, HH, I and Savings Notes. Although it's helpful to know a bond's serial number, you don't have to have the bond in front of you to find out what it's worth.
