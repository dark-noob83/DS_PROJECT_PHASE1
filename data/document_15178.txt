The kilowatt-hour (symbolized kW⋅h) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power sustained for one hour. One watt is equal to 1 J/s. One kilowatt-hour is 3.6 megajoules, which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour. Note that the international standard SI unit of energy is the joule. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt-hours is the product of the power in kilo watts and the time in hours. The kilowatt-hour is commonly used as a billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by electric utilities.
Electricity is measured in kilowatt ‐ hours (kWh) . One kWh of energy is equal to 1000 watt hours and will power a 100 watt light bulb for 10 hours (100 watts x 10 hours = 1,000 watt‐hours = 1 kWh). 
The kilowatt hour (kWh) is a unit of energy... The Calorie is a unit of energy... And the joule (J) is a unit of energy... And these aren't the only units of energy-there's the BTU, the watt hour (Wh), the therm, and plenty of obscure units that you're unlikely to have heard of. 
A kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour, or 3.6 megajoules. Energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example: a 100-watt (i.e. 0.1 kilowatt) light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800 W⋅h or 0.8 kW⋅h. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt-hours is the product of the power in kilo watts and the time in hours. The kilowatt-hour is commonly used as a billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by electric utilities.
1 kWh = kilo Watt hour. 2  Watt is a unit of power. 3  A kilo is a one thousand multiplier. 4  A kWh is the amount of power consumed/generated over a period of one hour. 5  For example, a 100 Watt light globe left on for 10 hours would consume 1kWh, that is, 100 Watts x 10 hours = 1,000 Watt hours = 1kWh. 1 A kWh is the amount of power consumed/generated over a period of one hour. 2  For example, a 100 Watt light globe left on for 10 hours would consume 1kWh, that is, 100 Watts x 10 hours = 1,000 Watt hours = 1kWh. 3  1kWh = 3.6 Mega Joules. 4  1kW = 1.34 Horsepower.
The symbol kWh stands for kilowatt-hour, which is a unit of energy amounting to one kWh. KWh is not used in any formal system as standard unit. However, the unit is used to determine the consumption of electricity. It is commonly used in household electrical applications.
The kilowatt hour (symbol kWh, kW·h, or kW h) is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules. If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in kilowatt-hours is the product of the power in kilo watts and the time in hours. The kilowatt-hour is commonly used as a billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by electric utilities.
1 A kilo is a one thousand multiplier. 2  A kWh is the amount of power consumed/generated over a period of one hour. 3  For example, a 100 Watt light globe left on for 10 hours would consume 1kWh, that is, 100 Watts x 10 hours = 1,000 Watt hours = 1kWh. 1 A kWh is the amount of power consumed/generated over a period of one hour. 2  For example, a 100 Watt light globe left on for 10 hours would consume 1kWh, that is, 100 Watts x 10 hours = 1,000 Watt hours = 1kWh. 3  1kWh = 3.6 Mega Joules. 4  1kW = 1.34 Horsepower.
Part of the IT standards and organizations glossary: The kilowatt-hour (symbolized kWh) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power expended for one hour (1 h) of time. The kilowatt-hour is not a standard unit in any formal system, but it is commonly used in electrical applications. An energy expenditure of 1 kWh represents 3,600,000 joule s (3.600 x 10 6 J). To obtain joules when kilowatt-hours are known, multiply by 3.600 x 10 6.
