Storage plans. You can upgrade your storage plan for a monthly fee. Your upgraded plan will be your new total storage limit. For example, if you upgrade to 1TB, your storage limit is 1TB (not 1TB + 15GB of free storage). There are no annual plans available at this time. 
1 For example, if you store 1,000 GB of Nearline data on day 1 and then remove it on day 15, you are charged $5 ($0.01 * 1,000 GB * 15/30) for storage from day 1 to 15, and then $5 ($0.01 * 1,000 GB * 15/30) for 15 days of early deletion from day 16 to 30. Google Cloud Storage pricing is based on a flat rate for storage and a usage rate for network. Project storage usage and bandwidth usage are calculated in gigabytes (GB), where 1GB is 2 bytes. This unit of measurement is also known as a gibibyte (GiB) .
According to IDC, the amount of data created and replicated globally in 2008 was ~486 exabytes (~522 billion GB). At 20 grams per GB per month, that is a monthly storage footprint of ~5 million metric tons of carbon, or ~62 million tons/year. ICT is said to account for ~600 million metric tons, which would put storage at ~10%. These are all rough estimates, but give us an order-of-magnitude perspective. 1  Login to post comments. The figure of $25/GB/mth was derived from a combination of customer engagements, analyst interviews and [published] reports.... ...we talk about fully burdened cost, which is not only storage and backup but also floor space in the datacenter, staff to support, server infrastructure, electrical power and cooling.
A consumer can get a 4TB capacity drive for less than £100. That’s an incredible £0.025 per GB. But while raw drive prices are measured in pennies per gigabyte, the actual cost of storage for the enterprise is much higher, and more difficult to calculate. There are many factors that need to be considered, including media type, platform hardware and software costs.
Also, for high availability operations a complete online duplicate infrastructure is required to support a 99.999% availability.. The full cost of data storage averages $25/GB/month and is consuming 40% of IT operating budgets.

With discount computer stores selling disk drives for a dollar per gigabyte, how can enterprise storage systems cost many times that amount? Fry's electronics, for example, recently advertised the Buffalo TeraStation at $1699 for 2 TB of NAS. That's $1.17 per GB. For its premium tier, the VA intends to keep the costs under $125 per GB per month for 50 TB of storage that offers 500 IOPS on SPC-1 and 25 MBPS on SPC-2. We will use the workload characteristics to determine which tier, says Yaple. As well as average MBPS, we are also using peak MBPS as a valuable metric..
Because Google Cloud Storage Nearline is intended for infrequently accessed data, you will incur the following costs for data access and early deletion: 1  Data retrieval incurs a cost of $0.01 per GB. 2  Data deleted in less than 30 days incurs a minimum 30 day charge. Google Cloud Storage pricing is based on a flat rate for storage and a usage rate for network. Project storage usage and bandwidth usage are calculated in gigabytes (GB), where 1GB is 2 bytes.

iCloud storage pricing. When you sign up for iCloud, you automatically get 5 GB of free storage. If you need more storage, you can upgrade to a larger storage plan. You can upgrade your iCloud storage from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or PC, and you can choose a total of 50 GB, 200 GB, or 1 TB. After you upgrade, we'll bill you monthly. 1 See the monthly pricing per country below. 
In the mid-tier, the VA is targeting a cost of $20 per GB for 50 TB of storage that meets 250 IOPS on SPC-1 and 25 MBPS on SPC-2. For its premium tier, the VA intends to keep the costs under $125 per GB per month for 50 TB of storage that offers 500 IOPS on SPC-1 and 25 MBPS on SPC-2. We will use the workload characteristics to determine which tier, says Yaple. As well as average MBPS, we are also using peak MBPS as a valuable metric..
There is a saying in the storage industry that capacity is free and performance costs. This is true to an extent because, for example, in raw capacity terms, the price (per TB) of a 15,000rpm high-performance drive can be 20x to 30x more than a SATA 7,200rpm device. That’s an incredible £0.025 per GB. But while raw drive prices are measured in pennies per gigabyte, the actual cost of storage for the enterprise is much higher, and more difficult to calculate. There are many factors that need to be considered, including media type, platform hardware and software costs.
