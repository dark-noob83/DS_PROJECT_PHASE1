Incubation period for SERAMA eggs is 19 days at 99.9 degrees F. Traditional SERAMA are not color bred, nor do they breed true to any one color, It is not uncommon to hatch as many different colored chicks as there are eggs that hatch. SERAMA do not breed true to size.
So, how long does it take for fertilized chicken eggs to hatch? The answer to that is 21 days exactly, although you need to bear in mind that this can vary, depending on a number of circumstances.
Hatching can take place between day 18-21. Once chicks have hatched move to the brooder. The serama is a relatiely good little layer considering its body shape and small size, my females at home lay usually every day or every other day when in full lay. As the body size of the serama varies vastly from A to C class weights as does the egg size.
This is my second batch of serama eggs and we are now going into day 20. I thought they were suppose to hatch between 18 and 19 days, the first hatch didnt hatch until day 21 or 22. Anyone else notice this or am i just super impatient. I have a cochin on mixed eggs as well and hers are hatching early, tomorrow is day 21 for those.
Whereas fertilized chicken eggs usually take exactly 21 days to hatch, most duck eggs take 28 days, apart from Muscovy ducks. As a general rule of thumb, the eggs of Muscovy ducks take 35 days, but once again, it can vary slightly depending on conditions.
The Malaysian Serama, a.k.a. Ayam Serama temperature and humidity level for hatching is just like any other Bantam breeds. Temp should be around 99.5F - 100.0F for Forced Air incubators and 101.5F - 102.5F for Non-Forced Air Incubators.
