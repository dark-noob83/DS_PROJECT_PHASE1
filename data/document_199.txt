Best Answer: I would say that it is still active. It last erupted 25 ears ago. Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March 24, 1984, to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late nineteenth century.

« « Previous |. Mauna Loa may be the “largest” volcano in all of Hawaii (And the world, for that matter), but Mauna Kea is the tallest. At 13,796 feet, it’s a mere 196 feet higher than Mauna Loa. Mauna Kea is classified as dormant, while Mauna Loa is still active. It’s outside of the Volcanoes National Park. Mauna Kea is not only popular for its height – it’s primarily known because of its accessibility.
Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March 24 to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century. It is an active shield volcano with relatively gentle slopes, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (75,000 km 3), although its peak is about 120 feet (37 m) lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea. Lava eruptions from Mauna Loa are silica-poor and very fluid, and they tend to be non-explosive
Mauna Loa is a large shield volcano on the big island of Hawaii  in the US state of Hawaii. Mauna Loa occupies more than half the  island and erupts almost continuously, a … dding to the land area of  the island with its lava flows.   Hawai'i is the latest island of the Hawaiian islands to form. Mauna Loa has been classed as an active volcanoe since its first recorded erruption in 1843. Between then and the 1984 erruption it has had a total of 33 eruptions. Because it … is not currently erupting does not change its classification to inactive as long as there remains emmissions and earthquake activity.

At 1 million to 700,000 years of age, Mauna Loa is the second youngest of the five volcanoes on the island, making it the third youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia. It is an active shield volcano with relatively gentle slopes, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (75,000 km 3), although its peak is about 120 feet (37 m) lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea.

Measured from its base on the ocean floor, Mauna Loa stands 30,077 feet (9167 meters) tall, roughly 3400 feet (1036 meters) shorter than Mauna Kea. It is second only to Kilauea as the most active volcano on the Big Island, erupting at least 35 times since 1843, most recently in 1984. Mauna Loa is the most massive of the Hawaii Island volcanoes, with 10,000 cubic miles of rock. In fact it is the most massive mountain in the world! With a width of 75 miles (120 kilometers), Mauna Loa Volcano makes up approximately half of Hawaii Island.
