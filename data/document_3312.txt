1 Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. 2  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 3  Remove roast to a platter. 4  Heat the wine in the pan and stir to loosen browned bits of food on the bottom. 5  Serve with pan juices. 1 Place pork loin into oven, turning and basting with pan liquids. 2  Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. 3  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 4  Remove roast to a platter
1 Preheat oven to 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. 2  Place the roast in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature down to 200 degrees F. 3  Roast for about 4 hours or until the meat is falling-apart tender (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast). 1 Place the roast in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature down to 200 degrees F. 2  Roast for about 4 hours or until the meat is falling-apart tender (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast). 3  Stir the salt and black pepper into the juice (do not omit the salt!).
1 Cover tightly. 2  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. 3  Place the roast in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature down to 200 degrees F. 4  Roast for about 4 hours or until the meat is falling-apart tender (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast). 1 Place the roast in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature down to 200 degrees F. 2  Roast for about 4 hours or until the meat is falling-apart tender (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast). 3  Stir the salt and black pepper into the juice (do not omit the salt!).
Swirl to coat the bottom. Roast the pork for 10 minutes: Set the pork in the pan. (It's fine if your pork tenderloin is a little long for the pan; just bend it to fit as we did here.) Return the pan to the oven. Roast for 10 minutes. Flip the pork, reduce the heat, and roast another 10 to 15 minutes: Flip the pork to the other side. Reduce the oven temperature to 400°F and continue roasting another 10 to 15 minutes. The pork is done when its internal temperature registers 140°F to 145°F in the thickest part of the meat (20 to 25 minutes total). 
In general, cooking the pork tenderloin over high heat for about 20 to 27 minutes per pound brings it to the required 145 F while preserving its inner juiciness. Whether pan-cooking the tenderloin on a stovetop, broiling it in an oven or cooking it on an indoor electric grill, the technique remains the same. The meat may still have a pink tint in the middle when it's sliced. In the past, cooks recommended cooking pork until it became white and opaque throughout. This can dry out a lean cut like pork tenderloin. Store fresh pork tenderloin for 3 to 5 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for 4 to 6 months.
Cook Pork Tenderloin to 145 F. According to the USDA, pork tenderloin must be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. After cooking, remove the meat from the heat and rest it for at least 3 minutes, which raises its temperature a bit more. The meat may still have a pink tint in the middle when it's sliced. In the past, cooks recommended cooking pork until it became white and opaque throughout. This can dry out a lean cut like pork tenderloin. Store fresh pork tenderloin for 3 to 5 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for 4 to 6 months.
1 Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices. 2  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist. 3  After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees. 
Continue cooking about 50-80 minutes or until the meat registers 145 degrees on a meat thermometer. Some roasts are long and thin and others are short and fat, consequently the cooking times will vary depending on the shape of your roast. The meat thermometer is the best way to judge the right amount of cooking time. 
Place the pork on a high shelf in the oven and roast it for 25 minutes. Turn the heat down to 190C/375F/Gas 5, and calculate the total cooking time allowing 35 minutes to the pound, then deduct the initial 25 minutes cooking time. In this case it would be a further 2½ hours.
