Worldwide there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks in 2013, down from 81 the year before and the lowest recorded since 67 attacks in 2009. The United States had 47 attacks, with 13 in Hawaii, six in South Carolina and one each in Alabama, California, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Florida was the world leader in unprovoked shark attacks last year with 23, easily most in the United States and more than twice the number as any other country, according to a report released Monday.
Of these attacks, the majority occurred in the United States (53 in 2000, 40 in 2005, and 39 in 2006). The New York Times reported in July 2008 that there had been only one fatal attack in the previous year. On average, there are 16 shark attacks per year in the United States with one fatality every two years. Despite these reports, however, the actual number of fatal shark attacks worldwide remains uncertain. Every year around 75 attacks are reported worldwide. Despite their relative rarity, many people fear shark attacks after occasional serial attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and horror fiction and films such as the Jaws series.
Shark attacks are extremely rare. An individual is three times more likely to be hit by lightning than to be bitten by a shark. There were an average of 32 shark attacks per year in U.S. waters between 1990 and 2004. Of the 490 attacks during this 15-year span, 11 were fatal. Most people die in the deep waters, some on the shores.
According to the Australian Shark Attack File, kept by researchers at Sydney's Taronga Conservation Society, there have been 1003 shark attacks in Australia since records began in 1791, and 232 of them have been fatal. 
Australian waters had the second-most shark attacks in 2012 at 14, led by the densely populated state of New South Wales and the white shark haven of Western Australia, with five attacks apiece. The number of fatalities is typically low in Australia, with just two last year and a yearly average of 1.4. Yet, the risk of a shark attack remains extremely low (about 1 in 11.5 million). There have been just 152 reported fatalities since records began in 1580. By comparison, there have been twice as many deaths from alligators in the U.S. than by sharks.
In the last 50 years there have been 45 unprovoked fatalities (average of 0.9 per year) from shark encounters in Australian waters. Some years there have been no fatalities recorded and in other years there have been up to 5, but the average remains around one per year. 
Last year there were a total of 47 shark attacks in the U.S., with two of them ending in a fatality. The states with the highest number of shark attacks that occurred last year, according to the International Shark Attack File, are as follows: Florida with 23 attacks, Hawaii with 13 and South Carolina with six. California, North Carolina, Texas, Oregon and Alabama each reported one shark attack
The 2012 figure was up slightly from 2011 when there were 78 unprovoked attacks, but on par with the 2010 total of 82. ISAF said the number of unprovoked shark attacks has grown steadily since 1900, despite an overall decline in shark populations as a result of overfishing and habitat loss. Yet, the risk of a shark attack remains extremely low (about 1 in 11.5 million). There have been just 152 reported fatalities since records began in 1580. By comparison, there have been twice as many deaths from alligators in the U.S. than by sharks.
The coast of South Africa is another shark haven where attacks are more frequent. There were four unprovoked attacks last year, which was on par with the nation’s 10-year average. The number of fatalities, however, was three, compared to an average of just one. Yet, the risk of a shark attack remains extremely low (about 1 in 11.5 million). There have been just 152 reported fatalities since records began in 1580. By comparison, there have been twice as many deaths from alligators in the U.S. than by sharks.
Seven fatal shark attacks have occurred in South Australian waters since the year 2000. All attacks prior to 2014 have been attributed to Great white sharks. 1  On 8 February 2014, 28-year-old Sam Kellett was killed while spear-fishing 100m off Locksmith Beach near Edithburgh on Yorke Peninsula. There have been 82 recorded Shark attacks in South Australia since the establishment of the colony in 1836. 20 of those have involved a single fatality. Victims were involved in a range of aquatic activities, including surfing, diving, spear-fishing, snorkeling, boating and swimming.
