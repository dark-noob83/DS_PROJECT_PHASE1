How to Do Judo. Judo is a relatively modern martial art, created by Professor Jigoro Kano in 1882. Its roots lie in Jiu Jitsu, which was the original art used by the Samurai. Kano wanted to create a form of ju-jitsu that he could practice without fear of serious injury, and so Judo was born.
If you are taking the class principally to learn Judo, there are no other mandatory costs. If you are a competitor, you will need to pay United States Judo Federation (USJF) membership costs. This is $50 yearly. The USJF membership is good for one year from the payment date.

But make sure that the coach is a Black (or Red) Belt (the highest rank, depending on your country), especially above 1st degree.
