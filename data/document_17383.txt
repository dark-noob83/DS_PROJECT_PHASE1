The brown rat can breed throughout the year if conditions are suitable, a female producing up to five litters a year. When food is in short supply, the rats lower in social order are the first to die. If a large fraction of a rat population is exterminated, the remaining rats will increase their reproductive rate, and quickly restore the old population level.
The Gestation period of mice is 5 weeks. Therefore they can breed every 6 weeks or so. On average they have about 12 babies. It is vitally important to separate males and females as soon as they are eating on their own i.e. about 4 weeks after birth, or they will breed with each other.
If you have decided to breed your rats, you must also consider their age. The best time to breed a female for the first time is at 4-5 months of age. It can be dangerous to breed a female older than 6-8 months of age for the first time, since her pelvic canal will be fused in a narrow position. Rats can reach sexual maturity at 5 weeks of age, so the sexes should be separated prior to this age. Rats do not recognize incest, so brothers and sisters and even mothers and sons must be separated. Rats do not have a breeding season, although very hot or cold temperatures will reduce breeding.
1 Feeder rats are bred for just that food for other animals, so they are not meant to be healthy or live a long time. 2  Rats are pregnant for 28 days but can have them as early as 21 days on occasion they may give birth a few days before or after the 28 day mark. 3  Rats and Gerbils are pregnant for 28 days. 1 Rats are pregnant for 28 days but can have them as early as 21 days on occasion they may give birth a few days before or after the 28 day mark. 2  Rats and Gerbils are pregnant for 28 days. 3  Mice and Dwarf hamsters are pregnant for 21 days.
females come into heat every 5 - 6 days, unless they're pregnant, and even then they may come into heat a few times early into pregnancy. the gestation period is normally 22 days. birth process takes about an hour or two. the average litter is 6 - 13 pups. pups start to grow hair at 7 days old, and their eyes fully open at 14 days old. with all that, you can probably guess that they multipy REALLY fast. When food is in short supply, the rats lower in social order are the first to die. If a large fraction of a rat population is exterminated, the remaining rats will increase their reproductive rate, and quickly restore the old population level.
Begin to breed mice at a relatively early age. 1  Females can breed from approximately 6 weeks old. 2  Males can breed from approximately 8 weeks old. 3  If time is not an issue, however, it is best to wait until the females are 12 weeks old, as this generally produces stronger litters. Place 1 male mouse in a cage with several female mice. 1  Generally 2 to 4 females to 1 male works well. 2  Do not place multiple male mice in a cage with the females. 3  The males will fight, often killing each other. 4  The males can also harm the females in the process or the produced offspring.
Rats are very easy to breed. In fact, many people end up with unplanned baby rats! Rats can reach sexual maturity at 5 weeks of age, so the sexes should be separated prior to this age.
