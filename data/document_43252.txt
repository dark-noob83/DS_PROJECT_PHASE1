The fat soluble vitamins are soluble in lipids (fats). These vitamins are usually absorbed in fat globules (called chylomicrons) that travel through the lymphatic system of the small intestines and into the general blood circulation within the body.
Vitamin C. Vitamin C is also a water-soluble vitamin that is absorbed directly into your bloodstream in your small intestines after it has been freed from food. Vitamin C is essential for good health and plays a number of important roles in your body.
Vitamins require no digestion and are absorbed directly into the blood stream. The thirteen vitamins identified are divided into two groups, fat-soluble and water-soluble. The fat-soluble vitamins, which include A, D, E, and K are stored in the liver and in body fat.
For the most part, the B vitamins are absorbed directly into the bloodstream in your stomach or small intestines. The exception is vitamin B-12, which must be bound to something called intrinsic factor for absorption.
They are absorbed directly into the bloodstream as food is broken down during digestion or as a supplement dissolves. Because much of your body consists of water, many of the water-soluble vitamins circulate easily in your body.
1 The water-soluble vitamins (B vitamins and vitamin C) are absorbed easily along with the water in the small intestine, where they then travel through the body via the blood vessels. 2  Fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, and K) are absorbed just like the fat mentioned above.
fat-soluble vitamins. absorbed into the lymph, travel in the blood in association with protein carriers. Can be stored in the liver or with other lipids in fatty tissues, so can become toxic. Require bile for absorption.
