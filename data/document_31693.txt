The poll found that consumers who earn $90,000 or more a year spent an average of $145 a day in May, which is the most so far this calendar year and a 33% increase from April where they averaged $109 a day. On the other hand, there are notorious examples of wealthy people spending grotesque amounts of money on a regular basis. Back in 2008, one woman confessed while getting divorced from her rich CEO husband that she spends an average of $53,000 a week (or about $7,500 a day, give or take a bottle of expensive wine).
Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards. In Sweden, the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD 29 185 a year, more than the OECD average of USD 25 908 a year. But there is a considerable gap between the richest and poorest – the top 20% of the population earn more than four times as much as the bottom 20%. 
Just don’t go out as much. On my cheapest day, I spent $50 USD and that was simply on accommodation and food. While there are ways to save money (see below), the reality is that Sweden is expensive, and there’s very little you can do about it if you aren’t staying in places for free or cooking 100% of your meals.
Daily consumer spending has increased among Americans who make $90,000 or more a year, to $190 per day in July from $157 per day in June and $189 in May. But daily spending for the majority of Americans fell slightly to $75 per day from $79 in June, $78 in May and $78 in July 2013. That's a lot of walking-around money, and it's higher than the $89 per day spent in July 2013, but lower than the six-year high of $98 per day recorded in May.
The U.S. spent $8,233 on health per person in 2010. Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland are the next highest spenders, but in the same year, they all spent at least $3,000 less per person. The average spending on health care among the other 33 developed OECD countries was $3,268 per person. The U.S. is a very rich country, but even so, it devotes far more of its economy — 17.6 percent of GDP in 2010 — to health than any other country
I was in Sweden for 19 days, and I spent a total of 11,357 SEK or $1,892.83 USD or (roughly) $100 USD per day (the ex-change rate is about 6 SEK to 1 USD). The numbers break down this way: Accommodation: 2,320 SEK. Food: 2,289 SEK. On my cheapest day, I spent $50 USD and that was simply on accommodation and food. While there are ways to save money (see below), the reality is that Sweden is expensive, and there’s very little you can do about it if you aren’t staying in places for free or cooking 100% of your meals.
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans report spending $151 on food per week on average. One in 10 Americans say they spend $300 or more per week and, at the other extreme, 8% spend less than $50. Gallup has asked a version of this question as far back as 1943, but has not asked it since 1987. In 1943, an average of $15 per week was spent on food. The final 1987 estimate was $106. Young adults' average weekly food spending is $173, more than what older Americans say they spend. Those with incomes of $75,000 or more per year are averaging $180 per week, compared with $144 for those with incomes of $30,000 to $74,999, and $127 for the lowest income group.
The countries that come closest to spending as much — Canada, the Netherlands, Japan — spend between $4,000 and $6,000 less per stay. Across OECD countries, the average cost of a hospital stay is about one-third that of the U.S., at $6,200. Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland are the next highest spenders, but in the same year, they all spent at least $3,000 less per person. The average spending on health care among the other 33 developed OECD countries was $3,268
Americans spent an average of almost $94 a day last month in stores, restaurants, gas stations and online. That's a lot of walking-around money, and it's higher than the $89 per day spent in July 2013, but lower than the six-year high of $98 per day recorded in May.
