Measure the height of the cushion if you are covering a box cushion. Multiply the width of the cushion by two and the depth of the cushion by two, and add those numbers together to figure out how much fabric you will need to make the sides, front and back of the box cushion. Add 2 inches for seam allowances.
1. Measure the cushion from the seam at the back of the seat to the seam at the front. Double that number and add 1 inch to get the length of fabric you will need to cover the top and bottom of the cushion. Adding 1 inch gives you a 1/2-inch seam allowance on each end
You will need two pieces of fabric slightly larger than the cushion inner you are using, plus a long narrow piece for the piping. For a cushion cover to fit a 45cm inner, you will need: 1  two pieces of fabric 47cm long x 47cm wide, and.
You will need one piece of fabric slightly larger than the cushion inner you are using, two smaller pieces to form the button flap front, plus a long narrow piece for the piping. For a cushion cover to fit a 45cm inner, you will need: Note: This will not produce a cushion with a pattern match to the buttoned side.
Estimate the amount of fabric necessary for each cushion. Cushions between 14 and 18 inches long require half a yard of fabric. Cushions 19 to 24 inches require one yard of fabric. One half a yard of fabric can cover a chair cushion.
Add a 1.5cm seam allowance to each of the four sides. So, for a 50cm x 50cm inner, youâ€™ll cut a piece of fabric 53cm x 53cm. 3. For the envelope back, you need two pieces of fabric. Make a pattern for these that measures the same width as for the front but about two-thirds the length, e.g. 53cm x 35cm.
One metre of standard width (137cm) furnishing fabric is enough for three plain cushions with either zip or standard button fastening to fit up to 45cm x 45cm size. Other styles of cushion will need more fabric. Cushions are great for using up offcuts and remnants.
