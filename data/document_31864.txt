To thaw lamb in cold water, do not remove the packaging. Be sure the package is airtight or put it into a leakproof bag. Submerge the lamb in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes so that it continues to thaw. Small packages of lamb may defrost in an hour or less; a 3- to 4-pound roast may take 2 to 3 hours. When thawing lamb in cold water or in the microwave, plan to cook it immediately after thawing.
There are three safe ways to thaw lamb: in the refrigerator, in cold water, and in the microwave. It's best to plan ahead for slow, safe thawing in the refrigerator. Ground lamb, stew meat, and steaks may defrost within a day. Bone-in parts and whole roasts may take 2 days or longer. Once the raw product thaws, it will be safe in the refrigerator before cooking 3 to 5 days (for roasts, steaks, and chops) and 1 to 2 days for ground lamb.
1 Plan ahead for defrosting meat in the refrigerator since it will take time. 2  Place wrapped or covered meat on a dish to catch any raw juice runoff. 3  Defrost the meat for a full 24 hours. 4  Large cuts of meat, such as whole birds or roasts, can take 24 hours for every 5 lbs.
It takes a bit of planning but frozen meat is best thawed in the fridge. 1  Time for a large roast is about 4 to 7 hours per 500g. 2  A smaller roast like a rack of lamb will take about 3 to 5 hours per 500g. 3  Steaks (about 3cm thick) will take about 12 hours or overnight.
The best method for thawing lamb (or any other type of meat) is to place it in the refrigerator where it will defrost slowly and safely. A temperature range of 33ºF and 40ºF is ideal. A large cut of lamb may require 24 to 48 hours to defrost in the refrigerator.
The general rule for lamb is, for every kilogram of weight, cook for an hour at 190 - 200 degrees Celsius, depending on the efficiency of your oven, or 180 degrees for a fan-f … orced oven. Thus, a 2kg leg of lamb will take two hours.
