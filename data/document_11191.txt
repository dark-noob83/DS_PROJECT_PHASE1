Unanticipated Costs of Nurse Practitioner Programs. Tuition is not the only cost you must consider when planning for your NP education. Living expenses must also come into play. Nurse practitioner programs take 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years to complete on a full-time basis or 3 to 4 years to complete part-time.
Nurse Practitioner School Costs. Let’s break those degree program requirements into dollars and cents. A nurse practitioner master’s degree consists of about two years of full-time study, which translates into 40 to 60 credits. Post-graduate certificate programs consist of about 40 credits and charge tuition comparable to MSN degree costs. Nurse practitioner tuition at a state university averages about $200 per credit for state residents and jumps to $500 per credit for out-of-state students. Total nurse practitioner tuition for a 60-credit program would then be $12,000 for in-state students and $30,000 for out-of-state students. If your heart is set on a private university, be aware that these schools charge as much as $1,000 per credit – amounting to $60,000 for total nurse practitioner tuition.
NP Programs are pricey. Most nurse practitioner programs require students to complete 30-54 credits (an average of about 45) depending on program and specialty. In-State tuition can cost anywhere from $225 to $665 per credit with an average of around $400 a credit for schools we surveyed.
Paying out-of-state tuition a nurse practitioner student can expect to spend about $31,500 on their education. Online programs run somewhere in between costing $400-$800 per credit ultimately averaging about $22,500 for a nurse practitioner degree. Private universities cost anywhere from $500 to $1,500 per credit.
