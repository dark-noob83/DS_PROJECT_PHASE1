Magma in these types of volcanoes is thick and has large quantities of silica in its composition. Magma that contains silicates have a tendency to be viscous. The viscous magma thereby plugs the volcano vent.
Magma is the term for liquid or melted rock and is usually quite hot. After all, the term igneous comes from the Latin word for of fire. Most people have seen pictures or video of magma that flows out of a volcano. When magma flows onto the surface of the Earth it is called lava. When the lava cools and forms a rock, that rock is an igneous rock. But there are also rocks that form from magma that does not reach the surface of the Earth. These rocks form in what are often called plutons and are also types of igneous rocks.
Volcanoes are created by ruptures in the Earthâ€™s crust. Fuelled by pockets of molten rock deep underneath the surface called magma, volcanoes allow lava and ash to escape from deep underground in powerful explosions. Magma that manages to break the surface is known as lava. Volcanoes are generally found where there is tectonic activity.
1 They are covered in encrusting life and soft corals and often surrounded by big pollack and schooling fish. 2  Steep sloping walls and cascading waterfalls of coral encrusted the features like a blanket of molten lava. 3  There is a good covering of marine life, and many rocks are encrusted by a hard pink growth.
