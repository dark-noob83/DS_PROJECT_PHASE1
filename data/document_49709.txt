Basic Height and Weight. The Navy uses a complicated method of determining height and weight requirements for its pilots called anthropometrics. Prior to using this system, pilot candidates must meet some basic requirements. A Navy pilot candidate must be at least 5 feet 2 inches tall and no taller than 6 feet 5 inches. A candidate must also not weigh more than 245 pounds or less than 103 pounds to qualify.
The height requirements for an aviator are not gender specific. Student pilots measuring a standing height of 62.0 inches to 77.0 inches are eligible for further anthropometric measurements.
Size requirements for United States Navy pilots and aviators are based on a series of body measurements called anthropometric measurements. These measurements are utilized to determine the proper fit of a pilot based on specific types of aircraft. The aircraft are measured using a compatible scale.
