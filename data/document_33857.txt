The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000. That translates to $37.2 million for each of the state’s five executions since the state reenacted the death penalty. The study estimates that the average cost to Maryland taxpayers for reaching a single death sentence is $3 million - $1.9 million more than the cost of a non-death penalty case.

Report Abuse. Depends on if you're buying from a pharmacy or a dealer. 20mg XR doses cost anywhere in the area of 3-8 bucks if you're buying from a dealer. If you're buying from a pharmacy, your prescription might be costing you a couple hundred bucks per fill up. It's an expensive drug, so if you're prescribed it, I'd suggest getting your Rx for IR (Instant Release) Adderall. You can get it generic for a lot cheaper (like a little over $100 for 90 doses of 10mg). IR starts working faster, but is shorter acting than XR. It's also a lot easier to crush up to snort/put in a drink. Be careful, though

With 11 executions spread over 27 years, on a per execution basis, California and federal taxpayers have paid more than $250 million for each execution. It costs approximately $90,000 more a year to house an inmate on death row, than in the general prison population or $57.5 million annually. The Attorney General devotes about 15% of his budget, or $11 million annually to death penalty cases. The cost of a system in which the number of death-eligible crimes was significantly narrowed would be $130 million per year. The cost of a system which imposes a maximum penalty of lifetime incarceration instead of the death penalty would be $11.5 million per year. Read the report.
