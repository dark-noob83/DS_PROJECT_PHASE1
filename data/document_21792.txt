Please try again later. Thank you @Dinnerbone for the hints! When zombies 'infect' villagers and turn the testificates into villager-zombies, you can turn the back by splashing them with a weakness potion and then right-clicking on them with a golden apple (the regular golden apple, not the shiny purple variety).

Curing. Zombie Villagers can be 'cured' by splashing them with a potion of weakness and then feeding them a Golden Apple. This will convert them into Villagers after 5 minutes, and will wear the robes they were wearing when they were Zombie Villagers.
Zombie Villagers act excactly like normal zombies, but can be cured by throwing a splash potion of weakness on them and feeding them a golden apple. They will shake while being cured, and it takes around 5 minutes. If zombies happen to be nearby, they will attempt to re-infect the zombie villager.
Zombie villagers [edit | edit source]. Villagers will spawn if a player uses a splash potion of weakness on a zombie villager and then feeds it a regular golden apple. It will then shake and turn into a villager within 5 minutes. During the change the zombie villager turning villager can still burn in the sun.
Zombies will kill villagers, or convert them to zombie villagers. The chance that the villager will become a zombie villager on death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard. Baby villagers can be infected by zombies as well.
To cure a zombie villager, you will need to trap it so that it can't escape and won't burn during the day, then hit it with a splash potion of weakness and then feed it a golden apple. After a few minutes the zombie should change into a villager.
