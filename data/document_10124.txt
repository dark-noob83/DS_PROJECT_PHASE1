How air temperature affects plants. Temperature is a key factor in plant growth and development. Along with the levels of light, carbon dioxide, air humidity, water and nutrients, temperature influences plant growth and ultimately crop yields. All these factors should be in balance.
Also: The effect of soil temperature in seed germination. Temperature, light, air, water, soil, pH and nutrients are among the factors that may be studied for each specific plant. Introduction: For farmers and growers it is important to know the best conditions for the growth of their products.
Temperature-A measure of the intensity of heat. Plant growth occurs in a fairly narrow range - 60 - 100 degrees F 1. Temperature directly affects photosynthesis respiration transpiration-loss of water absorption of water and nutrients 2. The rate of these processes increases with an increase in temperature.
Temperature affects the productivity and growth of a plant depending upon whether the plant variety is a warm-season or cool-season crop. If temperatures are high and day length is long, cool-season crops such as broccoli and spinach will bolt rather than produce the desired flower.
The ideal temperature range for plant growth without CO2 supplementation is 70-75 degrees. Temperature is probably the factor that causes the most problems in an indoor garden. When the temperature in a garden climbs higher than 85 degrees, plant growth damage can happen quickly.
Temperature affects the growth and productivity of plants, depending on whether the plant is a warm season or cool season crop. 1  Photosynthesis â€“ Within limits, rates of photosynthesis and respiration both rise with increasing temperatures.
Temperature is one of the main factors affecting plant growth. From the seed germination to flowering, many stages of each plant's life are temperature dependent. Plants vary considerably, however, in their response to temperature.
