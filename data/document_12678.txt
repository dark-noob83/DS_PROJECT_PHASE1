Mammary gland. The mammary gland is a gland located in the breasts of females that is responsible for lactation, or the production of milk. Both males and females have glandular tissue within the breasts; however, in females the glandular tissue begins to develop after puberty in response to estrogen release.
Mammary glands are embedded in adipose tissue (mammary fat pad) and consist of acini and ducts, which give mammary glands tree-like structures (best observed in a whole-mount preparation). In virgin mice, the mammary gland consists of lactiferous ducts and a few acini, the lobules type 1.
Mammary duct. In mammals, a mammary duct is present in order to produce milk. The mammary duct is an organ known as an exocrine gland, which is a type of gland that secretes a substance. The mammary duct is an enlarged sweat gland. The mammary gland, or mammary duct, is composed of alveoli.
Mammary gland: One of the two half-moon-shaped glands on either side of the adult female chest, which with fatty tissue and the nipple make up the breast. Within each mammary gland is a network of sacs that produce milk during lactation and send it to the nipple via a system of ducts.
Description. These mammary glands are actually a type of sweat or secretion gland where the female produces the milk. They are located inside a femaleâ€™s breast, with ten to fifteen ducts extending from the milk-producing ducts to the nipple.
