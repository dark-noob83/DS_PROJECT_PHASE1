Fevers are usually characterized by cold bouts as well as increased muscle tone, heart rate and shivering. Low grade fever is a mild increase in the normal body temperature for an individual, usually ranging from 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit to 102.2 degrees. 
1 Temperatures measured under the armpit are not considered as accurate and can be as much as 1 degree F lower than an oral measurement. 2  A temperature below 100.4 F (38 C) is considered a low-grade or mild fever. 3  It means that the body is responding to an infection. 
By Mayo Clinic Staff. You have a fever when your temperature rises above its normal range. What's normal for you may be a little higher or lower than the average normal temperature of 98.6 F (37 C). Depending on what's causing your fever, additional fever signs and symptoms may include:

Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises. About 38 °C (100.4 F) degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39 °C (103 F) degrees is a high-grade fever. 
Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response, is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point. There is not a single agreed upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.5 and 38.3 °C (99.5 and 100.9 °F). 1 Remittent fever: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 7002274149999999999♠1 °C in 24 hours, e.g. , infective endocarditis. 2  Pel-Ebstein fever: A specific kind of fever associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, being high for one week and low for the next week and so on.
A fever is an increase in the body temperature above normal. A low-grade fever is a mild elevation of the temperature above normal. Your temperature measurements fluctuate through the day and vary depending upon the site of measurement. Generally, a child is considered to have a fever if the temperature is at or above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit rectally, 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit orally, or 99 degrees Fahrenheit in the armpit. In an adult, a fever is generally defined as 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) or greater.
