Split and merge into it. Answer by RUClimate. Confidence votes 34.1K. The permanently frozen ground in the northern latitudes is called permafrost. The layer closest to the surface that thaws during the summer is also part of the permafrost, but is called the active layer. Permafrost is a major feature of the tundra biome.
Any melt of permafrost, or permanently frozen soil that covers almost a quarter of the northern hemisphere from Alaska to China, can also destabilize everything from oil and gas pipelines to buildings and roads.
Permafrost: A layer of soil or bedrock beneath the surface in which the temperature is permanently below freezing and water in the soil is permanently frozen. Permafrost exists where the average annual temperature is below about 23(degrees)F. OPINION.
Ground-water discharge is the removal of water from the zone of saturation, and may take place by transpiration and evaporation, by discharge from springs and seeps, by subsurface flow into an adjoining, area, and by pumping from wells.
Water that occurs above the permafrost table (the top of the permanently frozen layer) and the active zone on top of this layer is extremely difficult to drain. So, in spite of low rainfall (in Interior Alaska, for example), poor drainage becomes extremely noticeable.
