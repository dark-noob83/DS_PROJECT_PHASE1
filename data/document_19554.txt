Tryptophan achieves its effects by way of serotonin, one of the key. brain chemicals involved in regulating mood. Among other functions, serotonin promotes feelings of calm, relaxation, and sleepiness. Lack of. serotonin is associated with depression. 
A common monoamine neurotransmitter in the brain and central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract. It is synthesized from the dietary amino acid l.- tryptophan (see tryptophan hydroxylase), and in the pineal gland it is converted to melatonin.

It is thought by prescribing a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant medication like Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil “fixes” this imbalance, bringing serotonin levels back to “normal.”. First, let’s tackle the whole “chemical imbalance” theory that underlines the serotonin theory of depression. One of the leading myths that unfortunately still circulates about clinical depression is that it’s caused by low serotonin levels in the brain (or a “biochemical imbalance”). This is a myth because countless scientific studies have specifically examined this theory and have come back universally rejecting it.
Serotonin (pronounced /ˌsɛrəˈtoʊnən/) (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized in serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract of animals including humans. Recent research suggests that serotonin plays an important role in liver regeneration and acts as a mitogen (induces cell division) throughout the body. Recent research also suggests that intestinal serotonin may inhibit bone formation.
Also called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter. It is found throughout the body, with only a relatively small portion present in the brain. It cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and must be produced within the brain through a process described below. The original meaning of the word serotonin is a serum that gives tone. It referred to the serotonergic action outside of the CNS-causing contraction of smooth muscle. Yet, within the central nervous system it is involved in functions such as arousal, thermoregulation, mood, appetite, sleep and pain regulatory systems
Serotonin: A neurotransmitter that is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. Serotonin can trigger the release of substances in the blood vessels of the brain that in turn cause the pain of migraine. 
Serotonin and Behavior. Serotonin is a common neuromediator in the brain. It belongs to the group of so-called biogenic amines, relatively simple chemicals that facilitate the transfer of signals between the cells of the body. Low levels of serotonin are associated with depression and suicidal behavior. There are many genetic factors leading to decreased level of serotonergic activity in certain areas of
Function Edit. In the central nervous system, serotonin plays an important role as a neurotransmitter in the modulation of anger, aggression, body temperature, mood, sleep, human sexuality, appetite, and metabolism, as well as stimulating vomiting. Recent research suggests that serotonin plays an important role in liver regeneration and acts as a mitogen (induces cell division) throughout the body. Recent research also suggests that intestinal serotonin may inhibit bone formation.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (or SSRIs) are a class of antidepressants prescribed for depression and anxiety disorders. They work by increasing the amount of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Researchers believe a big part of the answer is found in the chemical oxytocin, also known as the “love hormone.” Dogs also affect our moods less directly, by being the catalyst of situations that help keep low spirits at bay, whether they spring from a diagnosed mood disorder or just a tough day at the office.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor: A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is one of the commonly prescribed drugs for treating depression. SSRIs affect the chemicals that nerves in the brain use to send messages to one another.
