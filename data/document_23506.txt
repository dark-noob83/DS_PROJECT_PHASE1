Try to look at this mnemonics: There are three major types of volcanoes: the composite volcano, the cinder cone volcano, and the shield volcano. Among these three types of volcanoes, the composite volcano is the famous one because it is what we usually see in the movies. The cinder cone is the simplest one and the shield volcano is the largest among the three. The composite volcano is cone shaped volcano with a branched vent and a primary vent in the center.
A shield volcano, cinder cone volcano, and the composite volcano. Shield volcanoes are on of the three types of volcanoes. Shield volcanoes have quiet eruptions and the lava … is basaltic. Its slope is shallow compared to a composite volcano and a cinder-cone volcano. They are produced by hotspots and mid-ocean ridge.
Shield volcanoes are the largest of the three types of volcanoes,  built from basaltic lava flows and shaped like a gentle dome.  Cinder cone volcanoes have very steep slope … s and reach heights of  300 meters or less, and are made from ejected lava.
There are three main types of volcano-composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite Volcanoes. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows. The eruptions from these volcanoes may be a pyroclastic flow rather than a flow of lava.
