Goal: Walk one mile as quickly as possible. Execution: We suggest that you DO NOT attempt this test until you are routinely walking for 15 to 20 minutes several times per week. Do not perform this test on a treadmill, as it will skew your results. Warm up by walking slowly for 3-5 minutes.
On average though, a mile can be walked in about 15-20 minutes. Therefore walking a half-marathon will take an average of 3-4 hours depending on how fast you are walking per mile. This of course will depend on where you live and what your preferences are.

The bad news about walking is, you don't burn a lot of calories doing it. The good news is, you do burn some. How much weight you can lose walking a mile each day depends on how fast you walk and your current weight. If you combine exercise with a low-calorie diet, you will lose weight more quickly.
GOLDENRODFARM. This is an odd test, one mile in 14 minutes is not a walking test, it is running for me, anything less then 17 minutes is running/jogging, my legs just don't go fast enough at a walk for that without resorting to running. To think someone my age can walk that fast without running is very strange.
To figure out how much weight you will lose walking, take the number of calories you burn on each walk and divide 3,500 by that number. This will tell you how many days it will take to lose 1 pound if you add nothing but a 1-mile walk to your daily routine.
