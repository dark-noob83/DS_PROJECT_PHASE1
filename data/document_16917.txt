In the U.S., the birthplace of fast food, Americans eat fewer than 70 percent of their meals at home and less than a third of American families eat meals together more than twice a week, according to Emory University.
A fast-food meal may sound like a good deal, especially when you don’t have time to prepare breakfast or lunch. A comparison of cost vs. nutritional value, however, paints a very different picture. The average cost of a combo meal at a fast food restaurant is $4 to $7. Preparing a comparable meal at home costs about the same, but the real savings are in the calories, fat, and sodium.
Fast-food vs. Fresh food cost Another factor to consider when choosing between eating out and fast food is the time of preparation and your health. Fast food is much quicker, but in the end much worse for your health. By cooking your own meals, you only need to spent about an hour per day.
Now let’s mix and match the two. Say you eat fast food for lunch with a cost of $20. For dinner, you go out to eat and spend $60. If you do that three times per week, you’re looking at $240 for the week and $960 for the month. Remember, this only includes two meals per day for three days during the week.
The study published by STFM found that the average total cost for the healthy-food-diet model was $5,019 per year. The average cost of the convenient-food-diet model was more than twice that of the healthy-food-model, at $10,298 per year. The average daily cost of the healthy diet was $7.48, while the fast food diet averaged $15.30 per day.
