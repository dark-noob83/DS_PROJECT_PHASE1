As a rule of thumb, a cow will eat 2 to 2.5 pounds of hay per day for each 100 pounds of body weight (about one 30- to 40-lb. bale per day). If you feed grain, the usual is 16% dairy ration, which will balance well with most pasture or hay. Another rule of thumb is to give 1 lb. of grain for every 3 lbs. of milk.
â€¢ The daily utilization rate for livestock. This is always the same number, .04, or 4%. This figure is used because livestock need to have 4% of their weight in forage each day (2.5-3% intake, .5 trampling loss and .5-1% buffer). EXAMPLE FARM Beefy Acres is a cow/calf operation located in the Southeast.
Miniature cows cost $1,800 to $3,500 depending on the size, markings and color. (A good standard Jersey sold as a family milk cow will cost $1,400 to $1,800.) Although small-breed cattle may cost more initially, they have some interesting advantages. To learn more, we talked with Pat Schout.
1. How much freezer space do I need? A whole cow takes up about 10 cubic feet of freezer space, which equates to a half using about 5 cubic feet and a quarter about 3 cubic feet. For chicken you can store about two chickens per cubic foot. They are similar to storing a football in the freezer.
