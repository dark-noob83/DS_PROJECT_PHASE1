Ok my ducks are babies so I know its going to be a bit but generally what age so I have a target date. They are stinking me out of house and home right now. I forgot how smelly they were.
3. Allow adult ducks to swim unassisted. When ducklings are fully feathered with their waterproof, adult feathers, they can swim without your supervision. Depending on the type of duck, full feathers should be in place by 9-12 weeks of age.
I have 6 and they are about 2 weeks old also. They are living in my bathtub. Lucky for me I have a separate tub and shower. There food, drinking water and bath water are all in the tub. I did have a folded up towel for them to have dry land but that just turned into a poop hill.
By the time the ducklings are 3-5 weeks old, weather-dependent, they can spend warm, sunny days outside, carefully supervised and protected from predators. Until the ducks are fully feathered around 7-9 weeks old, they have trouble regulating their body temperature and need heat.
Report Abuse. If your ducks are all feathered out and at about the age of 2-3 months old,they should already be living outside provided you aren't living in very frigid temperatures unless they are use to it.
2 ducks are about 2 weeks old now. The others ones are probably about 4 to 5 weeks old. wow they are smelly. Mother of 4, homeschooler, Raise chickens, ducks, geese, goats and YAY I finally have my dairy cow.
Ducklings can go out on grass or range on warm days at a couple of weeks of age, if the lawn is unsprayed and grit is provided with their feed. Ducklings should only be allowed to range on clean ground, preferably where no adult birds have been for 6-12 months to prevent bacterial or parasitic infestations.
