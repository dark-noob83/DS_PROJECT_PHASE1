1 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that patients with lung cancer are typically hospitalized for 7 days at a cost of $15,600 total, or $2,200 per day. 1 One study on the economic burden of lung cancer estimates that the overall costs, from diagnosis to a maximum of two years thereafter, to be about $46,000.
1 On average, the costs of lung cancer treatment hover around $1,500 to $3,200 per month without insurance. 2  Patients who survive through the first year incur the costs of initial treatment of around $26,000 for the first three months or $35,000 for the whole year. 1 It will also vary by the stage and histologic type. 2  On average, the costs of lung cancer treatment hover around $1,500 to $3,200 per month without insurance. 3  Patients who survive through the first year incur the costs of initial treatment of around $26,000 for the first three months or $35,000 for the whole year.
1 Newer cancer treatments can also cost as much as $10,000 for a month. 2  In addition, co-pays are often higher for cancer prescription drugs than those for other types of treatment. 3  According to a study done in 2002, the average price for the treatment of lung cancer was $39,891. 1 It will also vary by the stage and histologic type. 2  On average, the costs of lung cancer treatment hover around $1,500 to $3,200 per month without insurance. 3  Patients who survive through the first year incur the costs of initial treatment of around $26,000 for the first three months or $35,000 for the whole year.
1 For instance, ranibizumab (Lucentis) costs about $1,600 a dose, while Erlotinib (Tarceva) costs $3,500 a dose. 2  One study on the economic burden of lung cancer estimates that the overall costs, from diagnosis to a maximum of two years thereafter, to be about $46,000. 1
1 Patients who survive through the first year incur the costs of initial treatment of around $26,000 for the first three months or $35,000 for the whole year. 2  Lung cancer patients who die incur the initial treatment cost and terminal care costs amounting to around $42,000. 1 It will also vary by the stage and histologic type. 2  On average, the costs of lung cancer treatment hover around $1,500 to $3,200 per month without insurance. 3  Patients who survive through the first year incur the costs of initial treatment of around $26,000 for the first three months or $35,000 for the whole year.
Discounts: 1  According to a study published in the international journal Lung Cancer, the failure of initial treatment is associated with markedly increased costs. 2  Patients needing additional rounds of treatment had total costs of $120,650, compared to $45,953 for those receiving initial treatment only. 1 One study on the economic burden of lung cancer estimates that the overall costs, from diagnosis to a maximum of two years thereafter, to be about $46,000.
A. As far as treatment goes, if the lung cancer can be successfully removed with surgery, the patient has an excellent chance of surviving at least one year, and usually a better than 50% chance of living for five years or more after that. The challenge is detecting lung cancer early enough to make surgery possible. 
Types of Treatment. Lung cancer is treated in several ways, depending on the type of lung cancer and how far it has spread. People with non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. People with small cell lung cancer are usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. 1  Surgery. 2  An operation where doctors cut out cancer tissue
1 The average cost for treating lung cancer is around $7,000 to $40,000 per year. 2  The costs highly depend on if no active treatments are needed or if chemo is required. 3  It will also vary by the stage and histologic type. 1 It will also vary by the stage and histologic type. 2  On average, the costs of lung cancer treatment hover around $1,500 to $3,200 per month without insurance. 3  Patients who survive through the first year incur the costs of initial treatment of around $26,000 for the first three months or $35,000 for the whole year.
