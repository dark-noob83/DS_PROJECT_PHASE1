1MRS 755481 Calculation of the Current Transformer Accuracy Limit Factor 7 Fig. 3.1.1.1.-1 Resistance per cable length (+75 ° C) for copper (Cu). 3.1.1.2. 4- or 6-wire connection If 6-wire connection is used, the total length of the wire, naturally, will be two times the distance between the CT and the relay.
As in a two-winding transformer, the ratio of secondary to primary voltages is equal to the ratio of the number of turns of the winding they connect to. For example, connecting the load between the middle and bottom of the autotransformer will reduce the voltage by 50%.
The transformers “no-load” current taken from the supply is 3 Amps at a power factor of 0.2 lagging. Calculate the primary winding current, IP and its corresponding power factor, φ when the secondary current supplying a transformer loading is 280 Amperes at 0.8 lagging.
1MRS 755481. 4 Calculation of the Current Transformer 1MRS 755481Accuracy Limit Factor 1. Scope This document describes the calculation of the actual accuracy limit factor (F a) for protection-type (P) current transformers (CT).
1 Their performance is defined in terms of a knee-point voltage (KPV), the magnetizing current (Imag) at the knee point voltage or 1/2 or 1/4 the knee-point voltage, and the resistance of the CT secondary winding corrected to 75C.
1MRS 755481 Calculation of the Current Transformer Accuracy Limit Factor 5 2. Introduction The rated accuracy limit factor (F n) is the ratio of the rated accuracy limit primary current to the rated primary current. A protective current transformer type 5P10 has, for example, the accuracy class 5P and the rated accuracy limit factor 10.
1 For example, if a measuring CT class is 0.5M (or 0.5B10), the accuracy is 99.5% for the CT, and the maximum permissible CT error is only 0.5%. 2  Accuracy limit Factor is defined as the multiple of rated primary current up to which the transformer will comply with the requirements of ‘Composite Error’.
Respecting these limitations, transformers are rated for certain levels of primary and secondary winding voltage and current, though the current rating is usually derived from a volt-amp (VA) rating assigned to the transformer.
