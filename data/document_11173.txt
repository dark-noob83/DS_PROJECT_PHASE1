There is no other career where you can grow a $1,000,000 business and only cost you $600 for the license and testing fees. My son work for Aflac and when he finally landed a big account, $200,000 in commissions and future residuals,his bosses delayed closing the deal for about two weeks.My son pleaded with his regional manager to help him finalize the deal.
To those who claim that Aflac is a scam that requires you to pay them m â€¦ oney in order to work, I find that to be completely false. My State Insurance license for two lines only cost me $75. And that money spent has nothing to do with Aflac. Residuals are monthly payments paid to you by AFLAC. the remaining 21% of your 46% commission. Write $100,000, get 46%. Get 25% of that within 48hrs of closing the group.

In Virginia, you get approximately 60% of policy the whole year. But you get only 33% of it upfront once the policy is issued. The rest of the 60% you get throughout the 11 months of the year. Aflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL, TYO: 8686) sells supplemental health and life insurance in the United States and Japan. In the United States, Aflac is known for its policies which pay cash to supplement or replace a policyholder's income when an accident or injury prevents the policyholder from working.
Work hard and you will get paid handsome. IE: Aflac pays you 46% of the AP you write. write $100,000 worth of Annualized premium, aflac pays you $46,000 depending on the starter program you elect, your first year, you can choose 25% upfront and a little less on residuals. or 20% upfront and a little more in residuals. Residuals are monthly payments paid to you by AFLAC. the remaining 21% of your 46% commission. Write $100,000, get 46%. Get 25% of that within 48hrs of closing the group.
4. Some insurance companies will hire you as a rep and pay you a VERY low starting salary w/ some commissions. 5. AFLAC is 100% commission = your Own Business, so you make as much or as little as your area /your drive will allow. (I mean if you like in a town of 10k people and there are 6 AFLAC agents or Allstate agents or State Farm agents-you may only make $20k a year at best)- but you are only limited by where you have licenses. While Aflac does discount its policies for its employeess, since Aflac is not Major Medical or Disability insurance-you are still vunerable to having to pay out a LOT of money for actual medical and disability insurance.
