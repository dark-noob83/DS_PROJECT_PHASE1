The MCV Lab Test is a kind of Hemotology Test. The results are derived from Hct, Hgb, and RBC count from a blood sample. MCV stands for Microtic cell volume, the test is an indicator for the size of the RBC's or red blood cells. It helps to determine if there is risk for certain anemia's.
The MCHC in a MCHC test stands for Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration. MCHC is the calculation of the average hemoglobin inside a red blood cell. A MCHC test can be performed along with a MCV test (Mean Corpuscular Volume). Both levels are used to test people for anemia.
Indications/Applications. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) laboratory test, as part of a standard complete blood count (CBC), is used along with other RBC indices (MCH and MCHC) to help classify the cause of anemia based on red cell morphology. See also the Interpretation section above.
MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume. It’s the average volume of the body’s red blood cells, measured in femtoliters (one-quadrillionth of a liter). Cell-counting machines calculate MCV from a blood sample. A normal value may vary between laboratories, but is usually between 80 and 96 femtoliters (fL).
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the average size of your RBCs (red blood cells). The MCV is elevated when your RBCs are larger than normal (macrocytic), for example in anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency.
