take the number of calories you consume daily, and take 20% of this number (the amount of fat calories per day you need). in your case, you should consume 360 fat calori … es. one gram of fat is equal to 9 fat calories, so divide the 360 grams of fat by nine, to give you 40 grams of dat per day.
By comparison, most women should be getting no more than 6 teaspoons a day, or 100 calories, of added sugar — the sweeteners and syrups that are added to foods during processing, preparation or at the table. For most men, the recommended limit is 9 teaspoons, or 150 calories, the heart group says.
How much is 10 percent? Well, in a 2000-calorie-a-day diet, 10 percent would be equal to about 50 grams, or 10 teaspoons of sugar. Unfortunately, most Americans consume 30 to 40 teaspoons or more of refined sugar per day. Most of this sugar comes from food products to which sugar has been added, such as soda, candy and baked goods.
Average daily intake. On average, in 2004, Canadians consumed 110.0 grams of sugar a day, the equivalent of 26 teaspoons. This amounted to 21.4% of their total daily calorie intake. Absolute daily sugar consumption varied substantially with age (Figure 1).
Sugar Allowance. Because sugar isn’t an essential nutrient, it doesn’t have an official recommendation. However, the American Heart Association set a recommended limit, so you don’t get too many extra calories in your diet. Men shouldn't have more than 9 teaspoons daily, while women shouldn't have more than 6 teaspoons.
Currently, Western European adults consume an average of 101 grams of sugar per day, while in South America the figure rises to 130 grams. Sugar represents around 16-17% of an adult’s daily energy intake in the United Kingdom and Spain.
