Print Email. In this course, you explore PIPESIM* 2014 production system analysis software that provides steady-state, multiphase flow simulation for oil and gas production systems. A major feature of PIPESIM software is the system integration and openness that allows you to develop a Total Production System Model. You gain a general understanding of how PIPESIM software is used to design and optimize total production systems from the reservoir to the final processing delivery point.
Publisher's description. PIPESIM software is a steady-state, multiphase flow simulator for the design and diagnostic analysis of oil and gas production systems. PIPESIM software tools model multiphase flow from the reservoir to the wellhead. PIPESIM software also analyzes flowline and surface facility performance to generate comprehensive production system analysis.
