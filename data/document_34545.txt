one of many ideas of the physiological premise of color vision based upon proof from experiments on color mixture wherein all colors and shades were capable of being matched by a mixture of three primary hues. The Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision is the most widely acknowledged trichromatic theory. Later analyses ascertained that there are three varying retinal cone photopigments with peak sensitivities nearly correlating to the three primary hues of trichromatic theory: green, red, and blue.
