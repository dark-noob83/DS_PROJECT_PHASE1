The cost of having a professional yacht detailer perform a detailing job on your boat will vary by the geographical region your boat is in, the kind of boat you have, the experience and reputation of the detailer, and the condition of your boat, among other factors. Many yacht detailers charge by the foot. Typical per foot costs for detailing might be $10 to $20 per foot. Most boat detailers will offer a specified package of services that are included in their standard prices, and generally will provide additional services on request for an additional fee. Keep in mind that most boat detailers include needed equipment and supplies in their price. If you want to detail your boat yourself, you might spend $50 to $100 to purchase the necessary boat detailing supplies.
How do we determine pricing? For example, if your boat is 24 feet long and requires compound and wax (exterior only), this covers 1 pass of compounding and 1 coat of wax. The price will be $17.00 per foot. But if your boat requires 2 passes of compound, the price goes up. Or if your boat has a tall hull (taller than average), the price goes up. For boats 25 feet and longer, call for a quote. If your boat is stored at a marina, we reserve the right to add 10% to the price for marina fees. A 50% deposit is required on all jobs exceeding $1,000 to assist with labor and material costs.
