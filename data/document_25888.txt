1 Depending on the type of fencing you choose, the cost for farm fencing greatly varies. 2  For instance, if you choose to have a permanent fencing for your beef or dairy cattle or sheep, that can cost to as much as $1,500 to $2,500 per mile excluding the labor cost. 1 A one inch pony rail has an average cost of $.21 to $.28 per foot of rail. 2  Farm fencing using barbed wire suspensions can cost $1,500 to $2,500 for a 400 m area. 10 acres of land would cost around $2,000 to $4,000 for the fencing alone. 3  The materials of the fencing alone.

Labor costs, based on last year's Iowa Farm Custom Rate Survey, added up to $15.05/hour for woven wire fencing and $16.25 for barbed wire. A straight quarter-mile stretch of new woven wire fencing will cost $2,553.31, or just shy of $2 per linear foot. It's a little less expensive than a woven-wire fence to build and has about the same average lifespan of around 20 years, Edwards says. The estimated $1,947.75/quarter mile cost of a 5-wire barbed-wire fence takes into account the following: 1  4 8-inch wood posts ($28 apiece). 2  57 4-inch wood posts ($9 apiece).
1 Chain-link fence prices fluctuate with the cost of steel, but an average residential chain link fence with do-it-yourself installation typically costs $3-$6 a linear foot for 4' high and $8-$15 a foot for 6' high; with a gate or other options DIY materials can be $400-$2,000 for a 100' fence. 1 The cost for a wooden fence can vary from $3 -$9 a foot for do-it-yourself installation of a ranch-style rail fence, to $10 -$30 or more a foot for professional installation of a basic 6' wood privacy fence. 2  For details, see How Much Does a Wood Fence Cost.
Fencing costs are one of the most expensive aspects of livestock grazing. The type of fence constructed greatly impacts the cost per foot, total cost, and annual ownership cost. In addition, the shape of the paddocks affects the amount of materials needed and labor required for construction of the fence. Labor was valued at $15.05 per hour for woven wire and $16.25 per hour for barbed wire, the average fence building custom charges reported in AgDM File A3-10, 2011 Iowa Farm Custom Rate Survey. These charges include the cost of equipment and tools for building fence, as well as labor.
The estimated cost of materials to fence 10 acres with field fence would be $2,067.84, and a five-strand barbed wire fence would cost $1,471.76. Figure 7. Acreage and fencing measurements [Click thumbnail to enlarge.]. Acreage and fencing measurements. Table 5. The type of fence constructed varies with personal choice and the species of livestock to be confined. The two types of fencing illustrated are field wire and barbed wire. The list of tools (Table 1) and the materials needed for each type of fencing provided below is standard in the construction of a fence.
The non-wire/tape components have an estimated life of 25 years; the polywire and polytape will likely last about four to five years. Based on these estimates, the annual ownership cost for a polywire or polytape fence is approximately $0.06-$0.07 per foot. Labor was valued at $15.05 per hour for woven wire and $16.25 per hour for barbed wire, the average fence building custom charges reported in AgDM File A3-10, 2011 Iowa Farm Custom Rate Survey. These charges include the cost of equipment and tools for building fence, as well as labor.
An alternative is to set posts 30 feet apart and place two stay rods in the wire between each set of posts. Cost would be reduced about $85 for every 1,320 feet of fence, or $0.064 per foot. The high tensile electrified fence (see Table 4) uses five strands of 12.5 gauge high tensile wire with three charged and two grounded wires. Labor was valued at $15.05 per hour for woven wire and $16.25 per hour for barbed wire, the average fence building custom charges reported in AgDM File A3-10, 2011 Iowa Farm Custom Rate Survey. These charges include the cost of equipment and tools for building fence, as well as labor.
