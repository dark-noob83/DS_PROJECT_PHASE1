Hot water and steam radiator systems have been used in many colder climates to heat homes for more than a century. These systems provide excellent heat that is cost-effective and, some say, more comfortable than other more modern systems. No matter what is flowing through your radiator, putting in radiator covers is more than just an aesthetic choice. Radiators provide heat in one portion of a room. To get that heat to spread properly, a cover is often a cost-effective choice.
1 When replacing the radiator, it is best to also replace the radiator cap and thermostat. 2  After your radiator is replaced, it is best to have it checked for leaks, to assure that everything is in working order. 3  When the radiator is replaced, the entire cooling system should be checked, especially the radiator hoses. While running, the engine produces heat. Coolant flowing through the system absorbs and removes extra heat from the engine. The coolant then passes through the radiator where it cools off and is later circulated back to the engine to absorb heat again.
