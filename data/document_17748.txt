It's nearly recession-proof. It's cheaper than going to the movies and more social, said Darrell Gillo, who manages Karts N' Golf in Fremont, Calif. On average, it costs $5 to play 18 holes of miniature golf, which makes it one of the cheapest forms of entertainment around. It cost the owners of Karts N' Golf closer to $500,000, according to Gillo, to build out their amusement center. They managed to squeeze two 18-hole miniature golf courses, go-karts and bumper cars on 2.5 acres of land east of San Francisco Bay. Getting started runs Mondays on CNNfn's Small Business page.
