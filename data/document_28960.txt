Linked genes. Definition. noun, singular: linked gene. Genes that are inherited together with the other gene (s) as they are located on the same chromosome. Supplement. When a pair or set of genes are on the same chromosome, they are usually inherited together or as a single unit. For example, in fruit flies the genes for eye color and the genes for wing length are on the same chromosome, thus are inherited together.
Print. The reason that linked genes are inherited together is that. A) they are located on the same chromosome. B) the number of genes in a cell is greater than the number of chromosomes. C) chromosomes are unbreakable. D) alleles are paired. E) genes align that way during metaphase I.
Unlinked genes, whether on the same or different chromosomes, are inherited separately 50% of the time. Genes that are genetically linked are inherited separately less than 50% of the time. The closer together the linked genes are, the less likely it is that a recombination event will happen between them.
Genes on separate chromosomes are never linked (center). But not all genes on a chromosome are linked. Genes that are farther away from each other are more likely to be separated during a process called homologous recombination (right). Genetic linkage is different from sex linkage. Learn about

If two genes are inherited together more than 50% of the time, this is evidence that they are linked on the same chromosome. The closer together the genes are, the more frequently they will be inherited together.
