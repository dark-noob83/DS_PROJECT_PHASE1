Likewise, humans and apes have a lot of morphological similarities, so we would expect there would be similarities in their DNA. Of all the animals, chimps are most like humans [1] , so we would expect that their DNA would be most like human DNA.
Humans are most closely related to the great apes of the family Hominidae. This family includes orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos. Of the great apes, humans share 98.8 percent of their DNA with bonobos and chimpanzees. Humans and gorillas share 98.4 percent of their DNA.
Genetic Differences. Given the vast physical differences between humans and animals, it is interesting to note just how similar their DNA is. DNA is actually a code comprised of 4 nucleotides or types of molecules known as adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine.
Of course, humans, dogs, mice and apes are going to have DNA in common. They are all mammals. Humans and birds are a different matter. Yet they, too, share a lot of DNA -- 65 percent.
It includes a complete list of DNA and genes that give pigs their traits like height and color. Once all of the genetic information is understood, scientists anticipate improvements to the animal's health as well as human health, as pigs and humans share similar physiologies.
Animals make good research subjects for a variety of reasons. Animals are biologically similar to humans. In fact, chimpanzees share more that 99% of DNA with humans and mice share more than 98% DNA with humans, therefore, animals are susceptible to many of the same health problems as humans.
