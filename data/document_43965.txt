Double spacing refers to the amount of space that shows between the individual lines of your paper. When a paper is single spaced, there is very little white space between the typed lines, which means there is no room for marks or comments. In fact, this is exactly why teachers ask you to double space.
In most word processing programs, you set the line spacing and it will double space for you. In MS Word, you select Format, then Paragraph, then on the Indents and Spacing tab, pull down the menu under Line Spacing, select Double, and then click ok to get out of the menus.

Answer: When writing a text document, most word processing programs, such as Microsoft Word, allow you to change the line spacing. The line spacing refers to how much space is between each line of text. If it is set to one line, each line of text will be written one after the other, with no extra space in between. If it is set to two lines, commonly referred to as double spacing, each line of text will be followed by a line of white space with the next line of text below. Double spacing makes a text document feel more open and is typically easier to read.
