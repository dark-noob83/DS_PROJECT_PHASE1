Thomas Edison and the First Phonograph August 12, 1877. The next time you listen to a favorite album, you can thank Thomas Edison for discovering the secret to recording sound.
· Edison predicted that people would use phonograph technology to record phone conversations, dictation and final messages of dying family members. · Phonograph literally … means writing sound or sound writer in Greek. · The very first model Edison made was with was paper.
The output side of the machine played the sound through a needle and an amplifier. The needle was set in the groove and the cylinder set to the beginning. The amplified vibrations played back the recorded sounds. The recording medium used in the original phonograph was awkward to use and broke easily. In 1887, Emile Berliner, a German living in America, developed a hand-cranked machine that turned a hard rubber disc on a flat plate (instead of a cylinder) which became known as the gramophone.
Edison Invents the Phonograph. Thomas Edison created many inventions, but his favorite was the phonograph. While working on improvements to the telegraph and the telephone, Edison figured out a way to record sound on tinfoil-coated cylinders. In 1877, he created a machine with two needles: one for recording and one for playback.
How the phonograph works. The first audio recorded and played back was Edison saying the nursery rhyme, “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Edison soon got bored with the invention and did not do much with it for the next several years. Other inventers soon discovered the great invention and began to work with it themselves.
