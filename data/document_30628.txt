All seedless watermelons are hybrids and take the longest time to mature. The seeds germinate between seven and 14 days and they must be kept between 75 and 85 degrees. It's also necessary to plant seedless watermelons next to seeded watermelons, as the hybrid varieties need a pollinator.
Step 3. Cover pots with plastic wrap and place in a warm room to germinate---approximately 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Check daily for sprouts and to ensure the potting mix is still moist. Watermelons usually take 7 to 14 days to germinate but check seed package for exact timing for the variety you are growing.
Boosting the soil's fertility levels before planting watermelon seeds ensures quick germination and seedling establishment. For the best results with watermelons, use 3 pounds of 5-10-10 fertilizer for every 100 square feet of planting space.
Boost Temperatures. The warmer the soil, the faster watermelon seeds germinate. For example, it takes approximately three days for a watermelon seed to germinate in 90 degree Fahrenheit conditions, and approximately 10 days when temperatures are at 70 degrees.
Juicy, sweet watermelon is truly a summer treat. Watermelons require a long, hot summer in order to reach maturity. In the areas with short summers, start watermelon seeds indoors and transplant outside after all danger of frost has passed.
For a healthy seedling to sprout, watermelon seeds must be planted in temperatures between 70 and 95 degrees. Position the seeds no more than 5 feet away from each other, so the seedlings have room to mature into large fruit. Plant the seed about an inch into the ground.
Simply scoop the seeds out of a watermelon, rinse them under water to remove any fruit pieces or fruit juices, and let them air-dry on a paper towel. In general, watermelon seeds stay viable for approximately four years. However, the longer you wait, the lower your chances of optimal germination.
