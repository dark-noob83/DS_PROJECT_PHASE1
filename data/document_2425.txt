If you know the amps and the resistance Ohm's law becomes Volts = Amps * Resistance. Explanation. Amps are how many electrons flow past a certain point per second. It is equal to one coulomb of charge per second, or 6.24 x 10^18 electrons per second. Volts is a measure of how much force that each electron is under, which we call potential. Power (watts) is volts times amps.
Or, 1260 watt hours divided by 12 volts = 105 amp hours, or using our 50% example, 630 watt hours divided by 12 volts = 52.5 amp hours available. How many amps does a portable computer draw? I think mine is around 7 or 8 amps per hour. 52.6 amp hours divided by 8 equals 6.56 amp hours.
The equation for finding how many watt hours are available in a battery when the amp hours are known is voltage x amp hours. For instance, a 12 volt 105 amp hour (AH) battery can supply 1260 watt hours (12 volts x 105 amp hours =1260 watt hours).
You cannot convert watts to amps, since watts are power and amps are coulombs per second (like converting gallons to miles). HOWEVER, if you have at least least two of the following three: amps, volts or watts then the missing one can be calculated.
Best Answer: Actually your question should be How much energy is in a battery, and that is usually in mA-hours. Note the mA-hour rating is not actually energy, but a measure of energy. Multiply the ma-hour rating by the voltage (usually 1.5v) to get the energy rating in mW-hours (Watt-hour*1000). One watt-second is a joule.
It can also be expressed as amperes times ohms (current times resistance, Ohm's law), watts per ampere (power per unit current, Joule's law), or joules per coulomb (energy per unit charge) which is also equivalent to electron volts per elementary charge:
Voltage is a measure of electrical potential energy in units of volts or joules per coulomb (energy/charge). Then 1 volt means 1 joule per coulomb; 2 volts mean 2 joules per coulomb, and 5 volts mean 5 joules per coulomb.
