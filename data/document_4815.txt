Venules. Venules are minute vessels that drain blood from capillaries and into veins. Many venules unite to form a vein. 1  Drains blood from capillaries into veins, for return to the heart.
In most people, the portal vein splits into left and right veins before entering the liver. The right vein then branches off into anterior and superior veins. The portal vein supplies approximately 75 percent of blood flow to the liver. The portal vein is not a true vein, which means it does not drain into the heart. Instead, it brings nutrient-rich blood to the liver from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen.

From the dorsal venous arch, the great saphenous vein passes anterior to the medial malleolus of the ankle and enters the medial side of the leg.
The coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the heart. Oxygen-poor blood travels from organs and tissues to the heart through veins. The vena cava is the major vein that returns blood to the right atrium of the heart. The vena cava superior returns blood from the head, neck, upper extremities, and chest. The vena cava inferior returns blood from the lower extremities, the pelvis, and the abdomen.
Vena cava is one of the two veins (superior vena cava and inferior vena cava) that drain blood from all parts of the body (except the heart) into the right atrium of the heart. The superior vena cava returns blood from the head, neck, and arms to
