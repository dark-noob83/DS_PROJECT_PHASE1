What is commonly known as “average life expectancy” is technically known as “life expectancy at birth” or “life expectancy at age 0” and refers to the average number of years that a newborn baby can expect to live in a given society at a given time.
To summarize, the terms development, adult development, aging, life-span, life course, and life cycle are currently widely used within the field of developmental psychology. The term development has the widest range of usage, extending from a narrow biological definition to a life-span developmental definition.
World map of life expectancy, 2005. Life expectancy is a statistical measure defined as the expected (mean) survival of human beings based upon a number of criteria such as gender and geographic location. Popularly, it is most often construed to mean the life expectancy at birth for a given human population, which is the same as the expected age at death. However, technically life expectancy means the expected number of years remaining to live, and it can be calculated for any age.

Even at 80, Susannah is active. She likes to go for walks and even lifts weights a few days a week. 3. Reproduction.
This definition can be contrasted with that proposed by life-span developmental psychologists: Development is a life-long process beginning at conception and ending at death (Honzik, 1984, p. 309). Development is thus extended to include the whole of life.
