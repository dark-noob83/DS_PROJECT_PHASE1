Even with the long warm-up time, there is a limit to how long the lamp should be operated continuously to keep it functioning as designed. Do not run the lamp for more than eight to 10 hours straight.
Turn off the lamp and allow it to cool down before turning it back on. Once it cools, it should function properly again. A lava lamp may overheat in eight to 10 hours, depending upon the bulb and brand of lamp. Use the lamp for less than eight hours at a time for best results, allowing it to cool to room temperature before using it again.

If turned off or the bulb wattage is too low in humid climates, a salt lamp may sweat as they are natural dehumidifiers.
