Apoptosis also differs from necrosis in that it's essential to human development. For example, in the womb, our fingers and toes are connected to one another by a sort of webbing. Apoptosis is what causes that webbing to disappear, leaving us with 10 separate digits.
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a naturally occurring process in the body. It involves a controlled sequence of steps in which cells signal self termination. Apoptosis works to keep the body's natural cell division process of mitosis in check.
apoptosis-a type of cell death in which the cell uses specialized cellular machinery to kill itself; a cell suicide mechanism that enables metazoans to control cell number and eliminate cells that threaten the animal's survival.
Diffen › Science › Biology. Whereas apoptosis is a form of cell death that is generally triggered by normal, healthy processes in the body, necrosis is cell death that is triggered by external factors or disease, such as trauma or infection.
There are two ways that a cell can die: necrosis and apoptosis. Necrosis occurs when a cell is damaged by an external force, such as poison, a bodily injury, an infection or getting cut off from the blood supply (which might occur during a heart attack or stroke).
Apoptosis: A form of cell death in which a programmed sequence of events leads to the elimination of cells without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding area. Apoptosis plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining the health of the body by eliminating old cells, unnecessary cells, and unhealthy cells.
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a form of cell death that is generally triggered by normal, healthy processes in the body. Necrosis is the premature death of cells and living tissue.
