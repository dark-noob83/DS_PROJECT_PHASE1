Not only is growing pineapples ridiculously easy. Growing pineapple plants is possible just about anywhere in the world ! (That's because the pineapple plant is one of the few tropical fruits that are really well suited to growing in pots, and that means you can grow pineapples indoors.). I grow lots of pineapples in my garden. If you plant them in the right spot they need virtually no care whatsoever.
A new pineapple plant is grown from slips, crowns or suckers, not seeds, and the plant starts the flowering process about 12-14 months after planting. It is ready for harvesting usually about 20 months after it is planted.
Bananas and pineapples are grown in countries of the tropics-Africa, Latin America, Caribbean, Pacific etc. Many countries produce bananas as a staple food and only around 20% of all bananas that are produced are actually exported.
