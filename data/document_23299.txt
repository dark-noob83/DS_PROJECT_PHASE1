Earth's Interior. (J. Louie). The earth is divided into four main layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. The core is composed mostly of iron (Fe) and is so hot that the outer core is molten, with about 10% sulphur (S). The inner core is under such extreme pressure that it remains solid.
The thickest parts are under the continents and the thinnest parts are under the oceans. Crust. Earth's crust is made up of several elements: oxygen, 47 percent; silicon, 27 percent; aluminum, 8 percent; iron, 5 percent; calcium, 4 percent; magnesium, potassium and sodium, 2 percent.
Outside the core, the largest mass of planet Earth is called the mantle and this is mostly solid rock. The very outermost layer of our planet is about 30 miles thick, is made of lighter rocks, and is called the crust.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The earth's crust is the outer lighter portion of the continental crust. The crust beneath the ocean iscomosed of heavy, dark volcanic rock. The continental crust is composed mostly of lighter rocks rich in silica such as granite.
