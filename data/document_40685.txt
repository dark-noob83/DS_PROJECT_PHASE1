A cold air intake is designed to place the air filter as far away from the hot engine as possible. Especially important when your radiator fan turns on, it will not blow the hot air into your air filter as with most short rams.
Both ram air and cold air intake systems are designed to do the same thing: get more air, and thus more fuel-air mixture, into an internal combustion engine.
Both ram and cold air intakes provide more air to the engine without the added weight or complexity of a forced induction system, such as a supercharger or turbocharger. While neither one provides as much performance as forced induction, they are simpler, less expensive, and more reliable.
What's the difference between a cold air intake and a short ram air intake? What are the benefits of one over the other? Cold air intakes attempt to relocate the engine air filter outside of the engine compartment, thus pulling in cooler air and allowing for more power.
Ram air intake aka, short ram intakes are good for low end horsepower and torque. Cold air intakes have more horsepower gaines then short ram and more top end power. If your looking for more torque then horsepower, meaning more acceleration but dont care about topping out your car, then short ram intake is what you want.
Both ram air and cold air intake systems are designed to do the same thing: get more air, and thus more fuel-air mixture, into an internal combustion engine. They represent intermediate steps between a standard naturally aspirated engine and a forced induction system, such as a turbocharger or a supercharger ..
Performance. Cold air intakes bring denser cold air to the engine, providing noticeable increase in power and fuel economy. Short ram intakes bring in air that is warm or even hot from being in the engine compartment, limiting the improvement to just better airflow--giving the overall advantage to cold air intakes.
