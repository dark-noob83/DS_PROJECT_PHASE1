The average tax refund could cut almost one-third of the average credit card debt.

Another 25 percent will save at least some of their tax refund.

Posted by Financial Samurai 51 Comments. The average tax refund is around $3,000 in America according to the IRS. Since saving, or not spending $250 a month is difficult for many, I’m OK with such a refund. With basic savings interest rates close to zero, your opportunity cost is pretty small. If we are to compare the average tax refund to the average per capita income in America of $50,000 (~$40,000 tax), $3,000, or roughly 6-7% of income is a pretty meaningful number. 
The math works out to just over 73% of all returns resulting in a refund. The average tax refund works out to $2,792. This means that Uncle Sam received an average of $2,792 in interest-free loans from 109,499,000 lenders (aka taxpayers), for a combined $305.7 billion. Pretty ridiculous. 
As of March 22nd, the average tax refund stands at just a hair under three thousand dollars. At this time last year, the average was a little over that amount, sitting at $3,030 (the average for last year would later fall to $2,803 as later filers were accounted for). In previous years, the average tax refund has been in the same range, with the average peaking for the 2009 tax year before slipping: 1  Average 2012 Refund: $2,803. 2  Average 2011 Refund: $2,913.

In previous years, the average tax refund has been in the same range, with the average peaking for the 2009 tax year before slipping: 1  Average 2012 Refund: $2,803. 2  Average 2011 Refund: $2,913.
