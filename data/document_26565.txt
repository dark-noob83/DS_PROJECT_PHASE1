The isotopes of titanium range in atomic weight from 38.01 u (38 Ti) to 62.99 u (63 Ti). The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 48 Ti, is β+ and the primary mode after is β − . The primary decay products before 48 Ti are scandium isotopes and the primary products after are vanadium isotopes.
The atomic number of titanium is 22, so it as 22 protons in its nucleus, regardless of which isotope we're looking at. If the atomic mass of titanium (Ti) is 46, it has 46 - 2 … 2 or 24 neutrons in its nucleus. This is Ti-46, or 2246Ti, and its the lightest of the 5 stable isotopes of titanium.

Isotopes: Titanium has 18 isotopes whose half-lives are known, with mass numbers 39 to 57. Naturally occurring titanium is a mixture of its five stable isotopes and they are found in the percentages shown: 46 Ti (8.2%), 47 Ti (7.4%), 48 Ti (73.7%), 49 Ti (5.4%) and 50 Ti (5.2%).
26 Mar, 2012 how many 0. Titanium is a strong silvery metal that was discovered in 1791. Titanium is a chemical element that is represented by the chemical symbol Ti and the atomic number 22. It is the seventh most abundant metal in the crust of the Earth where it is always found bonded to other elements.

The 5 stable isotopes of titanium are 46 Ti, 47 Ti, 48 Ti, 49 Ti and 50 Ti. The most common titanium isotope on Earth is 48 Ti, which makes up about 74% of the natural titanium and the other 4 stable isotopes make up the remaining 26%. In addition to the stable isotopes, there have been 21 radioactive isotopes of titanium identified. The most stable of these is 44 Ti, with a half life of 60 years. 45 Ti, 51 Ti and 52 Ti are the only other isotopes with a half life of longer than a minute.
