When you click on the little arrow icon next to the downloaded pdf file, you get a context menu with the following options: 1  Open-displays it in Google Chrome. 2  Always open files of this type-opens pdf documents automatically from that moment on. 3  Open with system viewer-loads the file in the default program for pdf files.
Select Google Chrome from the list and click the ‘Set as default’ button and press the ‘Close’ button. Back to the desktop or any location where the PDF files reside. Double-click on a PDF file and it should open with the Google Chrome browser. Similarly, you can set the Google Chrome as the default PDF viewer in MAC.
Google Chrome used to open PDFs downloaded to the hard drive using the system's default PDF viewer by default. Recent versions of Chrome use Chrome's (inferior) built-in PDF viewer by default even for downloaded files, not only online PDFs.

If you install the PDF XChange viewer plugin in chrome and disable the default chrome pdf viewer, you will be able to use your viewer normally in chrome. share | improve this answer. answered Nov 17 '14 at 15:42.
To revert to the Adobe Reader, type about:plugins in the address bar (without the quotes), hit enter, and then click on details (near the top right), disable Chrome PDF Viewer and enable the Adobe one.
If you find that Google Chrome is not capable to open the PDF files head to the plugins page of your Chrome browser (type about:plugins at the address bar and hit the enter key). Make sure that the Chrome PDF viewer is enabled. You are done with setting your Google Chrome Web Browser as a default PDF viewer/reader.
