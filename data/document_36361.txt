I know we all don’t have the luxury of this generous coupon policy at all our ShopRite stores however definitely do some research and find out if your store honors any type of competitor’s coupons and if not your store, attempt to locate a store that does that is a reasonable distance from your location. LOL They will also accept Walgreen’s coupons…the ones you can print online and the ones from their monthly coupon books that you can get in the store. I usually grab 3 or 4 books. My husband only uses Prell shampoo so when Walgreen’s had a $3/1 Prell shampoo coupon I used one every time I stopped in Shoprite that month.

Outside of ShopRite many other stores accept competitor’s coupons! Below is a list of some of the stores I’m aware of that accept competitor’s coupons. Be sure to check with each store first for a details on this policy. Feel free to add in the comments any I might have missed! LOL They will also accept Walgreen’s coupons…the ones you can print online and the ones from their monthly coupon books that you can get in the store. I usually grab 3 or 4 books.

So if you had a $0.75 coupon and the item is $0.99 it will indeed only double to $0.99. But those 2 stores do Fully double coupons under $0.99. My local Shoprite on Hylan blvd in Staten Island fully doubles coupons but they will not accept printed coupons from smart source or anything that prints with a QR code on them. I have had the same problem recently at the shoprite on Hylan Blvd. I use a combination of circular coupons and internet printed coupons, all manufacturer’s. I check each receipt to confirm coupons have been applied. If there is something I’m missing to get the FD instead of RD, please do share! But I don’t think this particular ShopRite does FD, based on my experiences.
To find local stores doubling policies please visit Shoprite Stores Which Double Coupons. Then click on the state you are looking for store info on. There will be a list of the stores in that state and info on if the fully double or if they double to a max of $1.00. Thanks to everyone for posting on the ShopRite forums, it is helpful! I noticed that a lot of you can truly double coupons but I can not only up to $1. So I thought it might be helpful to post your store's location and what they double too, since they are individually owned.
