How long it would take to get to Uranus from Earth would depend on the path chosen and on where Uranus and Earth were in their orbits when the mission was launched. For example, the Voyager 2 spacecraft was launched on Aug 20, 1977 and it reached Uranus on Jan 24 1986.
Uranus revolves or orbits around the Sun once every 84 Earth years, or once every 30,687 Earth days. Uranus travels at an average speed of 15,290 miles per hour or 24,607 kilometers per hour in its orbit around the Sun. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 2  Learn how.
Uranus travels in an elliptical orbit around the sun once every 84 Earth years. At its closest (perihelion), the distance to Uranus from the star is 1.7 billion miles (2.5 billion km); at its farthest (aphelion), 1.89 billion miles (3 billion km).
At an average distance of 3 billion km from the Sun, it takes Uranus roughly 84 years (or 30,687 days) to complete a single orbit of the Sun. The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes. As with all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation.
It depends upon the speed of travel. The fastest current spacecraft (in 2012) would take about 5 years to travel there directly, provided Uranus was at its closest distance to Earth (the distance can vary from about 2.6 billion kilometers to 3.1 billion kilometers).
For the planet Uranus to travel around the Sun, it takes 84.02  Earth years (sidereal years). If you lived on Uranus, you would  call this one year.   This is 30,687.15 â€¦ Earth days or about 42,732 Uranus days. 16 people found this useful.
