Private-pay home care is different than the Medicare-covered home care, which is short term (less than 60 days), intermittent (for a few hours each week), rehabilitative (physical therapy or speech therapy), and medically necessary (care that must be provided by a Registered Nurse). Therefore it is intermittent (a few days per week, less than 24-hours per day) and short-term (it has an end point that is less than 60 days). Medicare does not pay for long-term or ongoing care that ultimately will not improve someone’s current health condition.
