The blood plasma is filtered through the capillaries of the glomerulus into the capsule. The Bowman's capsule empties the filtrate into the proximal tubule that is also part of the nephron. A glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal circulation. The glomerulus is a tuft of small blood vessels called capillaries located within Bowman's capsule within the kidney. Between the capillaries and Bowman's capsule lies mesangium.
A glomerulus is a network (as a tuft) of capillaries located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. It serves as the first stage in the filtering process of the blood carried out by the nephron in its formation of urine. The glomerulus is surrounded by a cup-like sac known as Bowman's capsule. The glomerulus is a tuft of small blood vessels called capillaries located within Bowman's capsule within the kidney. Between the capillaries and Bowman's capsule lies mesangium.
Split and merge into it. Answer by Mrbuttersworth. Confidence votes 2. The Bowman's Capsule is part of a Nephron, which would be found in the Kidney. It's function is to collect the filtrate from the Glomerulus, passing it on to the Proximal Convoluted Tubules (PCT's); subsequently, to the rest of the Nephron. 
Together the glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule are the renal corpuscle. The fluid and its contents, called filtrate, passes into the tubules of the nephron, which further filter and concentrate the filtrate. Function of Glomerulus and Definition. The coiled capillary network within the NEPHRON of the kidney through which BLOOD passes for filtration. Glomeruli are abundant within the KIDNEYS as each kidney contains more than a million nephrons.
(June 2011). Bowman's capsule (or the Bowman capsule, capsula glomeruli, or glomerular capsule) is a cup-like sac at the beginning of the tubular component of a nephron in the mammalian kidney that performs the first step in the filtration of blood to form urine. A glomerulus is enclosed in the sac. Fluids from blood in the glomerulus are collected in the Bowman's capsule (i.e., glomerular filtrate) and further processed along the nephron to form urine. This process is known as ultrafiltration. As a result, the filtrate leaving the Bowman's capsule is very similar to blood plasma (filtrate or glomerular filtrate is composed of blood plasma minus plasma protein i.e. it contains all the components of blood plasma except the proteins) in composition as it passes into the proximal convoluted tubule.
Best Answer: In the kidney, a tubular structure called the nephron filters blood to form urine. At the beginning of the nephron, the glomerulus /ɡlɒˈmɛrələs/ is a network (tuft) of capillariesthat performs the first step of filtering blood. The glomerulus is surrounded by Bowman's capsule. A glomerulus and its surrounding Bowman's capsule constitute a renal corpuscle, the basic filtration unit of the kidney. The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the overall renal function, is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).... Source(s): Monica · 3 years ago.
Ad. Bowman's capsule and the glomerulus form a unit called the renal corpuscle, in which the initial process of filtration occurs. A small artery carries blood into the glomerulus, where it is filtered at high pressure through two layers of cells before the remaining blood leaves through another artery. Bowman's capsule, also known as a glomerular capsule or capsula glomeruli, is a double-walled, cup-shaped structure inside the kidney. The kidney contains up to two million units called nephrons.
