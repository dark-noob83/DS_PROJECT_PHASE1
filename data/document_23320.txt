Project size. Most contractors will charge small tile installation projects at higher rate. For example, price for the installation of 45 sq. ft. porcelain floor tile in a small hallway will be around $450 to $550, which makes it $11.25 - $12.30 per square foot. But if it is a 700 ft 2 basement has to be tiled with the same porcelain tile, an installer typically offers much better deal on labor per square foot and will price the project at $2,800 - $3,100 or $4.0 - $4.4 per sq. ft. Design and layout will have significant impact on the tile installation prices.
Porcelain Tile Flooring Costs. Most porcelain tile costs $4 to $8 per square foot-slightly more than ceramic tile. However, keep in mind that if you’re looking for custom tiles, the price skyrockets to as much as $25 per square foot. Installation generally runs another $4 to $8 per square foot, depending on complexity. Ceramic tile generally costs $3 to $7 per square foot.
