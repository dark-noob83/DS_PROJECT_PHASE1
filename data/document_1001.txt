Thyroid Problems. Lyme disease is The Great Imitator, and some people are diagnosed with thyroid problems well before they find out they actually have Lyme disease. Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid under-produces the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine(T3) and/orthyroxine(T4).secretions. Symptoms are similar to some that accompany Lyme disease such as tiredness, poor ability to tolerate cold, and weight gain. Sometimes called Hashimoto's disease or Hashimoto's Thyroid disease is marked by a noticeable autoimmune disorder.
Hypothyroidism with concurrent Lyme disease. Paparone PW(1). Author information: (1)Lyme Disease Center for South Jersey, Absecon 08201, USA. Lyme disease can be seen as localized, disseminated, acute, or chronic and can mimic other, more serious diseases. Even though it is a multisystemic illness, very few spirochetes are present; yet, once established in the host, it can persist for years.
Hypothyroidism is common in people with chronic illnesses such as Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, and can be a major cause of symptoms in people with tick-borne infections. Often it occurs concurrently with adrenal insufficiency and is a direct result of it. 
Hashimoto's affects 28 million Americans and is the most common autoimmune disease in the world. It can lead to the symptoms of hypothyroidism which include: fatigue, depression, weight gain, constipation, insomnia, dry and brittle nails, cold hands & feet, hair loss, arthritis, brain fog, andnumbness/tingling. Many of these symptoms are similar to Lyme disease and its co-infections. High doses of iodine are being used by some practitioners to treat Lyme disease and thyroid disorders. Iodine is an excellent anti-microbial but it can also have devastating affects on autoimmune disease including Hashimoto's.
Lyme can certainly mess up your thyroid. Thyroid problems are listed in the symptoms of lyme disease and co-infections -- see the symptom lists in the sticky New to Lyme? .... Fibromyalgia is also a symptom. 
Lyme disease can have devastating effects on the body and can trigger autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. The bacteria borrelia burgdorferi has been found to cross-react with thyroid tissue which triggers the autoimmunity by what is known as molecular mimicry. High doses of iodine are being used by some practitioners to treat Lyme disease and thyroid disorders. Iodine is an excellent anti-microbial but it can also have devastating affects on autoimmune disease including Hashimoto's.

I don’t know of any research studies which confirm that Lyme Disease can lead to a thyroid or autoimmune thyroid condition. However, this disease can affect the endocrine system, as well as other systems of the body, and I know some people with Lyme Disease who developed thyroid conditions. But whether they would have developed problems with the thyroid gland even if they didn’t become infected with B. burgdorferi is unknown. With regards to autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Graves’ Disease and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, it is possible that Lyme Disease can trigger an autoimmune response. But as you know, other factors can also lead to an autoimmune condition
Before I discuss the possible connection between Lyme Disease and thyroid conditions, I want to briefly talk more about Lyme Disease itself. Some of the symptoms associated with this condition include fever, headache, muscle pain, stiff neck, fatigue, itching, light-headedness, and/or a bulls-eye rash. But whether they would have developed problems with the thyroid gland even if they didn’t become infected with B. burgdorferi is unknown. With regards to autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Graves’ Disease and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, it is possible that Lyme Disease can trigger an autoimmune response.
