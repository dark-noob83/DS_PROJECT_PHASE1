Beta cell: A type of cell in the pancreas. Within the pancreas, the beta cells are located in areas called the islets of Langerhans where they constitute the predominant type of cell. The beta cells make and release insulin, a hormone that controls the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood.
beta cells, 1 insulin-producing cells situated in the islets of Langerhans. Their insulin-producing function tends to accelerate the movement of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids out of the blood and into the cellular cytoplasm, countering glucagon function of alpha cells.
Pancreatic beta cell: A type of cell in the pancreas that makes insulin. The pancreas is a fish-shaped organ that stretches across the back of the abdomen behind the stomach. Within the pancreas there are areas that are called the islets of Langerhans.
Beta cells (β cells) are a type of cell found in the pancreatic islets of the pancreas.
Beta cell regeneration. Researchers and physicians are studying how to regenerate beta cells in the lab and within the pancreas, which may lead to new treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Beta cell dysfunction is a characteristic of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells — insulin-producing cells found in the pancreas — are destroyed, while in type 2 diabetes, they may not produce enough insulin. Since it's not possible today to generate new, patient-specific, functional beta cells, people with type 1 diabetes need insulin therapy.
Beta cells in type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells die from a misguided attack by the body’s immune system. How and why that happens is not clear, but the results of a study published in early 2011 suggest that these pancreatic cells become stressed at the earliest stages of the disease process.
