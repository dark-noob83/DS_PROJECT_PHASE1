A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun, as seen from Earth. Totality during such an eclipse can only be seen from a very small area on Earth. This area is usually about 100 miles (160 kms) wide and 10,000 miles (16,100 kms) long.
The orbit of the Moon around Earth is inclined about 5.1° to Earth's orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at two points or nodes. If New Moon takes place within about 17° of a node[ 1 ], then a solar eclipse will be visible from some location on Earth.
Types of Solar Eclipses. 1  Total Solar Eclipses occur when the umbra of the Moon's shadow touches a region on the surface of the Earth. 2  Partial Solar Eclipses occur when the penumbra of the Moon's shadow passes over a region on the Earth's surface.
Because the Moon's orbit with respect to the Sun has a mean duration of 29.53 days, there will always be one and possibly two solar eclipses during each 34.5-day interval when the Sun passes through the nodal eclipse zones. These time periods are called eclipse seasons.

1 Partial Solar Eclipses occur when the penumbra of the Moon's shadow passes over a region on the Earth's surface. 2  Annular Solar Eclipses occur when a region on the Earth's surface is in line with the umbra, but the distances are such that the tip of the umbra does not reach
