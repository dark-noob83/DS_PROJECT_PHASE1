There seems to be a relationship between the two events – price changes and amounts mined. Fluorspar’s price per ton increased 287% from 1996 to 2012, using average fluorspar acid prices for the year provided by the USGS in their reports (from $141 per ton in 1996 to $545 per ton in the first quarter 2012). This is an average annual increase of 22%. And, the fluorspar mine production went from 4,090,000 metric tons in 1996 to 6,850,000 metric tons in 2012, a 5% per year increase. USGS estimates 240,000,000 metric tons fluorspar in mining company’s reserves (
60 FLUORSPAR (Data in thousand metric tons unless otherwise noted) Domestic Production and Use: There was little or no domestic mining of fluorspar in 2006. Government Stockpile: During fiscal year 2006, the Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC) sold about 24,700 tons (27,200 short dry tons) of metallurgical-grade fluorspar and 4,420 tons (4,870 short dry tons) of acid-grade fluorspar from the National Defense Stockpile.
In industry, fluorspar ore must contain enough of the mineral fluorite (CaF 2), usually more than 20 percent, to be of commercial interest. Fluorite is 48.7 percent fluorine and 51.3 percent calcium. Its industrial value is due mostly to the fluorine content, and it is the chief source of that element. Fluorspar production from Africa through 1976 totals about 3.5 million metric tons. Approximately 88 percent of this total was produced since 1960, and 80 percent originated in South Africa. In 1976, about 83 percent of African fluorspar production was exported.
Attending representatives expected the market price of fluorite ore will be over RMB 3,000 per ton in May ... We believe a program to more efficiently use China's scarce fluorite resources will be an advantage to everyone. Rising prices for our fluorite products will generate greater benefits and further increase ... Dear Fellow Shareholders and Potential Investors, processing plant has become operational with a 200,000-ton fluorite ore processing and over 76,000 tons of fluorite powder capacity using an average grade of ore 63% versus ... 2010, fluorite prices were RMB 950 per ...
Events, Trends, and Issues: Fluorspar prices, particularly those for acid grade fluorspar, continued to decline in 2014. Prices of metallurgical grade fluorspar remained stable. Price declines were largely the consequence of continued global surplus in fluorspar stocks and downstream fluorochemicals. (Data in thousand metric tons unless otherwise noted). Domestic Production and Use: In 2014, minimal fluorspar (calcium fluoride) was produced in the United States.
Attending representatives expected the market price of fluorite ore will be over RMB 3,000 per ton in May, and they also provided a briefing on each respective company's recent developments and outlook. Last year, due to the insufficient cash flow of its operations, Xiangzhen's signed sales orders at fixed sales prices and received cash more than 3 months in advance from customers. Therefore, the Company did not receive any benefit from the increase in the market price of fluorite ores.
Although the market price of fluorite ore increased from approximately $118 per ton at the beginning of 2010 to $295 per ton by the end of 2010, Xiangzhen's average selling price for fluorite powder was only $163.78 per ton. However, Xiangzhen can fully benefit from this year's price increase. Last year, due to the insufficient cash flow of its operations, Xiangzhen's signed sales orders at fixed sales prices and received cash more than 3 months in advance from customers. Therefore, the Company did not receive any benefit from the increase in the market price of fluorite ores.

The quantity of fluorine present in phosphate rock deposits is enormous. Current U.S. reserves of phosphate rock are estimated to be 1.0 billion tons, which at 3.5% fluorine would contain 35 million tons of fluorine, equivalent to about 72 million tons of fluorspar. Government Stockpile: During fiscal year 2006, the Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC) sold about 24,700 tons (27,200 short dry tons) of metallurgical-grade fluorspar and 4,420 tons (4,870 short dry tons) of acid-grade fluorspar from the National Defense Stockpile.
