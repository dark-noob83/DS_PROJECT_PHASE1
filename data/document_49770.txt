Since, the upper leaf blade is directly faced to the sun, the rate of transpiration increases. Hence, to prevent excessive transpiration, stomata are more in lower surface i.e. relatively less transpiration happens from the lower epidermis. Plants also remove water in the form of (liquid), this is guttation. Stomata has no influence on this process.
Best Answer: Plant undergoes a process called transpiration. Transpiration is the removal of water (vapour) from the upper parts of the plant (stem, leaves). The opening and closing of stomata have huge influence on the rate of
Why does the lower epidermis of leaf contains more stomata than upper epidermis?   Because the top of the leaf is covered by the cuticle of the leaf which prevents water loss and transpiration. If there were stomata in the top of the leaf, more water w … old be lost and the plant would wilt.

It is the stomata that makes the main difference between upper and lower epidermis of leaves. Animals possess skin as their outer most cover of the body. Similar to that, plants have a layer called epidermis as their outermost cover.
The upper epidermis is responsible for preventing water loss by evaporation. It does this by having a waxy cuticle on the top of the leaf. The lower epidermis has stomata, whi … ch allow gases to enter and leave the leaf as a result of photosynthesis and respiration.
