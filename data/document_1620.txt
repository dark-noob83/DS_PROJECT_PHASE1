Dmitri Mendeleev. Dmitri Mendeleev was a Russian scientist who is best known for creating the Periodic Table of elements. He was born in Siberia in 1834 into a large and reasonably well-off family.
His life... Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834~1907), accessed 15th February, 2013. Mendeleev was born in Tobolsk (in Siberia), Russia on February 7th, 1834, and was the youngest of a family of 10~17 children (the exact number is disputed). The process of writing and developing this textbook was what had led Mendeleev to his most famous discovery; the discovery of the Periodic Table and the Periodic Law (1869). Mendeleev had 2 wives. His first wife, Feozva Nikitchna Lascheva, was suggested to him by his sister, Olga.
Mendeleev graduated on time and was awarded the medal of excellence for being first in his class.

His doctor suggested that he had tuberculosis and that, at most, he had two years to live providing he moved to a more suitable climate. Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907). Born in Siberia, the last of at least 14 children, Dmitri Mendeleev revolutionized our understanding of the properties of atoms and created a table that probably adorns every chemistry classroom in the world.
Lothar Meyer, for example, had proposed a rough periodic table in 1864 and by 1868 had devised one that was very similar to Mendeleev’s, but he did not publish it until 1870. John Newlands published a periodic table in 1865. His father died when Mendeleev was just 13 and the glass factory burned down when he was 15. Aged 16, he moved to Saint Petersburg, which was then Russia’s capital city. He won a place at his father’s old college, in part because the head of the college had known his father.
At this point the family included Maria, Dmitri, and Elizabeth (Dmitri's older sister). In Moscow, they entered a climate of considerable political unrest, which made the university reluctant to admit anyone from outside of Moscow. Mendeleev was rejected. Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907).

1 Thus the atomic weight of tellurium must lie between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128. ( 2 Tellurium's atomic mass is 127.6, and Mendeleev was incorrect in his assumption that atomic mass must increase with position within a period. In 1907, Mendeleev died at the age of 72 in Saint Petersburg from influenza. The crater Mendeleev on the Moon, as well as element number 101, the radioactive mendelevium, are named after him.
Early Life and Education. Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was born February 8, 1834 in Verkhnie Aremzyani, in the Russian province of Siberia. His family was unusually large: he may have had as many as 16 brothers and sisters, although the exact number is uncertain. His father died when Mendeleev was just 13 and the glass factory burned down when he was 15. Aged 16, he moved to Saint Petersburg, which was then Russia’s capital city. He won a place at his father’s old college, in part because the head of the college had known his father.
Mendeleev is thought to be the youngest of either 11, 13, 14 or 17 siblings; the exact number differs among sources. His father was a teacher of fine arts, politics and philosophy. Unfortunately for the family's financial well being, his father became blind and lost his teaching position. In 1907, Mendeleev died at the age of 72 in Saint Petersburg from influenza. The crater Mendeleev on the Moon, as well as element number 101, the radioactive mendelevium, are named after him.
