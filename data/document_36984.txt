The device picks up echoes of the sound waves as they bounce off the different parts of your heart. 1 Check the ability of your heart chambers to pump blood (cardiac performance). 2  During an echocardiogram, your doctor can calculate how much blood your heart is pumping during each heartbeat (ejection fraction). 3  You might have a low ejection fraction if you have heart failure.
An echocardiogram can cost you a lot. A standard echocardiogram can cost $1,000 to $2,000, and a TEE can cost $2,000 or more, according to costhelper.com.

An echocardiogram (echo=sound + card=heart + gram=drawing) is an ultrasound test that can evaluate the structures of the heart, as well as the direction of blood flow within it.
An echocardiogram (echo) is a test that uses high frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to make pictures of your heart. The test is also called echocardiography or diagnostic cardiac ultrasound. Quick facts. 1  An echo uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart’s chambers, valves, walls and the blood vessels (aorta, arteries, veins) attached to your heart. 2  A probe called a transducer is passed over your chest.
1 An Echo with a Doppler will usually cost $500 – $800 extra. 2  A transesophageal echocardiogram cost is anywhere from $1000-$1,700, possibly more due to prescriptions used for anesthesia. 3  A transthoracic echocardiogram will range from $1,000 to $1,500. 4  Depending on the geographical location, the costs can vary as well. 1 A transthoracic echocardiogram will range from $1,000 to $1,500. 2  Depending on the geographical location, the costs can vary as well. 3  San Francisco hospitals have an average of $2,100 while a hospital in Seattle has an average of $1,500.
