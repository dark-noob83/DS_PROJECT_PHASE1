Life in the Open Ocean. The open ocean, called the pelagic zone, is the largest area of the marine ecosystem. It reaches from coasts to the middle of the ocean. The living things that survive in the open ocean need to have a way to float or swim in ocean water.
Organisms are also more abundant where there are more nutrients: in the neritic, where nutrients wash off the land, and in upwelling zones, where relatively cold nutrient-rich waters from the deep ocean rise to the surface. Pelagic life is dominated by plankton, mostly tiny organisms that move with water currents.
1 Life in the Intertidal Zone-Where the ocean meets the land, hardy animals, plants, and algae make their homes between the low tide and high tide levels. 2  Life in the Open Ocean The largest area of the marine ecosystem, the open ocean is home to swimming fish, drifting plankton, and other creatures.
The open ocean or pelagic zone is the largest area of the marine ecosystem and contains a diverse environment of life. Although the pelagic zone has the greatest volume and vertical range of any life zone, it is only home to about 10% of all marine species.
