(haha). Getting the information out of our heads so we can use it is a pretty important part of memory. There are basically two main types of retrieval; recognition and recall. Recognition: is the process of matching a fact or concept with one already in memory. You are given a cue and just have to recognize the right answer. Multiple choice quizzes test your ability to use recognition.
Retrieval. The last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval, which is the conscious recollection of information that was encoded. Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon contextual information or cues and whether the information was encoded and stored into memory.
Semantic information retrieval method have exploited the advantages of the semantic web to retrieve the relevant data. It outperforms VSM, the classic information retrieval method and demonstrates promising performance improvements over other semantic information retrieval methods in retrieval.
Episodic memory refers to the memory of an event or “episode.” Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the recent or distant past (remote memories). Episodic memories include various details about these events, such as what happened, when it happened and where it happened.
