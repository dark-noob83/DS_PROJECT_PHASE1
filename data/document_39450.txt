Mix together the oats, water and salt in a microwave-bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute and 45 seconds. Stir immediately after cooking. If you're adding dried fruit, brown sugar or anything else to the oatmeal, stir it in as soon as the cooking time is done.
1 To make quick-cooking oats or instant oatmeal in the microwave, add 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water and ½ cup (40 grams) of oatmeal into a heat-safe bowl and microwave for 1 ½ minute to 2 minutes.
1 Place 2/3 cup chilled cooked oatmeal in a microwave-safe bowl. 2  Microwave, covered with waxed paper, on 100 percent power (high) for 50 to 60 seconds or until heated, stirring once. 3  Slow cooker oatmeal: In a 3-1/2- or 4-quart slow cooker combine 6 cups water, 2 cups steel-cut oats, and 1 teaspoon salt.
1 Mix 1/2 cup of steel cut oats with 2 cups of water in an 8 cup bowl (the size of the bowl is important as it must be large enough to allow the oats to bubble up without spilling over). 2  Microwave covered (I use a paper plate) for 5 minutes on high. 3  Stir. 4  Finish cooking for another 5 minutes.
Combine the oats and 1/4 cup of the water and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup more water and microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup water and microwave on high for 4 more minutes, stirring after every minute. Let the oatmeal set 1 minute before serving.
Microwave the uncovered bowl on High heat for 1-2 minutes. Or until the oatmeal begins to thicken. If the oatmeal is about to boil over, stop the microwave and take it out.
Tip: For creamier oatmeal, add the oats to the pan along with the water and salt. 1  Microwave: For one serving, in a medium microwave-safe bowl combine 1 cup water, 1/2 cup quick-cooking oats, and a dash of salt. 2  Microwave on 100 percent power (high) for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes. 3  Stir before serving.
