Naruto is the name used for a type of ramen topping called kamaboko. Kamaboko is pureed white fish that is formed in a loaf and then steamed. Naruto is the kind of kamaboko … that is sliced to form a spiral, it is called this since because of the Naruo whirlpools in the city of Naruto Japan.
I think they describe me best. The name Naruto means steamed fish-paste cake. The name 'Naruto' can mean 'steamed fish-paste cake.' Also, Naruto can mean 'maelstrom' which is a large or violent whirlpool. From Masashi Kishimoto's 'Naruto,' though, the name is most likely the latter of the two possibilities.
