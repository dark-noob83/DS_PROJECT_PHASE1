In humans, cells that do not produce gametes are collectively  called somatic cells. Somatic cells do not include sperm and ova,  the cells from which they are made, and und â€¦ ifferentiated stem  cells.
This event is called fertilization. The male gametes produced by animals and some plants (e.g., club mosses, horsetails, ferns) are called spermatozoa (plural of spermatozoon), or simply sperm. Their female gametes are called ova (plural of ovum). Ova are often called eggs. Most plants produce male gametes called pollen grains.
Unlike animals, plants have multicellular haploid and multicellular diploid stages in their life cycle. Gametes develop from the multicellular haploid gametophytes (Greek phyton, plant). Fertilization gives rise to a multicellular, diploid sporophyte that produces haploid spores via meiosis.

Plants which produce their gametes in flowers are called: antheridium, gymnosperms, angiosperms, or vascular. They are called angiosperms.
1 Other plants of the same species have flowers that are only female-they have only carpels. 2  Monoecious plants: Some flowers on a plant are only male; other flowers on the same plant are only female. 3  So, self pollination is avoided by a difference in the timing of their development.
Flowering plants have gametes, which are the haploid sex cells. The sperm (male gamete) are found in the pollen on top of the anther. The eggs (female gamete) are located deep in a ovule usually in the center of the flower.
