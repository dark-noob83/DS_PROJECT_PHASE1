The prevention of osteoporosis should start in early old age, to prevent a decrease in bone density in the future. The prevention of osteoporosis should begin young adults, to increase the bone mass to provide additional protection from osteoporosis.
Intramembranous ossification: Is the process of bone formation in which the mesenchyme differentiated directly into the bone, example, is the flat bones of the skull. In this process, the mesenchyme first differentiates in to osteoblasts (boneâ€“forming cell) which then begins to deposits osteoid (unmineralized matrix). Thereafter the osteoblasts deposit calcium phosphate into the osteoid tissue, and the osteoid then is converted into bone.
Before the extracellular matrix is calcified, the tissue is called osteoid (bone-like) tissue. When the concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions rise high enough, they are deposited into the extracellular matrix, and the bone calcifies.
The latest step in this evolutionary path is the use of three-dimensional scanning and printing (stereo lithography) for fabricating personalized three-dimensional orthosis.
Like cartilage, and other types of connective tissue, bone is made up of Cells and Extracellular matrix : Cells-which in bone are called osteoblasts and osteocytes, (osteo-bone).
Osteomalacia. This incomplete calcification of bone occurs in adults where deficient calcification of newly formed bone occurs, partial decalcification of older matrix, and decreased Ca per unit of bone matrix.
This process occurs in the primary ossification center and is a combo or resorption and formation, increased density of bone along outer margin, and formation of marrow cavity.
7. Skeletal System: Bone Structure and Function For the next two chapters (7 and 9) we will study the skeletal system. Although the majorfeature of this system is the bones, the skeletal system also consists of cartilage, ligaments,tendons, and other structures that hold the bones together and stabilize them.
