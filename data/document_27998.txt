Afferent neurons are typically sensory neurons--neurons which send information to the brain an … d spine. They send information about the body and immediate environment. Efferent neurons are typically motor neurons, sending information from the brain and spine to the rest of the body. They allow the main control system a way to act on the body.
Afferent neurons are peripheral neurons that collect information from the body and transmit it TOWARD the central nervous system. Efferent neurons are other peripheral neuron … s that transmit information AWAY from the central nervous system. Another way to distinguish these two is to think of afferent nerves as 'approaching' the brain (A) and efferent nerves as 'exiting' the brain (E). Interneurons are relay neurons and their signals, connecting efferent and afferent neurons in network. They can link up the same types or different types of neurons, meaning connecting sensory neurons together, motor neurons together, or the different types together
The opposite direction of neural activity is afferent conduction. In the nervous system there is a closed loop system of sensation, decision, and reactions. This process is carried out through the activity of afferent neurons (sensory neurons), interneurons, and efferent neurons (motor neurons). The motor nerves are efferent nerves involved in muscular control. The cell body of the efferent neuron is connected to a single, long axon and several shorter dendrites projecting out of the cell body itself.
The neuron is a single nerve cell, and you have billions of them. There are three basic types of neurons: association, afferent, and efferent. The association neurons comprise the central nervous system (CNS) that is the brain and spinal cord. The afferent neurons are also known as the sensory neurons: they bring the stimuli from the sensors (e.g., skin, eyes, ears) to the CNS.
Confidence votes 4.9K. A motor neuron is an efferent neuron as it 'sends out' a signal as opposed to sensory nerves which are afferent and relay information from the periphery towards the central nervous system. They send information about the body and immediate environment. Efferent neurons are typically motor neurons, sending information from the brain and spine to the rest of the body. They allow the main control system a way to act on the body.

This process is carried out through the activity of afferent neurons (sensory neurons), interneurons, and efferent neurons (motor neurons). Afferent neurons' somas are located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, and the axons of these cells travel from ganglion to ganglion and lead back to the spinal cord. The majority of these are unipolar neurons in that they have a single axon leaving the cell body and is sent towards the sensory organ.
(April 2014). In the peripheral nervous system, an afferent nerve fiber is the nerve fiber (axon) of an afferent neuron (sensory neuron). It is a long process (projection) extending far from the nerve cell body that carries nerve impulses from sensory receptors or sense organs toward the central nervous system. Afferent neurons' somas are located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, and the axons of these cells travel from ganglion to ganglion and lead back to the spinal cord. The majority of these are unipolar neurons in that they have a single axon leaving the cell body and is sent towards the sensory organ.
