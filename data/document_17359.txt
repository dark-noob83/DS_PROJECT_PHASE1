The nutrients created by the dead organisms are returned to the soil to be later used by the producers. Once these deceased organisms are returned to the soil, they are used as food by bacteria and fungi by transforming the complex organic materials into simpler nutrients.
they are basically organisms that eat organic matter, while helping the matter decompose. an example of a detritivore would be a worm, as they eat decomposing matter and help â€¦ make healthy and rich soil. A detritivore is an organism that feeds on decaying material, and takes it in to digest it (like humans do).
Decomposers such as bacteria and fungi cause decay at a microscopic level. Other larger organisms, called detritivores detritivore: An organism that feeds on dead organisms and waste eg earthworm. , help speed up decay by feeding on detritus detritus: Particulate matter formed by the decay or disintegration of an organic substance. . This is dead and decaying material.
Some of the species considered detritivores are snails, slugs, termites and earthworms. Decomposers such as fungi and bacteria are often referred to as detritivous organisms.. When these organisms help to break down other organisms, they return the nutrients to the soil for the producers to use.
When plants and animals die, they become food for decomposers like bacteria, fungi and earthworms. Decomposers or saprotrophs recycle dead plants and animals into chemical nutrients like carbon and nitrogen that are released back into the soil, air and water. Bacteria can be found everywhere. They live in the water, in the air and on land.
