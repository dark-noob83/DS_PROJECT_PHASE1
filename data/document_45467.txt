A labelled diagram of Amoeba proteus can be seen above. The pseudopodia are the most defined structures of A. proteus and part of what makes the organism so fascinating. These “false feet” are used for movement and to engulf prey (see Nutrition for further detail) – making it an essential part of its structure. As the amoeba moves towards its prey, its pseudopods reach out and engulf the prey. The formation of pseudopodia can be explained by change in viscosity (sol-gel theory).

The typical type of movement that an Amoeba exhibits is also called amoeba-like movement. The entire process is dependent on its anatomy and is based on a scientific theory, known as Sol-Gel theory. You first need to study the Sol-Gel theory in order to understand its movement. It is interesting to know how an amoeba moves itself because the process is completely different from normal locomotion process of other living beings. An amoeba propels itself by changing the structure of its body. Basically it's the cytoplasm and its variation in composition that aid in locomotion of the organism. Amoeba also extends the sides of its body to give rise to special structures known as pseudopodia, which enable it to drag itself
Structure of an Amoeba: unicellular animal with pseudopods that lives in fresh or saltwater. Pseudopodium: part of the amoeba used for locomotion. Ectoplasm: vitreous superficial layer of an amoeba. Endoplasm: central part of an amoeba. Cell membrane: membrane covering an amoeba. Contractile vacuole: cavity of the amoeba that is able to contract. Food vacuole: cavity of the amoeba responsible for digestion. Nucleus: central organelle for an amoeba.
Acanthamoeba. An amoeba (also ameba, amoeba amœba or) amoeboid is a type of cell or organism which has the ability to alter its, shape primarily by extending and retracting. Pseudopods amoebae do not form a single taxonomic, group but are found in every major lineage of eukaryotic. organisms Microbiologists often use the terms amoeboid and amoebae interchangeably for any organism that exhibits amoeboid movement. In older classification systems, most amoebae were placed in the class or subphylum Sarcodina, a grouping of single-celled organisms that possess pseudopods or move by protoplasmic flow.
Amoeboid movement is the most common mode of locomotion in Eukaryotic cells. It is a crawling-like type of movement accomplished by protrusion of cytoplasm of the cell involving the formation of pseudopodia. The cytoplasm slides and forms a pseudopodium in front to move the cell forward. This type of movement is observed in amoeboids, slime molds and some protozoans such as Naegleria gruberi, as well as some cells in humans such as leukocytes. Sarcomas, or cancers arising from connective tissue cells, are particularly adept at amoeboid movement, thus leading to their high rate of metastasis.
An amoeba (also ameba, amoeba amœba or) amoeboid is a type of cell or organism which has the ability to alter its, shape primarily by extending and retracting. pseudopods Microbiologists often use the terms amoeboid and amoebae interchangeably for any organism that exhibits amoeboid movement. In older classification systems, most amoebae were placed in the class or subphylum Sarcodina, a grouping of single-celled organisms that possess pseudopods or move by protoplasmic flow.
The appearance and internal structure of pseudopods are used to distinguish groups of amoebae from one another. Amoebozoan species, such as those in the genus Amoeba, typically have bulbous (lobose) pseudopods, rounded at the ends and roughly tubular in cross-section. Microbiologists often use the terms amoeboid and amoebae interchangeably for any organism that exhibits amoeboid movement. In older classification systems, most amoebae were placed in the class or subphylum Sarcodina, a grouping of single-celled organisms that possess pseudopods or move by protoplasmic flow.
The protozoa you will observe today is called the amoeba. An amoeba is unicellular and moves by using pseudopods. A pseudopod is a temporary bulge that forms in the cell membrane as a result of the movement of the cytoplasm. The word pseduopod means false foot.. The pseudopod has two functions, or uses: 1. to move, 2. to capture food. (Note: in the picture the cytoplasm is called the plasmasol and the cell membrane is called the plasma membrane.) Because the amoeba uses pseudopods to move and capture food, it is classified as a sarcodine. A sarcodine is a protozoan that uses pseudopods. Example of a pseudopod in an amoeba.
Amoeba Amoebas are sarcodines, which are protists that move and feed by forming pseudopods. Amoebas live either in water or soil and feed on bacteria and smaller protists in the surroundings. Click a button below to explore the parts of an amoeba.
