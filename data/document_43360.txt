If you want to avoid fat, select lean ground beef to prepare your patties. For example, an average patty made with 95 percent lean ground beef has about 5 grams of fat, while a patty made with regular ground beef has up to 12 grams of fat for the same serving.
A patty made from lean meat contains 35 percent of its calories from fat and 62 percent of its calories from protein, while 60 percent of the calories are supplied by fat and 38 percent by protein in a patty made from regular ground beef.

As far as concentration, there is 225 mg potassium in 100 gm of meat for bottom round beef to 459 mg for ground beef, 95% lean meat. The least amount of potassium is in fat which is 99 mg in 100 gm of fat. The average amount of potassium in beef is about 323 mg in 3 1/2 oz (100 gm) of meat.

The average fast food single-patty plain hamburger contains 378 milligrams of sodium. That's 16 percent of the daily 2,300-milligram limit. If you follow a low-sodium diet, you shouldn't have more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium each day, so that hamburger is 25 percent of your limit.
