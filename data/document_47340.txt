A diptych (pronounced dip’tik) was originally a pair of paintings hinged together. Frequently used as alter pieces or of an ornamental nature, they were often of religious origin. In modern art the diptych is often just a pair of images which reflect a common story or theme in each image.
A diptych is a combination of two images placed immediately next to each other to make an artistic statement or comparison. The photographs can be identical or they can be different; there are no hard and fast rules – they simply have to be next to each other.
Photography is about visual communication: sharing stories, ideas, and feelings through images. A diptych of two images, or parts of two images, is an impactful storytelling tool. Look for thematic, compositional, and other visual synergies that will make your diptychs more powerful than the sum of their parts.

As a format, one image file with two pictures is a diptych. For the photographic diptych format to work there has to be some form of commonality between the pictures in the image. They normally share some aesthetic, subject, colour, theme or form.
