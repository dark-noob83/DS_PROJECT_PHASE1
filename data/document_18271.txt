Google figures that when one page links to another page, it is effectively casting a vote for the other page. The more votes that are cast for a page, the more important the page must be. http://bloggin.gs/what-is-google-page... 
PageRank is a link analysis algorithm applied by Google.com that assigns a number or rank to each hyperlinked web page within the World Wide Web. The basic purpose of PageRank is to list web pages from the most important to the least important, reflecting on a search engine results page when a keyword search occurs. The basic process involves PageRank evaluating all of the links to a particular web page. PageRank was developed at Stanford University in 1995, in order to create an algorithm for Google that would allow the website to rank all web pages based on merit and not on Meta Tags because of the spamdexing abuse and other unscrupulous actions.
Google’s Definition: PageRank As Votes. Let’s start with what Google says. In a nutshell, it considers links to be like votes. In addition, it considers that some votes are more important than others. PageRank is Google’s system of counting link votes and determining which pages are most important based on them. 
PageRank or PR(A) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web. What that means to us is that we can just go ahead and calculate a page’s PR without knowing the final value of the PR of the other pages. PageRank or PR(A) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web. but that’s not too helpful so let’s break it down into sections. 1  PR(Tn) - Each page has a notion of its own self-importance.
PageRank or PR(A) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web. What that means to us is that we can just go ahead and calculate a page s PR without knowing the final value of the PR of the other pages.

Within the PageRank algorithm, the PageRank of a page T is always weighted by the number of outbound links C(T) on page T. This means that the more outbound links a page T has, the less will page A benefit from a link to it on page T. The weighted PageRank of pages Ti is then added up. So, first of all, we see that PageRank does not rank web sites as a whole, but is determined for each page individually. Further, the PageRank of page A is recursively defined by the PageRanks of those pages which link to page A.
PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. According to Google: PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites
PageRank is what Google uses to determine the importance of a web page. It's one of many factors used to determine which pages appear in search results. PageRank is also sometimes referred to by the slang term Google juice.. PageRank measure's a web page's importance. Page and Brin's theory is that the most important pages on the Internet are the pages with the most links leading to them.
PageRank has a number of different uses now that it is just one of hundreds of algorithms that Google.com employs to rank web pages. The Google Toolbar has a version of PageRank that features a smaller version of the algorithm. PageRank was developed at Stanford University in 1995, in order to create an algorithm for Google that would allow the website to rank all web pages based on merit and not on Meta Tags because of the spamdexing abuse and other unscrupulous actions.
