‘Adam’ walked the Earth 209,000 years ago: UK scientists claim the first man lived 9,000 years earlier than previously thought. 1  To calculate age of the Y chromosome, researchers multiplied data on age fathers have their first child with the number of mutations they uncovered. Our most common male ancestor, ‘Adam’, has finally got his original birthdate – and its 9,000 years earlier than scientists believed. UK researchers claim that ‘Adam’ walked the earth 209,000 years ago, contradicting a recent study that suggested the Y chromosome predated humanity. Their findings puts 'Adam' within the timeframe of his other half 'Eve', the genetic maternal ancestor of mankin
Modern Humans, Homo Sapiens Sapiens, have been on the earth at least 200,000 years...This has been confirmed by DNA research...The first Human migrations out of Africa started … around 100,000 years ago. How long ago did the first human walk on earth? According to the latest discoveries and theories, the genus Homo first came on the scene 2.3 to 2.4 million years ago, while the species Homo sapiens came into being 250,000 t … o 4
By about 40,000 years ago, Homo sapiens had evolved into modern human beings, Homo sapiens sapiens (wise, wise man). In 1868, the first fossils of modern Homo sapiens sapiens were found in Cro-Magnon caves in southwest France, which gave that name to all early Homo sapiens sapiens. 
When did the first man walk on the earth? Those who read the second creation account in Genesis literally, say that the first man on Earth, Adam, lived about six thousand years ago. Scientists say that the first tru … e humans, members of our own species, Homo sapiens. lived more than 200,000 years ago and that our earliest hominid ancestors lived around seven million years ago.   Not quite 7000 years ago. If the time were shown as a clock then it would be about 23.59pm. 
All people today are classified as Homo sapiens. Our species of humans first began to evolve nearly 200,000 years ago in association with technologies not unlike those of the early Neandertals. It is now clear that early Homo sapiens, or modern humans, did not come after the Neandertals but were their contemporaries.

But a study of 69 men from around the world found ‘Y-chromosomal Adam’ walked the Earth between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago, much earlier than previously believed. It places him nearer to Eve who was around 99,000 to 148,000 years ago the analysis found.

Credit: NASA Earth Observatory/NOAA NGDC. While our ancestors have been around for about six million years, the modern form of humans only evolved about 200,000 years ago. Civilization as we know it is only about 6,000 years old, and industrialization started in the earnest only in the 1800s. Our species was distinguished about 200,000 years ago and managed to survive and thrive despite climate change at the time. While we started in temperate climates, about 60,000 to 80,000 years ago the first humans began straying outside of the continent in which our species was born.
do you really believe adam was the first man. that makes the earth less than 7,000 years old, well I'm sorry but what abut the agricultural revolution of 10,000 bc that took place in ancient mesopotamia, greece, and ancient britain. Humans began differentiating into different races probably about 40 - 50,000 years ago. Early Hominids split off the family tree from the rest of the great apes about 5 - 6 million
