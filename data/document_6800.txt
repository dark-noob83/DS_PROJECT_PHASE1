Taxonomy (from Greek taxis meaning arrangement or division and nomos meaning law) is the science of classification according to a pre-determined system, with the resulting catalog used to provide a conceptual framework for discussion, analysis, or information retrieval.
subspecies, race - (biology) a taxonomic group that is a division of a species; usually arises as a consequence of geographical isolation within a species.
monotype - (biology) a taxonomic group with a single member (a single species or genus). species - (biology) taxonomic group whose members can interbreed. subspecies, race - (biology) a taxonomic group that is a division of a species; usually arises as a consequence of geographical isolation within a species. var.
, variant, strain, form - (biology) a group of organisms within a species that differ in trivial ways from similar groups; a new strain of microorganisms. type - (biology) the taxonomic group whose characteristics are used to define the next higher taxon. group Pteridospermae, group Pteridospermaphyta, Pteridospermae, Pteridospermaphyta-used in some classification systems: a group of extinct fossil gymnosperms coextensive with the order Cycadofilicales.
So, the summary: the fossil record is biased. Of course it is, and it would be stupid to deny it. But this bias is pretty well-known and can be predicted and tested for in any data set, so its existence is not a problem for palaeontological analyses, as long as it’s acknowledged.
In theory, the development of a good taxonomy takes into account the importance of separating elements of a group (taxon) into subgroups (taxa) that are mutually exclusive, unambiguous, and taken together, include all possibilities. In practice, a good taxonomy should be simple, easy to remember, and easy to use.
Bloom’s taxonomy is a classification system used to define and distinguish different levels of human cognition—i.e., thinking, learning, and understanding.
