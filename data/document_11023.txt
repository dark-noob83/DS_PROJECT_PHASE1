Chromosomes are organized structures of DNA and proteins that are found in cells. A chromosome is a singular piece of DNA, which contains many genes, regulatory elements and other nucleotide sequences. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which control its functions.
A chromosome is a structure that is made of a chemical known as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA as well as protein. Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of cells. Chromosomes contain many genes. A gene is a molecular unit of heredity.
The difference between DNA and a chromosome has to deal with an intermediary-genes. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, which is a nucleic acid. It is made up of four bases-adenin … e, cytosine, guanine and thymine. When these four bases are arranged in a segment, it is called a gene.
One set is inherited from the father, and one set is inherited from the mother. A DNA is a sort of a bio molecule. The entire DNA in cells can be found in individual pieces that are called chromosomes. The main difference between DNA and chromosome is regarding the role of genes. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. The DNA is basically made up of cytosine, adenine, thymine and guanine. When you arrange these four bases to create a particular segment, it is called a gene.
The difference between a chromosome and a DNA molecule is that a chromosome is a single DNA molecule associated with proteins and a DNA molecule is a long thin molecule that s … tores genetic information.
