Best Answer: It depends on the sorority. Most social sororities are very expensive. There is not typically any financial help, as it is not considered part of a colleges tuition, room/board, or books. You don't NEED to be in a sorority and it's not like athletics where there are scholarships. Being a part of a sorority is not cheap. I went to a very small school and my dues were $60 a month (and that was almost 10 years ago so I can't imagine what it would be now). And I've never heard of any sort of financial aid for it
