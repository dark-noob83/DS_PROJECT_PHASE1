A. Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dl) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females.
Normal range of serum creatinine level will differ with age, gender and physical constitute. In adult men, normal range of serum creatinine is 0.9-1.3mg/dl; while in adult women, normal range of creatinine is 0.6 to 1.1mg/dl.
Women usually have lower results on the serum creatinine test because they have a lower muscle mass in their bodies. The average range for women is between 0.6 and 1.1 mg/dL and for men it increases to between 0.7 and 1.3 mg/dL.
The kidneys maintain the blood creatinine in a normal range. Creatinine has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. Elevated creatinine level signifies impaired kidney function or kidney disease.
The creatinine levels in both urine and blood are determined and compared. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy women is 88-128 mL/min. and 97 to 137 mL/min. in males (normal levels may vary slightly between labs). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is another indicator of kidney function.
The normal range for serum creatinine (in the blood) is usually between 0.6 and 1.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) although it varies between labs, between men and women, and by age. ... A high serum creatinine level means your kidneys aren't working well.
Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females.
If they are healthy, the kidneys typically keep blood creatinine levels in a normal range. As such, creatinine levels are a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. If the kidneys become impaired for any reason, the creatinine level in the blood will rise.
