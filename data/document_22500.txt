The marginal cost curve is U-shaped. For the first 4 Stuffed Amigos, marginal cost declines from $5 to a low of $1.50. However, for the production beyond 6 Stuffed Amigos, marginal cost increases.
The U-shape of the marginal cost curve is directly attributable to increasing, then decreasing marginal returns (and the law of diminishing marginal returns). As marginal product (and marginal returns) increases for relatively small output quantities, marginal cost declines.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MARGINAL COST CURVE interval and from 76.7 percent to 85.5 percent for the 800-pound interval. As the interval is moved to the right, the marginal cost increases from $18.52 to $20.61 for the 1000-pound interval and from $15.38 to $17.12
Like other marginal curves, the long-run marginal cost curve follows the average-marginal rule relative to the long-run average cost curve. In all outward appearance, the long-run marginal cost curve looks very much like the short-run marginal cost, that is, it is U-shaped.
The short-run marginal cost (MC) curve will at first decline and then will go up at some point, and will intersect the average total cost and average variable cost curves at their minimum points.
Average costs are U-shaped, and the marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curves at their respective minimum points. In the competitive model of the firm, the minimum average variable cost is termed the shutdown point because a firm will not produce in the short run if price is below average variable cost.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MARGINAL COST CURVE 473 pounds, 6500 pounds become interval number 13; 7000 pounds, interval number 14; etc. But in Table 44, average costs are given per 100 pounds output even though output is again shown as 6500, 7000, etc. pounds.
W. E. PAULSON $1.49; the average marginal cost of a is $1.38. At intervals 80 and 90, the costs of b and a are: $2.20 and $2.04, and $3.32 and $3.05. The upshot of the whole matter is that the process of averaging moves the marginal curve to the right.
The average fixed cost (AFC) curve will decline as additional units are produced, and continue to decline. The average total cost (ATC) curve initially will decline as fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units, but will go up as marginal costs increase due to the law of diminishing returns.
