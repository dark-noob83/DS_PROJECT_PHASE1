Canada Geography. As the second largest country in the world, Canada includes a wide variety of land regions, vast maritime terrains, thousands of islands, more lakes and inland waters than any other country, and the longest coastline on the planet. In essence, Canada is a smorgasbord of landforms.
Ice and Rock. Above the tundra and well above the treeline, the Arctic landscape becomes a frozen ocean punctuated by ice-capped islands. Despite the harshness of the landscape -- the Arctic Ocean is covered with ice for most of the year -- a number of hardy cetaceans make this area their home.
Geographically, the Arctic spans the Arctic Ocean and covers land areas in parts of Canada, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States (Alaska).
Geography. The Arctic region of Canada is located near the top of Canada close to the North Pole. This enormous biome of land is extremely uniform in appearance, and covers one fifth of the earth's surface. The arctic region has many landforms. They include strange landforms called pingos; they also include glaciers, plains, islands, and lowlands. The major bodies of water are the Arctic Ocean, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Fox Bay, Great Bear Lake, half of Hudson Bay and Pond Inlet.
Arctic Map. The Arctic is a region of the planet, north of the Arctic Circle, and includes the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Baffin Island, other smaller northern islands, and the far northern parts of Europe, Russia (Siberia), Alaska and Canada.
