They’re not expensive! The average costs for a fire sprinkler system are as follows: 1  A complete fire sprinkler system integrated into a new construction project costs about $1 – 2 per square foot. 2  This includes equipment and installation. 3  Retrofitting an existing building usually costs between $2 – 7 per square foot. 1 This includes equipment and installation. 2  Retrofitting an existing building usually costs between $2 – 7 per square foot. 3  Retrofitting a high rise building will run you about $2 – 4 per square foot. 4  Installing a fire sprinkler in a historic building can sometimes be more expensive – up to $10

1 According to the Fire Protection Research Organization's 2009 Fire Sprinkler Cost Assessment, sprinkler installation costs homebuilders $0.38-$3.66 per sprinklered square foot, with an average cost of $1.61 per sprinklered square foot. 2  For an average 2,200-square-foot home, expect to pay about $3,542. 1 Nonmetallic installations average $1.18 per sprinklered square foot; a mix of both types costs on average $1.56 per sprinklered square foot; solely using metallic piping typically costs $3.19 per sprinklered square foot. 2  Location can play a role in the cost of fire sprinkler installation.
Table 4-3 shows that the fire sprinkler system designed in the 1984 report costs, in 2005 prices, were substantially more than the multipurpose network sprinkler system used here, even with a 100 % material markup (the exception being the townhouse at the 100 % markup). Table 4-3. Results of the benefit-cost analysis show that multipurpose network sprinkler systems are economical. The expected present value of net benefits (PVNB) is estimated to be $2919 for the colonial-style house, $3099 for the townhouse, and $4166 for the ranch-style house (see Table ES-1).

A residential sprinkler system will save a homeowner money in the event of a fire. When activated, a sprinkler head will spray 15 to 20 gallons per minute. “Eighty to ninety percent of fires are put out with one sprinkler head,” Marshall says. The cost of a home-sprinkler system will depend on a number of factors. A new-home, stand-alone installation can run anywhere from $1.00 to $1.25 per square foot, while a retrofit could cost $5 to $6 per square foot.
Fact: A residential fire sprinkler uses only 10 to 25 gallons of water per minute, and operates early in a fire. A hose used by a firefighters flows about 10 times that amount, around 125 gallons to 250 gallons per minute. Myth: Fire sprinklers could go off accidentally. Residential Fire Sprinkler Systems. Classic Fire Protection Inc. opened a committed Residential fire sprinkler division in January of 2006. Since then we have performed many types of installs from town homes to estate homes that measure over 15,000 square feet.
