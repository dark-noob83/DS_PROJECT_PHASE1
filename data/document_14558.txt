What you earn are points in the Choice Privileges program, enough to be used for a free night at a subset of their hotels. And it’s not even enough points for a free night in addition to the points you earn for two stays. Instead, it’s a bonus meant to top up the points you earn for those two stays so that in total you have enough for one free night at that subset of hotels. Specifically, after two stays you will earn a bonus of between 5000 and 8000 points, so that your total points earning from the stays is at least 8000 points. The good hotel redemptions in the Choice Privileges program, by the way, actually cost 30,000 to 60,000 points per night. So really, this is a bonus of between 5000 and 8000 points after 2 stays, . Which is a kind of strange promotion if you stop to think about it, but great marketing for that more modest investment
Choice Privileges had over 1,500 hotels in the lowest tiers for 6,000 points or 8,000 points per night. This can be as little as $100 in spend to earn 8,000 points during Choice Privileges recurring promotion for 8,000 points after two stays. When Choice Privileges offers double points then these low tier rewards take just $300 to $400 in hotel stay spend to earn a free night at any of 1,500+ hotels.
