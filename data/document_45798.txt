The cost of a mitigation system may vary according to the home's design, size, foundation, construction materials and the local climate. Radon reduction systems average costs nationally are $1,200 with a range from $800 to $1500 common depending on house and market conditions. 
1 Ground water wells can also be tested for radon, then, if needed, can get a water radon mitigation system installed. 2  Installing a water radon mitigation system runs from $1,000-$4,500, and maintenance runs $0 to $150 annually. 3  To find out about radon content in a city water system, call the local water provider. 1 The EPA's Installation and Operating Cost Table lists how much a radon mitigation system should cost based on the type of foundation. 2  Operating a radon mitigation system costs from nothing up to $700 per year. 3  Many radon mitigation systems have fans that require continuous electric power that can add to power bills.
1 A radon kit can cost anywhere from $13 to $30. 2  For example, the First Alert RD1 Radon Gas Test Kit costs $13 to $23. 3  Based on a 1-10 scale, anything under 4pCi/L is deemed “standard” according to the EPA. 4  If that number surpasses 4, mitigation will be necessary to ensure that the radon is free from the home. 1 The EPA will recommend that a home with radon present in the past be retested every 1 to 2 years. 2  A professional can give a professional reading for anywhere from $150 to $300. 3  A mitigation system may require maintenance in the future in case it fails.
There are different types of radon tests. Only a licensed radon tester can perform such a test, and a homeowner can expect to pay around $200. The average cost of testing and installation of a radon mitigation system is $758, explains the Home Advisor website. Most homeowners spent between $644 and $872 for radon testing and mitigation of the gas
1 Installing a water radon mitigation system runs from $1,000-$4,500, and maintenance runs $0 to $150 annually. 2  To find out about radon content in a city water system, call the local water provider. 3  It's wise to retest a home's radon level every year or two after a mitigation system is installed. 1 The EPA's Installation and Operating Cost Table lists how much a radon mitigation system should cost based on the type of foundation. 2  Operating a radon mitigation system costs from nothing up to $700 per year. 3  Many radon mitigation systems have fans that require continuous electric power that can add to power bills.
A professional licensed by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency’s Radon Program can mitigate your radon levels. The average cost of a mitigation system is between $800 to $1200. The most common type of mitigation systems is Active Soil Depressurization. These systems reduce radon by collecting radon prior to entry into the building and discharging it to a safe location. 
1 On average, mitigation by a professional can cost anywhere from $650 to $1,900. 2  One of the most common methods or ridding a home of radon is by installing a radon mitigation system; this keeps a constant reading as well as reduces the radon in the air. 3  A system can cost upwards of $650 to $2,100. 1 The EPA will recommend that a home with radon present in the past be retested every 1 to 2 years. 2  A professional can give a professional reading for anywhere from $150 to $300. 3  A mitigation system may require maintenance in the future in case it fails.
The cost of a radon mitigation system can range between $800 and $2,500 (average $1,200) dependent upon characteristics of the building and the choice of radon reduction method. 
Radon Mitigation Systems. Radon mitigation is any process or system used to reduce radon concentrations in the breathing zones of occupied buildings. The goal of a radon mitigation system is to reduce the indoor radon levels to below the EPA action level of 4 pCi/L. A quality radon reduction (mitigation) system is often able to reduce the annual average radon level to below 2 pCi/L. In general, costs can range from approximately $800-$2500, with the average reduction system costing approximately $1500. The PBS series “ Ask This Old House ” visited a home in Minneapolis to install a radon mitigation system. The episode covers how radon systems are properly designed and installed. 
In some counties, as many as 40-45 percent (or more) of the homes would have screening levels above the 4 pCi/l guideline. TYPICAL RADON MITIGATION COSTS If it has been determined from radon testing that radon mitigation is necessary, Compliance, Inc. can install a Radon Mitigation System. The costs range between $400.00 for a passive system to $2,500.00 for an extensive, active system.
