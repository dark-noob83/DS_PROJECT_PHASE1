Types of Collagen. There are many different types of collagen found throughout the body. Some of the most common are Type I and Type II. Type I collagen is the most abundant and is found in scar tissue, skin, tendons, artery walls, and bones. It is a very strong type of collagen, with good tensile strength. More specifically, collagen is found in our various types of connective tissue such as cartilage, tendons, bones, and ligaments. If we could look closely at a collagen fiber, we'd see that its structure is similar to that of a rope.
Elastin: A protein that coil and recoils like a spring within the elastic fibers of connective tissue and accounts for the elasticity of structures such the skin, blood vessels, heart, lungs, intestines, tendons, and ligaments. Elastin functions in connective tissue together with collagen. Whereas elastin provides elasticity, collagen provides rigidity to connective tissue. Elastin is normally no longer made after puberty and aging begins. Also called elasticin.
collagen. a fibrous structural protein that constitutes the protein of the white fibers (collagenous fibers) of skin, tendon, bone cartilage and all other connective tissues. It also occurs dispersed in a gel to provide stiffening, as in the vitreous humor of the eye. It is made of monomers of tropocollagen. Examples of collagen diseases that are most probably the result of an aberration of the immunological reactions that mitigate injury and inflammation of connective tissues are systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
It is found in connective tissue, including skin, bone, ligaments, and cartilage. It represents 30% of total body protein. collagenous, adj. A fibrous protein that provides strength and elasticity to skin, bones, cartilage and connective tissues. Examples of collagen diseases that are most probably the result of an aberration of the immunological reactions that mitigate injury and inflammation of connective tissues are systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
In other types of connective tissue, collagen may be arranged in a more irregular manner. In our skin, there are collagen fibers, but they're not arranged in the same way as in tendons. You can feel the difference by touching your Achilles tendon and then pulling at your arm skin. Skin is softer and much looser. More specifically, collagen is found in our various types of connective tissue such as cartilage, tendons, bones, and ligaments. If we could look closely at a collagen fiber, we'd see that its structure is similar to that of a rope.
Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. It is also abundant in corneas, cartilage, bones, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen /ˈkɒlədʒɨn/ is the main structural protein in the extracellular space in the various connective tissues in animals. As the main component of connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content

Collagen: The principal protein of the skin, tendons, cartilage, bone, and connective tissue. Collagen is an essential part of the framework of the design of our various body tissues.
