1 Cancer has spread to one organ that is not near the colon, such as the liver, lung, or ovary, or to a distant lymph node. 2  Stage IVB: Cancer may have spread through the colon wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes.
Lymph Nodes and Colon Cancer. (Ivanhoe Newswire) -- The number of lymph nodes evaluated for colon cancer has risen significantly over the past two decades. However, according to a study in the September 14 issue of JAMA, this improvement is not associated with an increase in node-positive cancers.
Stage describes the extent of cancer in the body. For colorectal cancer, the stage is based on how far the cancer has grown into the wall of the intestine, if it has reached nearby structures, and if it has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs. The stage of a cancer is one of the most important factors in determining prognosis and treatment options.
Regional Lymph Nodes. There are between 100 and 150 lymph nodes in the mesentery of the colon. Regional lymph nodes are the nodes along the colon, plus the nodes along the major arteries that supply blood to that particular colon segment.
Overall, a positive association between increased survival and increased number of lymph nodes removed was reported by 16 of the 17 studies examined for patients with stage II colon cancer and in 4 of 6 of the studies that included patients with stage III colon cancer.
