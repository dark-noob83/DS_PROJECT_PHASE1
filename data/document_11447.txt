The melting point of lead is 327.35°C, and the boiling point is 1515°C. The only common metals with lower melting points are tin and bismuth, while the boiling point is high enough to allow processes in liquid lead over a wide temperature range. The coefficient of linear expansion is 29.5 x 10 -4 per °C. Lead on its own does not wet metals well, but when tin is added the alloy wets copper, silver, gold and tin very well. Besides, it melts at a lower temperature and so is easier to use. The frequently-used 60-40 solder is 60 Sn, 40 Pb, which begins to melt at 183°C and is fully melted at 190°C.
The melting point for lead is 327.46°C or 621.43 °F      327.46 degrees celcius      Lead is a soft, malleable poor metal, also considered to be one of the … heavy metals. Lead has a bluish-white color when freshly cut, but tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air. Melting temperature is the point where a substance is reduced to a liquid (this is the state it changes to). the usual melting point of substances is 100 degrees or higher. …   thank you for answering!!
Best Answer: Common solder for electronics equipment uses Sn63Pb37 solder which melts at 182 to 183 degrees C. If the circuit board is more recent one and it says RoHS compliant then Lead free solder is use which can be 20 degree C higher, i.e. Sn-Ag-Cu (Tin-Silver-Copper) solders needs at least 217 degree C to melt. 
Not to be confused with protein melting temperature, Tm, the temperature at which 50% unfolding occurs. The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a solid is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. Many laboratory techniques exist for the determination of melting points. A Kofler bench is a metal strip with a temperature gradient (range from room temperature to 300 °C). Any substance can be placed on a section of the strip revealing its thermal behaviour at the temperature at that point.
3. Heat the lead until it melts. Turn on your heat source and adjust the heat to its highest setting, if applicable. Apply the heat as directly to the lead as possible. Lead melts at a temperature of 328 degrees Celsius (621 degrees Fahrenheit), so it will take time to melt a large amount of lead.
Lead melts at a low temp of only 158F-wrong   Lead melts at a much higher temp of 621.43F. Otherwise old copper plumbing on boiler pipes would come apart. The old joints … were soldered with mostly high percent lead. Water in boiler pipes can get as high as 180F to 200F.  .
