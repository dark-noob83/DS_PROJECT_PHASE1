Alfred Graf von Schlieffen, mostly called Count Schlieffen (. [ˈʃliːfən] ; 28 February 1833 – 4 January 1913) was a German field marshal and strategist who served as Chief of the Imperial German General Staff from 1891 to 1906. 
Alfred von Schlieffen. Alfred von Schlieffen was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1833. He attended the Berlin War Academy (1858-61) and was a staff officer during the Austro-Prussian War (1866). In 1891 Schlieffen replaced Helmuth von Moltke as Chief of General Staff. Schlieffen feared that France and Russia would join together to attack Germany. His main concern was to devise a plan that could deal with a war against Russia in the east and France in the west. This strategy involved a German invasion of Belgium and a right-wheel flanking movement through Holland and then southwards, cutting off Paris from the sea. Schlieffen retired as Chief of General Staff of the German Army in 1906. Alfred von Schlieffen died in 1913.
General Alfred von Schlieffen developed the Schlieffen Plan in 1905  to ensure that Germany would win a war against an alliance between  France and Russia in Europe. A modif … ied version of his plan was  unsuccessfully used in World War 1 that started in 1914. The Schlieffen Plan was created by Count Alfred von Schlieffen and modified by Helmuth von Moltke the Younger after Schlieffen's retirement. It was Moltke who actually put the plan into action, despite initial reservations about it. It was the German plan to avoid war on two fronts in short.
When Helmuth von Moltke replaced Alfred von Schlieffen as German Army Chief of Staff in 1906, he modified the plan by proposing that Holland was not invaded.
