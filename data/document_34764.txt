In 17, 857 patients with disease of all three coronary arteries who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, the annual mortality rate was 3.3 %. In 1,294 patients with three vessel disease who underwent coronary angioplasty the annual mortality rate was 4.2 %.
This surgery is called a bypass surgery. In a bypass surgery, part of an artery is taken from some other part in the body and replaces the blocked artery. The arteries are often taken from the leg of the patient. This replacement enables proper blood flow again and reduces the threat of a heart attack.
A bypass can be done to replace one, two or even three blocked arteries. When three arteries are replaced, the procedure is known as a triple bypass surgery. The number of arteries or veins being replaced in the surgery is the number mentioned in the surgery.
Patients and loved ones looking to explore heart bypass surgery as a means to remedy a recurring and potentially fatal heart condition always look into one statistic as a means to assure them of the soundness of the decision; that statistic is bypass surgery success rate.
The current success rate for bypass surgery is 95 to 98 percent, meaning that between 2 and 5 percent of all patients have complications, including death.
Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the United States. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 450,000 CABG surgeries were performed in 2006, with many people requiring more than one operation.

slide 1 of 5. Triple bypass surgery is performed when there is a blockage in more than one artery or one has coronary artery disease. The blockage impedes blood flow that can be life threatening by causing one to have a heart attack or stroke.
