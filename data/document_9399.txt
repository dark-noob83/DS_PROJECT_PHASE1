Gasoline prices are likely to go up, and with that increase in price at the pump, so does the affordability of a Tesla automobile. If the average cost of gasoline is $5 per gallon within the next 5 years, then owning a Tesla Model S, will be comparable to owning a $30,000 gasoline car. But if you’re the type of person that hangs on to your car for 7 or even 10 years, you’ll be saving much more. If we examine this, it seems that the cost to use the $60,000 car was half the price of the car, while the cost to operate the $26,000 car was almost 25% more than the cost of the car itself! So if the operating cost of a car, divided by the price of a car gives a lower number, the car is clearly a better deal.
How the least-likely person to purchase a Model S became an owner. This is my story about how I ended up purchasing a Tesla Model S. No snazzy car photos-not trying to sell you on the beauty of the car, there are plenty of websites for that. This site is about the economics of purchasing and owning a Tesla. electriclove on Hacker News found a bug in one of the formulas. The Ody PV line was adding in fuel costs from another car's row. I've updated the formula, which changes the results, which I discuss below at bottom under the Epilogue. I also added in an extra $1200 every 3rd year for the Tesla for tires.
We calculate the estimated cost of ownership over a 5 year period for the purchase of new 2011 or 2012 vehicle and new 2012 Tesla Model S. The purpose is to compare your estimated cost of ownership for 5 years to another vehicle you may potentially buy, to that of a Tesla Model S. If we examine this, it seems that the cost to use the $60,000 car was half the price of the car, while the cost to operate the $26,000 car was almost 25% more than the cost of the car itself! So if the operating cost of a car, divided by the price of a car gives a lower number, the car is clearly a better deal.
Last week Tesla Motors announced a new pseudo-lease program claiming a true cost of ownership of just $500/month. That would be considerably less than I am paying right now for a car that would be comparable to their mid range, but that low figure comes from the entry level model of course. Based on their number for electricity cost, driving 4 days a week would cost me $275 in electricity per month, plus $40 in tolls (assuming I can use the car pool lane). My current commuting costs me about $45 in gas, a maximum of $24 in tolls (it is cheaper if I go in later) and about $200 in fares.
Quite a lot more than the $500/month, and quite a lot more than I am paying now. Finance Payment. Perhaps the biggest difference in the Tesla plan to my conventional lease is the amount of the monthly payment. Based on their number for electricity cost, driving 4 days a week would cost me $275 in electricity per month, plus $40 in tolls (assuming I can use the car pool lane). My current commuting costs me about $45 in gas, a maximum of $24 in tolls (it is cheaper if I go in later) and about $200 in fares.
In reality, very few think that way. When I used the Tesla Leasing Calculator and factored in all of the potential savings, my effective cost per month for owning the Model S was $164/month. Strip out some of the potential savings that don't apply to me (using a carpool lane would save $167) and my effective monthly cost is $653. As expected, Tesla is finally getting into the leasing game. And as expected, CEO Elon Musk says having a lease option will make the $62,000 minimum of the Model S more affordable and expand sales. He's right.

Then one day, I did a Google search for [Tesla cost of ownership] and similar terms. I found a few threads and spreadsheets, but none that I liked. They didn't take into account the time value of money and depreciation. So I decided to make my own model. electriclove on Hacker News found a bug in one of the formulas. The Ody PV line was adding in fuel costs from another car's row. I've updated the formula, which changes the results, which I discuss below at bottom under the Epilogue.
