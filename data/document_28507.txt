Three Parts: Setting up a furnace Following safe practices Melting the brass. Brass has a relatively low melting point compared to iron, steel, or gold, but it still requires a special furnace. Many beginning metalworking hobbyists start out with aluminum, which is easier to melt, but brass is often the next step.
Melting temperature of some common metals and alloys. Melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from solid to liquid state. Melting points for some metals and alloys are indicated below.
Ilya Stcherbakov/iStock/Getty Images. 1,688 degrees Fahrenheit is an extremely hot temperature; however, in metallurgy it is considered a low melting point. Compared to iron's melting point -- 2,786 degrees Fahrenheit -- the average melting point of brass at 1,688 makes it a low-melting alloy.
