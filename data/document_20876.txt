Characteristics: Bismuth is a brittle, silvery-green metal that has a low melting temperature and high specific gravity. Being both stable and non-toxic, bismuth is often used as a replacement for toxic metals such as antimony, cadmium, lead and mercury.
Bismuth is mainly a byproduct of lead ore processing. It has a metallic luster and is silver-white with an iridescent tarnish. Among the heavy metals, it is the heaviest and the only non-toxic. Bismuth has been used in solders, a variety of other alloys, metallurgical additives, and medications and in atomic research.
Bismuth is not known to be toxic. Characteristics: Bismuth is a crystalline, brittle, metal. Lying on the right side of the periodic table, bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic metal; this means it resists being magnetized and is repelled by a magnetic field. One effect of this can be seen in the video (left).
First, let us look at its physical properties. Bismuth is a non-toxic heavy metal with a specific gravity of 9.71 (when alloyed with 3 percent tin). Compared to lead with a specific gravity of 11.12, Bismuth is 87 percent as dense as lead. Steel, with a specific gravity of 7.86, is only 71
Bismuth, the first non-toxic alternative to steel shot, is back. With the price of tungsten ammo going from expensive to “if you have to ask you can’t afford it” prices, that’s good news, at least for those who can pay $2-$3 per shell for shotgun ammo.
Bismuth metal is not considered toxic and poses minimum threat to the environment. Bismuth compounds generally have very low solubility but they should be handled with care, as there is only limited information on their effects and fate in the environment. Back to chart periodic elements.
