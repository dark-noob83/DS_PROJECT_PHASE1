Riparian means located by the banks of a river, stream, or other body of water. river. A river is a large, flowing body of water that usually empties into a sea or ocean. riverbed. A riverbed is the bottom of the river (or other body of water). riverine. Riverine means relating to, similar to, or formed by a river. 
Changing River Profiles. Changing River Profile. Before looking at specific river landforms it is important to look at how the river channel itself changes downstream. We have already looked at how the river channel in the upper course is shallow and narrow with large bedload that disrupts the efficiency of flow. It is common that rapids form over different bands of geology that vary in resistence or where the river is transporting large resistent bedload. The velocity of the river is noticeably faster at rapids but not efficient in its flow. Due to the roughness of the channel, flow is turbulent and known as white water.
A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or standing water. This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or (more rarely) another river that cannot transport away the supplied sediment. Despite a popular legend, this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus.
A river is a course of water that flows to another. water source such as an ocean, lake or even another river. A river is not exactly a landform but part of other landforms such as mountains, prairies and valleys. They can even be parts of many different landforms at the same time. It then is fed from other lakes and rivers during its trip to the gulf of Mexico. A couple of other ways rivers are created are from mountain and glacier run off. Rivers are not only created by other landforms but they also create landforms. Rivers can create canyons such as the Grand Canyon, valleys and bluffs.
Deltas are depositional landforms found at the mouth of a river where the river meets a body of water with a lower velocity than the river (e.g. a lake or the sea). Potholes are cylindrical holes drilled into the bed of a river that vary in depth & diameter from a few centimetres to several metres. Theyâ€™re found in the upper course of a river where it has enough potential energy to erode vertically and its flow is turbulent.

Landforms and Definitions List List of Landforms. Alluvial fan: land formation that occurs when sedimentary materials such as rocks, gravel, and silt, are deposited onto land as a result of decreasing or stopped water flow from a river or stream source. Altitude (elevation): the height above sea level. Rift Valley: two separating tectonic plates forming a valley by the land falling. River: a large stream of water flowing through the land into a lake, ocean, or other body of water. River Delta: a branching river extending into another body of water. River Island: an island in a river. Sea: a large body of water, usually salt water, partly or completely surrounded by land. Sound: a wide channel connecting two bodies of water or an inlet between the mainland and islands. Source (of a river): the place where a river or stream begins
