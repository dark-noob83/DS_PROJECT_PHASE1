Labour includes the cost of installing waterproofing, plumbing, tiling, electrical items, gyprocking, painting and the installation of fittings. The per-square-metre cost for labour that we use is $1100 for a new home and $1600 for a renovation (renovations require the old bathroom to be gutted). We obtained these values by getting prices from various bathroom installation specialists and then taking an average.
