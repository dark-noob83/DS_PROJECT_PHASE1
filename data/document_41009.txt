(1)University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is emerging evidence of gabapentin and pregabalin (gabapentinoid) abuse, particularly in the substance misuse population, and some suggestion of gabapentinoids being abused alongside methadone.
RESULTS: 22% (29/129) of respondents admitted to abusing gabapentinoids, and of these, 38% (11/29) abused gabapentinoids in order to potentiate the 'high' they obtained from methadone. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentinoid abuse along with methadone has not previously been described.
Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was carried out in six substance misuse clinics, looking for evidence of gabapentinoid abuse. Results: 22% (29/129) of respondents admitted to abusing gabapentinoids, and of these, 38% (11/29) abused gabapentinoids in order to potentiate the ‘high' they obtained from methadone. Conclusions: Gabapentinoid abuse along with methadone has not previously been described.
A woman substituted gabapentin 600–1,500 mg daily for cocaine. 1 Florida inmates admitted snorting gabapentin powder for effects reminiscent of cocaine. 2 Benzodiazepine-like withdrawal and dependence have been described. 3,4 Gabapentin has been misused to potentiate the effect of methadone. 5 About 20 cases of gabapentin addiction have been described in Europe.
Abstract. Background/Aims: There is emerging evidence of gabapentin and pregabalin (gabapentinoid) abuse, particularly in the substance misuse population, and some suggestion of gabapentinoids being abused alongside methadone.
