3. Enroll your pit bull in socialization classes. One of the best ways to socialize your puppy is to take a puppy socialization class with your puppy. You could find a responsible pit bull dog group, canine good citizen program, or dog therapy training program. Start introducing your pit bull to different people and animals as early as you can. This will help your puppy get used to all sorts of people and animals. The best time to start socializing your puppy is when he's around 3 to 5 weeks old to when he is 14 to 16 weeks old.
The primary puppy raiser must be an adult 18 years of age or older. However, minors are allowed to raise with an adult co-raiser living in the same home.

Get your puppy plenty of exercise. Try to take your puppy for short walks (less than 15 minutes) if he's less than 3 months old. You'll want to walk him at least twice a day, even as a puppy. Exercise is important to keep him healthy, burn energy, and make him happy and engaged. If you can, let your puppy exercise in an area with lots of space. Start introducing your pit bull to different people and animals as early as you can. This will help your puppy get used to all sorts of people and animals.

A: Yes. While it is easier for you to Puppy Raise if you have a backyard and house, puppy raisers are not limited to people who live in houses. The experience of living in an apartment helps in socializing a puppy so it is comfortable in an apartment setting. A: When the Puppy Raiser first picks up their puppy to raise he or she will receive a Vaccination Schedule of what shots are to be given and when they are due. Puppy Raisers are required to follow this schedule.
Distemper shots should start at 6 weeks old with a booster shot about 2 weeks later. After these initial life-saving vaccines are given, you can begin socializing your puppy outside the immediate household. Just remember to take your puppy to the vet for vaccine boosters every year. Buy a crate that's sized for a large breed dog and place your puppy's blanket or bed inside the crate, along with a few treats. Leave the door open throughout the day so your puppy can explore it. Start feeding your puppy his food inside the crate and close the door when he is eating.
A house is the optimal environment, but as long as you have a proper place for the puppy to be and you are willing to give the puppy extra activity to make up for the lack of space/yard, you can still raise a puppy in an apartment. You could bring the puppy with you on vacation (which can help the puppy get used to planes, trains, and long car rides), but if that is not possible you would need to contact Doggie Does Good to make arrangements for the puppy to stay somewhere else. These arrangements must be made in advance.
