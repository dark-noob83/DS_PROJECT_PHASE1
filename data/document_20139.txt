Mars' closest approach to the Earth is called opposition, and occurs roughly every 780 days.

August 25, 2003: At 09:51 universal time (UT) on August 27th, Earth makes its closest approach to Mars in nearly 60,000 years. The two worlds, center-to-center, will be just 56 million kilometers apart--a short distance on the scale of the solar system. The last people to come so close to Mars were Neanderthals.
Mars oppositions happen about every 26 months. Every 15 or 17 years, opposition occurs within a few weeks of Mars' perihelion (the point in its orbit when it is closest to the sun).
Confidence votes 43.1K. Polymer/Physical/Computational Chemist. Mars' closest approach to the Earth is called opposition, and occurs roughly every 780 days. The actual distance between the planets at that time varies considerably; it can be as little as about 55 million kilometers or as much as 100 million kilometers. Particularly close oppositions occur every 15 to 17 years; the opposition in 2003 was closer than any previous one in recorded history.
The encounter will culminate on August 27th when Mars comes to within 34,649,589 miles of Earth and will be (next to the moon) the brightest object in the night sky. It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will appear 25.11 arc seconds wide at a modest 75-power magnification.
In 2003, Mars made its closest approach to Earth in nearly 60,000 years! It won't be that close again until the year 2287. When Mars and Earth are close to each other, Mars appears very bright in our sky. It also makes it easier to see with telescopes or the naked eye.
