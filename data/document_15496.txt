Renters Insurance Statistics. As you begin thinking about your renters policy and how much youâ€™ll be spending on coverage, it might be helpful to consider some statistics. 1  In 2010, the average cost of a rental insurance policy in the U.S. was $185 a year. 2  Renter insurance costs are highest in Mississippi, Louisiana and Oklahoma. When you get a quote for a renters insurance policy, you will have to decide how much personal property coverage and liability coverage you need. You will also have to consider whether you want to purchase additional endorsements to cover specific items, such as high value jewelry or collections.
An insurance deductible is the part of the coverage that the insured is responsible for in the event of a loss. Deductibles can range from $500 to $2,000. Selecting a lower deductible raises the renter's insurance premium. Similarly, a high deductible lowers the premium. Even if the renter has $45,000 worth of possessions, he does not have to use that value as the policy coverage amount. He may instead decide to insure them for only $20,000 or $30,000, which would hold down the cost of the policy.

According to the Insurance Information Institute, a typical rental insurance policy will cost between $150 to $350 per year for around $35,000 of personal property coverage and between $100,000 and $300,000 of liability coverage. 
A renter can choose to insure only certain items and leave others uninsured. Even if the renter has $45,000 worth of possessions, he does not have to use that value as the policy coverage amount. He may instead decide to insure them for only $20,000 or $30,000, which would hold down the cost of the policy.
