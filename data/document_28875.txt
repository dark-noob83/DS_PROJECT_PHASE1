If your IP address is blocked by a website, there's little you can do to unblock it. Typically, IP addresses are blocked for violation of a website or company's policy. Abusive language on a message board may cause a website to block your IP address also.
My IP address is blocked. I'm Blocked. Something appeared to my screen saying that my IP address is blocked because I've posted content that is marked abusive. I didn't remember that I've posted something abusive and now Facebook blocked my IP address for maybe 2 days. :(.
We recommend that you troubleshoot some common problems that might be causing your IP address to be blocked. This can help to prevent your IP address from getting blocked in the future. Two common solutions are: Complete a thorough virus scan on all servers and computers behind the blocked IP address. Verify that your rDNS contains a name that includes mail, SMTP, relay, or MX. For example: mail.example.com, smtp.example.com, or mx1.example.com.
