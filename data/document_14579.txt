Therefore if the earth was on the opposite side of the sun from Neptune, at its maximum distance from the Sun, and Neptune was also at its maximum distance from the sun, the maximum distance of Neptune from Earth would be 4702 million km (or 4.702 billion km). The distance of the Earth from the Sun varies from about 147.1 million kilometers to 152.1 million kilometers. The distance of Neptune from the Sun varies from 4.45 billion km to 4.55 billion km.
The average distance of Neptune from the Sun is 2,795,084,800 miles or 4,498,252,900 kilometers. Because its orbit is elliptical, its distance from the Sun changes depending on where it is in its orbit. The closest Neptune gets to the Sun is 2,771,087,000 miles or 4,459,630,000 kilometers. The farthest it gets from the Sun is 2,819,080,000 miles or 4,536,870,000 kilometers. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos.
The average distance to the Moon is 384,399 kilometres = 4.06318742 × 10-8 light years (Note the minus) The moon is only a tiny fraction of one light year from earth. It ta … kes light from the sun eight minutes to reach earth, and the moon is much closer to earth than the sun. The rough average distance between the sun and earth is around 93 million miles. That's equivalent to about 0.0000158 light-year. Light takes about 8 1/3 minutes to travel … from the sun to the earth ... about 0.0000158 of a year.
… 9 AU, which will be closer to the sun than Pluto. Neptune's average distance from the sun is 30.1 AU. Therefore, depending upon where each planet is in its respective orbit, the distance could be anywhere from about 1 billion kilometers to over 19 billion km. The distance of the Earth from the Sun varies from about 147.1 million kilometers to 152.1 million kilometers. The distance of Neptune from the Sun varies from 4.45 billion km to 4.55
Here’s a quick answer: Neptune is approximately 4.4 billion km away from the Earth. NASA's Voyager 2 flew the entire distance from Earth to Neptune. They both have a closest point to the Sun, called perihelion, and a distant point, called aphelion. So, the closest point occurs when Earth and Neptune are on the same side of the Sun. Earth is at its most distant point from the Sun, and Neptune is at its closest. At this point, Earth and Neptune are separated by only 4.301 billion kilometers. At their most distant point, Earth and Neptune are on opposite sides of the Sun, at the most distant points on their orbits. At this point, Earth and Neptune are separated by 4.553 billion kilometers. If you’re interested, here’s an article that lists how far away all the planets are from the Sun and Earth
If the earth was on the same side of the Sun as Neptune, at its maximum distance from the Sun (ie its nearest distance to Neptune) and Neptune was also at its minimum distance from the sun (ie, its nearest distance to earth), the minimum distance of Neptune from Earth would be 4298 million km (or 4.298 billion km). The distance of the Earth from the Sun varies from about 147.1 million kilometers to 152.1 million kilometers. The distance of Neptune from the Sun varies from 4.45 billion km to 4.55 billion km.
The distance from one planet to another is constantly shifting because both bodies are moving through space. When Neptune and Earth line up on the same side of the sun, at their closest, they are only 2.7 billion miles (4.3 billon kilometers) apart. But when the planets are on opposite sides of the sun, they can put as many as 2.9 billion miles (4.7 billion km) between them. When the icy planet is closest to the sun, it lies only 2.77 billion miles (4.46 billion km). At its farthest, it passes 2.82 billion miles (4.54 billion km) from the star. Although Neptune is the eighth most distant planet, it was not always.
Neptune is 4.52 x 109 km on average, and earth is 1.5 x 108 km from the sun. On closest approach (both planets on the same side of the sun) the distance is 45.2 - 1.5 = 43.7 x … 108 km or 4.37 x 109 km But if they are on opposite sides of the sun then add to get 4.67 x 109 km. The distance of the Earth from the Sun varies from about 147.1 million kilometers to 152.1 million kilometers. The distance of Neptune from the Sun varies from 4.45 billion km to 4.55 billion km.
Firstly, Earth is furthest from the Sun (aphelion, 152,097,701 km) and Neptune is in opposition (directly opposite the Sun in the sky so that the Earth is exactly between the Sun and Neptune) and nearest to the Sun (perihelion, 4,452,940,833 km). This is the closest possible. Secondly, Earth is at aphelion and Neptune is at aphelion but in conjunction-diametrically opposite the Earth on the other side of the Sun. In this case the separation will be 4,553,946,490 km + 152,097,701 km or 4,706,044,191 km. This is 0.0004974 of a light year, the furth
