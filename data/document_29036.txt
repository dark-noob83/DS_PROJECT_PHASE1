These projectors are the least expensive, but the low output of light means that they have to be in a dark room. These projectors are best on smaller screens. 1,000 to 2,000 Lumens. This is a common lumen range and these projectors need to be in dimly lit rooms.
Projector users generally need to keep the lighting very low and project their image from a relatively short distance (home theater, small meeting room, etc.) when using projectors that have a lumens rating of fewer than 1,000.
The amount of brightness you need is determined by the room you project in. Projector brightness is measured in lumens. For home theater projectors where ambient light is kept to a minimum, you'll need a minimum of 1500 lumens. For classrooms, conference rooms or rooms with windows, a projector with a minimum of 2500 lumens is best. For large auditoriums or lecture halls, you'll need more lumens.

1 2000 to 3000 lumens. 2  This lumen range is a step up in performance and price. 3  These machines are suitable for normal business conference room and classroom use. 4  Presentations should be done with the room lighting reduced somewhat for best screen viewing.
Lumens: First off, some projector manufacturers are more dishonest than others about their lumens ratings, so equal numbers don't always produce equal brightness. If your theater room is always well darkened & the screen is not too large, you might be able to get away with 1000 lumens.
Lumens are a unit of measurement of the total brightness that comes from a light source, in this case, a projector. One may also see the term ANSI Lumens. ANSI is an acronym for the American National Standards Institute. In general, the more lumens a projector has, the brighter the image on the screen.
