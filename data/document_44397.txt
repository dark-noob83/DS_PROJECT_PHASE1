Sertraline is an antidepressant in a group of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Sertraline affects chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced and cause depression, panic, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Do not take sertraline if you have used an MAO inhibitor such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur, leading to serious side effects.
Sertraline is a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . Serotonin is a neurotransmitter â€” a chemical that relays signals between the cells in your brain. SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin in your brain, and this is how sertraline is thought to improve the symptoms of depression.
Zoloft is the brand name of sertraline, an antidepressant used to treat major depressive disorders. Zoloft is in a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

Sertraline is part of a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs for short. SSRIs act on a specific chemical within the brain known as serotonin. Serotonin is one of several chemicals used to send messages from one nerve cell to another. As a message travels down a nerve, it causes the end of the cell to release serotonin. Normally, this process works without any problems. But when the levels of serotonin become unbalanced, it can cause a variety of conditions, including depression and panic disorder. Sertraline helps to block the reuptake of serotonin so that more remains in the space between the brain's nerve cells.
