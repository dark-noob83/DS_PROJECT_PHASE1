Zigbee is a low power spin off of WiFi. It is a specification for small, low power radios based on IEEE 802.15.4 – 2003 Wireless Personal Area Networks standard. The specification was accepted and ratified by the Zigbee alliance in December 2004. Zigbee Alliance is a group of more than 300 companies including industry majors like Philips, Mitsubishi Electric, Epson, Atmel, Texas Instruments etc. which are committed towards developing and promoting this standard.
ZigBee is the wireless language that everyday devices use to connect to one another. ZigBee Keeps You Secure. ZigBee watches your home when you can’t, alerting you to intruders, smoke, carbon monoxide, even water leaks. Protecting the things-and people-you care about.
ZigBee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones. ZigBee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking. ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device. ZigBee is the only standards-based wireless technology designed to address the unique needs of device-to-device communication in just about any market. ‘ZigBee’ means two things: 1  A global alliance of companies founded in 2002. 2  A specification for interoperable, low-cost wireless device communication
Pioneered by Philips Semiconductors, ZigBee is a low data rate, two-way standard for home automation and data networks. The ZigBee standard uses small very low-power devices to connect together to form a wireless control web. A ZigBee network is capable of supporting up to 254 client nodes plus one full functional device (master).
ZigBee is a wireless networking standard that is aimed at remote control and sensor applications which is suitable for operation in harsh radio environments and in isolated locations. ZigBee technology builds on IEEE standard 802.15.4 which defines the physical and MAC layers. Above this, ZigBee defines the application and security layer specifications enabling interoperability between products from different manufacturers. In this way ZigBee is a superset of the 802.15.4 specification. With the applications for remote wireless sensing and control growing rapidly it is estimated that the market size could reach hundreds of millions of dollars as early as 2007
ZigBee is a low-cost, low-power, wireless mesh network standard targeted at wide development of long battery life devices in wireless control and monitoring applications. Zigbee devices have low latency, which further reduces average current. The current ZigBee protocols support beacon and non-beacon enabled networks. In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted CSMA/CA channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, ZigBee Routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring a more robust power supply.

The technology defined by the ZigBee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The current ZigBee protocols support beacon and non-beacon enabled networks. In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted CSMA/CA channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, ZigBee Routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring a more robust power supply.
ZigBee is a wireless communication standard based on a standard network architecture using an OSI model through an IEEE 802.15.4-2006 IP layer. In plain English, ZigBee signals operate like network signals and most closely resemble Bluetooth and WiFI. ZigBee devices have been slow in gaining acceptance in the home automation market. This is largely because, since ZigBee devices are open-source, devices from one manufacturer sometimes have difficulty communicating with devices from a different manufacturer.
ZigBee is a IEEE 802.15.4 -based specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios. The current ZigBee protocols support beacon and non-beacon enabled networks. In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted CSMA/CA channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, ZigBee Routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring a more robust power supply.
