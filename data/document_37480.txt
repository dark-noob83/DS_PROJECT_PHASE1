Energy companies running the new nuclear power plants will have to pay the costs for decommissioning existing sites, and pay their share of waste management costs, the government has said. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has said the cost will be 72bn over 20 years-up from an estimate two years ago of 56bn. Critics, such as Greenpeace, say that the bill for building new waste dumps will be a further 21bn and then 30bn to build the new nuclear power stations. Once built, nuclear power plants have advantages. In a gas-fired plant, the gas alone makes up 80% of the cost of electricity. So firms and consumers are very exposed to the wholesale price of gas. But at a nuclear power plant, the fuel is processed uranium, accounting for just 10% of the cost of production.
Meanwhile, Mark Cooper, from the University of Vermont Law School, said earlier this year that the overnight cost might be in the $7,000-to-$8,000 per kilowatt range, with the all-in cost of a 2-gigawatt nuclear plant including financing running around $20 billion to $25 billion -- in other words, $10 or more per watt. 
4 Other recently announced nuclear power plant costs estimates are in the same range as Florida Power & Light. For example, Progress Energy has projected a cost of about $10.5 billion for two new nuclear units with financing costs bringing the total up to about $13-14 billion. Companies that are planning new nuclear units are currently indicating that the total costs (including escalation and financing costs) will be in the range of $5,500/kW to $8,100/kW or between $6 billion and $9 billion for each 1,100 MW plant.
It costs around 7 billion dollars and 12+ years to build a Nuclear power plant with a single reactor. The cost all depends on the type of power plant and number of reactors it â€¦ has. Some power plants have 6 reactors. I'm not even sure how much that would cost. Maybe 10-15 billion dollars. 
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: It is estimated a new nuclear plant built today in the US would cost $10-12 billion for a 1500-1600 MW plant. Then once you have the plant built, one load of fuel bundles would cost approx. $150 to $200 million
This increased their construction costs from $938 per installed kW to $2,959 per installed kW. The lesson, in other words, is simple. The historical record, along with new projections from actual utilities and energy consultants, implies that industry cost estimates for new nuclear power plants cannot be trusted. Researchers from the Keystone Center, a nonpartisan think tank, consulted with 27 nuclear power companies and contractors, and concluded in June 2007 that the cost for building new reactors would be between $3,600 and $4,000 per installed kW (with interest).
For a typical 1,000 MWe BWR or PWR, the approximate cost of fuel for one reload (replacing one third of the core) is about $40 million, based on an 18-month refueling cycle. The average fuel cost at a nuclear power plant in 2014 was 0.76 cents / kWh. Because nuclear plants refuel every 18-24 months, they are not subject to fuel price volatility like natural gas and oil power plants. Fuel costs make up 30 percent of the overall production costs of nuclear power plants. Fuel costs for coal, natural gas and oil, however, make up about 80 percent of the production costs.
Modeling a nuclear power plant as an annuity costing an initial $4 billion with a 40 year life and interest rate of 11% (corresponding to approximately 50-50 debt/equity split) results in a total cost of more than $17 billion over the life of the loan. While a natural gas power plant could be constructed for as little as $850/kW, recent estimates put construction of a nuclear power plant at $4000/kW. [2] This estimate means a 1 GW plant should cost about $4 billion if financed by a lump upfront payment.
Between 2002 and 2008, for example, cost estimates for new nuclear plant construction rose from between $2 billion and $4 billion per unit to $9 billion per unit, according to a 2009 UCS report, while experience with new construction in Europe has seen costs continue to soar.
