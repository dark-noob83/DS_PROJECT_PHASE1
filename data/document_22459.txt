The specific heat of water is 1 calorie/gram °C = 4.186 joule/gram °C which is higher than any other common substance. As a result, water plays a very important role in temperature regulation. The specific heat per gram for water is much higher than that for a metal, as described in the water-metal example. For most purposes, it is more meaningful to compare the molar specific heats of substances.
When specific heats are measured on a per-gram basis, lighter molecules have higher specific heats. For example, the specific heat of hydrogen (H2), which has a molecular weight of 2 grams per mole, is much higher than that of water.
Specific Heat Capacity, c The specific heat capacity of a substance, c, is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 o C. Specific heat capacity is a physical characteristic property. Different substances have differ ent specific heats. Water has a very high specific heat: it takes 4.19 J to raise the temperature of 1 g or 1 ml of water by 1 o C. Most metals, on the other hand, have much lower specific heats. Cu's c value is only 0.39 J/(g C).
Almost all other substances have lower specific heats than water does. Specific heat is defined in terms of one gram of substance and a one degree temperature rise, but of course it is applied to other-sized samples and other temperature changes.
Lucky for me, you, and our fish in the pond, water does indeed have a very high specific heat capacity. The specific heat of water is the amount of heat needed to raise its temperature a certain amount. One of water's most significant properties is that it takes a lot of heat to it to make it get hot.
The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one Celsius degree is call the “specific heat” or “specific heat capacity” of that substance. For pure water, that amount is one calorie, which is equivalent to 4.184 joules.
