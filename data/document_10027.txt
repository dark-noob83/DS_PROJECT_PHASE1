Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys. The upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 IU/day for infants, 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day for children 1-8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children 9 years and older, adults, and pregnant and lactating teens and women. Vitamin D toxicity almost always occurs from overuse of supplements. 
Consuming the required amount of vitamin A daily helps maintain overall health. Infants up to 6 months need 400 micrograms of vitamin A per day, while infants between ages 7 months and 12 months require 500 micrograms per day. For children aged 1 to 2 years, the recommended daily allowance, or RDA, for vitamin A is 300 micrograms. Children from the ages of 4 to 8 should consume 400 micrograms each day, whereas children from 9 to 13 need 600 micrograms daily.
No doubt about it, vitamin D is enjoying its time in the sun. In doctors' offices, testing for vitamin D levels, once a rarity, has become commonplace. And between 2002 and 2011, U.S. sales of vitamin D supplements jumped more than tenfold — from $42 million to $605 million — according to the Nutrition Business Journal. 
Adult men and women, including pregnant or nursing women, should consume 15 micrograms of vitamin D daily, according to the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board. Vitamin D intake can also be measured in International Units; by this measure, adults require 600 International Units daily. Seniors over 70 years of age have a higher RDA -- 800 International Units, or 20 micrograms, of vitamin D each day. 
This doubled the AAP's previous recommendation. The AAP also recommends 400 IU/day of vitamin D for children and teens who drink less than a quart of vitamin D-fortified milk per day. The Vitamin D Council recommends that healthy adults take 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily -- more if they get little or no sun exposure. There's evidence that people with a lot of body fat need more vitamin D than lean people. 
Vitamin A Pediatric Dosage. Infants up to 6 months need 400 micrograms of vitamin A per day, while infants between ages 7 months and 12 months require 500 micrograms per day. For children aged 1 to 2 years, the recommended daily allowance, or RDA, for vitamin A is 300 micrograms. Children from the ages of 4 to 8 should consume 400 micrograms each day, whereas children from 9 to 13 need 600 micrograms daily.
Fatty fish like salmon, tuna and mackerel also contain vitamin D as do beef liver, cheese and eggs, although in much smaller amounts. When it comes to sun exposure, most people only need five to 30 minutes of exposure to the sun twice a week. This can be on the face, arms, back or legs. 
People 50 to 70 years old should get 10 mcg daily (400 IU) daily, and those over 70 should get 15 mcg daily (600 IU). Based on recent research, Dr. Weil recommends 2,000 IU of vitamin D per day. 
Infants from birth to 12 months need less: 400 IU (10 mcg). After the age of 70, adults need 800 IU (20 mcg). People can get vitamin D from foods that are naturally rich in the vitamin, fortified foods, supplements and exposure to the sun. The safe upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 international units (IU) per day for infants. For children aged one to eight years, the safe upper limit is 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day, and 4,000 IU/day for children nine years and older, adults and pregnant and lactating teens and women.
