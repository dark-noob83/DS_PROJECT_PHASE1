Opium (poppy tears, lachryma papaveris) is the dried latex obtained from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). Opium latex contains approximately 12% of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for the illegal drug trade. The word  meconium  (derived from the Greek for opium-like, but now used to refer to infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies.

Today, about 40 percent of our prescription medicines come from plant extracts or synthesized plant compounds. plant-based medicines are everywhere, including the shelves of our local drugstores.Quinine (Malaria Drug) Derived from: Cinchona tree (cinchona pubescens) part used: Bark active ingredient: Quinine. The leaves can be used for tea, salads, and as an herb in foods. aspirin Derived from: Willow (salix) part of plant used: Bark active ingredient: Salicin, a compound that breaks down to become salicylic acid (aspirin). Salicylic acid (aspirin) is now synthesized.
Plants are the original source materials for as many as 40% of the pharmaceuticals in use in the United States today. This is to say that either the drugs currently contain plant-derived materials, or synthesized materials from agents originally derived from plants. Much of the current drug discovery and development process is plant-based, and new medicines derived from plants are inevitable. On this website, you will encounter a great deal of information about the non-pharmaceutical side of plant medicines.
1. Plant Sources: Plant source is the oldest source of drugs. Most of the drugs in ancient times were derived from plants. Almost all parts of the plants are used i.e. . leaves, stem, bark, fruits and roots.
There are over a hundred active ingredients derived from plants for use as drugs and medicines. This is by no means a comprehensive list of all of the plants, names of chemicals, or uses for those chemicals, but it should serve as a useful starting point for further research.
