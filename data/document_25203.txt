Medical Uses. Technetium, aside from its dangerous properties and deadly radioactivity, is used for many medical purposes. One of these purposes is the Technetium-99m Generator.Technetium-99m, a man made element and a type of technetium isotope, has been used as a radioisotope since 1958. Since all isotopes of technetium are radioactive so is technetium-99m. The radioisotope is used to diagnose diseased organs. The injection of the technetium-99m isotope gives off a certain type of radiation which show doctors which areas of the organ is diseased without causing radiation damage to the patient.
Technetium-99m can be readily detected in the body by medical equipment because it emits 140.5 keV gamma rays (these are about the same wavelength as emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment), and its half-life for gamma emission is six hours (meaning 94% of it decays to 99 Tc in 24 hours). Technetium-99m was discovered as a product of cyclotron bombardment of molybdenum. This procedure produced molybdenum-99, a radionuclide with a longer half-life (2.75 days), which decays to Tc-99m. At present, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is used commercially as the easily transportable source of medically used Tc-99m.
Technetium-95, with a half-life of 61 days, is used as a radioactive tracer. Technetium-99, has a very long half-life (2.11 X 10 5 years) and decays almost entirely by beta decay with no gamma rays. It is used as for equipment calibration. Uses of Technetium. Technetium-99m is a metastable isotope with a half-life of six hours. Technetium-99m emits gamma rays and low energy electrons, forming technetium-99 (half-life 211 000 years).
Technetium-99m. Technetium -99m is a widely used radioactive tracer isotope in Nuclear Medicine. It's gamma ray energy of about 140 keV is convenient for detection. The fact that both its physical half-life and its biological half-life are very short leads to very fast clearing from the body after an imaging process. Since 99 Mo is a fission product of 235 U fission, it can be separated from the other fission products and used to generate 99m Tc. For medical purposes, the 99m Tc is used in the form of pertechnate, TcO 4 - . The technetium isotope 99m Tc is unusual in that it has a half-life for gamma emission of 6.03 hours.
The following uses for technetium are gathered from a number of sources as well as from anecdotal comments. I'd be delighted to receive corrections as well as additional referenced uses (please use the feedback mechanism to add uses). 1  ammonium pertechnate, NH 4 TcO 4, is a specialist corrosion inhibitor for steel. 
Technetium-99m is a metastable nuclear isomer of technetium-99 (itself an isotope of technetium), symbolized as 99m Tc, that is used in tens of millions of medical diagnostic procedures annually, making it the most commonly used medical radioisotope. Technetium-99m was discovered as a product of cyclotron bombardment of molybdenum. This procedure produced molybdenum-99, a radionuclide with a longer half-life (2.75 days), which decays to Tc-99m. At present, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is used commercially as the easily transportable source of medically used Tc-99m.
Technetium (/tɛkˈniːʃiəm/) is a chemical element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the element with the lowest atomic number in the periodic table that has no stable isotopes: every form of it is radioactive. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts are found in nature. Technetium-99 (99 Tc) is a major product of the fission of uranium-235 (235 U), making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×10 8 disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62 G Bq /g).
Technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Technetium-99 (99 Tc) is a major product of the fission of uranium-235 (235 U), making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×10 8 disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62 G Bq /g).
Uses of Technetium-99m. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is used in a wide range of medical applications, such as distinguishing brain tumours. Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine, and about 90% of the procedures are for diagnosis.
