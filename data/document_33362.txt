There are actually 3 parts to this answer. First, choose a quality fertilizer, then apply the right amount (rate) and apply at the right time of the season. Quality nitrogen fertilizers should contain controlled-release nitrogen (see next question for more on this).
Since each lawn is different, you need to visually determine whether your lawn needs additional fertilizer, but most people can expect to fertilize again within three to four weeks of planting -- or when the grass is 1 to 1 1/2 inches tall. This encourages deep roots and inhibits weed growth.

When and how often you should apply fertilizer to your lawn depends on the type of grass you grow. Grasses need nitrogen and other nutrients during their seasons of active growth, and they grow best with an even supply. Fertilize grasses when it’s naturally dormant, and you’re wasting fertilizer.
And fertilizer is actually not food for your lawn, it is actually the building blocks that the lawn plants use to put their parts together. And the basic ingredients are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. And when you break down, the nitrogen, think green. Nitrogen is for the green parts, the blades of the plants.
Do not use a weed-and-feed product as your second application of fertilizer because most weed-and-feed products contain herbicides that inhibit seed germination.This includes pre-emergent herbicides such as crabgrass preventer and postemergent herbicides used to control broadleaf weeds.
