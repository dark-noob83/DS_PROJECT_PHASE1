Henry Bessemer-The Steel Man. Englishmen, Sir Henry Bessemer (1813-1898) invented the first process for mass-producing steel inexpensively, essential to the development of skyscrapers.
Bessemer was knighted in 1879 for his contribution to science. The Bessemer Process for mass-producing steel, was named after Bessemer. The inventor, Sir Henry Bessemer on the making of the first steel ingot: More on Steel. Robert Mushet invented tungsten steel in 1868. Henry Brearly invented stainless steel in 1916.
The process of refining molten iron with blasts of air was accomplished by the British inventor Sir Henry Bessemer who developed the Bessemer furnace, or converter, in 1855. He was a prolific inventor, but is best known for his process for the manufacture of steel.
Bessemer converter, schematic diagram. The Bessemer process was the first inexpensive industrial process for the mass-production of steel from molten pig iron prior to the open hearth furnace. The key principle is removal of impurities from the iron by oxidation with air being blown through the molten iron.
Discovered in 1855 by Sir Henry Bessemer. The Bessemer process was discovered through Sir Henryâ€™s attempts to manufacture steel faster and more cheaply. Particularly for the purpose of manufacturing military weapons, which were at the time made with iron, which is considerably heavier than steel.
Sir Henry Bessemer was a prominent British engineer, inventor and entrepreneur. He developed the first cost-efficient process for the manufacture of steel in 1856, which later led to the invention of Bessemer converter.
