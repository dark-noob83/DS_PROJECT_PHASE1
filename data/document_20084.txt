In general, it's fine to continue exercising during pregnancy. But your exercise program should be conducted under the supervision of your doctor or midwife, who will monitor how much you do and how it affects your baby.
Dance during pregnancy is a safe way to exercise, stay fit, and have fun. Most healthy women can dance throughout their pregnancy. The following tips will help you have a safe and rewarding experience.
QUESTION. Dear Fitness Expert, I am about 4 weeks pregnant and am a Polynesian dancer.
