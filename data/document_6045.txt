Profile of a Pediatrician. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in care of children aged 17 and under. In most cases children receive the care of a pediatrician from as early as the day they are born until they turn 18 years of age. At this time the patient will begin seeing a practitioner who specializes in the care of adults. Becoming a pediatrician is not a complicated process but it is by no means an easy one either. Before beginning a practice as a pediatrician a number of steps must be taken. The first step is to enter a college program, ideally in a pre-medicine program.
A pediatrician commonly starts his/her day in the Newborn Nursery at the local hospital, examining newborns within 24 hours of birth. After a break for lunch, the day continues until 4 or 5 pm. In addition to seeing patients in the office, during the day, a Pediatrician will likely have to spend some time doing administrative work, giving advice on the phone, filling out forms and doing other paperwork, doing research and sometimes teaching.
One of the things we have to address is what a typical day is like as a pediatric nurse. I've looked online and haven't been able to find anything other than just a list of the kinds of things they do, but I'm looking for more of a daily schedule. The first rule of pediatric nursing is that there is no typical day. Your patients are so diverse they can have any number of conditions. Peds covers patients from birth to age 18. One day you might have a newborn and a toddler. The next day you might have two teenagers.
Dr. Mortimer Childers is a pediatrician at St. Shmoop Children's Hospital. (In case you're wondering, St. Shmoop is the patron saint of standardized testing.) He wakes up at 5:30, eats a bowl of Fruit Loops (filled with vitamin F and natural Toucan proteins), and drinks a glass of chocolate milk. Before lunch, he does three immunizations, writes prescriptions for five kids with colds (must be going around), and treats one sprained thumb. The thumb belongs to an 8-year-old boy named Jonathan who sustained his injury while playing Wii Mario Kart.
Most Pediatricians in primary care have a fairly typical day, which generally begins with seeing patients in the hospital before starting … their day in their office. In the hospital, a Pediatrician might have new babies to see in the newborn nursery or he might have to see sick patients admitted to the hospital. After 'making rounds' in the hospital, Pediatricians usually begin seeing patients in their office at about 8 or 9 am. After a break for lunch, the day continues until 4 or 5 pm. In addition to seeing patients in the office, during the day, a Pediatrician will likely have to spend some time doing administrative work, giving advice on the phone, filling out forms and doing other paperwork, doing research and sometimes teaching.
[See a typical day for a first year med student and a medical intern .]. Below, in MacAdam's own words, is her typical timeline: 6:00 a.m. — Alarm rings—hit snooze. Today I have nursery rounds, so I slap on some scrubs and head out the door to the hospital.

They moved place to place looking for jobs. The workers asked to stay at a home, but it always came with a price. And … that price was work. The workers had to do a job and once they were finished they could stay at the place for the night.
