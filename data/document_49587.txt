Bake for 30 to 40 minutes: Transfer the chicken to the oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is completely opaque all the way through and registers 165°F on an instant-read thermometer. Serve: Serve the chicken immediately, or let it cool and refrigerate for up to a week.
Boneless chicken. Boneless chicken doesn't need as much cooking time in the oven and can become overcooked and flavourless if you dont keep an eye on it. A 113-gram boneless chicken piece will take about 20 to 30 minutes in a 350-degree oven. Some boneless chicken pieces weigh up to 227 grams, so you can either increase the cooking time or slice horizontally through the side of each chicken piece to make two 113-gram pieces.
Cooking time is generally 20 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken registers 165°F in the thickest part. Amazingly, all the chicken pieces wind up cooking at about the same rate — dark meat pieces cook a bit slower than white meat, but the thickness of the breast meat means everything finishes around the same time.
Chicken pieces. Cutting a chicken into individual pieces can reduce its cooking time; however, some pieces require more cooking time in the oven than others. Thighs and wings need to cook at 200ºC for a minimum of 40 minutes, while drumsticks require about 25-30 minutes. Breasts have a cooking time of 15 minutes.
Place the chicken breast side up in the roasting pan and slide it into the preheated oven. Cook the chicken for 20 minutes per pound plus an additional 15 minutes. Check the chicken's temperature by inserting an instant read thermometer into the meaty part of the thigh.
Step 2: Bake the chicken pieces. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the chicken pieces, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until no longer pink (internal temperature should be 170 degrees F for chicken breasts, 180 degrees F for thighs and drumsticks). To store: Let the baked chicken stand for 30 minutes to cool.
