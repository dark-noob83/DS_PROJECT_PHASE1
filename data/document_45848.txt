The Moon is exceptionally large relative to Earth: a quarter its diameter and 1/81 its mass. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, though Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto, at 1/9 Pluto's mass. This allows the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence. The Moon's linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ± 0.07 centimetres (1.504 ± 0.028 in) per year, but this rate is not constant.
Earth is classified as the largest of the terrestrial planets based on its circumference and diameter as well. At the equator, Earth's circumference is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 km). It is slightly smaller between the North and South poles at 24,859.82 miles (40,008 km). As the largest of the terrestrial planets, Earth has an estimated mass of 5.9736 × 10 24 kg. Its volume is also the largest of these planets at 108.321 × 10 10 km 3. In addition, Earth is the densest of the terrestrial planets as it is made up of a crust, mantle and core.
What is the actual size of a centimeter? 1 cm = 10 mm It is 1/100 of a meter. The actual length of a meter was originally meant to be one ten millionth of the distance between the Equator and the North Pole. It is n … ow defined in terms of the speed of light. 2.54 cm = 1 inch 1 cm = 0.394 in. 17 people found this useful. If it can display 12 digits, the largest number you can calculate on it is 999,999,999,999. The scientific calculators which support scientific notation can usually calculate numbers up to 9.999999 x 1099.
Earth's moon is the brightest object in our night sky. It appears quite large, but that is only because it is the closest celestial body. The moon is a bit more than one-fourth (27 percent) the size of Earth, a much smaller ratio (1:4) than any other planets and their moons. Earth's moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system.
Earth's Size. As the largest of the terrestrial planets, Earth has an estimated mass of 5.9736 × 10 24 kg. Its volume is also the largest of these planets at 108.321 × 10 10 km 3. In addition, Earth is the densest of the terrestrial planets as it is made up of a crust, mantle and core.
satellite, natural. satellite, natural, celestial body orbiting a planet, dwarf planet, asteroid, or star of a larger size. The most familiar natural satellite is the earth's moon; thus, satellites of other planets are often referred to as moons. 
In our solar system, the sun. Planetwise, Jupiter. Update: The largest known celestial body is Sloan Great Wall, which is a giant wall of galaxies. The wall measures 1.37 billion light years in length and is located approximately one billion light-years from Earth. As a single object, the red hypergiant star, VY Canis Majoris, is largest
Report Abuse. The Milky Way, BY FAR! To give you an idea of size: Our sun, the next biggest celestial object on your list, is about 870,000 miles in diameter. The Milky Way's diameter is about 600,000, 000, 000,000 ,000 miles in diameter! Or in more practical terms: If the sun were the size of a large pin-head, the Milky Way would extend from the Earth to nearly twice the distance to the moon. screaming monk · 8 years ago.
Ceres (/ˈsɪəriːz/ ; minor-planet designation: 1 Ceres) is the largest object in the asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its diameter is approximately 945 kilometers (587 miles), making it the largest of the minor planets within the orbit of Neptune. The thirty-third largest known body in the Solar System, it is the only one identified orbiting entirely within the orbit of Neptune that is a dwarf planet.
