I can share that the average amount spent on a wedding gift in 2014 through RegistryFinder.com was $120. If you choose to buy from the couple's wedding registry, we recommend purchasing early, so you have the best selection of gifts and price ranges. We just don't know how much we are expected to spend on a wedding gift. Unfortunately, there's no simple answer and no set amount you should spend (or amount you should give if gifting cash). The amount you spend is dependent upon your budget and relationship with the wedding couple (or their parents).
According to the American Express survey, the average wedding gift is $144 for a family member and $97 for a close friend. More affluent wedding guests give an average wedding gift worth $251 for any wedding they attend, while co-workers come in at the low end of the scale at an average of $66. Not surprisingly, the more removed a wedding guest is from the bride and groom, the smaller their wedding gift tends to be. The average wedding gift for a family member is around $150 per person – so something in the order of $200 – $400 for the both of you would be reasonable – depending on the venue and style of the wedding.

Guests in New York will spend an average of $172 on a gift this year, while those in Florida will dish out $148 and Californians will expend $116.
Despite the increased costs, attendees are actually spending a little less on the gift, about $106, compared to the average of $109 in 2014.
