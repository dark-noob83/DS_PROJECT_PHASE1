When you receive a job offer, it's important to take the time to carefully evaluate the offer so you are making an educated decision to accept, or to reject, the offer. The last thing you want to do is to make a hasty decision that you will regret later on.
Once you receive a job offer, many companies will expect a decision within two or three days, and more than a few will ask for an answer within 24 hours.
Before accepting a job, be sure that you are clear on the hours and schedule you need to work. Also, confirm what, if any, travel is involved. If the position requires 45 or 50 hours of work a week and you're used to working 35 hours, consider whether you will have difficulty committing to the schedule. If the nature of the job requires that you will need to be on the road three days a week, be sure that you can commit to that, as well.
Acceptance and Rejection Letters. Whether you are accepting, or rejecting, a job offer, it's a good idea to let the company know your decision in writing. In both cases, be polite, brief and to the point. Here are sample letters to review: 1  Job Acceptance Letter.
Here’s how long you can take to answer a job offer, and what you should consider before you say yes or no. The job offer itself. Most job offers have an expiration date. Either the recruiter/employer will outright tell you over the phone or through email, or the job offer letter will specify a deadline. It’s usually one week after you get offered the job — that’s a standard time to “think it over” and come to a decision.
