Etymology: Gk, protos + zoon, animal. a unicellular protist that ingests food. Protozoa include free-living forms, such as amebas and paramecia, as well as parasites. Approximately 30 protozoa are pathogenic to humans, including Plasmodium, which causes malaria, and Trypanosoma, which causes sleeping sickness.
The taxonomic kingdom Protista is a collection of single-celled organisms that do not fit into any other category. Protists are a group made up of protozoa, unicellular algae, and slime molds. We will concentrate on the animal portion of this group: the protozoa (proto = first, zoa = animals). Protozoa are the oldest known group of heterotrophic life that consume and transform complex food particles into energy.
Phylum Protozoa. Paramecium, A Unicellular Animal. There's no doubt about it that the earliest forms of life were simple unicellular organisms and in that respect protozoans must be considered the earliest animals. Many of these have survived the longest geological periods with very little change.
Paramecium, A Unicellular Animal. There's no doubt about it that the earliest forms of life were simple unicellular organisms and in that respect protozoans must be considered the earliest animals.
Amoeba is a typical example of a simple unicellular animal. Paramecium is a much more complicated protozoan, but still its body never attains the complexity found in larger animals. Protozoans are mostly aquatic, fresh water or marine, but some are found in damp places, and a number of them are parasites.
2) Kingdom Protista: unicellular animal-like organisms. 3) Animal-like characteristics of Protozoa. a) Unicellular (negative) are not true animals (zygotes of animals are). b) Microscope (actually a lot of multicellular, true animals). c) Lots of diversity regard shape and symmetry.
