Synapse Energy Economics, Inc. 2015 Carbon Dioxide Price Forecast 32  The Low case forecasts a CO 2 price that begins in 2020 at $15 per ton, and increases to $25 in 2030 and $45 in 2050, representing a $26 per ton levelized price over the period 2020‐2050.  The Mid case forecasts a CO 2 price that begins in 2020 at $20 per ton, and increases to $35 in 2030 and $85 in 2050, representing a $41 per ton levelized price over the period 2020‐2050. This forecast represents a scenario in which federal policies are implemented with significant but reasonably achievable goals.
Gallons of water per metric ton   A metric ton (1000 kg) of water occupies exactly one cubic meter. One cubic meter is 264.17 gallons. 17 people found this useful. Edit. (Tonne is metric) Therefore answer is 2240 divided by 10 = 224 … Gallon. A US gallon of pure water weighs approximately 8.34 pounds, therefore a 2000 pound US ton of water would contain approximately 239.8 gallons.
All annual allowance prices and levelized values are reported in 2014 dollars per short ton of CO 2.  The Low case forecasts a CO 2 price that begins in 2020 at $15 per ton, and increases to $25 in 2030 and $45 in 2050, representing a $26 per ton levelized price over the period 2020‐2050.  The Mid case forecasts a CO 2 price that begins in 2020 at $20 per ton, and increases to $35 in 2030 and $85 in 2050, representing a $41 per ton levelized price over the period 2020‐2050.

Split and merge into it. Answer by Alex146. Confidence votes 36.8K. The density of Hydrochloric Acid varies from 6.421 pounds per US gallon (at 10% HCl to H2O) to 9.901 pounds per US gallon (at 38%) At what strength. Minor edit? 
This is Semiconductor Grade material (equivalent to Reagent. Grade). Background: Hydrochloric acid is the solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in water. It is a highly corrosive, strong mineral acid and has major industrial uses. It is found naturally in gastric acid. Historically called muriatic acid or spirits of salt, hydrochloric acid was First produced from vitriol and common salt. 
A weak oil industry and an oversupply of HCl caused a sharp decline in prices last year, but both of those factors have turned around sharply this year. A recent nomination of $15 per ton in the US and C$30 per ton in Canada has raised byproduct wet acid to $55 to $75 per ton and burner acid to $75 to $95 per ton. Mr. Smith rates the average weighted price for byproduct muriatic acid at $65 per ton. Consumers have generally accepted the increase. In 1999, muriatic acid pricing collapsed from $75 per ton to $45 because wet acid demand failed to keep up with plant expansions for MDI and TDI. In addition, oil drilling declined as crude oil fell to around $9 per barrel. Spot prices for crude oil recently peaked at $38 per barrel before settling back to $32.
Olin is one of many HCl producers that supported the most recent price nomination.

The December 2014 clearing price was the highest‐ever clearing price at a RGGI auction. In 2015, the number of cost containment reserve allowances will rise from 5 million to 10 million, alongside an increase in the trigger price from $4 to $6 per short ton.  The Mid case forecasts a CO 2 price that begins in 2020 at $20 per ton, and increases to $35 in 2030 and $85 in 2050, representing a $41 per ton levelized price over the period 2020‐2050.
