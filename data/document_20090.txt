This process is called chemosynthesis and involves the use of chemical substances for the production of energy. Heterotrophic bacteria, in contrast, cannot synthesize their own energy and must consume organic matter for energy.
Autotrophic bacteria describes a diverse group of microorganisms that are able to make their own energy. To make the energy essential for life and everyday functioning, the bacteria take inorganic substances and turn them into organic substances that can be broken down.
Diffen › Science › Biology. Autotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food from the substances available in their surroundings using light (photosynthesis) or chemical energy (chemosynthesis). Heterotrophs cannot synthesize their own food and rely on other organisms — both plants and animals — for nutrition.
Autotrophs are self feeders that use light or chemical energy to make food. Plants are an example of autotrophs. In contrast, heterotrophs (other feeders) obtain energy from other autotrophs or heterotrophs. Many bacteria and animals are
Maybe that is why they are one of the oldest forms of life on earth. Autotrophic species are photosynthetic like plants. Heterotrophic species get their energy from organic carbon compounds in much the same way as yeast, bacteria and animals. Mixotrophic species can use sunlight or organic carbon, whatever they can get.
Organisms are divided into autotrophs and heterotrophs according to their energy pathways. Autotrophs are those organisms that are able to make energy-containing organic molecules from inorganic raw material by using basic energy sources such as sunlight. Plants are the prime example of autotrophs, using photosynthesis.
