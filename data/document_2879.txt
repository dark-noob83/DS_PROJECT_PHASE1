Water-soluble vitamins are absorbed in the upper small intestine. Bacteria in the large intestine synthesize many water-soluble vitamins; however lower intestinal bacterial synthesis of vitamins is not a major source of vitamins for humans.
Some vitamins are also synthesized by bacteria in the lower intestine, although their contribution to absorbed vitamins is not likely very large. Photo Credit roobcio/iStock/Getty Images.
Vitamin K: One of two naturally occurring fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin K1 and vitamin K2) needed for the clotting of blood because of an essential role in the production of prothrombin (a clotting factor).
Present in many natural foods, including dark-green vegetables (spinach!), beef, eggs, whole grains. Also synthesized by intestinal bacteria. Serves as a coenzyme in the synthesis of several amino acids, as well as purines and thymine, and therefore DNA. Deficiency is typically manifest as growth failure and anemia.
There are two sources of this essential vitamin, including vitamin K1, or phylloquinone which is primarily found in green leafy vegetables and vitamin K2 or menaquinone which is synthesized by certain intestinal bacteria.
Vitamin K 1 or phylloquinone is synthesized by plants and is the predominant form in the diet. Vitamin K 2 includes a range of vitamin K forms collectively referred to as menaquinones. Most menaquinones are synthesized by human intestinal microbiota and found in fermented foods and in animal products.
There are 4 forms of vitamin D, and the important ones are synthesized by the reaction between UV rays and cholesterol in our skin. Vitamin K2 is synthesized in the guts by b â€¦ acteria. Vitamin B3 Niacin is synthesized in small amounts by gut bacteria. Vitamin B5 Pantothenic Acid is synthesized in small amounts by gut bacteria. Vitamin B7 Biotin is synthesized in small amounts by gut bacteria. Vitamin B9 Folic Acid is synthesized in small amounts by gut bacteria. Vitamin B12 is synthesized in the guts by bacteria.
