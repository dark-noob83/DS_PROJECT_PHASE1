Structural Analysis. A truss bridge is a bridge composed of connected elements (typically straight) which may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to loads. Truss bridges are one of the oldest types of modern bridges. The basic types of truss bridges are shown below.
Basics of Truss Bridges. Truss is a formation produced by triangular components, in accordance with the truss bridge drawings, and coupled at joints known as nodes. The triangular units forming the truss are slim and straight in form.
A truss bridge is one form that a bridge can take and there are at least 30 different kinds of truss bridges, including the Warren, Pratt, and Howe designs among others. Truss bridges can have any of the 3 span types including simple, continuous, or cantilever.
(In order, below.). A truss bridge is a bridge composed of connected elements (typically straight) which may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to loads. Truss bridges are one of the oldest types of modern bridges. The basic types of truss bridges are shown below.
Truss bridges are amongst a variety of bridge designs that are being used for road traffic. The basic shape of a truss bridge is like a right triangle, with the hypotenuse extending to the abutments. There are two similar trusses at each of the road sides.
Thus, for the most part, all beams in a truss bridge are straight. Trusses are comprised of many small beams that together can support a large amount of weight and span great distances. In most cases the design, fabrication, and erection of trusses is relatively simple.
Truss bridge is a type of bridge whose main element is a truss which is a structure of connected elements that form triangular units. Truss is used because it is a very rigid structure and it transfers the load from a single point to a much wider area.
