When they click 'OK' they are then given this error: There were no pages selected to print.. I'm no expert so I have no idea why it only happens to some PDFs and not all. The servers that the users run off are identical, but some servers DONT have the issue, and some DO. So that makes this issue even stranger.
For a while now, Adobe Acrobat or the free Adobe Reader will in some instances display an error message that suggests that there were no pages selected to print when the user tries to print any PDF document. 
Print selected PDF pages. Open the PDF in Adobe Reader or Acrobat. Open the Pages tab on the left side of the document window if it isn't already open. Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the page thumbnails you want to print. 
up vote 4 down vote favorite. When I try to print a PDF I get a message box that says the document could not be printed. I then get another message box that says there were no pages selected to print. The sender could print it. Other users on same computer are unable to print their docs but I can print from Word. With the targeted PDF file opened in Adobe Reader, click print. In the printer dialog window, I have Adobe PDF listed as a possible selection for available printers. Choosing that and clicking print would bring up another window to let you type in the file name and location for the new PDF file to be saved.

After getting some more details I find they are working is Adobe Reader and attempting to print a PDF file. The error states that “Document cannot be printed” which gets points for being descriptive and when you click ok you get another error that says: “There were no pages selected to print.” Now that seems promising. Except the person did select pages and in some cases selected exact pages they wanted printed.

I changed to using a network name (rather than IP address) for the printer mapping and it installed a printer driver for this new printer onto the local xp box-all then worked ok. Strange, as I have previously printed from acrobat fine using the IP address mapping. So either changing to the network name or the fact that the printer driver was reinstalled, cured the problem. BTW: I have also seen something similar happen on a printer at work (again on a system that had worked fine previously).
Customer Question. I am suddenly unable to print any aobe acrobat pdf, though I can still print windows file attachments. I hit print and get an adobe reader error message: The document could not be printed. I hit Okay (the only option) and then get the message: There were no pages selected to print. (I've tried every page selection possible.) I hit okay and nothing happens. This includes all received email attachments and past scans.
