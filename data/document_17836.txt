1 The Difference Between Cerebral Cortex and Cerebrum A human's central nervous system is comprised of the brain and spinal cord. 2  Among the parts of the brain, the cerebral cortex assists with higher functions such as sensory an…. 3  The Five Major Parts of the Brain At its most basic, the brain controls the body. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. A Ridge/Hill is called a Gyrus (pl Gyri) and a cleft/valley is called a Sulcus (pl Sulci). Some of the Gyri and Sulci are individually named for example look at the cerebrum from a lateral view. You should see one fairly distinct vertical sulcus roughly in the middle of the brain (it will not be straight but reasonably obviously vertical. This is called the Central Sulcus
1 The major portion of the brain, the cerebrum, develops during this second stage of CNS development. 2  The cerebrum has two parts: the outer layer (cerebral cortex) and the inner layer (cerebral medulla). 3  The cerebrum is the structure most of us picture when we think about what a brain looks like. The Central Nervous System (CNS), which consists of the brain and spinal cord, is in charge of how our bodies function. The CNS takes in, interprets and sends out signals.
The cerebrum -- which is just Latin for brain -- is the newest (evolutionarily) and largest part of the brain as a whole. It is here that things like perception, imagination, thought, judgment, and decision occur. The surface of the cerebrum -- the cerebral cortex -- is composed of six thin layers of neurons, which sit on top of a large collection of white matter pathways. The cortex is heavily convoluted, so that if you were to spread it out, it would actually take up about 2 1/2 square feet (2500 sq cm). Some of the sulci are quite pronounced and long, and serve as convenient boundaries between four areas of the cerebrum called lobes. The furthest forward is the frontal lobe (from the Latin word for forehead).

The convolutions have ridges which are called gyri (singular: gyrus), and valleys which are called sulci (singular: sulcus). Some of the sulci are quite pronounced and long, and serve as convenient boundaries between four areas of the cerebrum called lobes. The furthest forward is the frontal lobe (from the Latin word for forehead).
Anatomy. The cerebrum is a large, folded mass of nervous tissue that makes up the majority of the human brain. Many ridges of cerebral tissue, called gyri (singular: gyrus), extend from the surface of the cerebrum and are bordered by grooves in the cerebrum.... Click to read more below. The cerebrum is the most superior and anterior of the brain’s major regions. It is the seat of reason, planning, memory, and sensory integration. All conscious thought originates in the cerebrum and can influence the subconscious functions of the lower regions of the brain.
