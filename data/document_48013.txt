Understanding your menstrual cycle. Your menstrual cycle begins on the first day of your period and continues up to the first day of your next period. You are most fertile at the time of ovulation, (when an egg is released from your ovaries) which usually occurs 12-14 days before your next period starts.
One of your ovaries will release an egg (ovulation) about 12 to 14 days before your period starts. The first day of your period, when you start bleeding, is counted as the first day of your cycle. If you have a 28-day cycle, you'll usually ovulate some time between day 12 and day 16 of your cycle. During your period an egg is usually developing, ready for release mid-cycle. The time it takes for an egg to mature within the ovary can vary. This means that the day you ovulate can also vary from cycle to cycle. If your cycle is short, 22 days for example, then you could ovulate just days after your period, if your period lasted seven days. The longest that sperm can survive in fertile cervical mucus is seven days. So it may just be possible for you to get pregnant if you ovulate a little earlier than usual
During your window of ovulation, an egg is only available to be fertilized for about 12-24 hours. But since sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days after sex, and the egg is available for one day, your most fertile time is considered to be about 5-7 days. Keep in mind that while you cannot technically ovulate while on a period, because sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days after sex, pregnancy could occur from intercourse that takes place during a period.
The Association estimates that ovulation occurs anywhere between 11-21 days after the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), or 12-16 days from when you expect the next menstrual period to start.

Keep in mind that while you cannot technically ovulate while on a period, because sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days after sex, pregnancy could occur from intercourse that takes place during a period.
I had a miscarriage a couple months ago and I ovulated the day after my period ended. I had a positive home pregnancy test on day 14 of my cycle. So it IS possible. Also, not everyone has their period 14 days after ovulation. My cycles are anywhere from 28-32 days, so it looks like it's about 21-26 days after ovulation.
The number of days in your cycle is calculated by counting the number of days from the beginning of one period to the beginning of the next period. If you have a short cycle, for example 21 days, and you bleed for 7 days, then you could ovulate right after your period. Keep in mind that while you cannot technically ovulate while on a period, because sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days after sex, pregnancy could occur from intercourse that takes place during a period.
Ovulation can occur when you experience mid-cycle or ovulatory bleeding. Keep in mind that while you cannot technically ovulate while on a period, because sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days after sex, pregnancy could occur from intercourse that takes place during a period.
If you have a five day period, for example you would have ovulated on day 8 (3 days after your 5 day period), which would be very early. If your menstrual period is 7 days, then you could be at day 13 when you ovulated, which is right in the window of acceptable ovulation. So, that piece of information is critical to accurately answer your question. If you did ovulate on day 9, let's say (6 day period + 3) it'd be early. If you are ovulating early, you may have a hormone imbalance that is shortening your follicular phase (from period to ovulation) and that can mean that your are ovulating (releasing an egg) before it is fully mature

However, only one egg will predominate and be release when you ovulate. For the average menstrual cycle, which is 28-32 days ovulation occurs on day 14
