adenosine diphosphate (ADP) a nucleotide, adenosine 5′-pyrophosphate, produced by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is then converted back to ATP by the metabolic processes oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. a compound derived from nucleic acid, composed of adenine and a sugar, d-ribose. Adenosine is the major molecular component of the nucleotides adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate, and adenosine triphosphate and of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.
Energy transfer used by all living things is a result of dephosphorylation of ATP by enzymes known as ATPases. The cleavage of a phosphate group from ATP results in the coupling of energy to metabolic reactions and a by-product, a molecule of ADP. The two phosphate groups of ADP are added in series to the 5’ carbon of the sugar backbone, while the adenosine molecule attaches to the 1’ carbon.
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is an organic molecule involved in the central part of the metabolism of the cell that generates energy. It is interconvertible with the cell’s energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine diphosphate is a nucleotide composed of adenosine, which is comprised of the base adenine and the sugar ribose. ADP also has the two phosphate groups. The basic structure of this molecule is similar to a base that is part of DNA or RNA.
ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). 1  It is the major energy currency of the cell, providing the energy for most of the energy-consuming activities of the cell. 2  It is one of the monomers used in the synthesis of RNA and, after conversion to deoxyATP (dATP), DNA. 3  It regulates many biochemical pathways. ADP is adenosine diphosphate. P i is inorganic phosphate. [ structure ]. Because of the substantial amount of energy liberated when it is broken, the bond between the second and third phosphates is commonly described as a high-energy bond and is depicted in the figure by a wavy red line.
Adenosine plays an important role in biochemical processes, such as energy transfer — as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) — as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Adenosine is used as a medication, specifically, as an antiarrhythmic agent, to treat a number of supraventricular tachycardia that do not improve with vagal maneuvers. Common side effects include chest pain, feeling faint, shortness of breath and tingling.
Plants absorb energy from sunlight and transfer it to ADP and inorganic phosphate. Mitochondria convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a form of chemical energy. ATP is formed by the addition of an inorganic phosphate group to ADP. Adenosine diphosphate is a nucleotide composed of adenosine, which is comprised of the base adenine and the sugar ribose. ADP also has the two phosphate groups. The basic structure of this molecule is similar to a base that is part of DNA or RNA.
Conversion from ATP to ADP. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of life and it provides that energy for most biological processes by being converted to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). Since the basic reaction involves a water molecule, this reaction is commonly referred to as the hydrolysis of ATP. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is considered by biologists to be the energy currency of life. It is the high-energy molecule that stores the energy we need to do just about everything we do.
