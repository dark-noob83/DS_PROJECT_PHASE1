By definition, a neck strain is not a serious injury. However, the pain and dysfunction that it causes can be significant. This article reviews both first aid approaches to alleviate the pain, as well as signs and symptoms that indicate when to see a doctor. 1  See Types of Neck Pain.
Triggers for the onset of neck muscle strain can be traced to several common activities that strain the neck anatomy, such as: 1  Too much time in an awkward position, such as hunched over a steering wheel while driving, hunched forward to view a computer monitor, or cradling a phone in the crook of the neck.
Most episodes of neck muscle strain (or other soft tissue strain or sprain, such as ligaments or tendons) result in a stiff neck and/or pain in a shoulder muscle. Symptoms typically include difficulty and pain when moving or rotating the head or neck. 1  See Stiff Neck Causes, Symptoms and Treatment.
Any part of your neck-muscles, bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, or nerves-can cause neck problems. Neck pain is very common. Pain may also come from your shoulder, jaw, head, or upper arms. Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually overuse, such as from sitting at a computer for too long. Sometimes you can strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it during exercise.
Your neck is flexible and supports the weight of your head, so it can be vulnerable to injuries and conditions that cause pain and restrict motion. Neck pain causes include: 1  Muscle strains. 2  Overuse, such as too many hours hunched over your computer or smartphone, often triggers muscle strains. 3  Even minor things, such as reading in bed or gritting your teeth, can strain neck muscles. 4  Worn joints.
Most neck pain is caused by activities that involve repeated or prolonged movements of the neck. This can result in a strain (an overstretched or overused muscle), a sprain (injury to a ligament), or a spasm of the neck muscles.
