Gamma-cyhalothrin belongs to the pyrethroid family, patented by Cheminova. It is the most active of this family of chemicals. It is used as a broad spectrum insecticide and agriculture product. It's mode of action is a nerve toxin. The use rates of gamma-cyhalothrin are some of the lowest of insecticides.
Gamma-cyhalothrin is a single, resolved isomer of the pyrethroid insecticide cyhalothrin, and as such shares physical, chemical, and biological properties with both cyhalothrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, which are mixtures of 4 and 2 isomers respectively.
Gamma-cyhalothrin is a broad-spectrum pyrethroid insecticide approvd for use in EU. It has a low aqueous solubility, non-volatile and, based on its chemical properties, would not be expected to leach to groundwater. It is non-persistent in soil systems and would not normally persist in aqueous systems.
Gamma-cyhalothrin is a single stereoisomer of the pyrethroid insecticide cyhalothrin, and as such shares physical, chemical, and biological properties with both cyhalothrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, which are mixtures of 4 and 2 isomers respectively.
Chemical poisoning -- gamma-Cyhalothrin: Introduction. Chemical poisoning -- gamma-Cyhalothrin: Gamma-Cyhalothrin is a pyrethroid chemical used as an insecticide. The chemical is toxic to the nerve system. Ingestion and other exposures to the chemical can cause various symptoms.
Gamma-cyhalothrin is the most insecticidally active isomer of cyhalothrin/lambda-cyhalothrin, and thus the technical gamma-cyhalothrin product may be considered a refined form of cyhalothrin/lambda-cyhalothrin in that it has been purified by removal of less active and inactive isomers.
