Save. Every once in a while, you may see a small timer appear in the middle of your BlackBerry Curve and the device may stop working until the timer is gone. You may also experience this timer when powering up your device, especially if your device is having issues loading its software.
Facebook-a small Facebook icon with a number; indicates that you have a new message on Facebook. BB Messenger-the BB icon with a number; indicates that a BlackBerry messenger message is waiting for you. slide 7 of 9. Alarm Clock-a small clock with a time; indicates the alarm is on and is set to go off at that time. Roaming-a triangle; means that you are not in a network and are roaming.
the clock means your message hasnt left your phone yet, when it successfully leaves your phone you will see a check ... when it gets delivered you will see a D under that check and when your contact reads the message there will be an R under that check.

Does that mean my contact is on the phone (without changing the status on purpose manually)...??
I sent an email that the recipient never got. Next to it on my phone is a symbol/icon that looks like a clock face.
When you see a clock on your blackberry mobile phone after a text message.... 4. 0. When you see a clock on your blackberry mobile phone after a text message, that means your message is yet to be sent, and is still in a waiting stage.
