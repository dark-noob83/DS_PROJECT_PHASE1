When aspirin is given in low doses (75 mg/day), the complete inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme and hence maximal antiplatelet effect may take several days. At a dose of 160-325 mg/day, the maximal antiplatelet effect of aspirin occurs within 30 minutes.
Aspirin is a medicine that has been used for many years as a painkiller. However, it has another action to lower the risk of forming a blood clot in the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries) or brain. This lowers the risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Aspirin helps to prevent blood clots forming.
Antiplatelet drugs are used to treat heart disease. They are a group of powerful medications that prevent the formation of blood clots. When you are wounded, platelets arrive on the scene and group together, forming a blood clot that stops the bleeding. When an injury involves a break in your skin, this is a good thing.
Introduction. Aspirin is an antiplatelet medicine, which means it reduces the risk of clots forming in your blood. This reduces your risk of having a stroke or heart attack. Normally, when there is a cut or break in a small blood vessel, a blood clot forms to plug the hole until the blood vessel heals.
Aspirin belongs to a class of medications called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin and other NSAIDs, for example, ibuprofen (for example, Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (for example, Aleve), are widely used to treat fever, pain, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, tendonitis, and bursitis. Aspirin is known chemically as acetyl salicylic acid and often abbreviated as ASA.
