Too much space can be uncomfortable too. Our conclusion is that in order to build a true luxury home, the cost of the lot alone would be about a million dollars. Average construction costs would be $300 per square-foot, making a 3000 square-foot home cost about $900,000 and a 5000 square-foot home cost $1,500,000. The architect fees could be up to $300,000. So the average cost to build a luxury home could be approximately 2.2 million to 2.8 million at the average cost per-square-foot, if you include the lot. In some areas the average cost to build a luxury home could be twice that amount, or more.
