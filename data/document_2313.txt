Findings. Hospital costs by age, 2010. In 2010, the average cost per hospital stay was $9,700 and the aggregate cost for all hospital stays totaled $375.9 billion. Figures 1 and 2 show the distribution of aggregate hospital costs and stays by age and the average hospital cost per stay by age, respectively. ■ Adults ages 45–64 and 65–84 accounted for nearly two-thirds of aggregate costs in 2010 and had the highest average cost per stay ($12,100 and $12,300, respectively). This Statistical Brief presents data from the Healthcare Cost and. Utilization Project (HCUP) on costs of hospital stays in the United. States in 2010.
■ Aggregate inflation-adjusted costs for hospital stays grew 3.8 percent annually between 1997 and 2010, with 2.9 percent attributed to an increase in the intensity of services (cost per stay) and 1.0 percent attributed to growth in the population. ■ Adults ages 45–64 and 65–84 accounted for nearly two-thirds of aggregate costs in 2010 and had the highest average cost per stay ($12,100 and $12,300, respectively). This Statistical Brief presents data from the Healthcare Cost and. Utilization Project (HCUP) on costs of hospital stays in the United. States in 2010.
In 2012, mean hospital costs per stay for surgical stays ($21,200) were 2.5 times the mean costs for medical stays ($8,500) and approximately five times the mean costs for maternal and neonatal stays ($4,300). 5 ■ Medicare-covered stays had high mean hospital costs but slow growth between 2008 and 2012. Mean hospital costs in 2012 were highest for hospital stays billed to Medicare: $12,200 compared with $8,100 for Medicaid-covered stays, $8,800 for stays for uninsured patients, and $9,700 for privately insured stays.
Medicare, meanwhile, is concerned about overpaying for short hospital stays that it believes should have been classified as outpatient stays. In 2012, the average short inpatient stay cost Medicare $5,142, versus $1,741 for an observation stay. On average, beneficiaries also pay less for observation stays: $401, compared with $725 for short inpatient stays. But observation stays create pitfalls for some Medicare enrollees.
