You essentially do everything that a GSTL (a team leader) does except coach cashiers and do a shitload of paperwork. However, you are not paid ANYWHERE close to what they are paid. One of the GSTL’s at my store makes over $15/hr…I make $8.25. I started at Target in Feb of 2011. I applied for the job because my girlfriend and I decided to move in together. When I first started everything was seriously perfect. I was just a simple cashier, working a relaxed schedule because of my schooling, and I adored the 2 GSTL’s.
1. Brutal schedule, your body will hate you and Target took away the 2 dollar shift differential, any real job when you work a shift like this you will be paid more than a normal shift, they slashed this down to 1 dollar. Meaning if your base wage is 8.75, you will make 9.75 from 4am-8am. 
StateofTarget said: ↑. I think the biggest problem with GSA's is that a lot of them try to act like they are a TL. (similar to how sales floor TMs may do this, usually the young 16-18 year olds who get it in their head they are in charge for some reason) IMO, a lot of stores don't do anything to stop this behavior.... Hypothetically, it would require 3 GSTLs to work 40 hours/week. In addition, the GSA would be scheduled as cashier or photo. They would assist the GSTL and attend to the front-lanes. They would cover breaks, get change, do price checks, and backup carts/cafe/sbucks/photo/gs/lanes.
I worked for target for 4 years and for almost the last 2 I was a GSA. Which pretty much means the GSTL’s bitch. I busted my ass harder than anyone’s. I started at Target in Feb of 2011.

if you are trying to calculate how much you make hourly from a wage all you have to do is cut in half what your salary is and that is approx. what you make an hour. For exampl … e, if you make 20,000 a year you make about $10/hr. That is based on a 40/hr work week. $384.62/40= $9.61 A $20,000 salary is equivalent to $9.61 each week if working 40 hours per week.   Conversely, another general rule is that to convert an hourly amount to estimate the annual amount, you would double the hourly wage, then convert it to thousands.
The salary for an overnight stocker at Target will vary according  to experience and length of employment. It is currently at an  average of $9.18 an hour and can range from … 48 to $14 an hour. I was making $12 before I quit. I believe it depends on how much you make before you get the job. All the specialist jobs get $1 raise for there position.
For those wanted to work hourly, the pay depends on your state (and also may depend on the stores location within that state). In Southeast Michigan, the 4am backroom pay starts at $7.90 + a shift premium. I'm not sure when/if team members get wage increases, but after starting, they come within the first 60-90 days. Because you get treated like crap and the benefits and raises are not all that fantastic. As for raises, you get one once a year. They are a joke. My first year I worked there, the minimum wage was $8.00 and Target was starting their cashiers out at $8.25.
How do you calculate your hourly wages from salary? Take your salary (example $20,000) and divide it by the number of weeks you work (usually 52).   20,000/52= $384.62 (this is what you earn each week)   Then divid … e this amount by the number of hours you work each week (usually 40). $384.62/40= $9.61 A $20,000 salary is equivalent to $9.61 each week if working 40 hours per week.   Conversely, another general rule is that to convert an hourly amount to estimate the annual amount, you would double the hourly wage, then convert it to thousands.
