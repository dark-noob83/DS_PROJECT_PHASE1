Sabrina Parker. Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome (LMBBS) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by obesity, retinal degeneration, extra digits on the hands and feet, and intellectual impairment.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome shows significant overlap with a disorder called Laurence-Moon syndrome. In fact, in the past, these disorders were considered the same and referred to as Laurence-Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Eventually, researchers decided that the two disorders despite numerous similarities were distinct entities.
Recently, however, the syndrome was split into Laurence-Moon (LMS) and Bardet-Biedl (BBS), where LMS is characterized as the cases involving mental retardation and spastic paresis and BBS involved obesity, polydactyly, and learning disabilities.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare inherited condition. It is characterised by visual difficulties, obesity, additional fingers and/or toes, undeveloped genitals, learning difficulty (see entry Learning Disability) and renal (kidney) problems.
The disorder was first described by doctors Bardet and Biedl in the 1920s. Laurence-Moon syndrome, which some researchers believe is the same as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, was first described in the medical literature by doctors Laurence and Moon in 1865.
This is a rare autosomal recessive condition. Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome and Laurence-Moon-Biedl-Bardet syndrome are no longer considered valid terms, because the patients of Laurence and Moon had paraplegia, but no polydactyly or obesity, which are the main characteristics of Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
As a result, LMS is sometimes referred to as Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome or Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The differences between BBS and LMS have not been clearly defined.
