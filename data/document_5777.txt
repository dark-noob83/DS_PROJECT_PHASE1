How to reduce size of PDF file created from document scanned on printer using Home Center Software. Published 08/25/2010 11:38 AM | Updated 04/25/2011 12:43 PM | Answer ID 1738. When a document is scanned on a KODAK All-in-One Printer, it is saved uncompressed at the resolution selected in the Home Center. You can lower the scan resolution (dpi), which will result in a smaller file size. However, the ability to compress a PDF file is not a feature of the Home Center Software. There are various third-party applications that feature file compression. Here are some applications that can compress PDF files:
Before covering how to reduce the size of scanned documents in detail, letâ€™s discuss four factors that affect the size of scanned images: 1  Scanning Resolution. 2  A scan at 600 dpi results in a much larger file than at 300 dpi. 3  Color Space. 1 Color and grayscale files result in much larger files than black and white files. 2  Physical dimensions of the scanned page. 3  A legal-size scan will be larger than a letter-size scan, with all other factors being equal. 4  Compression. 5  Raw scan data can be compressed to make it smaller.

When you scan a document onto your computer using a flatbed scanner, the size -- in terms of physical dimensions and bit size, or the amount of space the document takes up on the computer's hard drive -- is generally larger than necessary for the document's recipient to make use of the document. You can make scanned documents a smaller bit size to send the documents to others more quickly and easy via email.
