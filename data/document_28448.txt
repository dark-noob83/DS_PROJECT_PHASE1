A: Using average sea level pressure of 29.92 inches of mercury as a point for comparison, the highest barometric pressure ever recorded in the USA was 31.85 inches in Northway, Alaska, in January 1989. A barometer measures the pressure of the air pushing on it. On the average, at sea level, the air has a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch. This means a square one inch on each side has 14.7 pounds of air pressure on it.
The English units of air pressure are inches of mercury. The metric version is millibars. The average sea level pressure is 29.92 inches of mercury and 1013 millibars. Using these average values it can be determined whether the pressure is above, significantly above, below or significantly below the average value. 
Standard sea-level pressure is expressed as 1013.2 millibars. Isobars are lines on a weather map that connect places of equal air pressure. A mercury barometer measures air pressure using a column of mercury in a glass tube that is sealed at one end and inverted in a dish of mercury. A mercury barometer measures atmospheric pressure in inches of mercury, the height of the column of mercury in the barometer. Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level equals 29.92 inches
In American units of measure, it's 29.92 in. Hg (inches of mercury) or 14.696 psi (pounds per square inch). This means that, at sea level, the weight of air pressing on every square inch of something is almost 15 pounds. Something to think about: If you had 1 square inch of room-temperature mercury that was 29.92 tall, it would weigh ... Unfortunately for the student, there are many, many different units for measuring atmospheric pressure. Standard air pressure at sea level is most easily defined as 1 atmosphere, or 1 atm. In terms of an international (ISO) standard, it is defined to be 101325 Pa or 101.3 kPa (kilo-Pascals) at a temperature of 15 °C.
Again, these are the average atmospheric pressures only at sea level. Pressure drops as we gain altitude; for instance, in Denver, approximately 1 mile above sea level, atmospheric pressure drops to approximately 12.2 PSI or 841.4 millibar. Unfortunately for the student, there are many, many different units for measuring atmospheric pressure. Standard air pressure at sea level is most easily defined as 1 atmosphere, or 1 atm. In terms of an international (ISO) standard, it is defined to be 101325 Pa or 101.3 kPa (kilo-Pascals) at a temperature of 15 °C.
The table below lists average sea level pressure in units commonly used. Values of Average Sea Level Pressure 1 ATM (atmosphere) 1013.25 millibars (mb) 14.7 pounds per square inch (lb/in2) 760 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) 29.92 inches of mercury (Hg) or (inHg) 1013.25 hectoPascals (hPa). All of these pressure values are equivalent, meaning they express the same amount of pressure, i.e., average sea level pressure. Thus, we say that average sea level pressure is 14.7 pounds per square inch. In the metric system, this is equivalent to about 1013.25 millibars. PRESSURE UNITS There are several units used to express atmospheric pressure. You have just seen two of them: pounds per square inch (lb/in2) and millibars (mb).
A barometer measures barometric pressure. Measurement of barometric pressure can be expressed in millibars(mb) or in inches or millimeters of mercury (Hg). Normal pressure at sea level is 1013.3 millibars or 29.92 inches of mercury. Fluctuations in barometric pressure are usually a sign of weather conditions.
As an example, consider a unit area of 1 square inch. At sea level, the weight of the air above this unit area would (on average) weigh 14.7 pounds! That means pressure applied by this air on the unit area would be 14.7 pounds per square inch. Meteorologists use a metric unit for pressure called a millibar and the average pressure at sea level is 1013.25 millibars. Terms for using data resources. CD-ROM available
Report Abuse. The average atmospheric pressure on earth at sea level is called the Standard Atmosphere (SA) and it is 1013.25 hPa (hectoPascal) which is the same as millibars. In the US it is called inches of mercury and it is 29.9. Imagine you hold your finger upward and that it has a surface of one square centimeter. 
Average sea-level pressure is 101.325 kPa (1013.25 hPa or mbar) or 29.92 inches (inHg) or 760 millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
