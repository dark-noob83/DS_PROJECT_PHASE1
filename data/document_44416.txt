An average commercial steel building costs between $16 and $20 per square foot, including building package (I-Beams, purlins, girts etc.) , delivery, foundation and the cost of construction.

by Jay Behm-A very basic way to estimate the cost of building a detached garage is to simply apply a typical average per square foot construction of $30 to $40. That is for an average cost basis for having a contractor / builder build a basic one story garage for you on your property. If you are in an area with higher-than-average cost of living you can use $50 to $55. If there are complications or you prefer top quality materials and components the price can go up.So, generally speaking, a 24 ft.sq., two car, basic garage will cost in the range of $17,000 to $23,000.
1 A slab foundation for an average 1,600- to 1,800-square-foot family home might cost about $7,000-$16,000 or more, while a slab foundation for a 3,000- to 4,500-square-foot home might cost $13,000-$40,000 or more. 
Test your cost estimate by using neighboring new construction. Subtract the average cost of the land from the price of the comparison home, typically approximately 20 percent, and then divide the price of the new home by the square footage. Accurately estimating home-construction costs requires using the blueprints for your new home. Estimating the cost of building a new home helps plan for the features you want, while staying within your basic budget.
The shape of the outside perimeter is an important consideration in estimating the total construction cost. Generally, the more complex the shape, the more expensive the structure per square foot of floor area. 
Home prices of $55, $66, $72, $80, $84, $92, $110, $118, and $328 per square foot combine to produce an average of $112 per square foot, which is probably a reasonable figure for many areas of the country. However, the difference between the lowest figure and the highest is very substantial. 
In addition, not all boroughs are created equally. Manhattan is, not surprisingly, the most expensive borough in which to build, with average hard construction costs for buildings over 10 stories logging in between $400 and $600 per square foot, according to IVI International’s Barone. A few years ago, the highest-end condominium projects in the city cost about $650 per square foot to build. And back in 2005, the developers of 15 Central Park West shelled out only about $400 per foot to construct their gold-standard condo project.
Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price. The cost per square foot is often higher for a small home than that of a larger home. When building a larger home, the cost of expensive items (such as a furnace or kitchen) is spread over more square footage. Consequently, a larger home may have a lower square footage cost than a smaller home.
For example, homes built with the majority of the features listed under the highest class of construction in 2012 used $110 as the multiplying factor. Mid-grade construction used the average square-foot cost of $95. Houses with standard features used $79 as a multiplier. Multiply the cost by the number of square feet from your blueprint calculations to estimate your building costs.
