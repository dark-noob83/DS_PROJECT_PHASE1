Hepatic veins are unusual in that they do not have valves. Hepatic veins are blood vessels which transport the liver's deoxygenated blood and blood which has been filtered by the liver (this is blood from the pancreas, colon, small intestine, and stomach) to the inferior vena cava.
Superior vena cava. The lung consists of five lobes. The left lung has a superior and inferior lobe, while the right lung has superior, middle, and inferior lobes. Thin walls of tissue called fissures separate the different lobes. The superior lobes of each lung are the uppermost pieces, also called the upper lobes.
Blood Flow. All blood enters the right side of the heart through two veins: The superior vena cava (SVC) and the inferior vena cava (IVC) (see figure 3). The SVC collects blood from the upper half of the body. The IVC collects blood from the low
The pulmonary vein and the superior and inferior venae cavae do not have valves proximal to the heart. The pulmonary artery and the aorta do. Valves keep blood flowing in the right direction.
The vena cava are two sets of veins: the superior vena cava, and the inferior vena cava. The inferior vena cava is the longest vein in the body.
1. I am confused regarding the presence of valves in the superior vena cava. The superior vena cava does not possess valves unlike inferior vena cava, which possesses Eustachian Valve.
The inferior vena cava is the largest vein in the human body. It collects blood from veins serving the tissues inferior to the heart and returns this blood to the right atrium of the heart.
