If demand goes up and supply stays the same then you will have shortages because enough goods aren't being produced. Prices may then go up to reduce demand and reach a new equivalence point. Conversely if you have low demand and high supply pricess will be lower to increase demand and get rid of excess product.
B. The price will go down. This probably happen to a product when demand is low. [smile]hill.com/sites/dl/free/0070741786/692664/Lovewell5e_Chapter02.pdf.
1 demand increases, and supply increases. 2  For a given price, more quantity is demanded, and more quantity can be supplied. 3  The demand curve is shifted to the right to show a greater quantity for a given price. 4  The supply curve is also shifted to the right,
Best Answer: Draw the diagram, downward sloping demand curve, upward sloping supply. If demand shifts out at first there will be excess demand. Consumers will be willing to pay higher prices and the price will rise. Eventually you will reach a new equilibrium point with high price and higher quantity. Suppliers will NOT simply be able to charge any price they want.
As the supply decreases, prices will move higher because the product is more scarce. As supply increases, prices will move lower because the product is readily available. For instance, suppose there is a drought and wheat is in short supply.
1 If the demand increases, and the supply remains the same, there will be a shortage. 2  This will mean the price will increase. 3  If the demand decreases, and the supply remains the same, there will be a surplus. 4  This will mean the price will go down.
For normal goods, and a normal market, there are four basic laws that determine the change in the market, if either supply or demand changes: 1  If the demand increases, and the supply remains the same, there will be a shortage. 2  This will mean the price will increase.
