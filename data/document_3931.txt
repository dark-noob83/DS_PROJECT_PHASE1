A NG heater is much cheaper to run that a LP heater. For comparison, a gallon of propane is about equal to a therm of NG in terms of BTU output (~100,000). The average cost of a therm of NG is $1.00 (mine is $0.77) and the average cost of LP is $3.00 (mine is $2.75).
I would estimate that the heater would only need to run about 5 to 10 minutes per day. At a run time of 10 minutes, that would allow 120 days of use on 72 gallons of propane. Also, the price of LP gas varies, so your cost will also depend on what your price is.
Lots of variables here 1) Cost per gallon for LP 2) Size of heater 3) Size of pool, in gallons and surface area 4) Temp desired 5) Use of a Solar Cover or Rings 6) Plumbing and equipment My 300K enjoys its diet of about 3 gallons per hour when it's firing.
Re: Heater (Pool or Spa) Cost of operation of Propane heater. JB beat me but our answer is the same. The heater is rated for BTU/H so in 6 hrs you used 2,400,000 BTU's or about 26 gallons of propane. Propane has about 91,500 btu per gallon so that heater will use about 4 gallons per hour.
At $1.50 a therm, it would cost around $5 to get that same 10 degrees. If you use propane, it would heat the pool in the same amount of time as the NG, and cost about $10-$11, about the same as the Heat pump, but do it in 20% of the time. I have heat pump, I know what they can do.
Re: Heater (Pool or Spa) Cost of operation of Propane heater. Thanks for the input. I guess using cowboy arithmetic I can pretty well assume $10/hr in 2013 propane prices of $2.35 in my area. Part of the cost of enjoying a pool.
I think it is close to this: 1 gallon propane = ~ 92,000 BTU Heater = ~400,000 BTU/hour So in 6 hours, you used 2,400,000 BTU / 92,000 = 26 gallons of propane = $61 Your specific question: 400,000 BTU/hr / 92,000 BTU/gallon = 4.35 gallons / hr ...
I have a propane heater for my spa and it really can get expensive. Propane delivered to my 120 gallon tank at my house is about $5 a gallon when you include all the surcharges (environmental fee, delivery fuel surcharge, tank rental, and billing fee).
