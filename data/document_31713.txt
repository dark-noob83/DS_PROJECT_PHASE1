4. 1. An architect`s rate is negotiable, most of the times, and they usually charge by the hour. The average price charged by an architect to draw a house plan is from $80 to $200 per hour, more if the project is big sized. To this, you need to add the architect`s visits to the construction site, ion order to make proper drawings. 
How much does it cost and how much time is involved to get architectural drawings made (plumbing, electrical, etc) for a 1500 square foot retail space that would be used for a restaurant. Thank you.

1 Fees can also be based on 5 to 15 percent of a project's construction expenses. 2  Designing a 25x25-foot room addition that costs $165,000-$200,000 to build could generate an architect's bill of $8,250-$30,000; using this pricing method, the fee for a $750,000 custom-built new home could be $37,500-$112,500. 1 Architect's fees depend a great deal on the project and the location, and can vary in both amount and type: 2  Hourly charges may start at $50-$150 but can go up depending on the type of work (from creating drawings to inspecting a construction site), location, and the architect's training, experience and reputation.
1 A negotiated flat fee can be as low as $700-$1,000 for up to a specified number of hours spent creating a concept design. 2  Or an architect might agree to design a 25x25-foot room addition for $5,000-$10,000, or a 3,000-square-foot custom home for $50,000-$75,000 or more, no matter what the final construction price is. 1 Architect's fees depend a great deal on the project and the location, and can vary in both amount and type: 2  Hourly charges may start at $50-$150 but can go up depending on the type of work (from creating drawings to inspecting a construction site), location, and the architect's training, experience and reputation.
Average CAD Service Costs. A typical drafting company will charge $100 to $120 per hour. Architects charge slightly more, averaging around $130 per hour. A typical A0 drawing of one type of a house will take about 8 hours to complete, which would cost between $800 and $1,040. Larger structures, such as a municipal building or an office complex, may take up to 24 hours to complete.
This means on a $100,000 dollar construction cost project, the architectural fees would fall in the range of $8,000 to $15,000 range – pretty simple really but one of the things that can always cause confusion is what exactly counts as part of the cost of construction.

If your building costs $1,000,000.00 and the architect charges 10% his fee is $100,000 making the total value of the house $1,100,00.00. It is important to understand that decisions made with the architect/designer are decisions that you will be living with for many years to com. 
The amount of money that you spend on an architect can vary greatly, depending on the size of your project, what you want the architect to do and the individual architect’s fee structure. An architect may charge by the hour, by the square foot or a percentage of the total cost of the project. At minimum, you will need to spend $800 to $1,000 to hire an architect to review and approve blueprints and other construction documents if you need a licensed architect’s approval for a building permit or bank financing. Architects usually charge $100 to $150 per hour, and $80 to $100 for work done by a CAD technician.
