axon. the process of a nerve cell along which impulses travel away from the cell body. It branches at its termination, forming synapses at other nerve cells or effector organs. Many axons are covered by a myelin sheath formed from the cell membrane of a glial or Schwann cell. axon hillock. the elevation on the perikaryon from which the axon emerges. axon reflex. a nerve impulse conducted through nerve pathways limited to the single axon, without the participation of a nerve cell or synapse.
refers to the end of an axon or an axon branch, which forms a synapse on a neuron or other target. See also terminal button. AXON TERMINAL: The axon terminal of a neuron is most commonly located at the end of the axon, nearest to the synaptic cleft..
An axon terminal is the structure of a neuron (a single cell of the central or peripheral nervous system) at the end of it's axon that forms a synapse with another neuron. Generally, the axon terminal is the point at which a neuron passes information to the neurons with which it is connected.
Definition. noun, singular: axon terminal. Button-like endings of axons through which axons make synaptic contacts with other nerve cells or with effector cells. Supplement. Axon terminals refer to the axon endings that are somewhat enlarged and often club-or button-shaped. Axon terminals are that part of a nerve cell that make synaptic connections with another nerve cell or with an effector cell (e.g. muscle cell or gland cell). Axon terminals contain various neurotransmitters and release them at the synapse.
