Nerve impulses have a domino effect. Each neuron receives an impulse and must pass it on to the next neuron and make sure the correct impulse continues on its path. Through a chain of chemical events, the dendrites (part of a neuron) pick up an impulse that's shuttled through the axon and transmitted to the next neuron.
Nerve impulse. Definition. noun. (1) The movement of action potential along a nerve fiber in response to a stimulus (such as touch, pain, heat or cold). (2) The relaying of a coded signal that travels along a nerve cell membrane to an effector, such as muscle, gland or another nerve cell. Supplement. A nerve impulse is the relaying of a coded signal from a nerve cell to an effector (a muscle cell, a gland cell or another nerve cell) in response to a stimulus. It is the means by which a nerve cell communicates with another cell.
begins as a small depolarization which is carried as a wave of depolarization across the membrane of the neuron, in the form of an action potential. NERVE IMPULSE: Communications are transmitted by the nervous system as nerve impulses.. No related posts.
Transmission of a nerve impulse: Resting potential and action potential. Like the gaps between the Schwann cells on an insulated axon, a gap called a synapse or synaptic cleft separates the axon of one neuron and the dendrites of the next neuron.
A nerve impulse begins when an individual neuron receives a stimulus that enables the action potential threshold to be reached (around -50mv). The stimulus is specific for the neural receptor. In other words, a light receptor is stimulated by a particular quantity of light energy.
Transmission of a nerve impulse: Resting potential and action potential. Like the gaps between the Schwann cells on an insulated axon, a gap called a synapse or synaptic cleft separates the axon of one neuron and the dendrites of the next neuron. Neurons don't touch.
