The inferior vena cava is the largest vein in the human body. It collects blood from veins serving the tissues inferior to the heart and returns this blood to the right atrium of the heart.
All blood enters the heart's right side through two veins: The superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. The superior vena cava collects blood from the body's upper half. The inferior vena cava collects blood from the body's lower half. When blood leaves these two veins, it enters the heart's right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, blood flows through a valve into the heart's right ventricle.
Blood is a mixture of two components: cells and plasma. The heart pumps blood through the arteries, capillaries and veins to provide oxygen and nutrients to every cell of the body. The blood also carries away waste products. The adult human body contains approximately 5 liters (5.3 quarts) of blood; it makes up 7 to 8 percent of a person's body weight.
Blood from the tissues of the lower back, including the spinal cord and muscles of the back, enters the vena cava through the lumbar veins. Many smaller veins also provide blood to the vena cava from the tissues of the abdominal body wall.
Blood Flow. All blood enters the right side of the heart through two veins: The superior vena cava (SVC) and the inferior vena cava (IVC) (see figure 3). The SVC collects blood from the upper half of the body. The IVC collects blood from the lower half of the body. Blood leaves the SVC and the IVC and enters the right atrium (RA) (3). When the RA contracts, the blood goes through the tricuspid valve (4) and into the right ventricle (RV) (5).
