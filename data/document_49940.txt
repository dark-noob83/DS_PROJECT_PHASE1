The pituitary will take longer and it is very difficult to assess this recovery of gland function.
Your hospital stay will depend on the method and extent of your surgery. If you need an open operation, you may be in the hospital for 5-10 days. If you undergo a laparoscopic adrenalectomy, you will likely be ready to go home in 1-2 days.
