1 This sort of replication is called continuous. 2  Lagging strand: 3  Numerous RNA primers are made by the primase enzyme and bind at various points along the lagging strand. 4  Chunks of DNA, called Okazaki fragments, are then added to the lagging strand also in the 5’ to 3’ direction. DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division. 1  The first step in DNA replication is to ‘unzip’ the double helix structure of the DNA molecule.
Helicases are often used to separate strands of a DNA double helix or a self-annealed RNA molecule using the energy from ATP hydrolysis, a process characterized by the breaking of hydrogen bonds between annealed nucleotide bases. Their main function is to unpackage an organism's genes. They are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., DNA, RNA, or RNA-DNA hybrid) using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis.
The size of the activation barrier to overcome by the helicase contributes to its classification as an active or passive helicase. In passive helicases, a significant activation barrier exists (defined as B B T, where k B is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature of the system). Their main function is to unpackage an organism's genes. They are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., DNA, RNA, or RNA-DNA hybrid) using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis.

DNA helicase unzip, or separate, a strand of DNA at positions  called origins. This means that the hydrogen bonds between  complementary base pairs are removed (DNA is dou … ble stranded!).  When they separate double-stranded DNA into single strands, it  allows each strand to be copied (replication). The job of Helicase is to unzip the DNA strand … by breaking the hydrogen bonds that hold them together, and it does this by moving along the strand of DNA, very much like on an actual zipper. Because of this type of movement, helicase is a type of `motor protein.`. 1 person found this useful. Deb Answers
1 The separation of the two single strands of DNA creates a ‘Y’ shape called a replication ‘fork’. 2  The two separated strands will act as templates for making the new strands of DNA. 3  One of the strands is oriented in the 3’ to 5’ direction (towards the replication fork), this is the leading strand. DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division. 1  The first step in DNA replication is to ‘unzip’ the double helix structure of the DNA molecule.
1 The new strand is proofread to make sure there are no mistakes in the new DNA sequence. 2  Finally, an enzyme called DNA ligase seals up the sequence of DNA into two continuous double strands. 3  The result of DNA replication is two DNA molecules consisting of one new and one old chain of nucleotides. DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division. 1  The first step in DNA replication is to ‘unzip’ the double helix structure of the DNA molecule.
However, DNA does not unzip entirely. It unzips in a small area called a replication fork, which then moves down the entire length of the molecule. Let's look at the details: 1  An enzyme called DNA gyrase makes a nick in the double helix and each side separates. 2  An enzyme called helicase unwinds the double-stranded DNA. Where DNA replication occurs depends upon whether the cells is a prokaryote or a eukaryote (see the RNA sidebar on the previous page for more about the types of cells). DNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and in the nucleus of eukaryotes.
