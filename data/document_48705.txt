Production possibility frontier is the graph which indicates the various production possibilities of two commodities when resources are fixed. Definition: Production possibility frontier is the graph which indicates the various production possibilities of two commodities when resources are fixed. The production of one commodity can only be increased by sacrificing the production of the other commodity.
Best Answer: One of the definition of a frontier is a boundary or the area immediately inside the boundary. The idea that a boundary is shifting can be applied to different areas. A shifting frontier of science would be referring to the fact that science is always changing and growing, and always with new areas. In wartime, a shifting frontier would be an international border which is constantly being renegotiated.
Definition. PPF. A curve that compares the trade offs between two goods produced by an economy in order to demonstrate the efficient use of resources. Points along the curve are considered efficient and obtainable, and show the maximum amount of one good that can be produced in relation to another.
A production possibility Frontier shows how much an economy can produce given existing resources. A production possibility can show the difference choices that an economy faces. For example, when producing on the PPF curve, increasing output of goods will have an opportunity cost of less services.
DEFINITION of 'Production Possibility Frontier-PPF'. A curve depicting all maximum output possibilities for two or more goods given a set of inputs (resources, labor, etc.). The PPF assumes that all inputs are used efficiently. As indicated on the chart above, points A, B and C represent the points at which production of Good A and Good B is most efficient.
