What is ZigBee?ZigBee is a technology of data transfer in wireless networks. It has low energy consumption and is designed for multi-channel control systems, alarm systems, and lighting control. 
Zigbee technology is used in three different types of devices which are used in networking according to its functionality. As prominently Zigbee is a wireless technology for making a network system, coordinators are the primary devices to help in activation of the system by collecting the data in form of memory. Zigbee technology is programmed in a chip form and is used in many devices to function automatically. For controlling and monitoring a whole factory unit while sitting in one cabin is possible by using Zigbee technology.
ZigBee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones. ZigBee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking. ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device. ZigBee is the only standards-based wireless technology designed to address the unique needs of device-to-device communication in just about any market. ‘ZigBee’ means two things: 1  A global alliance of companies founded in 2002. 2  A specification for interoperable, low-cost wireless device communication
Zigbee Technology is one of such progression in wireless technology. Wireless is not a new technology as wireless networking and wireless internet are already in use; yet Zigbee technology set a new aspect in wireless technology. That’s why it’s usually referred as Zigbee Wireless Technology. Zigbee technology is programmed in a chip form and is used in many devices to function automatically. For controlling and monitoring a whole factory unit while sitting in one cabin is possible by using Zigbee
The technology defined by the ZigBee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. ZigBee-style self-organizing ad-hoc digital radio networks were conceived in the 1990s. The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 ZigBee specification was ratified on December 14, 2004. The ZigBee Alliance announced availability of Specification 1.0 on June 13, 2005, known as the ZigBee 2004 Specification.
A type of low cost, low power and wireless technology which is used for the different purposes at ultra low power is known as Zig bee technology. Low power radios on the basis of standard personal wireless networking are used by a protocol to enhance the technology. It offers excellent wireless control path network. 
Zigbee technology used in the remote control devices helps to control the function at a specific range. This feature of Zigbee Technology is very attractive and effortless as all the home appliances are mostly coming with remote control system which is the essence of this Zigbee wireless technology. Zigbee technology is programmed in a chip form and is used in many devices to function automatically. For controlling and monitoring a whole factory unit while sitting in one cabin is possible by using Zigbee
Zigbee is a low power spin off of WiFi. It is a specification for small, low power radios based on IEEE 802.15.4 – 2003 Wireless Personal Area Networks standard. The specification was accepted and ratified by the Zigbee alliance in December 2004. 
ZigBee is a IEEE 802.15.4 -based specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios. ZigBee-style self-organizing ad-hoc digital radio networks were conceived in the 1990s. The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 ZigBee specification was ratified on December 14, 2004. The ZigBee Alliance announced availability of Specification 1.0 on June 13, 2005, known as the ZigBee 2004 Specification.
ZigBee is a wireless networking standard that is aimed at remote control and sensor applications which is suitable for operation in harsh radio environments and in isolated locations. ZigBee technology builds on IEEE standard 802.15.4 which defines the physical and MAC layers. Above this, ZigBee defines the application and security layer specifications enabling interoperability between products from different manufacturers. In this way ZigBee is a superset of the 802.15.4 specification. With the applications for remote wireless sensing and control growing rapidly it is estimated that the market size could reach hundreds of millions of dollars as early as 2007
