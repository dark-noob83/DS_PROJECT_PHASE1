Epididymitis is an inflammation of the coiled tube (epididymis) at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. Males of any age can get epididymitis. Epididymitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhea or chlamydia.
Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, which is a tube located at the back of the testicles. The tube stores and carries sperm. Epididymitis is most common in men aged 19 to 35 and is a frequent cause of military hospitalizations. Epididymitis is caused by an infection, usually a bacterial or a sexually transmitted infection. The condition usually improves with antibiotics.
Epididymitis Overview. Epididymitis is infection or less frequently, inflammation of the epididymis (the coiled tube on the back of the testicle). The majority of men that develop epididymitis develop it because of a bacterial infection.
Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis-the coiled tube that collects sperm from the testicle and passes it on to the vas deferens. There are two forms of this disease, acute and chronic. Acute epididymitis comes on suddenly with severe symptoms and subsides with treatment.
Epididymitis is the inflammation (swelling) of the epididymis, a structure in the male reproductive organs that joins the testis and the vas deferens. Inflammation of the epididymis may result in scrotal swelling, pain, penal discharge, blood in the semen, and fever.
Epididymitis (/ˌɛpɪˌdɪdəˈmaɪtɪs/ , ěp'ĭ-dĭd'ə-mī'tĭs, EP-i-DID-i-MEYE-tis) is a medical condition characterized by discomfort or pain of the epididymis, a curved structure at the back of the testicle in which sperm matures and is stored.
The epididymis is a long, tightly coiled tube that lies above and behind each testicle. It collects and stores maturing sperm made by the testicles prior to ejaculation. Inflammation and infection of the epididymis is called epididymitis.
