I understand you want to widen some windows in your house, not lower them. Here in the NorthEast when you widen a window you have to enlarge the beam above the opening to accomadate the new size. This work is costly and reqyures a permit. Lowering windows is much cheaper as you can work under the existing beam. Widening a brick opening is the most costly. Your project tops the list in cost. Masonry with both cuts (one left & right)and a longer iron angle to hold up the brick would cost 2,000. The interior carpentry to open the interior wall and put a new longer beam in place, install the new window and build a new jamb and wood work it would be another 2,000.
ikea_gw June 8, 2008. Hi, we are moving into a new house in a few weeks and I really want to enlarge the window in the master bedroom. The window now is 50 inches wide but only 30 inches tall and it sits very high up on the wall. Basically I get a view of the sky and the top of the tree and nothing else unless I stand right in front of it. I would like to have a window like the one on the right hand side in this picture http://bp1.blogger ... 
It has 2 big exterior walls (aluminum siding) with 1 window on each: a pseudo bay window that I'd like to eventually replace with faux french doors leading onto a patio, and a strange little gunslit window set about 5 feet up from the floor (and probably less than 2 feet high).

The average replacement window cost is $300-$700 for a single window inserted into existing frames. This would equate to $3,000 to $10,000 for a home with about ten windows. A 30- by 48-inch window can range anywehere from $150 to $500. A low-end Harvey vinyl window could run you about $300, while a high-end brand like Pella or Anderson window could cost close to $1000 per window installed.
