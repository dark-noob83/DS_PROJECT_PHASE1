The use of the latter transformed the nature of porter. The first porters were brewed from 100% brown malt. Now brewers were able to accurately measure the yield of the malt they used, and noticed that brown malt, though cheaper than pale malt, only produced about two thirds as much fermentable material.
Porter is a dark style of beer developed in London from well-hopped beers made from brown malt. The name was first recorded in the 18th century, and is thought to come from its popularity with street and river porters. The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined. The name stout as used for a dark beer is believed to have come about because strong porters were marketed under such names as Extra Porter, Double Porter, and Stout Porter. The term Stout Porter would later be shortened to just Stout.
