There are two Atrioventricular Valves in the heart. The first one, on the right side of the heart, is called the Tricuspid Valve (it has three 'flaps'). On the left side, the Atrioventricular Valve is called the Bicuspid or Mitral Valve (it has two 'flaps').

1. left atrioventricular valve-valve with two cusps; situated between the left atrium and the left ventricle. bicuspid valve, mitral valve. atrioventricular valve-either of two heart valves through which blood flows from the atria to the ventricles; prevents return of blood to the atrium. 1  Facebook.
The atrioventricular valves (AV valves), which separate the atria from the ventricles, allow blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles, but prevent flow in the opposite direction. The right AV valves is called the tricuspid valve. The left AV valve is called the mitral valve.
The valve between the left ventricle and aorta is called the aortic valve and the valve between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle is called the pulmonary valve. The heart has two types of valves: the atrioventricular (AV) and semilunar.
The mitral valve is also called the bicuspid valve and the left atrioventricular valve. As the name bicuspid valve may suggest, the mitral valve is considered to have two primary leaflets: the anterior and posterior leaflets.
