Example 1: Draw the graph of the linear equation y = 2x +3. Example 2: Sketch the linear equation y = 2x +3, using the x-and y-intercepts. Example 3: Rearrange the linear equation, 3y + 4x = 12 to y= mx + c form and find the y-intercept. Example 1. Draw the graph of the linear equation y = 2x +3First make a table. Sketching a straight line graph: Graph paper or grid paper are not necessary. Only two points are necessary to sketch a straight line graph. Join the two points to give a straight line. There are different ways of writing a linear equation or an equation of a straight line.
Graph sample of linear equations. A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable. Linear equations can have one or more variables. Linear equations occur abundantly in most subareas of mathematics and especially in applied mathematic
Best Answer: a linear graph is a mathematical illustration of identities with just a line either in its reverse or original form, when it is in its reverse it is a negative linear basically it is always a straight line graph that always has a slope y= mx+c that is the equation hope that helps a bit. Source(s): Report Abuse. A liner graph is a graph that explains a liner relationship. A linear relationship is a relationship in which the amount goes up or down in the same incriment each time, or stays the same, So a linear graph would have to have a straight line, usually diagonal, going through the various points.
A linear line is just a straight line. To graph it, you can use this equation: y=mx+b where m = the slope of the line, and b = the y-intercept of the line, in other words, … where the line crosses the y-axis. 6 people found this useful. The set of all such ordered pairs defines the graph of y = mx + c, called a learning linear graphing.In the equation y = mx + c, the number m is called the slope of the line and c is known as the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. Sometimes the y-intercept c is 0. In this situation, the equations of the line is y = mx and we say that the line passes through the origin.The basic principle behind drawing a linear graph is that only two points are needed to graph a straight line
The word linear means in a straight line. If the graph is a line, it is linear. Also, linear equations are of the first order; they contain a variable but not a square (or hig … her power) of a variable. If the equation contains x2 it is not linear. The set of all such ordered pairs defines the graph of y = mx + c, called a learning linear graphing.In the equation y = mx + c, the number m is called the slope of the line and c is known as the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. Sometimes the y-intercept c is 0. In this situation, the equations of the line is y = mx and we say that the line passes through the origin.The basic principle behind drawing a linear graph is that only two points are needed to graph a straight line
Non-linear graphs are everything else. The straight lines are in the form of y=mx+b. The first non-linear graph we have is a parabola which is the shape of the graph when either x or y is squared. A parabola looks like a U, but the ends are not parallel. If you graph y=x^2 (the most basic one), you'll see a parabola. The next non-linear graph is where either x or y is cubed

A linear equation in two variables describes a relationship in which the value of one of the variables depends on the value of the other variable. In a linear equation in x and y, x is called x is the independent variable and y depends on it. We call y the dependent variable. If the variables have other names, yet do have a dependent relationship, the independent variable is plotted along the horizontal axis. Most linear equations are functions (that is, for every value of x, there is only one corresponding value of y). When you assign a value to the independent variable, x, you can compute the value of the dependent variable, y. You can then plot the points named by each (x, y) pair on a coordinate grid.
