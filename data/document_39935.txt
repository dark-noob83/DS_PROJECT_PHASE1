Estimates the energy production and cost of energy of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) energy systems throughout the world. It allows homeowners, small building owners, installers and manufacturers to easily develop estimates of the performance of potential PV installations.
Just three years into the initiative, SunShot is making significant headway. Today, the Energy Department announced that the U.S. solar industry is more than 60 percent of the way to achieving cost-competitive utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity.
Therefore, the upfront cost of the solar panels per watt are Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8/watt Or, by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000, Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8000/kilo-watt. As determined from a survey of current market prices, it costs about $600 to purchase and install a 75 watt panel.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that a $1/watt installed photovoltaic solar energy system – equivalent to 5‐6 cents/kWh – would make solar without additional subsidies competitive with the wholesale rate of electricity, nearly everywhere in the US.
A typical residential solar PV panel system in the U.S. costs $3.60/watt after installation, and the solar panels typically save the customer over $20,000 (net) over the course of 20 years. Learn more about the many advantages of solar energy.
Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.72/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. “Common residential system prices ranged from less than $3.00/W to just above $7.00/W,” the Solar Energy Industries Association writes.
Photovoltaics. The SunShot Initiative aggressively supports development of low-cost, high-efficiency photovoltaic (PV) technologies in order to make solar electricity cost-competitive with other sources of energy by 2020.
At an installed price of $1.25 per watt, the cost of PV solar is always cheaper than coal. At $2 per watt, it is cheaper after year 40. At $3.00 per watt, it is cheaper about year 80.
