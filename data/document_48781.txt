The costs of maintaining capacity that sits idle increase the costs of manufacturing, and therefore the price, of each car. This is no less true for the costs of each MRI or CT scan. The average MRI costs about $2 million to buy and install, and about $800,000 per year to run. Those costs must be recouped by the health care providers within a finite period of time before the equipment wears out or becomes obsolete.
1 The cost of an MRI machine depends upon the size of the machine. 2  Usually, you can expect to pay anywhere from $500,000 to an upwards of $1,000,000 for an MRI machine. 3  In certain cases, the MRI machine can cost $10,000,000. 1 For a typical installation for an MRI System, expect to spend between $40,000 and $80,000. 2  Also, inquire about ongoing service costs. 3  Look for specialized engineers that can properly handle MRI’s. 4  These include reliable, operation and maintenance costs.
MRI's are expensive because of the price of the equipment. With the average MRI machine costing over $1 million dollars they have to charge enough per test to cover the expense of the machine. Now, that doesn't mean you can get a better price that what is published. Similar to the price of a new automobile, everyone knows that the sticker price is just an asking price. It's very similar to the two MRI facilities in Dallas. Facility A cost for an MRI is only $1,785 while Facility B's cost is $2,199. A difference of $414. It's like this in every city around the US.
This may, however, vary depending on the number of parts of the body being examined. 1  The cost of an MRI machine depends upon the size of the machine. 2  Usually, you can expect to pay anywhere from $500,000 to an upwards of $1,000,000 for an MRI machine. 1 For a typical installation for an MRI System, expect to spend between $40,000 and $80,000. 2  Also, inquire about ongoing service costs. 3  Look for specialized engineers that can properly handle MRI’s. 4  These include reliable, operation and maintenance costs.
Used low-field MRI machines can be as cheap as $150,000 or as expensive as $1.2 million. For a state-of-the-art 3 Tesla MRI machine, the price tag to buy one new can reach $3 million. The room that houses the machine, called an MRI suite, can cost hundreds of thousands more. When it comes to pricey hospital procedures, MRIs come to mind. Sure enough, according to recently released Medicare pricing data analyzed by NerdWallet Health, the average cost of an MRI in the U.S. is $2,611.
Cost. MRI equipment varies in cost, depending on the strength of the scanner. Scanners with more strength produce more detailed images; therefore, these scanners cost more. MRI machines can range in cost between $1 and $3 million. Construction of MRI suites can easily add another $500,000 to the total cost. An extremity MRI machine alone costs $300,000 or more, and can only be used to scan hands, feet and knees. Purchasing a used-extremity MRI scanner can cost as much as $150,000. 
1 Usually, you can expect to pay anywhere from $500,000 to an upwards of $1,000,000 for an MRI machine. 2  In certain cases, the MRI machine can cost $10,000,000. 3  BlockImaging.com notes a handful of machines that range anywhere from $150,000 to as much as $1.2 million. 1 For a typical installation for an MRI System, expect to spend between $40,000 and $80,000. 2  Also, inquire about ongoing service costs. 3  Look for specialized engineers that can properly handle MRI’s. 4  These include reliable, operation and maintenance costs.
A larger and brand new CT scanner can run as high as $2.5 million. Prices are slightly higher for MRI machines, running up to about $3 million for a new machine. Ultrasound machines are much cheaper at $10,000-$200,000, depending on brand and type. For hospitals and imaging centers, the base price for machines is just the beginning
For example, the cost of a CT scanner can be as low as $65,000 for a refurbished one that produces only small images quickly. A larger and brand new CT scanner can run as high as $2.5 million. Prices are slightly higher for MRI machines, running up to about $3 million for a new machine. Ultrasound machines are much cheaper at $10,000-$200,000, depending on brand and type. For hospitals and imaging centers, the base price for machines is just the beginning. At $2,600 on average for an MRI and $1,100 on average for an ultrasound, even one unnecessary test is too many for folks on a budget, unless your insurance or Medicare covers the test.
4.1k Views • Paul has in. An MRI machine for medical use costs between $300,000 and $1 million new, depending on size. The MRI machines use in neuroscience research to generate fMRI images are higher resolution (via larger magnetic field strength) and cost $500,000 to $3 million depending on the resolution.
