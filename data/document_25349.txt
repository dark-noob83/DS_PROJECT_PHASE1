Posted on. (Answer #2). DNA is a large molecule and therefore is a suitable molecule for storing genetic information. DNA is like a code with instructions that has the ability to not only store information, but command other cells, and replicate itself. It also has the ability to build more components of cells.
Thus the information 'stored' in the genetic code of the DNA sequence is now 'transcribed' into a 'messenger' function, which illicits a specific type of development from the cell itself in terms of protein fabrication, which in turn ultimately determines the nature of growth that develops from the DNA 'seed'.
DNA. DNA (or deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries the genetic information in all cellular forms of life and some viruses. It belongs to a class of molecules called the nucleic acids, which are polynucleotides-that is, long chains of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components:
The primary function of DNA is to store and transmit genetic information. To accomplish this function DNA must have two properties. It must be chemically stable so as to reduce the possibility of damage. DNA must also be capable of copying the information it contains.
So, the short answer: DNA stores the information used to build proteins. The specific base pairings code for specific amino acids that build these specific proteins.
DNA actually has several functions. For example, DNA stores the genetic material of an organism. It also replicates itself when it divides. the DNA is the genetic material of a cell it is what makes each cell unique.
