Answers. Best Answer: Here you go... :-) An average heart pumps 2.4 ounces (70 milliliters) per heartbeat. An average heartbeat is 72 beats per minute. Therefore an average heart pumps 1.3 gallons (5 Liters) per minute. In other words it pumps 1,900 gallons (7,200 Liters) per day, almost 700,000 gallons (2,628,000 Liters) per year, or 48 million gallons (184,086,000 liters) by the time someone is 70 years old. That's not bad for a 10 ounce pump! 
How much Blood does the Heart Pump. By kamal on November 22, 2010 Health Questions. On an average, human heart pumps about 2.4 ounces (70 milliliters) of blood per cardiac beat (heart beat). On a normal basis, if the heart beats 72 beats per minute, our heart pumps about 1.3 gallons (5 liters) of blood per minute. This adds up to about (1.3 gallons X 60 mins X 24 hours=1872) 1,900 gallons appx. (7,200 liters) of blood, which is pumped by our heart per day. 
But the average adult human heart pumps a volume of from 7000 to 8000 liters eve … ry day. (This is roughly 1850 to 2100 gallons/day) This is a rate between 4.9 liters/minute for a female adult and 5.6 liters/minute for a male adult. The average heart pumps 1,900 gallons of blood daily. It pumps  700,000 gallons per year and has pumped 48 million gallons of blood  by the time a person reaches 70 years ol … d.
Over 1,500 Gallons of Blood Pumped Daily. The heart is a powerful muscle that beats without stopping throughout a lifetime. It pumps about 55-80 ml (1/3 cup) of blood with each beat for adults and around 25-85 ml per beat for children. An adult heart pumps about 6,000-7,500 liters (1,500-2,000 gallons) of blood daily. The average adult body contains about five quarts of blood which continually circulates throughout the body. How much blood the heart pumps for every square meter of surface area (cardiac index) varies with the age of the individual. For children ages 10­13, the average cardiac index is 2.75 liters/m 2 /minute at a resting state.
A. The heart is an amazing organ. It pumps oxygen and nutrient-rich blood throughout the body to sustain life. This fist-sized powerhouse beats (expands and contracts) 100,000 times per day, pumping five or six quarts of blood each minute, or about 2,000 gallons per day. 
Output. Cardiac output is the volume of blood being pumped by the heart in a minute. It is equal to the heart rate multiplied by the stroke volume. So if there are 70 beats per minute, and 70 ml blood is ejected with each beat of the heart, the cardiac output is 4900 ml/ minute. This value is typical for an average adult at rest, although cardiac output may reach up to 30 liters/ minute during extreme exercise. Factors Affecting Cardiac Output.
1 An average heart pumps about 2.4 ounces (70 milliliters) of blood per beat of heart. 2  If 72 beats occur per minute, then about 1.3 gallons (5 Liters) of blood is pumped per minute. 3  About 1,900 gallons (7,200 Liters) of blood is pumped per day. 1 About 1,900 gallons (7,200 Liters) of blood is pumped per day. 2  This adds up to almost 700,000 gallons (2,628,000 Liters) of blood per year and about 48 million gallons (184,086,000 liters) by a life span of 70 years.
The heart pumps approximately the entire body blood volume completely each minute. According to the U. S. Department of Health, the average heart, based on our defaults, pumps about .073 liters of blood each beat or about 2000 US gallons per 24 hour day roughly. 
The heart beats 70 times a minute, with each beat the heart pumps 60 to 90 mililiters (2 to 3 ounces) of blood out of the heart. It can move 5 to 7 liters of blood in one minute and 7600 liters (2000 gallons) per day. In a lifetime, it beats over 2.5 billion times and pumps over 200 million liters of blood.
