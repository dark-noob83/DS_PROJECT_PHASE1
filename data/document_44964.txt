Stamp Duty Land Tax applies to properties that cost over £125,000 except in Scotland where since 1 April 2015 Stamp Duty doesn’t apply. Instead you’ll now pay Land and Buildings Transaction Tax when you buy a property.
You’ll need to submit a Stamp Duty Land Tax return and pay what you owe within 30 days of completion. If the price of your new home is under £125,000, you must still submit a return even though you won’t need to pay any Stamp Duty.

You should check if you have a copy of the Stamp Duty Land Tax return, which you would have sent when you bought the property. This form should have a UTRN that should allow HMRC to check your records. If you don't have this, check if you've got a receipt for the payment.
Usually your solicitor will deal with the Stamp Duty return and payment for you, although you can do it yourself. But either way, you’re responsible for making sure it’s all submitted on time. If it’s not paid, you’ll be charged a £100 penalty plus interest.
