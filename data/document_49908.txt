The Witness Protection Program is a service provided by the United States government that protects witnesses in major criminal cases from physical harm and intimidation. Among law enforcement, the program is better known as the United States Federal Witness Security Program, or WITSEC.
The program is administered by the United States Department of Justice, and operated by the United States Marshals Service. Few states such as California, Illinois, New York, and Texas, have their own witness protection programs for crimes not covered by the federal program.
Witness protection is usually required in trials against organized crime, where law enforcement sees a risk for witnesses to be intimidated by colleagues of defendants. It is also used at war crime trials.

Â­Witness protection is provided only for witnesses whose testimony is determined to be essential to the successful prosecution of a criminal case and in which the witness's life or the life of his family is at risk.

The UK has a witness protection scheme, run by the National Crime Agency, but little has been revealed about it to date. Newsnight's James Clayton has been given an exclusive insight into the programme and the people who've been through it.
