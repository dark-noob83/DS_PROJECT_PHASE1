It's not often that you can take money from your traditional IRA or from your earnings in a Roth IRA before age 59 1/2 and avoid the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty. But, surprisingly enough, this is one of the tax benefits enacted as part of the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act to help people become homeowners. But, even though the penalty is waived, you will still be required to pay taxes (as applicable) on the traditional IRA withdrawal itself. The rules for taking a distribution from a Roth IRA to finance a first-time home purchase are slightly different than those for a traditional IRA.
You should understand that the mortgage rates on these loans will likely be higher than current mortgage rates for traditional purchases. In addition, you can't use any non-IRA funds to close on the mortgage -- it is absolutely illegal to co-mingle any of your non-IRA money with IRA account funds or assets. Rules governing these accounts must be followed to the letter or you could find yourself paying very stiff penalties. For example, you can use your self-directed IRA to buy your future retirement home, but you can't live in the home until you retire.
Medical premiums are a big expense, and you may wish to tap into your IRA money to pay them. If you are over age 59 1/2, you can withdraw from an IRA for any reason, and just pay any applicable taxes on the income. If you are under age 59 1/2 and withdraw from a traditional IRA to pay medical premiums, you do not have to pay the 10 percent tax penalty under certain conditions. To use a traditional IRA deduction and not pay the 10 percent early-withrawal penalty if you're under age 59 1/2, you need to receive unemployment compensation benefits under a state or federal program for at least 12 consecutive weeks. Step 3. Request a disbursement from the IRA account.
The IRS allows an individual to withdraw up to $10,000 from a single IRA account for the purpose of a down payment on a home. If you are married, you can take double the advantage of this offer. Both you and your spouse can with $10,000 each from an IRA for a down payment, if you meet a few requirements. First-timers can take advantage of these accounts to pull out money penalty-free when the money is used for a down payment.

However, if the retirement plan account is an IRA or the account owner is a 5% owner of the business sponsoring the retirement plan, the RMDs must begin once the account holder is age 70 ½, regardless of whether he or she is retired.
