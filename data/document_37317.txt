A '100-W' lamp consumes energy at the rate of 100 joules per  second.    One unit of electrical energy is a kilowatt hour (1kWh). If you  leave the bulb on for ten ho … urs, it will use 1 unit of energy. A 60  watt bulb would take 16 hours 40 minutes to use the same single  unit of energy. It has a relative measure of twice  the light output of a 20 watt bulb and … one half the output of an 80  watt bulb.   A 40 watt bulb uses 40 Joules of energy each second, or 40  watt-hours of energy each hour. In 1000 hours it uses 40  kilowatt-hours or Units of electrical energy.
One point not yet mentioned: a 60 watt bulb will use 60 watt-hours per hour, or 60 watt-seconds per second, or 60 watt-microseconds per microsecond, or 60 watt-centuries per century. In other words, the watts part of the bulb's power usage has nothing to do with hours or any other unit of time. Energy is an amount, while power is a rate at which energy is used. 1  Energy is measured in watt-hours (W·h) or joules (J).
The rate is the watt itself, and yes, again, one hour is the time component base unit of measure for a watt. So a 60-watt light bulb is measured in watts, not watt-hours, but it burns 60 watt-hours after one hour. Energy is an amount, while power is a rate at which energy is used. 1  Energy is measured in watt-hours (W·h) or joules (J).
A Watt second is a unit of energy, equal to a Watt of power expended for a duration of one second. It's precisely equal to a newton meter or a Joule. The name Joule is used for most purposes that don't have to do with rating photographic strobes. Power is the rate of doing work or expending energy. If I lift a 10 pound weight 10 feet in the air in 2 seconds I expend the same 100 foot-pounds of energy but I do it at the rate of 200 foot-pounds per second.
Best Answer: Watt = Joules per second. 120 Watt means it consumes 120 Joules every second. The most common term is kilowatt-hour (kWh). This is the amount of kilowatts the device requires, multiplied by the amount of hours you leave it on. So your TV consumes 0.12 kWh every hour if you leave it on.
An electrical watt is a measure of power. A 40 watt light bulb uses  40 watts of electrical power. It has a relative measure of twice  the light output of a 20 watt bulb and … one half the output of an 80  watt bulb.   A 40 watt bulb uses 40 Joules of energy each second, or 40  watt-hours of energy each hour. In 1000 hours it uses 40  kilowatt-hours or Units of electrical energy.
The watt second is a unit of energy, equal to the joule. One kilowatt hour is 3,600,000 watt seconds. The watt second is used, for example, to rate the energy storage of flash lamps used in photography, although the term joule is generally employed. The milliwatt is equal to one thousandth (10 −3) of a watt. A typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power, whereas a typical hearing aid for people uses less than one milliwatt. The kilowatt is equal to one thousand (10 3) watts, or one sthene-metre per second.
Power is a rate already, 120 watts is 120 joules of energy used every second. 120 watts per second or per hour is a meaningless concept, about like listing the speed of a boat in knots per hour, since knots is, again, already a rate, nautical miles per hour. botom line, the power usage is 120 watts. period. the energy usage is 120 joules per second. or 432 kJ per hour. 120 Watt means it consumes 120 Joules every second. The most common term is kilowatt-hour (kWh). This is the amount of kilowatts the device requires, multiplied by the amount of hours you leave it on. So your TV consumes 0.12 kWh every hour if
Amplifier power is measured in watts, as in 100 watts per channel, but what does that really mean? Do all 100 watt per channel receivers deliver 100 watts? And what about those 1000 watt home theater in a box systems? Are they more powerful than 2,000 A/V receivers? 
The watt (symbol: W) is a derived unit of power in the International System of Units (SI), named after the Scottish engineer James Watt (1736–1819). The unit is defined as joule per second and can be used to express the rate of energy conversion or transfer with respect to time. It has dimensions of L 2 M T −3. The milliwatt is equal to one thousandth (10 −3) of a watt. A typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power, whereas a typical hearing aid for people uses less than one milliwatt. The kilowatt is equal to one thousand (10 3) watts, or one sthene-metre per second.
