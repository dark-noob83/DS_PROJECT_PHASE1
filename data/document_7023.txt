These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term having a gene (e.g., good genes, hair colour gene) typically refers to having a different allele of the gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles. The total complement of genes in an organism or cell is known as its genome, which may be stored on one or more chromosomes. A chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus.
Heritability means the information in a given gene is not always exactly the same in every individual in that species, so the same gene in different individuals does not give exactly the same instructions. Each unique form of a single gene is called an allele; different forms are collectively called polymorphisms. 
Every person has two copies of each gene, one inherited from each parent. Most genes are the same in all people, but a small number of genes (less than 1 percent of the total) are slightly different between people. Alleles are forms of the same gene with small differences in their sequence of DNA bases. These small differences contribute to each person’s unique physical features. Genes are made up of DNA. Each chromosome contains many genes. A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes, which are made up of DNA, act as instructions to make molecules called proteins. In humans, genes vary in size from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million bases. 
Body cells are called ____________________ cells. An organism that has two copies of the same allele for a gene is ___________________ or also known as _______________________. An organism that has two different alleles for the same gene is _____________________.
Various forms of the same gene are called ________________________. The spot on a chromosome where a particular gene is found is a ________________. Pairs of matching chromosomes are called _______________________. Organisms with two haploid sets of chromosomes are called ___________________. An organism that has two copies of the same allele for a gene is ___________________ or also known as _______________________. An organism that has two different alleles for the same gene is 
User: The different forms of a gene are called __________ A. alleles. B. factors. C. masks. D. traits. ALLELES. The different forms of a gene are called A. alleles.
1. C. Hybrids are organisms that result from cross-breeding, and usually have different copies of the same genes. Dominant factors are genes that show up even if only one copy is that gene. Recessive factors are ones that show up only if all copies are the same. 
Alleles are the different forms of a gene. Alleles are corresponding pairs of genes located at specific positions in the chromosomes. Together, alleles determine the genotype. Alleles which determine some aspect of the phenotype, the physical appearance of an organism, are said to be coding alleles. When both alleles in a pair are the same, the alleles are homozygous. If the alleles are different, they are heterozygous. In the case of homozygous alleles, the expression of phenotype is usually very straightforward. In heterozygous instances, however, the phenotype of the organism is determined by which allele is dominant, meaning that one allele overrides the other.
