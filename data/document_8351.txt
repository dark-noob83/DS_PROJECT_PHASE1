The price for electricity can vary from day to day and even by hour. You can find out when electricity is cheaper by examining the energy market. When consumer demand for energy is low, you will see the best energy prices. Seasonally, this falls during the spring and fall months when temperatures are mild.
Energy Day on March 1 is an opportunity to raise awareness in your community about renewable energy sources and ways to conserve energy. We can create a more sustainable, cleaner and safer world by making wiser energy choices. Everything needs energy to work-machines, plants and animals.
If you typically work during the day, you can eliminate large amounts of electricity use by unplugging your devices. Plug them in only during the late evening when energy is cheapest and you are home to use them. Be sure to check with your supplier about whether one of these types of plans is available in your area.
