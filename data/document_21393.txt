A closed urinary drainage system consists of a catheter inserted into the urinary bladder and connected via tubing to a drainage bag. The catheter is retained in the bladder by an inflated balloon.

A bag (also known regionally as a sack) is a common tool in the form of a non-rigid container. The use of bags predates recorded history, with the earliest bags being no more than lengths of animal skin, cotton, or woven plant fibers, folded up at the edges and secured in that shape with strings of the same material. 
You will immerse each bag in pure water in a plastic cup. You will use a balance (it's not a scale) to measure the mass of each bag, to the nearest 0.1 g, at 0 minutes, 20 minutes, and 40 minutes. The 0 minutes weight (called time zero) represents the weight of a bag before it is placed into the water in the cup. Though each bag was supposed to receive 15 mL of a solution (or water in #1), two factors cause the initial bag weights to differ somewhat. First, your measurements and handling may cause slightly more or less than 15 mL to go into each bag (that's error).

A Foley catheter is a flexible tube passed through the urethra and into the bladder to drain urine. It is the most common type of indwelling urinary catheter. The tube of a Foley catheter has two separated channels, or lumens, running down its length. One lumen is open at both ends, and drains urine into a collection bag. The other lumen has a valve on the outside end and connects to a balloon at the tip
