Leaving hard-boiled eggs at room temperature for extended periods of time allows for dangerous bacteria, including salmonella, to grow at a rapid pace. FoodSafety.gov states that foodborne pathogens grow quickly between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, commonly known as the danger zone.
Place the eggs in the pot, cover it and bring it to a boil. Boil the eggs 3 minutes for soft boiled eggs or 10 minutes for hard boiled. Drain the eggs and immediately cover them with cold running water until they are completely cooled, about 5-10 minutes, if they are to be served cold. If they are to be served hot keep them covered in the hot water.
Cook eggs until the yolk and white are firm. If you serve a dish that contains hard-boiled eggs at a party, such as deviled eggs, place your serving platter on ice to keep the eggs cold during service. Set a timer to remind yourself to refrigerate the leftovers within two hours. If your eggs sit out longer than they should, play it safe and throw them out.
Hard-boiled eggs still in their shells can keep for a week in the fridge, and raw eggs in their shells can stay fresh three to five weeks from the purchase date, even if the sell-by date has passed.
How long can hard-boiled eggs stay out at room temperature? The Easter basket looks empty without them.

Otherwise, it says, they should be kept in the refrigerator.
