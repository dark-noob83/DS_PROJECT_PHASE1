At issue, however, was the nature of that neutrality. There was still a treaty in force between the United States and France, but the pro-British Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, urged President Washington to renounce the French alliance. Jay returned to the United States with a treaty that removed some British outposts from the Northwest (posts that the British had promised to abandon in the Treaty of 1783 that ended the Revolution), but did relatively nothing to confirm the neutral rights of American ships.

When the British began to seize ships bound for French ports, Washington sent John Jay, a prominent Federalist and chief justice of the Supreme Court, to London to negotiate a treaty. Jay was a weak negotiator and unwilling to provoke the British. Jay returned to the United States with a treaty that removed some British outposts from the Northwest (posts that the British had promised to abandon in the Treaty of 1783 that ended the Revolution), but did relatively nothing to confirm the neutral rights of American ships.

The Jay Treaty (1795), or Jay's Treaty, is a treaty that John Jay negotiated for the United States in 1794 with Britain in order to prevent war between the two countries. The treaty, designed by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, was ratified by both countries in 1795. Congress voted an embargo for two months. Hamilton and the Federalists favored Britain over France, and sought to normalize relations. Hamilton designed the plan and Washington sent Chief Justice Jay to London to negotiate a comprehensive treaty.
The Federalists backing George Washington supported Jay's Treaty.   Washington is said to have gone to the well of the Senate in secret session to defend the Treaty, and wa … s called a traitor. Washington urged the United States to maintain strict neutrality and to avoid any entanglement in European affairs. Washington was a reluctant supporter of the Jay Treaty.
The treaty was unpopular at first, and gave the Jeffersonians a platform to rally new supporters. As the historian Paul Varg explains, The Jay Treaty was a reasonable give-and-take compromise of the issues between the two countries. What rendered it so assailable was not the compromise spelled out between the two nations but the fact that it was not a compromise between the two political parties at home. (The British had recognized this area as American territory in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.) The parties agreed that disputes over wartime debts and the American–Canadian boundary were to be sent to arbitration —one of the first major uses of arbitration in diplomatic history.

The reaction to the Jay Treaty provided Washington with his greatest political challenge yet. In the Senate, his Federalist majority was solid enough to secure the treaty's ratification. But in the press and in the street, the reaction was more volatile and more indifferent to the president's influence. Copies of the treaty were printed and dissected in newspapers throughout the country.
The Federalist (later known as The Federalist Papers) is a collection of 85 articles and essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay (under the pseudonym Publius) promoting the ratification of the United States Constitution. A compilation of these and eight others, called The Federalist; or, The New Constitution, was published in two volumes in 1788 by J. and A. McLean. The collection's original title was The Federalist; the title The Federalist Papers did not emerge until the 20th century.
First Party System , with the Federalists favoring Britain and the Jeffersonian republicans favoring France. The treaty was for ten years' duration. Efforts to agree on a replacement treaty failed (in 1806) when Jefferson rejected the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty as tensions escalated toward the War of 1812. (The British had recognized this area as American territory in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.)
