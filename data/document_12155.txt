By 1871, the federal government stopped signing treaties with Native Americans and replaced the treaty system with a law giving individual Indians ownership of land that had been tribal property. This Indian Homestead Act, official known as the Dawes Act, was a way for some Indians to become U.S. citizens. Assimilation of the American Indians would become the basis for much of the government policy toward the Native American from the 1880s to the 1930s. This set the stage for the passage by Congress of the General Allotment Act (the Dawes Severalty Act) of 1887.
Effects of the Dawes Act: The provisions of the Dawes Severalty Act were not upheld by the United States governmentâ€”the amount of land allotted to the natives depleted from roughly 150 million acres to 78 million acres in 1900. The 50% depletion was regarded as a surplus and usurped by the government.
