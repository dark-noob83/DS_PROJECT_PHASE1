q star the short answer is that it takes sunlight an average of 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the sun to the earth here s the math we orbit the sun at a distance of about 150 million km light moves at 300000 kilometers second divide these and you get 500 seconds or
a it takes about 500 seconds for sunlight to reach the earth this means that when the sun rises the light that reaches the earth is already 8 minutes and 20 seconds old know more
sunlight travels at the speed of light photons emitted from the surface of the sun need to travel across the vacuum of space to reach our eyes the short answer is that it takes sunlight an average of 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the sun to the earth here s the math we orbit the sun at a distance of about 150 million km light moves at 300000 kilometers second
this is an average number remember the earth follows an elliptical orbit around the sun ranging from 147 million to 152 million km at its closest point sunlight only takes 490 seconds to reach earth and then at the most distant point it takes 507 seconds for sunlight to make the journey but the story of light gets even more interesting when you think about the journey light needs to make inside the sun
in our solar system we see light from our sun reflected off the planets in more distant galaxies light from many millions of stars takes a long time to reach the earth it takes light 4 years to reach the earth from sirius a near neighbouring star using the hubble telescope we can see the light from the eagle nebula which takes 7000
