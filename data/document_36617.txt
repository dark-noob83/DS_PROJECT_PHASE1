Definition of ALBEDO. : reflective power; specifically: the fraction of incident radiation (as light) that is reflected by a surface or body (as the moon or a cloud). ADVERTISEMENT. Late Latin, whiteness, from Latin albus. First Known Use: circa 1859.
Albedo (/aelˈbiːdoʊ/), ælˈbiːdoʊ or reflection, coefficient derived From latin albedo (whiteness or reflected) sunlight in turn from albus, white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a. surface
Albedo (al-bee-doh) is a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed. Something that appears white reflects most of the light that hits it and has a high albedo, while something that looks dark absorbs most of the light that hits it, indicating a low albedo.

The amount of energy that is reflected by a surface is determined by the reflectivity of that surface, called the albedo. A high albedo means the surface reflects the majority of the radiation that hits it and absorbs the rest. A low albedo means a surface reflects a small amount of the incoming radiation and absorbs the rest. For instance, fresh snow reflects up to 95% of the incoming radiation.
Albedo: definition. Albedo is the fraction of solar energy (shortwave radiation) reflected from the Earth back into space. It is a measure of the reflectivity of the earth's surface. Ice, especially with snow on top of it, has a high albedo: most sunlight hitting the surface bounces back towards space.
