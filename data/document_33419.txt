Pulse Rate: Defined, as the rate at which your heart beats. Your pulse is usually called your heart rate, which is the number of times your heart beats each minute (bpm). Changes in your heart rate or rhythm, a weak pulse, or a hard blood vessel may be caused by heart disease or other problem(s).
When performing cardio, your heart rate should be between 60 and 90 percent of your maximum. This is commonly referred to as your training zone. Going below 60 percent means you may not be exercising hard enough to elicit an improvement in fitness; going over 90 percent means you may be exercising too hard.
You check your pulse rate by counting the beats in a set period of time (at least 15 to 20 seconds) and multiplying that number to get the number of beats per minute. Your pulse changes from minute to minute. It will be faster when you exercise, have a fever, or are under stress.
