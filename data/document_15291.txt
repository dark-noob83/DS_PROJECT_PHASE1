One parsec is the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond. A parsec is equal to about 3.26 light-years (31 trillion kilometres or 19 trillion miles) in length. The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is about 1.3 parsecs from the Sun. 
One Astronomical Unit (or AU) is equal to the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or approximately 93 million miles (or 150 million kilometers). A more precise … answer is 92,955,807.267433 miles. An astronomical unit (AU) is based on the earth-to-sun distance. It's about 149,597,870,691 ± 30 metres or nearly 150 million kilometres or 93 million miles.   A link to t … he Wikipedia article is provided for reference.
The astronomical unit (symbol au, AU or ua) is a unit of length, roughly the distance from the Earth to the Sun. 
ASTRONOMICAL UNIT (AU) 1 AU = 149,597,870.700 kilometers (or 149,597,870,700 meters) Definition: An Astronomical Unit is the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun. In 2012, the International Astronomical Union defined the distance to be 149,597,870,700 meters. Historical Background: Tycho Brahe estimated the distance between the Sun and the Earth at 8 million kilometers (5 million miles). Later, Johannes Kepler estimated the AU was at 24 million kilometers (15 million miles).
Definition of astronomical unit. For general reference, we can say that one astronomical unit (AU) represents the mean distance between the Earth and our sun. The AU is approximately 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles. It is approximately 8 light-minutes. More exactly, one astronomical unit (AU) = 149,597,871 kilometers = 92,955,807 miles. Earth’s orbit around the sun isn’t a perfect circle. So Earth’s distance from the sun changes throughout the year.
1 AU = 149,597,870.700 kilometers (or 149,597,870,700 meters). Definition: An Astronomical Unit is the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.

1 light-year (traditional) is equal 5872850000000 miles (mi). Astronomical unit-a unit of length that is roughly equal to 150 million kilometers, the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.
Astronomical Unit (A.U.). An astronomical unit (A.U.) is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. Astronomical units are usually used to measure distances within our solar system. 
In astronomy, an astronomical unit is defined as the average distance from the Sun to the Earth, or about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). You can abbreviate astronomical unit as AU. Since the distances in astronomy are so vast, astronomers use this measurement to bring the size of numbers down. 
1 Astronomical Unit = 92,955,887.6 miles or 149,598,000 kilometers ===== 1 AU = 149,597,870.691 kilometers An Astronomical Unit is approximately the mean distance betwe … en the Earth and the Sun.
