Best buy credit card barely gives you any money. i have a 750+ credit score and they gave me a $800 limit. so good luck with that. if you need money with a lower apr rate, go to a credit union. you can get a credit card for 7,000+ with a decent credit score.

Credit cards sometimes make a purchase hard to pass up. For example, they make it possible to buy something for $3,000 and pay just $60 per month until it's paid off. Most people can afford a $60 monthly payment, but what is often overlooked is how much you end up paying in interest.
