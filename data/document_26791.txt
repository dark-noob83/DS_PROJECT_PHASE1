A unique type of sugar made naturally in the body from glucose, ribose plays important roles in the production of RNA and DNA, as well as ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy source for every cell in the body. Ribose is great for promoting cardiovascular health and overall energy levels.
Glucose is made of 6 carbons, 12 hydorgens and 6 oxygens while ribose is made of 5 carbons, 10 hydrogens and 5 ox … ygens. glucose is used by organisms to get energy from while ribose is a component of the DNA. I think that's it hope i helped. Glucose and ribose are monosaccharides.
A ribose molecule has 5 carbons and this is what classifies it as a pentose. (Note, for comparison with the sugar found in DNA, that deoxyrib … ose is also a pentose.).
well, they're both monomers (smallest unit) of carbohydrates. Glucose is made of 6 carbons, 12 hydorgens and 6 oxygens while ribose is made of 5 carbons, 10 hydrogens and 5 ox … ygens. glucose is used by organisms to get energy from while ribose is a component of the DNA.

RIBOSE Overview Information. Ribose is a kind of sugar that is produced by the body. It is used as a medicine. Ribose is used to improve athletic performance and the ability to exercise by boosting muscle energy. It has also been used to improve symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, and coronary artery disease.
