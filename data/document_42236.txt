One barrel of crude oil accounts for about 19 gallons of gasoline. The other 22 to 25 gallons is divided like this: about 10 gallons of diesel, roughly 4 gallons of jet fuel, close to 2 gallons of heating oil and about 7.3 gallons for other petrochemical products like tar, asphalt, bitumen, etc.
American Petroleum Institute reports that 1 barrel of oil produced 19.4 gallons of gasoline per barrel based on average yields for U.S. refineries in 2000.They also report that The total volume of products made is 2.6 gallons greater than the original 42 gallons of crude oil.
1 barrel of crude oil = 42 US gallons (159 liters or 35 imperial gallons). It produces from about 35 percent to 42 percent of gasoline or petrol, plus many other products such as kerosene, etc.
How many gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline are made from one barrel of oil? Refineries in the United States produced an average of about 12 gallons of diesel fuel and 19 gallons of gasoline from one barrel (42 gallons) of crude oil in 2014. Many other petroleum products are also refined from crude oil.
U.S. refineries produce about 19 gallons of motor gasoline from one barrel (42 gallons) of crude oil. The remainder of the barrel yields distillate and residual fuel oils, jet fuel, and many other products.
A: The 42-gallon barrel of crude oil makes about 19 gallons of gasoline, 9 gallons of fuel oil, 4 gallons of jet fuel, and 11 gallons of other products, including lubricants, kerosene, asphalt, and petrochemical feedstocks to make plastics.
There are 42 gallons (1 U.S. gallon = 3.78 liters) in a barrel (i.e., 1 barrel of oil = 159 liters). When converting to oil to Metric Tonnes (MT), there is around 7.3 BBL per MT, and 304 Gallons per MT. Originally there were 40 gallons to a barrel.
A: NOT 33 gallons -- 42 gallons per barrel makes about 19 gallons of gasoline, 9 gallons of fuel oil, 4 gallons of jet fuel, and 11 gallons of other products, including lubricants, kerosene, asphalt, and petrochemical feedstocks to make plastics.
