Some are as vast as the ocean, while others, such as streams, follow paths that are narrow by comparison. A stream is a body of flowing water that stays within its banks, or the land on either side. A creek is a stream of small or medium size. Creeks are often shallow and flow into larger bodies of water. While many people would claim that a creek is smaller than a river, not everyone agrees on what makes a creek a creek! In fact, the definition of a creek may change depending on the part of the world in which it flows.
By definition, a creek is a natural stream of water, normally smaller than, and often tributary to a river. Often, creek waters flow directly into Chesapeake Bay, or merge with other Bay tributaries, such as the Patapsco, the Patuxent, and the Potomac rivers.
