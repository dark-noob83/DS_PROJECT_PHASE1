The cost to add sewer backup could range from $10 to $250 per year with traditional home insurance policies. Not all insurance policies (or homes) are created equal. Some companies allow you to add sewer backup to your policy, but will limit the amount of coverage to $5,000.
The average cost of such a rider is typically less than $100 per year for around $20,000 of coverage, while the cost to pay on your own for a backed-up sewer issue could easily approach $10,000 even before the cost of replacing damaged items kicks in.
Fortunately, sewer backup coverage is available from most insurance companies for a nominal cost. The sewer and drain professionals at Horizon Services recommend that most consumers in our rain-prone region of Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland err on the side of caution and purchase this additional insurance.
Sewage backup coverage is available from most insurers as a rider to a home insurance policy. Coverage for $5,000 to $10,000 in damages can run about $75 to $150 a year, according to FEMA, and there's usually a deductible. Your cost will be tied to your risk.
So if your home is insured for $200,000 and you add on sewer backup insurance, you’re amount of coverage for a sewer backup would also be $200,000. Either way, it’s a small price to pay as opposed to the thousands in damages you could be stuck with should a backup occur.
You can typically purchase sewer backup insurance for an additional premium of $40-$50 per year; a small price to pay for significant piece of mind and protection. If you live in a flood plain or near a river or stream, you may be required to carry flood insurance, as well.
An annual premium of $25 buys roughly $5,000 to $10,000 worth of coverage. In other states, when you purchase sewer backup insurance for $40 to $60 a year, the amount of coverage is equal to the amount of coverage you already have on your homeowners policy.
