As we said, home improvements can't be written off like, say, tax preparation fees or medical expenses (although later we'll see how medical expenses might lead to home improvement deductions). One way you can cleverly deduct your home improvement budget is to roll it into your mortgage when you purchase a house. It's a one-time credit (meaning you can't take it every year), but it lets you write off 30 percent of the cost of any solar, geothermal, wind or fuel cell technology you're adding to your home.
If you use your home purely as your personal residence, you cannot deduct the cost of home improvements. These costs are nondeductible personal expenses. However, this doesn't mean that home improvements do not have a tax benefit. They can help reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay when you sell your home at a profit.
If you qualify for this deduction, you can deduct 100% of the cost of improvements you make just to your home office. For example, if you use a bedroom in your home as a home office and pay a carpenter to install built-in bookshelves, you may depreciate the entire cost as a business expense. These costs are nondeductible personal expenses. However, this doesn't mean that home improvements do not have a tax benefit. They can help reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay when you sell your home at a profit.
Adding a deck to your home or remodeling your kitchen are not deductible expenses at tax time. The IRS allows some write-offs on your personal home, such as mortgage interest and property tax, but improvements don't usually qualify. If you itemize deductions, you can write off the sales tax on any materials you purchase. You can deduct 100 percent of improvements to the home office as a business expense, and 9 percent of home-improvement projects that affect the whole structure, such as installing a new roof. Projects that don't affect your office, such as landscaping or a kitchen remodel, don't qualify.
However, your home's basis does not include the cost of improvements that were later removed from the home. For example, if you installed a new chain-link fence 15 years ago and then replaced it with a redwood fence, the cost of the old fence is no longer part of your home's basis. These costs are nondeductible personal expenses. However, this doesn't mean that home improvements do not have a tax benefit. They can help reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay when you sell your home at a profit.
Although you can't deduct home improvements, it is possible to depreciate them. This means that you deduct the cost over several years--anywhere from three to 27.5 years. To qualify to depreciate home improvement costs, you must use a portion of your home other than as a personal residence. These costs are nondeductible personal expenses. However, this doesn't mean that home improvements do not have a tax benefit. They can help reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay when you sell your home at a profit.
