There is also a variable cost component related to running the machines on the factory floor. The fixed component in this example is $3,000 per month. The variable cost component is $10 per unit of output. Hence, at a production level of 500 units, the total electric cost is $8,000 [$3,000 + ($10 x 500)]. The mixed cost illustrated in the above chart is called a step function
Materials 35,000 â€“ variable. The total variable cost is 40,000 + 22,000 x 80% + 35,000 = 92,600. If the number of units produced in the period is 1,000 the the variable cost per unit is 92,600 / 1,000 = 92.60 per unit. If in the next period the number of units produced is expected to be 1,200 then the variable costs will be 1,200 x 92.60 = 111,120. 
Thus, the cost per unit is not constant. For example, ABC Company has total variable costs of $50,000 and total fixed costs of $30,000 in May, which it incurred while producing 10,000 widgets. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $50,000 variable costs) / 10,000 units = $8 cost per unit. In the following month, ABC produces 5,000 units at a variable cost of $25,000 and the same fixed cost of $30,000. The cost per unit is: The cost per unit is commonly derived when a company produces a large number of identical products. The cost is derived from the variable costs and fixed costs incurred by a production process, divided by the number of units produced.
(Total fixed costs + Total variable costs) / Total units produced. The cost per unit should decline as the number of units produced increases, primarily because the total fixed costs will be spread over a larger number of units (subject to the step costing issue noted above). The cost per unit is commonly derived when a company produces a large number of identical products. The cost is derived from the variable costs and fixed costs incurred by a production process, divided by the number of
$10,000 / 5,000 = $2 per unit. Often, calculating the cost per unit isn't so simple, especially in manufacturing situations. Usually, costs per unit involve variable costs (costs that vary with the number of units made) and fixed costs (costs that don't vary with the number of units made). For example, at XYZ Restaurant, which sells only pepperoni pizza, the variable expenses per pizza might be: Flour: $0.50. Yeast: $0.05.
The variable cost per unit equals $15. Fixed costs are equal to $700,000 for a year. Subtract the variable cost per unit of $15 from the $40 price, leaving $25. Divide fixed costs by $25 and you have a breakeven sales volume of 28,000 units. 
By dividing the total variable costs for a specific period by that same period's production volume will provide us with the variable cost per spark plug. For example, if the spark plug business made 500,000 units last year, its unit variable cost is $90,000 / 500,000, or $0.18. This cost per unit is the variable cost of each variable unit produced, or in other words the additional cost incurred for the production of each spark plug. For example, if the business produced 1,000 more units, it would expect to incur additional production costs of $180.
For example, if a bicycle business had total fixed costs of $1,000 and only produced one bike, then the full $1,000 in fixed costs must be applied to that bike. On the other hand, if the same business produced 10 bikes, then the fixed costs per unit decline to $100. Variable costs behave differently. For example, if the bicycle company incurred variable costs of $200 per unit, total variable costs would be $200 if only one bike was produced and $2,000 if 10 bikes were produced. However, variable costs applied per unit would be $200 for both the first and the tenth bike.
Total variable costs increase proportionately as volume increases, while variable costs per unit remain unchanged. For example, if the bicycle company incurred variable costs of $200 per unit, total variable costs would be $200 if only one bike was produced and $2,000 if 10 bikes were produced. However, variable costs applied per unit would be $200 for both the first and the tenth bike. The company's total costs are a combination of the fixed and variable costs. If the bicycle company produced 10 bikes, its total costs would be $1,000 fixed plus $2,000 variable equals $3,000, or $300 per unit
