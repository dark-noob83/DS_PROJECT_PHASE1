The Help is set in the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, and told primarily from the first-person perspectives of three women: Aibileen, Minny, and Skeeter. Aibileen is a maid who takes care of children and cleans.
Rea Hederman represented the third generation in this saga of family and of Mississippi. In 1973, he began transforming the newspaper from propagandist for white racism to voice of reason. He made the paper respectable, and even admirable journalistically.
On April 1, 1982, his father and uncles, unable to work together any longer, sold the Clarion-Ledger and their nine other Mississippi newspapers to the Gannett Corp. for $110 million. Rea used his money -- the legacy of Mississippi's racist past -- in 1984 to buy the New York Review of Books, a voice of liberal America. Then he bought Granta, the free-wheeling British literary quarterly. In a few short years, he had traveled an enormous distance.
The Help is a 2009 novel by American author Kathryn Stockett. The story is about African-American maids working in white households in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early 1960s. A USA Today article called it one of the summer sleeper hits .
