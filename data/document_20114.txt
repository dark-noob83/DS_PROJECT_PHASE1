Lidoderm is available as a patch, with 5 % lidocaine. Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. The Lidoderm patch (lidocaine patch 5%) is offered in a carton of 30 patches, packaged into individual child-resistant envelopes. If you suspect that you have overdosed with Lidoderm you should seek emergency help immediately. Lidoderm has the main ingredient lidocaine, as a 5% patch. 
LIDODERM (lidocaine patch 5%) is comprised of an adhesive material containing 5% lidocaine, which is applied to a non-woven polyester felt backing and covered with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film release liner. The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm Ã— 14 cm. Single-dose treatment with LIDODERM was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours.
