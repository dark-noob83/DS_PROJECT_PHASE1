Because they are a bit tough, whole grain wheat berries do take a long time to cook. To prepare wheatberries, cover them with plenty of water and simmer in a covered pot for about one hour, or until soft.

Farro is an ethnobotanical term derived from Italian Latin for a group of three wheat species: spelt (triticum spelta), emmer (triticum dicoccum), and einkorn (triticum monococcum) which are types of hulled wheat (wheat which cannot be threshed). It is also considered to be of a higher quality for cooking than the other two grains and is sometimes called true farro. Farro is also sometimes defined as spelt (dinkel in German), specifically distinguished from both emmer and einkorn.
