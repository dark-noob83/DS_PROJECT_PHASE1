Uranium is very dense. At about 19 grams per cubic centimeter, it is 1.6 times more dense than lead. Density increases weight. For example, while a gallon of milk weighs about 8 pounds, a gallon container of uranium would weigh about 150 pounds.
Typically, a pellet of uranium weighs around seven grams or 0.24 ounces. This pellet is capable of generating as much energy as three and a half barrels of oil. At $60 a barrel, you d need to spend $210 for oil. On the other hand, it costs around $1.43 to buy 0.24 ounces of uranium at the current price of $95 per pound.
