Carat is the term used for the measurement of weight of precious stones like diamonds and other gems. It is usually represented in terms of milligrams and 1 carat weighs 200 milligrams which is equivalent to 0.007ounces. Further, a carat is divided on a scale of 100 points.
The carat weight is one of the major factors affecting the price of a diamond, along with cut, clarity and color. Heavy diamonds are rarer than small one. Thus, the value increases exponentially for higher carat weights.
Carat is the term used to describe the weight of any gemstone, including diamonds. Although the definition of a carat has changed over time, since 1913 the international standard has been 200 milligrams, or 1/5 of a gram. Often, jewelers describe carats in 1/4 increments.
Diamond Carat Weight. Diamond carat weight is the measurement of how much a diamond weighs. A metric carat is defined as 200 milligrams. Each carat can be subdivided into 100 'points.' This allows very precise measurements to the hundredth decimal place. A jeweler may describe the weight of a diamond below one carat by its 'points' alone. For instance, the jeweler may refer to a diamond that weighs 0.25 carats as a 'twenty-five pointer.' Diamond weights greater than one carat are expressed in carats and decimals.
Diamonds and other gemstones are weighed in metric carats: one carat is equal to 0.2 grams, about the same weight as a paperclip. (Don’t confuse carat with karat, as in “18K gold,” which refers to gold purity.). Just as a dollar is divided into 100 pennies, a carat is divided into 100 points.
