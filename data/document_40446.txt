Definition of RIBOSOME. : any of the RNA-rich cytoplasmic granules that are sites of protein synthesis — see cell illustration. — ri·bo·som·al \ˌrī-bə-ˈsō-məl\ adjective.
ribosomal RNA. n. 1. (Biochemistry) biochem a type of RNA thought to be transcribed from DNA in the nucleoli of cell nuclei, subsequently forming the component of ribosomes on which the translation of messenger RNA into protein chains is accomplished.
Medical Definition of RIBOSOMAL RNA. : RNA that is a fundamental structural element of ribosomes—called also rRNA.
rRNA: Ribosomal RNA, a molecular component of a ribosome, the cell's essential protein factory. Strictly speaking, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) does not make proteins. It makes polypeptides (assemblies of amino acids) that go to make up proteins.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is part of the ribosome, or protein builders of the cell. Ribosomes are responsible for translation or the process our cells use to make proteins. rRNA are responsible for reading the order of amino acids and linking amino acids together. They do this through a highly complex sequence.
