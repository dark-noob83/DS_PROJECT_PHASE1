The average height of a small wind turbine (of any capacity) is about 80ft. (about twice the height of a neighborhood telephone pole), with a range of 30-140 ft. Generator size and tower height are not generally related; a 5-kW turbine could be on a tower anywhere from 30-140 ft. in height, for example.
Cost per Unit of Output. While there is no available average cost of a wind turbine, there is, at least for large turbines, an average cost per megawatt. In 2015, it was about $2 million per megawatt. The SeaTitan 10MW, therefore, although not priced at the time, could cost in the neighborhood of $20 million.
1 The Department of Energy finds that “ Among a large sample of wind projects installed in 2012, the capacity-weighted average installed cost stood at nearly $1,940/kW, down almost $200/kW from the reported average cost in 2011 and down almost $300/kW from the reported average cost in both 2009 and 2010 .” [3].
Home or Farm Scale Wind Turbines. Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more).
Total costs for installing a commercial-scale wind turbine will vary significantly depending on the number of turbines ordered, cost of financing, when the turbine purchase agreement was executed, construction contracts, the location of the project, and other factors.
Capital costs: The cost of the wind turbine is the single largest cost component, and can make up 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project. The cost of installation, such as construction, makes up the remaining capital costs.
The costs for a utility scale wind turbine range from about $1.3 million to $2.2 million per MW of nameplate capacity installed. Most of the commercial-scale turbines installed today are 2 MW in size and cost roughly $3-$4 million
This is a per megawatt cost of about $3 million to $8 million. At the bottom end of the price scale, the Aleko WG450A Wind Turbine Generator with a 450 Watt 24 Volt capacity was selling for $402 in 2015. Micro-turbines are largely for hobby purposes.
