Fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas, are currently the world's primary energy source. Formed from organic material over the course of millions of years, fossil fuels have fueled U.S. and global economic development over the past century.
Fossil fuel. Definition. noun. (1) Any fuel formed from hydrocarbon deposits (e.g. coal, petroleum or oil, natural gas, etc .) or fossilized remains of organism (hence the name). (2) A solid, liquid or gaseous fuels formed after millions of years by chemical and physical changes in plant and animal residues under high temperature and pressure.
Fossil fuels are sources of energy that have developed within the earth over millions of years. Because fossil fuels-oil, natural gas, and coal-take so long to form, they are considered nonrenewable.

Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources created by the anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. They include petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Fossil fuels serve as the dominant source of energy for humanity, powering over four-fifths of the world's utilities.
