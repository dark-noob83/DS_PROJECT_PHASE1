CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and Ca 19-9 (Carbohydrate antigen 19-9) are two blood tests commonly used to follow patients with known cancers. CEA is a glycoprotein (sugar protein) present in embryonic tissues and in extracts from normal colonic washings. CA 19-9 is a modified blood group antigen (Lewis(a)).
Specimen Type: Blood. Description: This test measures the level of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) in the blood. CEA is a protein which is often elevated in people with certain types of cancer. CEA is used as a tumor marker for a variety of cancers including colon, breast, rectum, liver, pancreas, stomach and ovaries.
The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test measures the amount of this protein that may appear in the blood of some people who have certain kinds of cancers, especially cancer of the large intestine (colon and rectal cancer). It may also be present in people with cancer of the pancreas, breast, ovary, or lung.
Carcinoembryonic Antigen Test (CEA). A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test is a blood test used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers, especially cancer of the colon. The test measures the amount of CEA present in the blood. If you already have cancer, this test helps a doctor determine if the treatment for the cancer is working.
