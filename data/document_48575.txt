The myocardium is located between the endocardium and the visceral layer of the serous membrane (epicardium) of the heart.
The myocardium is surrounded by the epicardium (outer layer of the wall of the heart) and the endocardium (inner layer of the heart). Myocardium stimulates heart contractions to pump blood from the ventricles and relaxes the heart to allow the atria to receive blood. These contractions produce what is known as a heart beat. The beating of the heart drives the cardiac cycle which pumps blood to cells and tissues of the body.
The coronary system is comprised of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins. The coronary arteries originate as the right and left main coronary arteries which exit the ascending aorta just above the aortic valve (coronary ostia).
The myocardium is the middle layer of the walls of the heart, made of cardiac muscle, that contracts to push out blood.
Myocardium is the muscular middle layer of the wall of the heart. It is composed of spontaneously contracting cardiac muscle fibers which allow the heart to contract. Heart contraction is an autonomic (involuntary) function of the peripheral nervous system.
myocardial. pertaining to the muscular tissue of the heart (the myocardium). myocardial infarction (MI) death of the cells of an area of the heart muscle (myocardium) as a result of oxygen deprivation, which in turn is caused by obstruction of the blood supply; commonly referred to as a “heart attack.”.
necrosis of the cells of an area of the heart muscle (myocardium) occurring as a result of oxygen deprivation, which in turn is caused by obstruction to the blood supply; commonly referred to in humans as a 'heart attack'.
