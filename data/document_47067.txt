Roth IRA phase out. Like the Traditional IRA, the IRS has phase out rules for Roth IRA contributions. Tax filers will be able to contribute the maximum amount to their IRA if they donâ€™t exceed certain income limits. 1  Single, Head of Household, or Married Filing Separately can contribute the maximum if their MAGI is $116,000 or less. The Traditional and Roth IRA contribution limits are $5,500 for those under age 50. Persons age 50 and over can make additional catch up contributions of $1,000, for a total contribution limit of $6,500.
Roth IRA Phase-Out Limits. IRA phase-out limits work very differently depending on whether you are contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRA income limits affect how much you can contribute to the account. If your income exceeds a certain amount, you may make a partial contribution. If you make up to $177,000, you may make a partial contribution. If your joint income exceeds $177,000, you cannot make a Roth IRA contribution in 2010. Traditional IRA phase-out limits only apply if you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan plan, and even then, they only affect your deduction.
Traditional IRA Deductions. Traditional IRA contributions are 100% tax deductible if you make less than the IRS deductibility phase out level (less $61,000 if you are single, or less than $98,000 if you are married filing jointly). The Traditional and Roth IRA contribution limits are $5,500 for those under age 50. Persons age 50 and over can make additional catch up contributions of $1,000, for a total contribution limit of $6,500.

Contribution Limits. To understand how phase-out limits work, it is important to understand contribution limits, as well. Each year, the IRS determines the maximum total amount you may contribute to your Roth and traditional IRAs. As of 2010, that amount is $5,000 if you are under 50, and $6,000 if you are 50 or over. If you make up to $177,000, you may make a partial contribution. If your joint income exceeds $177,000, you cannot make a Roth IRA contribution in 2010. Traditional IRA phase-out limits only apply if you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan plan, and even then, they only affect your deduction.
2015 IRA Contribution Limits. The 2015 IRA contribution limits will look just like it did for 2014. Both the traditional and Roth IRA will have the same contribution limit, which will max out at $5,500. If you are 50 years or older, there is a $1,000 catch up contribution.
1 Contribution rates phase out beginning at a MAGI above $116,001, and end at $131,000 (up from $114,000, and $129,000, respectively in 2014). 2  Married Filing Jointly can make maximum Roth IRA contributions for an income of $183,000 or less. The Traditional and Roth IRA contribution limits are $5,500 for those under age 50. Persons age 50 and over can make additional catch up contributions of $1,000, for a total contribution limit of $6,500.
Contribution Limits vs. Deduction Limits. The maximum you can contribute to a traditional IRA depends on your age. For the 2015 tax year, the limit is five thousand five hundred dollars for those 49 and younger. If you turn 50 or older in 2015, then your upper limit raises to six thousand five hundred dollars. 1 If your filing status is head of household or single, your IRA tax deduction starts to phase out when your AGI reaches $61,000 and completely disappears when you reach $71,000. 2  If you and your partner file are married filing jointly, the IRA deduction begins to phase out when you reach $98,000 and tops out at $118,000
