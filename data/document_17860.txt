1 Be sure to use low heat and a long cook to properly cook the burgers the whole way through. 2  Place on the barbecue grill. 3  Cook as usual for hamburgers on the barbecue. 4  Bake: Place in the oven on 350ºF/180ºC for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness.
1 Set the burgers at least 1 inch apart on the wire rack. 2  Roast the burgers for 10 to 16 minutes, checking on them either with an instant-read thermometer (the quickest way) or by cutting into one to peek. 3  For medium-rare, look for 130 to 135 degrees; for medium, 140 degrees.
Using a spatula, transfer the hamburgers to the roasting rack in the oven and continue cooking to desired doneness, 8 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, 10 to 11 minutes for medium, and 13 to 15 minutes for well-done. If you are using the cheese, top the hamburgers during their last couple of minutes of cooking to melt.
Into a 475 degree oven it goes and you just cook them until the burger is between 130 and 135 for medium-rare: Just as its getting close, you top the burger with cheese and put it back in the oven for the cheese to melt.
2. Place burgers on the grill and cook, waiting for at least 4 minutes before flipping. 3. Cook until both sides are browned and the burger is cooked to the desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium rare for 8-ounce burgers. Let the burgers rest for about 5 minutes before serving.
Shut the door and bake the burgers at 425 degrees; grease will drip into the pan below as they cook. Periodically check your burgers and make sure the center reaches the USDA-recommended temperature of 145 degrees. Cook 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare, 11 to 12 minutes for medium, and 13 to 15 minutes for medium well.
1. Put two 6-8-oz. burgers on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet fitted with a separate rack. 2. Broil the patties until the meat is nicely browned on one side; flip burgers and cook for about 1 minute more. 3. With this method it should take about 8 minutes to cook two 8-ounce burgers to medium rare.
1 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 2  Line baking pan with foil. 3  Place baking rack inside pan. 4  With hands make four equal sized hamburger patties. 5  Place patties on baking rack and season both sides with salt and pepper. 6  Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping once.
