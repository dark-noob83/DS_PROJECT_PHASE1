My local Hyundai dealer charges $179.00 to service the transmission. Not sure what they mean by service I didn't ask. I just do a drain and fill every 15k miles or so. Cheap insurance and it's easier then changing the oil and filter. Just remove the drain plug, wipe it off and reinstall after fluid is drained.

I changed my transmission fluid, filter and basket. Immediately after that my trans was shift extremely hard for a year. Then the torque converter locked up which cost me 1700 to have trans rebuilt. Now would it void my warranty if I was to just flush and fill my system it is it best to just take it to the dealer.
Hello again, you can follow up on your original question but the cost for the trans flush will be about $170. Be sure they use Hyundai SP3 fluid, if you go to the shop I recommended they will know the correct fluid.

1 Flushing a transmission with a pressurized machine can cost $125-$300 or more, and may include pushing a special cleaning compound through the system. 2  The power flush process typically replaces all of the transmission fluid, and can require 12-22 or more quarts.
