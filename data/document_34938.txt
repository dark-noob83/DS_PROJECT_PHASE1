The importance of the luteal phase. The purpose of the luteal phase is to produce progesterone that prepares a woman’s body for pregnancy. The length of this phase is usually constant and can be used to establish the time of ovulation with the woman’s menstrual cycle. This is important in planning or avoiding
The luteal phase is dominated by the hormone progesterone. Changes in your luteal phase suggest fluctuations in the hormone. If your luteal phase is longer, this is ok. But shorter than 12 days may cause problems.

The follicular phase may vary from woman to woman but the luteal phase is normally around 12-14 days for most women. A luteal phase that is shorter than 12 days may be a concern for some women.
