Definition: A pure substance is a sample of matter with both definite and constant composition with distinct chemical properties. Alternate Spellings: chemical substance. Examples: water, diamond, gold, table salt (sodium chloride), ethanol.
A chemical substance (also called a pure substance) may well be defined as any material with a definite chemical composition in an introductory general chemistry textbook. According to this definition a chemical substance can either be a pure chemical element or a pure chemical compound. But, there are exceptions to this definition; a pure substance can also be defined as a form of matter that has both definite composition and distinct properties. The chemical substance index published by CAS also includes several alloys of uncertain composition.
A pure substance cannot be separated into any other kinds of matter by any physical or chemical process. It is also made up of the same particles. An element is an example of â€¦ a pure substance because it cannot be broken down into simpler substance. Examples of pure substances would be: H2O (water), neon (an element), and NaCl (table salt).
pure substance. (chemistry). A sample of matter, either an element or a compound, that consists of only one component with definite physical and chemical properties and a definite composition.
