Yes, generally speaking, stress can lead to eye pressure. As we know that when you have stress, it can work on your eyes, and make your eye pressure high. Also, if your eyes suffer from high eye pressure, it can make the bloodshot to eyes. So at that time, you can say your eyes become red. Sometimes, if you have high blood pressure, you should be more careful about it.
And, when you have high eye pressure, it is possible for your eyes to have many eye diseases, such as dry eyes, or eye strain. Also, it can damage your vision in some degree. In addition, eye pressure significantly increases as a result of mental stress and smoking.
The term ocular hypertension usually refers to any situation in which the pressure inside the eye, called intraocular pressure, is higher than normal. Eye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 10-21 mm Hg.
Elevated intraocular pressure is a concern in people with ocular hypertension because it is one of the main risk factors for glaucoma. High pressure inside the eye is caused by an imbalance in the production and drainage of fluid in the eye (aqueous humor).
Eye pressure may also increase due to the use of topical steroid eye drops, which are used to treat eye inflammation. Typically, a healthy eye has an eye pressure of between 10 and 21 mm of mercury. On a daily basis this can increase or decrease due to exercise, stress, fluid consumption and even caffeine. If eye pressure is consistently over 21, then you may have ocular hypertension. If increased eye pressure leads to glaucoma, the optic nerve can become damaged and there is a heightened risk of blindness.
