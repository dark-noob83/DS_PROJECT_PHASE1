How much electricity does an American home use? In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. 
(Then divide by 1000 to get the kilowatt-hours, which is how your utility charges you.) Example: 100-watt bulb x 2 hours 1000 = 0.2 kWh. Trivia. The average U.S. household uses 920 kWh a month. (Dept. of Energy). The U.S. as a whole used nearly 4 trillion kWh in 2009. (DoE) About 37% was residential use. For example, an all-electric (no gas) San Francisco household has baseline quantities of 11.1 for summer and 20.2 for winter. In a 31-day month, the baseline is 11.1 x 31 = 344 kWh for summer and 20.2 x 31 = 626 kWh
1 For the first 10 kWh per day on average in summer or 16 kWh per day on average in winter, you pay the rate of $0.0376 per kWh. 2  For additional use over 11 kWh per day on average in summer or over 17 kWh on average in winter, you pay the rate of $0.0793 per kWh. 1 more appliance FAQ's... 2  For the first 10 kWh per day on average in summer or 16 kWh per day on average in winter, you pay the rate of $0.0376 per kWh. 3  For additional use over 11 kWh per day on average in summer or over 17 kWh on average in winter, you pay the rate of $0.0793 per kWh.
The average household in the United States uses about 8,900 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year.. there are 9000 hours in a year. so 9e3 kwatt-hour/9e3 = about 1kw average usage, averaged over time, is 1000 watts. At 10¢ per kw-hr, that is 10¢ per hour, or $2.40 per day or $900 per year. Surprisingly, the average person drives 37 miles per day, and the average car mpg in 2008 was 25 mpg, so that's about 1.5 gallons per person just on driving. This means a per household fuel usage of gas is likely double that, 3 gallons. So on average we use about 4 times as much energy driving, than we use in our home.
But there’s another value listed: how much energy you actually used. If you are a perfectly average American living in a perfectly average household, your monthly electricity bill will read 903 kilowatt hours (kWh), which costs $107, per household. But most of us don’t live in perfectly average households. (The state that comes closest to matching the average monthly electricity usage is Ohio). Depending on whether a state is hot or cold, urban or rural, an average household can use as little as 531 kWh a month (Maine) or as much as 1,245 kWh (Louisiana). Costs vary state-by-state, too. Hawaiians pay the most for electricity ($203 a month) and New Mexicans pay the least ($75 a month)
The average electricity consumption of a US family of four is in the neighborhood of 50 kWh per day, or 1,500 kWh per month. Similar figures apply for Canada. Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh, that translates into about $6 per day for electricity, or $180 per month. 
In the US typical household power consumption is about 11,700 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010. Our household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.
Therefore, the average home uses about 24 kilowatt hours of electricity in a 24 hour period. If your power rate is 10 cents per Kwh, then you are paying about 10 cents per hour or $2.40 per day-more if your home is electrically heated and you live in Fairbanks or Winnipeg in January. minefinder · 7 years ago.
