Former PGA Tour caddie Alfred “Rabbit” Dyer says that caddies may earn salaries of $2,000 per week, while “Forbes” magazine reports that PGA Tour caddies typically receive about $1,000 each week. The magazine said in a 2007 article that Steve Williams, then caddying for Tiger Woods, earned $1.27 million in 2006.
A survey by Salary Expert shows that, on average, caddie masters earn less than $40,000 a year except for those in San Francisco, Manhattan and Los Angeles. Forbes sports writer Matt Woolsey explains that PGA caddies earn an average of $1,000 each week.
What most caddies make. Caddies on the PGA Tour who work 30 weeks a year will usually make at least $50,000 annually. That figure goes up depending on how successful the caddie’s golfer is during the year.
Most PGA Tour caddies make between $1000 and $1500 per week, but they also make a percentage of what the player wins in the tournaments. This usually equates to 5 percent of any finish outside the top 10. Players breaking into the top 10, but not winning, will share 7 percent of their prize with their caddies.
Using the 2013 PGA Tour Money List, the minimum Tiger Woods' caddie would have received was $427,671. Because Tiger won five times in 2013, it's reasonable to assume the caddie made far more. In all, 33 golfers made more than $2 million in 2013. That means those caddies would receive a minimum of $100,000 in bonuses.
Another 50 golfers made between $1-$2 million, resulting in bonuses of at least $50,000. And if you were the caddie who finished 125th on the money list (the last person to guarantee a PGA Tour card for 2014), you would have received at least $30,508 in bonuses.
Caddies don't have an annual salary like most people do. The President of the Professional Caddies Association (PCA) recently told reporters that high end caddies typically earn a base weekly salary of somewhere between $1,000-$1,500. Again, caddies negotiate this deal with the golfer on a case by case basis. Some could make more. Some could make less. The average PGA Tour player plays between 20-30 events per year, so it would make sense to assume that the average salary would range from $20,000-$45,000. Bonuses: The real money for caddies comes from bonuses. The PCA President also explained that caddies earn at least 5% what the golfer makes in a given week.
