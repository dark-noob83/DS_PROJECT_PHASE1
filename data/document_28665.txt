The ever-popular weed prices. Sure enough, thereâ€™s good reason to keep searching those prices. The price of a recreational eighth of marijuana flower at a dozen prominent Colorado pot shops from January 2014 ($53.88) to December 2014 ($48.95) dropped by 9 percent, according to Denver Post data. And now, the whole U.S. map:
Over the past year, the price for 1/8th of an ounce of recreational pot dropped as much as 40% in Colorado, according to a report from global brokerage services company Convergex, which recently surveyed several marijuana dispensaries in the Centennial state.
Still, medical pot continues to sell, and at competitive prices. In Colorado, medical cannabis is about half the price of recreational cannabis. Denver dispensaries charge medical customers around $10 per gram; prices per gram for the retail stuff range from $15 to $25.
Recreational marijuana is now legal to buy in Colorado, and it's not cheap. But pot smokers who waited in five-hour long lines weren't necessarily looking for a deal on Green Wednesday. Our most expensive strains sold the quickest, said Toni Fox, proprietor of Denver's 3D Cannabis Center, to The Huffington Post.
For quantities larger than a gram, the median recreational price per gram ranges between $7.00 and $8.50, while the median medical price per gram is consistently about $5.60. To understand these price differentials, I spoke to Kayvan Khalatbari, co-founder of Denver Relief, a marijuana dispensary.
Marijuana sales are expected to generate nearly $70 million in tax revenue for Colorado in 2014. But some dispensary owners, like 3D's Fox, chose to absorb the cost of excise tax in order to keep marijuana prices competitive. Fox told HuffPost that her most expensive eighths sold for approximately $50 after taxes.
