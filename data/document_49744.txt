Your baby may be able to sit unsupported with her back straight. This will free her hands for exploring, and she'll learn how to turn when sitting to reach for a toy (Sheridan 2008) . At this point she may even be able to get into a sitting position from lying on her tummy by pushing up on her arms. The muscles she needs to use develop gradually from birth, and she finally becomes strong enough to sit between four months and seven months. By the time your baby is eight months old, she should be able to sit well without support (NHS 2013, Sheridan 2008) .
