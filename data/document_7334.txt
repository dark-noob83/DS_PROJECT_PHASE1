Grains can be purchased from bins or prepackaged. There are also foods that are made from grains that you can buy. As a general rule, brown grain food products are whole grains and white grains have been bleached and processed. But always check the food label and look for the 100% whole grains. This has the most fiber.
Any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley or another cereal grain is a grain product. Bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals, tortillas, and grits are examples of grain products. Grains are divided into 2 subgroups, Whole Grains and Refined Grains. Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel â€• the bran, germ, and endosperm. Examples of whole grains include whole-wheat flour, bulgur (cracked wheat), oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and brown rice. Refined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ.
This list of grains identifies grains from the Grass Family, other foods from the Grass Family, specifies which grains contain gluten, and lists alternative grains. Grains or cereals are edible seeds from plants of the Grass family.
