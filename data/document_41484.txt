1 Overall (Average) Solar panels cost (from recently updated figures in 2013) ranges between $1750 – $2500 per Kw of installed capacity (average Solar panel cost per kw). 2  This figure includes purchasing the equipment and cost for solar panel installation. 1 Simplistic estimation of FITs income – For a solar panel installation under a FITs scheme of $0.35c per kWh you will receive on average 1650 kwh x 0.35$/kwh = approx. 2  $580 per year per kW installed. i.e. a 5kw home solar panels system will generate 5x$580 = $2900 per year.
The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.72/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. “Common residential system prices ranged from less than $3.00/W to just above $7.00/W,” the Solar Energy Industries Association writes. The total price of a system, of course, varies tremendously based on the size of your roof and your electricity needs.
This is no longer true. The effective rate for solar power spread across the life of a system is $0.08/kWh. The average cost for conventional energy is $0.12/kWh and rising. The price for solar panel installation will be continued to be updated on this page. As of early 2015, it’s approximately $3.00 per installed watt. The average sized solar panel system is 5,000 watts, so this brings the total cost to $15,000. That 15k figure is just an average amount.
Our annual electrical usage each year is a miserly 4,800 kilowatt-hours, of which 75 percent is produced by the solar-electric array. The average cost across the country for a professionally installed system is about $8 to $9 per watt, with batteries adding an additional 20 to 30 percent to the cost. If you are a handy do-it-yourselfer, you can save around $2 per watt, but your system may be more difficult to certify for incentives. Most off-grid homes need to be very energy-wise to keep costs for a solar energy system within bounds. Although if the utility grid is located more than one-half mile away, even a fairly large solar-electric system will cost less than having the utility bring in power.
Year-over-year, the national average PV installed system price declined by 9% to $2.73/watt in Q2 2014. The average price of a residential PV installation in Q2 2014 was $3.92/watt, 41% lower than 2010. Since the second quarter of 2010, the average price of a solar panel has declined by 64%. The solar panels themselves usually account for about 30% of total costs. Residential solar panels with a combined capacity of 3-8kW typically cost between $4,000-$16,000. The best solar panels are not necessarily the most expensive.
The cost of installing solar power on a mid-sized home is between $30,000 to $40,000 dollars, which covers about 30 panels. If you’re connecting off the grid, expect a higher price tag to cover the cost of extra wiring and materials. Those 30 panels will produce about 8350 kW hours of energy a year or 22 kW hours a day. 
The average price of a solar panel has declined by 60% since the beginning of 2011, according to GTM Research. And, according to CleanTechnica, a website dedicated to renewable energy news, the price of solar power has fallen rom $76.67 per watt in 1977 to 74 cents today. 
That translates to about $34,800 for a four-kilowatt system, the average size of a residential installation.

For example, the total average cost of an installed residential PV system under the California Solar Initiative is $8.70 per Watt (including installation, as of January 2011).
