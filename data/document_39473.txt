“The average man’s speaking voice, for example, typically has a fundamental frequency between 85 Hz and 155 Hz. A woman’s speech range is about 165 Hz to 255 Hz, and a child’s voice typically ranges from 250 Hz to 300 Hz and higher.”. As is specified later on in the article, there is much overlap.
Perhaps a measurement of something more relevant to the voice source itself, such as the size of the larynx, would be more helpful. Men, on average, have a larynx which is about 40% taller and longer (measured along the axis of the vocal folds) than women, as seen below.
The findings on frequency and intensity in readings and voice acoustic analysis (ie, the mean value, fundamental frequency range, standard deviation of each parameter) are displayed in Table 3 for men and Table 4 for women. Also, the findings on statistical analysis are summarized in Table 5.
Baby cries have a fundamental frequency (hereafter referred to as Fo) of around 500 Hz (roughly corresponding to the note B4). Child speech ranges from 250-400 Hz (notes B3 to G4, adult females tend to speak at around 200 Hz on average (about G3), and adult males around 125 Hz (or, B2).
According to Boone and McFarlane and Hedge, the typical fundamental frequency is about 125 Hz for men and about 225 Hz for women. 2,5 There appears to be strong consensus that the average F0 falls between 120 and 130 Hz for males and between 220 and 225 Hz for females.
The average man’s speaking voice, for example, typically has a fundamental frequency between 85 Hz and 155 Hz. A woman’s speech range is about 165 Hz to 255 Hz, and a child’s voice typically ranges from 250 Hz to 300 Hz and higher.
The voiced speech of a typical adult male will have a fundamental frequency from 85 to 180 Hz, and that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255 Hz. Thus, the fundamental frequency of most speech falls below the bottom of the voice frequency band as defined above.
A voice frequency (VF) or voice band is one of the frequencies, within part of the audio range, that is used for the transmission of speech. In telephony, the usable voice frequency band ranges from approximately 300 Hz to 3400 Hz.
