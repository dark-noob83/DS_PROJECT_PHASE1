Length, Width, Height, Weight. Total length of Bridge including approaches from abutment to abutment is 1.7 miles (8,981 ft or 2,737 m). Total length of Bridge including approaches from abutment to abutment, plus the distance to the Toll Plaza, is 9,150 ft (2,788 m). Length of suspension span including main span and side spans is 1.2 miles (6,450 ft or 1,966 m). Weight of Bridge, excluding anchorages and approaches, and including the suspended structure, main towers, piers and fenders, bottom lateral system and orthotropic redecking (1986) is 419,800 tons (380,800,000 kg *).
The Golden Gate Bridge's clearance above high water averages 220 feet (67 m) while its towers, at 746 feet (227 m) above the water, were the world's tallest on a suspension bridge until 1998 when bridges in Denmark and Japan were completed. The Golden Gate Bridge is the top most used suicide site/ suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (see List of suicide sites). The deck is about 245 feet (75 m) above the water. After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph or about 120 km/h.
From http://goldengatebridge.org/research/fac... Clearance above mean higher high water: 220 ft = 67 m However, it's not that easy. (1) The depth of the bay varies due to tidal forces. So the height of the water from the roadway varies by the hour. (2) Because the Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge, the roadway is suspended from the two towers, higher in the middle and lower at each end.

The Golden Gate Bridge has two main towers that support the two main cables. The height of a tower above water is 746 ft (227 m). The height of a tower above roadway is 500 ft (152 m). Tower base dimension (each leg) is 33 ft x 54 ft (10 m x 16 m).

The Golden Gate Bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the opening into the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. It connects the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County as part of US Highway 101 and California State Highway 1. The Golden Gate Bridge also had the world's tallest suspension towers at the time of construction, and retained that record until more recently. In 1957, Michigan 's Mackinac Bridge surpassed the Golden Gate Bridge's length to become the world's longest two-tower suspension bridge in total length between anchorages.
The Frommers travel guide considers the Golden Gate Bridge possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world. It opened in 1937 and was, until 1964, the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,300 m). The Golden Gate Bridge is the top most used suicide site/ suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (see List of suicide sites). The deck is about 245 feet (75 m) above the water. After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph or about 120 km/h.
The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, the 1 mile (1.6 km) wide, 3 mile (5 km) long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The Golden Gate Bridge is the top most used suicide site/ suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (see List of suicide sites). The deck is about 245 feet (75 m) above the water. After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75 mph or about 120 km/h.
