Horseradish peroxidase is a 44,173.9-dalton glycoprotein with 6 lysine residues which can be conjugated to a labeled molecule. It produces a coloured, fluorimetric, or luminescent derivative of the labeled molecule when incubated with a proper substrate, allowing it to be detected and quantified. Horseradish peroxidase catalyses the oxidation of luminol to 3-aminophthalate via several intermediates. The reaction is accompanied by emission of low-intensity light at 428 nm.

DEFINITION of 'Human Resource Planning-HRP'. The ongoing process of systematic planning to achieve optimum use of an organization's most valuable asset-its human resources. The objective of human resource (HR) planning is to ensure the best fit between employees and jobs, while avoiding manpower shortages or surpluses. BREAKING DOWN 'Human Resource Planning-HRP'. The HR plan needs to be flexible enough to meet short-term staffing challenges, while adapting to changing conditions in the business and environment over the longer term. Human resource planning is also a continuous process.
HRP-4 is a life-size platform for research and development of working humanoid robots we have developed in collaboration with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), an independent administrative legal entity. We have achieved the HRP-4 as a new platform for research and development of working humanoid robots, for instance by mounting the 80W or less motors to all axes taking into account the safety requirements for the robot.
Thermo Scientific Pierce Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) is purified horseradish peroxidase enzyme for use in activity assays and conjugation to antibodies for ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry applications. Features of Thermo Scientific Pierce Horseradish Peroxidase: COA. 
The enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP), found in the roots of horseradish, is used extensively in biochemistry applications primarily for its ability to amplify a weak signal and increase detectability of a target molecule. It is a metalloenzyme with many isoforms, of which the most studied type is C. Horseradish peroxidase catalyses the oxidation of luminol to 3-aminophthalate via several intermediates. The reaction is accompanied by emission of low-intensity light at 428 nm.
HRP-2 is the final robotic platform for the Humanoid Robotics Project headed by the Manufacturing Science and Technology Center (MSTC), which is sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) through New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
