Loquats may be found growing from 20° to 35°N and are best adapted to subtropical and warm temperate climates. Loquat is a subtropical evergreen fruit tree that blooms in the fall and early winter and is harvested during the spring.
Overview. The loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) grows as a small evergreen tree or shrub. It rarely exceeds 30 feet in height and normally averages only 10 feet. Large clusters of 1- to 2-inch fruits grow in profusion. A few cultivars offer self-pollination, but others require a pollinator planted close by.
Distribution: Loquat is grown in southern Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Near, Middle, and Far East, North Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the East Indies (at moderate altitudes), and North, Central, and South America.
Gardeners and landscapers enjoy growing loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) for its small, juicy fruits, handsome evergreen foliage and fragrant white flowers. The tree grows an umbrella-shaped canopy that provides shade in hot, sunny areas. A loquat tree can reach up to 30 feet tall in its 20- to 30-year lifespan.
Soil: Loquats grow well on a variety of soils of moderate fertility, from light sandy loam to heavy clay and even limestone soils, but need good drainage. Irrigation: Loquat trees are drought tolerant, but they will produce higher quality fruit with regular, deep watering.
Find a sunny spot free of obstructions or nearby trees. Loquat trees can grow up to 30 feet in height and have huge, round crowns, so they need space--at least 6 to 8 feet between trees. Break up the ground with pickaxe to a depth of about 1 foot, then mix in potting soil.
Fruit: Loquat fruits, growing in clusters, are oval, rounded or pear-shaped, 1 to 2 inches long with a smooth or downy, yellow or orange, sometimes red-blushed skin. The succulent, tangy flesh is white, yellow or orange and sweet to subacid or acid, depending on the cultivar.
