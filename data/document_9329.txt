How long does it take alcohol to leave your urine: People metabolize alcohol usually, at the rate of 1/2 to 3/4ounce every hour (which is about half an ounce of one standard drink). This is equal to 4 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, 10 ounces of microbrew. • It would take approx 3.33 hours for .05 BAC of alcohol to leave your body. • For .08 BAC of alcohol, which is the legal limit set in United States, it would take approx 5.33 hours for you body to be alcohol free.
If a person drinks 250 ml of wine, it would take three hours for the body to metabolize the alcohol. A 500 ml beer would take about two hours. But a strong 500ml strong beer would take much longer since it contains about three units of alcohol. 
Still using the two examples above, there would be no measurable alcohol in the woman's body in about 6-1/4 hours, and the man's body in about 2-3/4 hours. Below is a list of BACs and the approximate time it takes for alcohol to leave your system. 1  A BAC of .02 will take about 1.33 hours to leave your system. 1 A BAC of .02 will take about 1.33 hours to leave your system. 2  A BAC of .05 will take about 3.33 hours to leave your system. 3  A BAC of .08 (the legal limit in the United States) will take about 5.33 hours to leave your system. 4  A BAC of .10 will take about 6.66
How long does it take alcohol to get out of your blood? As a general rule of thumb, the major metabolite in alcohol, can be detected in your blood for up to 24 hours and as gross as it sounds...in your urine for up to 48 hours. Generally speaking, people metabolize alcohol at the rate of 1/2 ounce per hour (that's half an ounce of absolute alcohol -- or one standard drink) -- roughly equivalent to: 12 ounces of beer, 10 ounces of microbrew, 6 ounces of wine cooler (or hard lemonade), 1-1/4 ounces of 80-proof liquor or 4 ounces of wine.
After 4 hours – your BAC would be 0.02. After 5 hours – your BAC would be 0.005. Alcohol would be eliminated from the body at about 5 hours and 20 minutes (the body metabolizes alcohol at the rate of about 0.005 per twenty minutes, as 0.005 x 3 = 0.015). So it is easy to tell when your body will be free of alcohol. 
However, 20 drinks is a negligible amount of alcohol in your system and even this amount of alcohol in your bloodstream is not detectable after 24 hours. Check out the BAC calculator above to calculate different drink combinations within a 24 hour period. One serving of alcohol is fully absorbed into the blood stream within 30 minutes to 2 hours after intake. This is because the body can metabolize about 0.25 ounces of alcohol per hour. However, the effects of alcohol vary by individual and by how much alcohol they drink in one session.
Adding up your units. If you drink a large (250ml) glass of wine, your body takes about three hours to break down the alcohol. If you drink one pint of beer, your body takes about two hours to break it down. One pint of strong lager is equivalent to three units, so this will take longer. However, this time can vary depending on the factors mentioned above. If you have a few drinks during a night out, it can take many hours for the alcohol to leave your body. The alcohol could still be in your blood the next day. This means that if you drive the day after an evening of drinking, you could be over the legal alcohol limit.
It depends on how much you weigh and how high your BA is. BA stands for Breath Alcohol. Say you would be a .08 (this is the legal limit in most states now), your body would process that alcohol at a rate of .0032 an hour. So it would about 6-7 hours to process out of your system. But in your case, if you have to take a urine test for alcohol content, it is only in your system for a maximun of 24 hours. Just think of how many times you have to pee when you are drinking once you break the seal.
Therefore, if you consume three standard drinks -- regardless of how long it took you to drink them -- it would take you three hours to be completely free of alcohol. This should hopefully make it apparent that alcohol builds up in your body over time because the liver can only metabolize one an hour. Generally speaking, people metabolize alcohol at the rate of 1/2 ounce per hour (that's half an ounce of absolute alcohol -- or one standard drink) -- roughly equivalent to: 12 ounces of beer, 10 ounces of microbrew, 6 ounces of wine cooler (or hard lemonade), 1-1/4 ounces of 80-proof liquor or 4 ounces of wine.
