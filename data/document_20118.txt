Sulfur in plants is a component of some vitamins and is important in helping give flavor to mustard, onions and garlic. Sulfur born in fertilizer assists in seed oil production, but the mineral can accumulate in sandy or overworked soil layers.
Sulfur Reactions in Soil. The form of sulfur taken up by plants is sulfate-sulfur and must be constantly replenished. Sulfur from all sources must either be in the sulfate form or be converted to the sulfate form before it can be used by plants. As mentioned above, organic matter is the major reservoir of sulfur in most soils.
Overview. Sulfur is a plentiful element found in nature. Though less commonly known than nitrogen or iron, sulfur is a vital mineral necessary for balanced soil, plant growth and reproduction. Sold as a fertilizer, an herbicide and an insecticide, sulfur affects soil pH and, therefore, must be used with care.
The unpleasant odor of rotten eggs and sewage is from hydrogen sulfide; the odor given off by burning matches is sulfur dioxide. Sulfur in the soil is generally in a sulfate form, and microbes change it to sulfide compounds that enter the soil solution and can be taken up by plant roots for growth.
The ratio of sulfur in plants is 10:1 and carried in the tissues of the plant. Much of this is brought up from natural soil decay and previous plant matter. Some minerals found in soil contain sulfur, which is released as the minerals break down. A less obvious sulfur source for plants is from the atmosphere.
Sulfur can be used in the soil or on the tomato plant to help develop tasty tomatoes. Growing your own juicy, red tomatoes is relatively easy. But when leaves yellow or the fruit fails to mature, sulfur can help, both in the soil and dusted on leaves as a fungicide and insecticide.
Sulfur is necessary for all living cells, but humans and animals only get it from plants. In plants, sulfur is essential for nitrogen-fixing nodules on legumes, and necessary in the formation of chlorophyll. Plants use sulfur in the processes of producing proteins, amino acids, enzymes and vitamins.
