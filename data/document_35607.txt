The Spurs still have a lot of money to make up. LaMarcus Aldridge is not signing with the Spurs for a first-year salary of $10 million, no matter how much he wants to leave Portland.

The first-year maximum salary for Aldridge is a little less than 30 percent of what's expected to be a $67.1 million cap, which comes out to about $18.8 million. The Spurs are $22 million OVER the cap with all their holds. Time to start hacking away.
