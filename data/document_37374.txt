Pawn King was established in 2007. It is family owned and operated and is the largest of its kind in Upstate New York. Our staff participates in regular training classes to ensure you always get the best service, most accurate evaluation and ultimately, the best prices for your items.
Pawn Stars began with Brent Montgomery and Colby Gaines of Leftfield Pictures, who were struck by the array of eclectic and somewhat seedy pawn shops in Las Vegas during a 2008 weekend visit to the city.
From jewelry to power tools and laptops to sporting goods, Pawn King has all of the items you want for less. Either in the store or online, our experienced staff will make sure your purchase is tested, cleaned and ready for you to enjoy.
How to Find Out Who Owns an LLC. A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid business form that combines principles of a partnership with aspects of a corporation. Like corporations, LLCs must register with their state of formation.
