Layers of the GI tract. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is formed, with a few exceptions, by four concentric layers of tissue. These are, from deep to superficial, the mucosa, submucosa, muscular (or muscularis) and the serosa layers. This is the simplified version. The fact is that there are more sublayers.

Muscularis: The muscularis is responsible for segmental contractions and peristaltic movement in the GI tract. The muscularis is composed of two layers of muscle: an inner circular and outer longitudinal layer of smooth muscle.
Within the stomach and intestines, there are three layers of muscular tissue. These need to withstand high pressures and force the food material through the digestive system. … In the esophagus the muscular layer is much thinner. It is also smoother in the esophagus.
The GI tract contains four layers: the innermost layer is the mucosa, underneath this is the submucosa, followed by the muscularis propria and finally, the outermost layer-the adventitia. The structure of these layers varies, in different regions of the digestive system, depending on their function.
They are both a type of mechanical digestion that is involved in the gastrointestinal tract.   Peristalsis is the slow and gradual movement of food through the digestive s … ystem. The food is crushed and propelled in one direction as smooth muscle contracts and forces the food along
Muscularis Extema is the layer of the digestive tract wall that is responsible for peristalsis.
there are four layers in the digestive tract: the inner most layer is the mucosal layer the second is the sub-mucosal layer then cones the muscular layer responsible for peri … stalisis e.g..teh circular muscle and the longitudinal muscles the outermost layer is a thin membrane known as the serous coat.
