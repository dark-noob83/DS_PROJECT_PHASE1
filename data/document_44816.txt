A major organelle in most eukaryotic cells is the structure of membrane-bound sacs called the Golgi apparatus (or Golgi body, Golgi complex, dictyosome). It acts to process and package the macromolecules such as proteins and lipids that are synthesized by the cell. It has been likened to the cell's post office.
n. A network of stacked membranous vesicles, present in most living cells, that stores and modifies proteins and other macromolecules and transports them within the cell or excretes them from the cell. Also called Golgi body, Golgi complex.
The Golgi Apparatus is an organelle found in most Eukaryotic cells. It was identified in 1897 by the Italian physician Camillio Golgi and named after him. The function of the Golgi is to make proteins for the cell. The Golgi apparatus job is to send the packages elsewhere in the cell or to the outside of the cell.

Golgi Apparatus Definition. The Golgi complex is referred to as the manufacturing and the shipping center of the eukaryoric cell. The Golgi apparatus or the Golgi body or Golgi complex or Golgi is a cellular organelle present in most of the cells of the eukaryotic organisms.
Definition of GOLGI APPARATUS. : a cytoplasmic organelle that consists of a stack of smooth membranous saccules and associated vesicles and that is active in the modification and transport of proteins —called also Golgi complex — see cell illustration.
A structure within many cells that is composed of a series of sacs, called vesicles, and is thought to play a role in the synthesis and transport of proteins. All organisms except bacteria have at least one Golgi apparatus in their cells. See more at cell.
