1 If your project involves making observations and doing experiments, you should probably follow the Scientific Method. 2  If your project involves designing, building, and testing something, you should probably follow the Engineering Design Process. Key Info. 1  The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to come up with a solution to a problem. 2  Many times the solution involves designing a product (like a machine or computer code) that meets certain criteria and/or accomplishes a certain task.
If you haven't already done so, please read the preamble. It contains important background information to help you understand the content of this webpage. Project scope definition is a core project planning process (see figure 6.x). It involves identifying and describing the work that is needed to produce the product of the project in sufficient detail to ensure that: 1  The project team understands what it must do. If this process is poorly done, it is unlikely that the rest of the project planning will be well-done. Special Considerations.

If you are doing the work yourself, then it is another set of eyes checking things out. There is no need to worry about a surprise inspection, in fact, inspectors only come when you call and schedule an appointment. How the inspection process works if you are doing the project yourself: 1  When a project is ready to be inspected you need to call and schedule an inspectio
