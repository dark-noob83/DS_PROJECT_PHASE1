The bones of the ear, also known as the auditory ossicles, are the three smallest bones in the human body. These bones play an important role in the sense of hearing by transmitting sounds to the inner ear. Anatomy The three auditory ossicles – the malleus, incus, and stapes – are tiny bones found in the middle ear.
The three auditory ossicles are located in the middle ear. Their function is to transmit and amplify the sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane (eardrum) to the oval window. The ears change the high amplitude, low pressure waves of sound in air. into the low amplitude, high pressure waves of sound in water.
The three bones of the middle ear, malleus (m), incus (i) and stapes (s) are shown in panel A as they articulate with each other. In panel B, the ossicles are shown in isolation so that their parts can be viewed. The malleus is the lateral most ossicle.
The Ossicles. The three tiniest bones in the body form the coupling between the vibration of the eardrum and the forces exerted on the oval window of the inner ear. Formally named the malleus, incus, and stapes, they are commonly referred to in English as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup.

They form a connecting bony system from the tympanic membrane to the oval window that is the opening to the internal ear. auditory tube. the narrow channel connecting the nasopharynx to the middle ear.
