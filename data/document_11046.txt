.73 to .78 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight per day. In this category that 180 pound person would need 131 to 140 grams of protein each day. If you're a VEGETARIAN it is suggested you increase your protein intake above suggested levels by another 10%.
For strength athletes, those numbers are even higher--generally between 0.7 and 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight, he says. If you've been shooting for a gram of protein per pound of body weight--or more--you're overdoing it.
I've also seen numbers such as between 0.8 and 1 gram of protein per kilogram of weight a day (about 7 grams per 20 pounds. So a person who weighs 150 pounds would need around 52 grams a day.). I'm ~250lbs right now. I was 260 but I'm cutting wieght to 240. I'm not doing any serious training
Conclusion. Hopefully you've been convinced that a high protein intake is not evil.. Protein intake ranging from 1.4 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight to one gram per pound or more can be beneficial for an individual involved in an intense training program.
