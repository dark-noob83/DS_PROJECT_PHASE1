1 Muscle spasm in the shoulder-blade area. 2  Swelling in the shoulder-blade area. 3  Loss of strength (moderate or severe strain). 4  Crepitation (crackling) feeling and sound when the injured area is pressed with finger. 5  Calcification of the muscle or its tendon (visible with X-ray). 6  Inflammation of sheath covering the tendon.
So what is the best cure to soothe those aching muscles â€“ heat or ice? Before you reach for the heating pad, take note that applying heat to a muscle strain within the first 24 hours will actually increase swelling and pain. So your best bet, at least for the first full day, is to doctor your hurting muscles with a cold compress.

If theres inflammation/swelling ice is better than heat, and can also help numb pain. If there is no swelling heat is good for reducing pain. Ice - 20 minutes on 20 minutes off throughout the first day of the strain. Then heat after the first 24 hours.
