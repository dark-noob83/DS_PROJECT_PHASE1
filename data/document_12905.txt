Krystol Internal Membrane or KIM is an integral crystalline concrete waterproofing admixture. When combined with water, KIM’s proprietary chemicals react to form millions of needle-like crystals. These crystals grow and fill the capillary pores and micro-cracks in the concrete, blocking the flow of water.
Description. Hydrostop Sealer is a clear, water-based sprayable liquid which activates a water-repellent effect on the surfaces of concrete, brick, mortar and masonry.
Krystol T1 & T2 system is a surface-applied crystalline waterproofing treatment for concrete structures that is used to protectagainst the ingress of water. It is a dry powder, that when mixed with water becomes a coating that is applied to the inner orouter sides of a concrete structure.
The finished application is virtually invisible, leaving the surface with its original appearance and breathability. Use Hydrostop Sealer over Hydrostop Coating as a part of the Hydrostop Restore & Protect System™ to increase value and performance of that system.
For protecting existing concrete and masonry, refer to Application Instruction 7.11 — Sealing Above Grade Concrete & Masonry. Hydrostop is best applied with a low pressure sprayer while the surface temperature is above 4 °C (40 °F) and must remain above 4 °C (40 °F) for a minimum of 24 hours.
TOPCOAT® Membrane. TOPCOAT® Elastomeric Roofing Membrane is a water-based, spray-applied liquid, which cures to form a seamless 100% acrylic elastomeric membrane. TOPCOAT®Membrane WOB. Water-based, brush, roll or spray-applied liquid which cures to form a seamless rubber membrane that covers the entire roof. TOPCOAT®MB Plus. Water-based, low VOC, acrylic, sprayable polymeric liquid, which cures to form a seamless rubber membrane.
