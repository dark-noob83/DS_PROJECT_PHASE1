If the NiFi instance to connect to is clustered, the URL should be that of the NiFi Cluster Manager. In this case, the Receiver will automatically contact the Cluster Manager to determine which nodes are in the cluster and will automatically start pulling data from all nodes.
Apache NiFi is a software application that is currently undergoing incubation within the Apache Software Foundation. NiFi is an enterprise integration and dataflow automation tool that allows a user to send, receive, route, transform, and sort data, as needed, in an automated and configurable way.
Apache NiFi is a dataflow system that is currently under incubation at the Apache Software Foundation. NiFi is based on the concepts of flow-based programming and is highly configurable. NiFi uses a component based extension model to rapidly add capabilities to complex dataflows.
Apache nifi supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of the high-level capabilities and objectives of Apache NiFi include: 1  Web-based user interface. 2  Seamless experience between design, control, feedback, and monitoring.
Similar tools exist, but NiFi is different because of its user-friendly drag-and-drop graphical user interface and the ease with which it can be customized on the fly for specific needs. Think of creating a simple flow chart of what you want to do with your data; that is how easy it is to create a dataflow in NIFi.
