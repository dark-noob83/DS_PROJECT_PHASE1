Fasting blood glucose: A test to determine how much glucose (sugar) is in a blood sample after an overnight fast. The fasting blood glucose test is commonly used to detect diabetes mellitus. A blood sample is taken in a lab, physician's office, or hospital. The test is done in the morning, before the person has eaten. 
1 Fasting blood sugar test. 2  A blood sample will be taken after an overnight fast. 3  A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. 4  A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. 1 A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. 2  A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. 3  If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes. 4  Oral glucose tolerance test.
1 Oral glucose tolerance test. 2  For this test, you fast overnight, and the fasting blood sugar level is measured. 3  Then you drink a sugary liquid, and blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours. 4  A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal. 1 A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. 2  A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. 3  If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes. 4  Oral glucose tolerance test.

Typically it will be 1 hour but can go as long as 3 hours. You will drink the glucose drink (orange is the best) and from there get blood taken every half hour for the duration of the test. So if the test is 1 hour you will get blood drawn twice, 2 hours four times and 3 hours 6 times. You must fast from midnight the night before until after the test is administered.
The fasting blood glucose test is the test most commonly used to diagnose diabetes. It measures blood glucose levels after a period of fasting, usually at least eight hours without food or liquid (except water). If the first level is above 125 mg/dL, the fasting blood glucose test will be done again (for example, the next day) to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. A value between 100 and 125 mg/dL indicates pre-diabetes. Someone with a result in this range should be followed closely, with follow-up testing
It depends on the type of blood test. For fasting sugar tests it  can have an affect. Fasting longer than 12 to 14 hours will cause  your body to start utilizing glycogen th â€¦ at is primarily stored in  your muscles and that can affect blood tests for fasting sugar.
