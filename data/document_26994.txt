3, 2013 10:45 AM ET | About: AmBase Corp. (ABCP) by: Chris Karlin. My initial thesis-that the discount to cash at Ambase (OTCPK:ABCP) would narrow when the 12/31/12 financials were recognized-did not play out and is no longer applicable. However, given the change in events and the dramatically lower stock price, I believe Ambase currently offers a very intriguing reward-to-risk profile. After the close on 6/21/13, Ambase filed an 8-K providing minimal detail on a real estate joint venture deal it had entered.
