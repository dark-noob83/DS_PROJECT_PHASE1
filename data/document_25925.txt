A mini refrigerator uses about 70 watts per hour or 0.07 KWH. Therefore it uses about 24 times 0.07 KWH, or 1.68 Kilowatt Hours per day. There are varied sizes of mini refrigerators and varying degrees of. insulation, so the wattage may vary from 40 watts per hour to 100 watts per hour or .96 KWH to 2.4 KWH per day. How much total … energy a 60 watt light bulb consumes, which is the amount of electricity that has to be paid-for, is measured in watt•hours (that's watts times hours). So a 60 watt bulb consumes 60 watt•hours in one hour, or 60 Wh x 24 hr/day = 1440 Wh per day. That is the same as 1.44 kilowatt•hours (kWh), so, if you look up what your electricity supplier charges for 1 kWh you can figure out how much it would cost you in mone
The power usage is measured in watts and kilowatts (a kilowatt =1000 watts), and the amount of energy that it consumes in watt-hours or kilowatt hours (kWh). A single bar electric fire often uses electricity at the rate of one kilowatt (kW) per hour. So, in an hour an electric fire will use one kilowatt hour (kWh). 
So, To convert these wattages into a daily use of kilowatt hours (kWh – the standard billing unit of electricity suppliers), the following equation applies -. (Wattage x eight) ÷ 1000 = kWh per day. Where eight represents our presumed eight hours active time per day. Thus a 600 Watt unit – typical of older, larger refrigerators – would use 4.8 kilowatt hours daily, or 1750 per year; where a more modern 140 watt unit uses about 1.1 kWh daily, or approximately 400 per year. This is how many watts does a refrigerator use. No information is provided by the author. 
Annual cost to operate: The utility rate is 11 cents per kWh.4.68 kWh × $0.11/kWh = $0.51/year. Determining how much electricity your appliances and home electronics use can help you understand how much money you are spending to use them. Wattage: The wattage is on the label and is listed at 1500 W. 3. Daily energy consumption:(1,500 W × 1) ÷ 1,000 = 1.5 kWh 4. Annual energy consumption: The kettle is used almost every day of the year.1.5 kWh × 365 = 547.5 kWh 5. Annual cost: The utility rate is 11 cents per kWh.547.5 kWh × $0.11/kWh = $60.23/year II.
A fridge will use anywhere from 100 to 400 watts depending on size, an average modern fridge will use 180 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a refrigerator using 180 Watts for 24 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Cost Per Hour: Hours Used Per Day: Enter how many hours the device is being used on average per a day, if the power consumption is lower than 1 hour per a day enter as a decimal.
A 1986-era 18 c.f. fridge uses 1400 kWh a year, while a modern energy-efficient model uses only 350 kWh — a whopping 75% reduction. At 15 kWh, trading in a pre-1986 fridge for a new efficient one would save about $158 a year in electricity costs. And some older fridges are even worse than the average. One reader estimates her savings to be $238 per year for trading in her 1979 fridge for a 2004 model. Fridge should be 36-40F, and the freezer should be 0-5F (-17 to -10C). Fridges set 10 degrees lower than needed (or freezers set 5 degrees lower than needed) can increase energy use by as much as 20-25%. Personally, I set my own fridge to 56 because as a vegan I never store super-perishables like meat or dairy.
Price (kWh): Enter the cost you are paying on average per a kilowatt hour, average price in North America is 10 cents. If you are using an old fridge we highly recommend you upgrade to a more efficient modern model, advances in the past 15-20 years have reduced the energy use of refrigeration. Hours Used Per Day: Enter how many hours the device is being used on average per a day, if the power consumption is lower than 1 hour per a day enter as a decimal.
Annual cost: The utility rate is 11 cents per kWh. 547.5 kWh × $0.11/kWh = $60.23/year. II. Following the steps above, find the annual cost to operate a paper shredder. 1. Estimate of time used: The shredder is used for about 15 minutes per day (0.25 hour). Wattage: The wattage is on the label and is listed at 1500 W. 3. Daily energy consumption:(1,500 W × 1) ÷ 1,000 = 1.5 kWh 4. Annual energy consumption: The kettle is used almost every day of the year.1.5 kWh × 365 = 547.5 kWh 5. Annual cost: The utility rate is 11 cents per kWh.547.5 kWh × $0.11/kWh = $60.23/year II.
(For example: 30 minutes per a day is 0.5). If you are using an old fridge we highly recommend you upgrade to a more efficient modern model, advances in the past 15-20 years have reduced the energy use of refrigeration. Hours Used Per Day: Enter how many hours the device is being used on average per a day, if the power consumption is lower than 1 hour per a day enter as a decimal.
