ECC Memory. ECC (Error Correction Codes) is a method used to detect and correct errors introduced during data storage or transmission. Certain kinds of RAM chips inside a computer implement this technique to correct data errors and are known as 
With ECC memory, there is an extra ECC bit, which is known as a parity bit. This extra parity bit makes the binary code read 10110001 0, where the last zero is the parity bit and is used to identify memory errors.
ECC (which stands for Error Correction Code) RAM is very popular in servers or other systems with high-value data as it protects against data corruption by automatically detecting and correcting memory errors. Standard RAM uses banks of eight memory chips in which data is stored and provided to the CPU on demand.
Error-correcting code memory (ECC memory) is a type of computer data storage that can detect and correct the most common kinds of internal data corruption. ECC memory is used in most computers where data corruption cannot be tolerated under any circumstances, such as for scientific or financial computing.
ECC is a method of detecting and then correcting single-bit memory errors. A single-bit memory error is a data error in server output or production, and the presence of errors can have a big impact on server performance. There are two types of single-bit memory errors: hard errors and soft errors.
ECC RAM stands for “Error-correcting code – random access memory” or simply ECC memory. It is a type of computer data storage system that features error-correction capabilities. ECC RAM is typically used in computer servers and in financial computing where error-detection is very important to protect computer data. Memory chips with ECC are able to detect and/or correct common errors at the time of storage and transport of data.
