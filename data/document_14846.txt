A climate zone is a region of the world where the climate can be defined using a few key parameters. There are a number of different ways to classify the world's climate zones, and a wide assortment of uses for this information.
Climate Zone: are divisions of the Earth's climates into general climate zones according to average temperatures and average rainfall. The three major climate zones on the Earth are the polar, temperate, and tropical zones. Temperatures in these three climate zones are determined mainly by the location, or latitude, of the zone. 1  polar-has the coldest with temperatures almost always below freezing.
Earth has three main climate zones—tropical, temperate, and polar. These zones can be further divided into smaller zones, each with its own typical climate. A region’s climate, together with its physical characteristics, determines its plant and animal life.
Climate zones. Climate zones. Source: wikipedia.org. Climate zones are areas with distinct climates, which occur in east-west direction around the Earth, and can be classified using different climatic parametres. Generally, climate zones are belt-shaped and circular around the Poles (see picture on the right).
Climate Zones Objectives: 1. Describe Earth's major climate zones. 2. Explain how climate zones are characterized. Notes: According to the three cell convection model of each hemisphere the Earth neatly separates itself into three distinct climate zones; the polar, temperate, and the tropical zones.
