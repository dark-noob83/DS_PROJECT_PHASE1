Fluctuations. Most bonuses aren't that consistent, even if you stay with the same employer. If your bonus has varied over the past couple of years, your lender may average it out: $12,000 this year and $8,000 last year gives you $20,000 for 48 months, or $416 extra income a month. A lender will typically look at your income for the past couple of years. If you've earned a $12,000 bonus both years and the lender accepts that the bonuses will keep coming, that translates into $1,000 added to your average monthly income.
Most workers earn a salary or hourly rate, which is typically the largest part of a person's total income. For example a marketing manager may earn $80,000 per year in salary. Excluding any incentive payments, the $80,000 salary may represent 85 percent of the marketing manager's total annual income. A worker's salary or hourly rate will usually increase as she gains experience.
An employee's hourly rate for a job is based on his salary and the number of hours he's supposed to work. When you calculate an hourly rate, do not include any other compensation, such as overtime or bonus pay, or value provided by an employee benefit program, such as vacation or sick pay. Hourly Rate Calculation. To convert a full-time salary to an hourly rate, use the standard hours for the job to calculate the hourly wage. For example, to convert an annual salary of $52,000 to an hourly rate for a job that requires 2,080 hours per year, divide 52,000 by 2,080 to arrive at an hourly rate of $25.
For example, one year, I got a $4000 bonus standard performance bonus and a $15000 project completion bonus. I would have reported the $4000 bonus as part of my salary, and called out the $15000 bonus as a bonus. That's just me, take it for what it's worth. 
An employee's salary is often expressed as an annual figure, such as $30,000 per year. Do not add any other income such as a bonus to an employee's salary when you calculate the hourly rate. If an employee has overtime pay, it's an indication that the employee is not a salaried employee. Hourly Rate Calculation. To convert a full-time salary to an hourly rate, use the standard hours for the job to calculate the hourly wage. For example, to convert an annual salary of $52,000 to an hourly rate for a job that requires 2,080 hours per year, divide 52,000 by 2,080 to arrive at an hourly rate of $25.
Pay for vacation and sick time is considered an employee benefit, not a component of an employee's salary. Do not include vacation or sick time or the value of any other employee benefit when you calculate the hourly rate for a salaried employee. Hourly Rate Calculation. To convert a full-time salary to an hourly rate, use the standard hours for the job to calculate the hourly wage. For example, to convert an annual salary of $52,000 to an hourly rate for a job that requires 2,080 hours per year, divide 52,000 by 2,080 to arrive at an hourly rate of $25.
The bonus is part of your compensation. You may or may not receive that next year, just as you may or may not get a raise next year. I recently had a salary negotiation with a prospective employer. I had a salary last year of $x and received a bonus of $y. 
Base Salary. Base salary is what you see on your paycheck. It is the amount per hour or per year that you are paid for performing your job. Base salary does not include any bonuses, benefits or perks associated with the job. It increases with raises or adjustments, but remains the yearly or hourly wage paid. Base salary is typically the number you say when people ask you how much you make -- what you are paid. It includes base salary, bonuses, benefits, perks and on-site amenities. Total compensation indicates that an employee is making two or three times his base salary. A company may inform you that you are receiving additional compensation, yet rarely discloses the full amount compensated during the entire year
1 For our example, let’s assume you’ve worked two overtime hours per week for the past year, and that your salary is based on a 40-hour work week. 2  Thus, your $577 base salary per week, divided by 40 hours, equates to $14 per hour (with rounding to the nearest dollar for simplicity’s sake). 1 Added to your weekly base salary plus overtime of $619, your weekly total is now $739. 2  This is your weekly gross pay. 3  For the year, $739 x 52 = $38,428. 4  This is your annual
