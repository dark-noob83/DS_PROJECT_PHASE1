Gene mutation. Gene mutation is considered as the small scale change in a nucleotide sequence. The altering of the genetic material on an organism happens in two ways. Point mutations and frame shift mutations are two bases which play a vital role whenever any change happens in a nucleotide sequence.
Gene Mutation vs Chromosome Mutation. Mutations are the changes that occur in the genetic material of organisms, and those take place due to various reasons. Gene mutations and chromosome mutations are the two basic types of mutations, and those vary from each other mainly in the magnitude of the alteration. Gene Mutation. Gene mutation is a small-scale alteration of the genetic material of an organism, which primarily is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a particular gene. These changes are of two types based on the way those take place.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: A gene mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. Mutations range in size from a single DNA building block (DNA base) to a large segment of a chromosome. A chromosomal mutation is a mutation involving a long segment of DNA, it is a any change in the structure or arrangement of the chromosomes. The mutation is called the C677T.People with two copies of the T mutation are two and a half times as likely to have a NTD as people with two copies of the normal gene.
2- Chromosomal mutations are changes in the structure or the numbers of chromosomes (a gain or loss). Gene mutations involve changes in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA molecule. 3-A gene mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. a gene mutation can be acquired throughout life or it is genetic ex sickle cell anemia chromsome mutations have more pronounced effects and are due to a change in the number … of chromosomes or a change in the structural effect that are inherited.. ex downs syndrom. 3 people found this useful.

Mutations range in size from a single DNA building block (DNA base) to a large segment of a chromosome. A chromosomal mutation is a mutation involving a long segment of DNA, it is a any change in the structure or arrangement of the chromosomes. These mutations can involve deletions, insertions, or inversions of sections of DNA. a gene mutation can be acquired throughout life or it is genetic ex sickle cell anemia chromsome mutations have more pronounced effects and are due to a change in the number … of chromosomes or a change in the structural effect that are inherited.. ex downs syndrom. 3 people found this useful.
Overview of Genes and Chromosomes. Before we start to learn what is the difference between gene mutation and chorosomal mutation, it is often easier to know first a few facts about genes and chromosomes and their specific functions. Most cells in the human body contains a nucleus, and in the nucleus are very tiny threadlike units called chromosomes. They are often caused by exposure to radiation, viruses and chemicals. Some mutations may occur in a random manner during cell division. The result of mutations are varied, some may not be apparent, while others may manifest as disease processes. Genetic mutations can either be acquired or inherited.

Gene mutation is basically the change in the nucleotide sequence while chromosome mutation is the change in several genes. These gene mutations are basically small changes in the gene while chromosome mutation is the alteration that happens on a large scale. 1. Gene mutation. Gene mutation is considered as the small scale change in a nucleotide sequence. The altering of the genetic material on an organism happens in two ways. Point mutations and frame shift mutations are two bases which play a vital role whenever any change happens in a nucleotide sequence.
