How big are white pine? White pine are the largest conifer east of the Mississippi and the second largest pine in North America. Mature White Pine are usually about 100 ft tall and 3ft in diameter. Historically white pine of up to 250 ft tall and 10 ft in diameter were found. The largest white pine in Minnesota is in Itasca State Park, it is 14 1/2 ft around and 113 feet tall. People thought that the forests white pines, 200 feet tall and stretching for miles, would last forever. Between 1776 and 1940 2.4 quadrillion board feet of white pine was logged. All of this wood stacked in a city block would stack 400 miles high! By the 1950’s all of the vast forests of white pines had been cut down.

Pine trees reach a range of mature sizes that depends on the species. The dwarf mugo pine (Pinus mugo pumilio) grows to a mature size of 4 feet tall, while slash pines (Pinus elliottii) reach 100 feet. White pines reach up to 150 feet tall, growing only 8 to 12 inches a year, when planted in favorable environments. As a group, pine trees are long-lived conifers. Most varieties live over a century when growing in favorable conditions. Bristlecone pine trees are known to live at least 4,800 year
Growth and Yield-White pine is a long-lived tree commonly reaching 200 years if undisturbed; maximum age may exceed 450 years. It has a remarkable rate of growth compared to other pine and hardwood species within its range (20). Height growth of both planted and natural white pine is slow during the first 2 to 3 years. Afterwards, growth accelerates rapidly, peaking at an average annual rate of 1 m (3 ft) between 10 and 15 years on site index 80 (base 50 years) (6).
California’s storied redwood trees are probably best-known as the tallest trees in the world, towering 350 to 400 feet tall. The conifers are a fast-growing tree, growing 3 to 5 feet per year in the first five years and reaching 90 feet tall by 25 years. The average life span of a redwood tree is more than 600 years. Spruce trees are native to the western United States and Canada. The Colorado blue spruce, also called the silver spruce, was first discovered on Pikes Peak in 1862. Blue spruce can live 800 years. White spruce has a life expectancy of 200 or more years, with some 300-year-old specimens documented in Manitoba, Canada.
California's redwoods are both tall and long-lived, with an average life span of 600 years. Conifers are trees and shrubs such as pine and spruce trees that generally produce seeds in cones instead of berries or flowers. The evergreens especially are prized in landscapes for their year-round color. Spruce trees are native to the western United States and Canada. The Colorado blue spruce, also called the silver spruce, was first discovered on Pikes Peak in 1862. Blue spruce can live 800 years. White spruce has a life expectancy of 200 or more years, with some 300-year-old specimens documented in Manitoba, Canada.
The seeds are 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long, with a slender 15–20 mm (0.59–0.79 in) wing, and are wind-dispersed. Cone production peaks every 3 to 5 years. While eastern white pine is self-fertile, seeds produced this way tend to result in weak, stunted, malformed seedlings. Mature trees can easily be 200 to 250 years old. Pinus strobus grows approximately 1 m (3.3 ft) per year between the ages of 15 and 45 years, with slower height increments before and after that age range. The current tallest eastern white pines reach between 50–57.55 m (164.0–188.8 ft), as determined by the NTS—Native Tree Society.
White Pine -----Pinus strobus The White Pine is a fast growing (2-3 ft per year or more) evergreen that has needles of from 3-6 inches long and are arranged in bundles of five on the stem. In Sep-Oct this pine sheds all of its needles that grew out the previous year.
