Importance of produced water. Because the produced water is not usually a revenue stream, the emphasis on water-flow prediction, technology development, and engineering application has not traditionally been a major focus of oil-and gas-production engineering.
Understanding the physical properties of the formation water that will be produced along with the oil or gas is important to a proper assessment of reserves volumes, producibility, economics, and surface facilities.
Today, much more attention is being paid to issues surrounding the management of oilfield water used in upstream oil and gas operations.
Produced water is chemically very complex. The process of producing and processing produced water causes changes in temperature and pressure. The addition of treating chemicals, along with the presence of coproduced gas, oil, and likely solids, changes the produced-water properties and behavior.
About Produced Water (Produced Water 101). Produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas exploration and production, it is generated in large volumes, and it plays a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production wells.
Produced water is water trapped in underground formations that is brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration and production. In traditional oil and gas wells, produced water is brought to the surface along with oil or gas. In coal bed methane production, wells are drilled into coal seams, and the water located there is pumped to the surface in order to allow gas to release from the coal seams.
