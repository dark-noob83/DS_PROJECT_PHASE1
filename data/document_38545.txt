This formula divides the total cost of all the orders by the total number of units ordered, which results in a weighted price per unit average of 29.38297872. Calculate an average that ignores specific values. You can create a formula that excludes specific values.

1 Average Variable Cost: This is per unit total variable cost, or total variable cost divided by the quantity of output produced. 2  Average variable cost is influenced by short-run marginal returns, decreasing for small quantities, then increasing for larger quantities. Average cost is a general notion of the per unit cost incurred in the production of a good or service. It is specified as the total cost divided by the quantity of output. Average cost plays a key role in the short-run production decision by a firm when evaluated against the price, which is per unit revenue.
1 Average Fixed Cost: This is per unit total fixed cost, or total fixed cost divided by the quantity of output produced. 2  Because fixed cost does not vary with output, average fixed cost declines with larger quantities of production. Average cost is a general notion of the per unit cost incurred in the production of a good or service. It is specified as the total cost divided by the quantity of output. Average cost plays a key role in the short-run production decision by a firm when evaluated against the price, which is per unit revenue.
The Unit Price List includes average unit bid prices for standard and non-standard items included in construction projects. These bid prices are based on recent TCI construction projects and actual bid proposals submitted by contractors. This price list is updated periodically. Unit Price List (PDF). 
(Total fixed costs + Total variable costs) / Total units produced. The cost per unit should decline as the number of units produced increases, primarily because the total fixed costs will be spread over a larger number of units (subject to the step costing issue noted above). Thus, the cost per unit is not constant. For example, ABC Company has total variable costs of $50,000 and total fixed costs of $30,000 in May, which it incurred while producing 10,000 widgets. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $50,000 variable costs) / 10,000 units = $8 cost per unit. In the following month, ABC produces 5,000 units at a variable cost of $25,000 and the same fixed cost of $30,000. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $25,000 variable costs) / 5,000 units = $11/unit.
The actual total cost of all purchased or beginning inventory units in the preceding table is $116,000 ($33,000 + $54,000 + $29,000). The total of all purchased or beginning inventory units is 450 (150 beginning inventory + 300 purchased). The weighted average cost per unit is therefore $257.78 ($116,000 ÷ 450 units.). The ending inventory valuation is $45,112 (175 units × $257.78 weighted average cost), while the cost of goods sold valuation is $70,890 (275 units × $257.78 weighted average cost).
In retail, unit price is the price for a single unit of measure of a product sold in more or less than the single unit. The unit price tells you the cost per pound, quart, or other unit of weight or volume of a food package. It is usually posted on the shelf below the food. The shelf tag shows the total price (item price) and price per unit (unit price) for the food item. Statistical units are also known as equivalent units. Average price per unit and prices per statistical unit are needed by marketers who sell the same product in different packages, sizes, forms, or configurations at a variety of different prices.
When using the weighted average method, divide the cost of goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale, which yields the weighted-average cost per unit. In this calculation, the cost of goods available for sale is the sum of beginning inventory and net purchases. The ending inventory valuation is $45,112 (175 units × $257.78 weighted average cost), while the cost of goods sold valuation is $70,890 (275 units × $257.78 weighted average cost).
