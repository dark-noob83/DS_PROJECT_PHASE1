Phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogen's are compounds similar in their composition to hormones in humans. Phytoestrogens appear in most plants and they have been used as treatments for centuries inadvertently. It was only in the 20th century that they were formally identified and their chemical composition analyzed. Herbal phytoestrogens work by binding to estrogen receptors in the body and in response, their low estrogen levels help to balance the bodies own estrogen levels. If estrogen levels are to high, the phytoestrogen compounds occupy the estrogen receptors in replace of the stronger human version of the hormone.
Chemical structures of the most common phytoestrogens found in plants (top and middle) compared with estrogen (bottom) found in animals. Their name comes from the Greek phyto (plant) and estrogen, the hormone which gives fertility to female mammals. Phytoestrogens cannot be considered nutrients, given that the lack of these in the diet does not produce any characteristic deficiency syndrome nor do they participate in any essential biological function. Analytical methods are available to determine phytoestrogen content in plants and food
A phytoestrogen is a naturally-occurring plant nutrient that exerts an estrogen-like action on the body. Scientists have discovered hundreds of phytoestrogens including soybeans, whole grains, seeds (especially flax), nuts (especially walnuts) and many herbs. Nine common phytoestrogens in a Western diet, foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content were nuts and oilseeds, followed by soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages.
A phytoestrogen is a plant which produces estrogen-like compounds similar to those in the human body. When such compounds enter the body, they act as a substitute for human estrogen and help balance hormone levels. Phytoestrogen compounds were first discovered in plants as early as 1926 but it too some time for scientists to realize the impact phytoestrogenic compounds could have on human or animal metabolism.
Top 10 facts about the world. A phytoestrogen is a plant-based compound that can act like the hormone, estrogen made by the body. It is considered to offer some health benefits such as reducing the severity of symptoms brought on by menopause. Soy foods, flax seeds, and whole grains are among the dietary sources of these plant hormones. Tofu is a natural soy product that contains phytoestrogen. Asparagus includes phytoestrogens. Cherries contain phytoestrogens. Edamame contains isoflavones, a class of phytoestrogenic compounds.
Phytoestrogens are plant-derived xenoestrogens (see estrogen) not generated within the endocrine system but consumed by eating phytoestrogenic plants. Phytoestrogens cannot be considered nutrients, given that the lack of these in the diet does not produce any characteristic deficiency syndrome nor do they participate in any essential biological function.

The human body is incredibly fragile and the smallest fluctuation in chemical or hormone levels can have a dramatic effect on a persons health. Phytoestrogen compounds were first discovered in plants as early as 1926 but it too some time for scientists to realize the impact phytoestrogenic compounds could have on human or animal metabolism.
Phytoestrogens were first observed in 1926, but it was unknown if they could have any effect in human or animal metabolism. In the 1940s and early 1950s, it was noticed that some pastures of subterranean clover and red clover (phytoestrogen-rich plants) had adverse effects on the fecundity of grazing sheep. Phytoestrogens cannot be considered nutrients, given that the lack of these in the diet does not produce any characteristic deficiency syndrome nor do they participate in any essential biological function.
