A $4,000 annual maintenance and repair budget is $333 per month. If you bought a $300,000 home with 20% down and a 30-year fixed-rate loan at 4.75%, your $240,000 mortgage would cost $1,252 a month, according to the Mortgage Loan Calculator. A $333 monthly maintenance and repair budget would equal nearly 27% of your principal and interest payment. Historically, home values have gone up about 4% a year, on average. Because of inflation, your maintenance costs will also continue going up, so they will always equal 1% of the home’s value. As a result, your home really gains just 3% a year. That happens to be the long-term inflation rate.

Average Annual Home Maintenance Costs. A good rule of thumb for new home-buyers trying to figure out the annual expense of maintaining a home is to allocate 1-1/2 to 4 percent of the purchase price for regular annual maintenance, depending on the age and size of the house.
If you own a 2,000 square foot home, for example, budget $2,000 a year for maintenance and repairs (again, over a long-term annualized average). This rule of thumb makes slightly more sense than the “1 percent of purchase price” rule. The more square feet you’re managing, the more you’ll need to spend. The 1 Percent Rule. One popular rule of thumb says that one percent of the purchase price of your home should be set aside each year for ongoing maintenance. For example, if your home cost $300,000, you should budget $3,000 per year for maintenance. That doesn’t mean you’ll literally spend $3,000 every year

Skimping on these costs may lead to depreciation of the home's value. 
Just for fun, I took all the items, calculated an individual annual cost and summed that up to get an idea of my average annual maintenance costs. It came out to $3,186 per year. Throw in a few bucks to cover smaller maintenance costs not listed and my annual house maintenance costs are $3,500 per year. 
Let’s look at it another way. Assume your home is an investment that will grow in value over time. Historically, home values have gone up about 4% a year, on average. Because of inflation, your maintenance costs will also continue going up, so they will always equal 1% of the home’s value. As a result, your home really gains just 3% a year. That happens to be the long-term inflation rate. If you bought a $300,000 home with 20% down and a 30-year fixed-rate loan at 4.75%, your $240,000 mortgage would cost $1,252 a month, according to the Mortgage Loan Calculator.
