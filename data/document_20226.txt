1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature
A rectal temperature is usually 0.9° F (0.5° C) higher than an oral temperature, and axillary and tympanic temperatures are usually 0.9° F (0.5° C) lower than an oral temperature. Agency policy usually specifies whether to document a temperature reading in degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius. The Celsius strip has 50 dots with each representing temperature increments of 0.1° C over a range of 35.5° C to 40.4° C. The Fahrenheit strip has 45 dots with increments of 0.2° F and a range of 96.0° F to 104.8° F. The chemical dots usually change color within 60 seconds.

Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day.
