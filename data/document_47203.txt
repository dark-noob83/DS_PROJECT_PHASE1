Home Heating System. If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, plan on spending several thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to build the system. A large chunk of your household budget goes to heating and cooling your home. That cost only goes up when your home heating system doesn't work right or it breaks down. The cost to replace your home heating system won't be cheap either, but some contractors offer payment plans if you need help.
Our hydro heat system was probably fine for a while more but the 19 year old original installation air conditioner (old type coolant) had developed a leak in part that is inside the air handler. Because the hydro was also 19 years old and had sprung a leak before, we decided to replace both. 1 It might be possible to get a low-cost loan, rebate or tax credit for installing an energy-efficient central heating system. 2  The database of State Incentives for Renewables & Energy Efficiency tracks energy-efficiency incentives from utilities and from state, federal and local government agencies.
1 A new furnace in a central heating system costs $2,500 to $7,500 or more. 2  If you don’t need ductwork, the cost of a new heating and cooling system can be significantly decreased. 3  In cases where new HVAC duct is required, however, you might pay $1,000 to $3,000. HVAC—short for Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning—refers to equipment that is used to regulate the temperature, humidity and air quality of a residential or commercial building. In this guide you’ll learn more about the components of a home HVAC system in addition to how much it costs to install one.
The cost to install a window air conditioner averages between $150 and $300, depending on the size you need. Installing a window air conditioning unit can bring added comfort for a reasonable price, but it will be less powerful than a central air conditioning system. Most homeowners report spending between $3,675 and $7,155 to have air conditioning installed. This price is more typical of a central A/C unit installation rather than a window air conditioner addition which typically averages about $300. Your total cost for the job will depend on the type of system you choose
1 For a 1,000 square foot home, the cost of an HVAC system is $6,000 to $12,000, including a new furnace, air conditioning unit, and ductwork. 2  For larger homes and more complex setups, however, the price could be significantly higher.

1 For central air-conditioning, you’ll pay $3,000 to $5,000 and up for a 2,000 square foot home. 2  A new furnace in a central heating system costs $2,500 to $7,500 or more.

Central Air Average Costs. The actual cost of central air installation depends on a number of factors, including the size of the home as well as the unit’s tonnage and SEER rating. 1  In a 2,000 square foot home with existing ductwork, central air conditioning costs $3,000 to $5,000 installed. 1 In a 2,000 square foot home with existing ductwork, central air conditioning costs $3,000 to $5,000 installed. 2  If ductwork is additionally required, costs could reach $6,000 to $10,000 or more. 3  Mini-split central air conditioner prices average $1,500 to $3
Additional costs: 1  It typically takes a day or two to replace the heat source in an existing central heating system, and a week or more to install a new central heating system, depending on the size and layout of the house and the complexity of the system. 1 It might be possible to get a low-cost loan, rebate or tax credit for installing an energy-efficient central heating system. 2  The database of State Incentives for Renewables & Energy Efficiency tracks energy-efficiency incentives from utilities and from state, federal and local government agencies.
