Average ACT: 34. The average ACT score composite at Harvard is a 34. The 25th percentile ACT score is 32, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 35. In other words, a 32 places you below average, while a 35 will move you up to above average. There's no absolute ACT requirement at Harvard, but they really want to see at least a 32 to have a chance at being considered. To be safe, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 35 ACT and a 4.04 GPA or higher to be above average. This is only part of the challenge-after this, you'll need to impress them beyond your academic scores, with your accomplishments and extracurriculars.
The scores from each section can range from 200 to 800, so the best possible total score is 2400. The average score for each section is roughly 500, so the average total score is about 1500. For the 1.66 million test-takers in 2013, the mean scores were 496 critical reading, 514 math, and 488 writing.
Well, it all depends on the colleges you are considering. A 23 on the ACT or a 1800 on the SAT may be above average at one university but below average at another. The higher your score, the more options are open to you. Above average SAT/ACT scores will improve your chances of getting into a more selective school. Scores below an 1100 on the SAT or a 15 on ACT are considered low at just about any four-year college. You can overcome low scores with good grades or an outstanding application

In 2011, ASMSA students received an average composite score of 28.6. The average composite score for the state was 19.9
Those four scores are then averaged to generate the composite score used by most colleges. The average composite score is roughly a 21. That is, about 50% of test-takers score below a 21. For students who took the ACT with writing, the writing section is scored on a 12-point scale. The average score is between 7 and 8. Very few students get a perfect ACT score, even those who get into the country's top colleges. In fact, anyone scoring a 34, 35 or 36 is among the top 1% of test-takers in the country. The table above shows the middle 50% range of ACT scores for different school
