At birth, a Labrador puppy from average parents and an average litter (6 puppies) weighs about 1 pound or less. During the first 8 weeks of its life the puppy gains about 2 pounds a week. An 8 week old Labrador puppy weighs between 11 and 17 pounds. From 8 weeks to 26 weeks (6 months) this growth proceeds in about the same way-an average six month old Labrador weighs between 50 and 60 pounds. Dogs are heavier than bitches. Judging your Lab's weight this way ensures that it is right for him and not just right for the average member of the breed. It is almost always possible to adjust the feeding schedule to ensure proper weight in a puppy fed primarily dog food.

The average female black Lab grows to a height of between 21 and 24 inches from the floor at the withers, or shoulders, although even a purebred dog can be bigger or smaller. Males reach a height of 22 to 25 inches.

RE: How much should the average female labrador weigh? Our male lab weighs about 110-115 but he is lean and muscular...our female on the other hand weighs about 90lbs but she is fat. She doesn&#39;t overeat, vet thinks it may be a thyroid problem since we know it isn&#39;t the food. 
Average Weight. Healthy adult male labs typically weigh between 65 to 80 pounds. Average adult female labs weigh between 55 to 70 pounds. In order to maintain their weight, labs require at least 40 minutes of exercise each day. The Lab is prone to obesity. If you can't feel your dog's ribs through his coat easily, he's fat.

Just like humans, there can be slight genetic differences in a dog’s overall structure that can result in a weight that is above or below the average. An average full-grown male Labrador Retriever weighs anywhere between 65 and 80 lbs. Males are characteristically larger than females, though are just as prone to becoming overweight.
