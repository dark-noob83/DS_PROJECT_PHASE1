The Winds are a popular recreation destination, much of which is described in Joe Kelsey's Climbing and Hiking in the Wind River Mountains, a guidebook for the range that many consider definitive. The range’s vast wilderness areas attract many hikers, climbers and skiers. The range runs roughly NW-SE for approximately 100 miles (161 km). The Continental Divide follows the crest of the range and includes Gannett Peak, which at 13,804 feet (4,207 m), is the highest peak in Wyoming. There are more than 40 other named peaks in excess of 13,000 feet (3,962 m)
Shoshone National Forest is a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a nearly unbroken expanse of federally protected lands encompassing an estimated 20,000,000 acres (8,100,000 ha). The Absaroka and Beartooth Mountains are partly in the northern section of the forest. The Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River is federally-designated as a Wild and Scenic River for 22 mi (35 km) through the forest, with cliffs towering up to 2,000 ft (610 m) as the river winds through a gorge.
The greater Yellowstone area is home to at least. 600 grizzlies — and some say more than 1,000. DeBolt said a bear moving into the southern Wind Rivers indicates a healthy and thriving grizzly population. Food and habitat sources abound in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, but as bear numbers grow, more will move into other areas looking for home ranges of their own.
The Winds also hold the southernmost real glaciers in the U.S., and many of them dwarf those of the Beartooths and Glacier National Park farther north. And now that grizzlies have definitely returned to the Wind River Range, these mountains truly deserve their inclusion in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. 
The Wind River Range is in the southern portion and contains Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River is federally-designated as a Wild and Scenic River for 22 mi (35 km) through the forest, with cliffs towering up to 2,000 ft (610 m) as the river winds through a gorge.
The Wind River Range (or Winds for short), is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in western Wyoming in the United States. The range runs roughly NW-SE for approximately 100 miles (161 km). The Continental Divide follows the crest of the range and includes Gannett Peak, which at 13,804 feet (4,207 m), is the highest peak in Wyoming. There are more than 40 other named peaks in excess of 13,000 feet (3,962 m)
The Wind River Range is a major barrier between western and central Wyoming and it separates the Wind River Basin to the northeast from the Greater Green River Basin to the south and southwest. 
There are over 500 lakes in the forest, and 1,000 mi (1,600 km) of streams and rivers. The Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River is federally-designated as a Wild and Scenic River for 22 mi (35 km) through the forest, with cliffs towering up to 2,000 ft (610 m) as the river winds through a gorge.
The deep curve of the Wind River Valley is shaped by the snowcapped Wind River Range to the West and the Absaroka and Owl Creek ranges on the east, forming a cottonwood-lined bottom that many consider one of the most beautiful areas in Wyoming. The Wind River Indian Reservation hosts a couple of casinos and some great, permit only, trout water. The largest towns of the Wind River Valley are Riverton is a thriving community of 10,000 people located in the heart of Wyoming’s Wind River Country.
