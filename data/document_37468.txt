Everyone talks about sushi being healthy, but no one ever talks about actually knowing how many calories are actually in their favorite Japanese food.
The ever-increasing popularity of Japanese food makes life easier for those watching their weight. With sushi bars popping up all over the place, a low-fat, low-calorie lunch, dinner or snack is never too far away. On average, a sushi lunch pack has 360 calories and 6 grams of fat, though watch for sushi rolls that use mayonnaise. Japanese foods that are quite high in fat and calories include fried noodles, tempura dishes, and pot stickers (vegetable dumplings). Your best non-sushi or sashimi choices include miso soup or udon noodle soup, shabu shabu (meat and vegetables dipped in a hot broth to cook), edamame beans and cucumber salad.
The food eaten by Japanese is good in taste as well as healthy too. They generally eat boiled or steamed food and this is the main reason of their long life span. Now many food delivery services in japan apply this technique in their services also.
The secret is to replace energy-dense foods (those containing a higher number of calories per gram), like chocolate, potato chips, and cookies, with those that are less energy-dense, like fruits, vegetables, and broth-based soups (all, not coincidentally, a daily part of the Japanese diet).
by Bonnie Pfiester. Everyone talks about sushi being healthy, but no one ever talks about actually knowing how many calories are actually in their favorite Japanese food. After doing some extensive googling, I was disappointed to find very few Asian restaurants offered nutritional information.
In addition to eating healthfully, the Japanese also have different attitudes toward food than many Americans. In Okinawa, for instance, residents practice hara hachi bu or eight parts of 10: They stop eating when they are 80 percent full.
