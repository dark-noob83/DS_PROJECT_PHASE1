Rather, it is the softest sound that a person with normal hearing ability would be able to detect at least 50% of the time. (Some audiograms, in fact, begin at -10 dB HL or lower.). Audiologists consider 0 -15 dB HL to be normal hearing in children (0 - 25 dB HL in adults). The most important frequencies for speech fall into the 250-6000 Hz range. The vowel sounds of speech are typically low frequency sounds that make up the loudness of speech. The consonant sounds like f, s, and th are high frequency sounds.
Users have ears enhanced to hear with amazing clarity, distance, and even frequencies outside normal range. Users ears can pick up every single sound, can decipher layer upon layer of differing sounds/conversations, locate the source of noise or pick up a sound from a mile away in a busy city. 
The commonly stated range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Under ideal laboratory conditions, humans can hear sound as low as 12 Hz. Humans are most sensitive to (i.e. able to discern at lowest intensity) frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 Hz. Their hearing range varies by species; at the lowest it can be 1 kHz for some species and for other species the highest reaches up to 200 kHz. Bats that can detect 200 kHz cannot hear very well below 10 kHz. In any case, the most sensitive range of bat hearing is narrower: about 15 kHz to 90 k
· just now. Report Abuse. Jordan is right give him the points. The typical range of human hearing for a child is approximately 20 Hz to 20 KHz, but very few of us over 18 years of age can hear 20 kHz, I do a lot of noise induced hearing loss training and run experiments with guys in the class. Most are lucky to still be playing above about 14 kHz and several below that. But they are older and have been exposed to a working life in a noisy environment. So yeah, it is widely accepted that the range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
The normal range of hearing for a healthy young person is 20 to 20,000 Hz; hearing deteriorates with age and with exposure to unsafe volume levels.. 20–20,000 Hz. Sense. Wikipedia. 2004. Humans cannot hear sounds of every frequency. The range of hearing for a healthy young person is 20 to 20,000 hertz. The hearing range of humans gets worse with age. People lose the ability to hear sounds of high frequency as they get older.
The human range is commonly given as 20 to 20,000 Hz, though there is considerable variation between individuals, especially at high frequencies, and a gradual loss of sensitivity to higher frequencies with age is considered normal. Sensitivity also varies with frequency, as shown by equal-loudness contours. Their hearing range varies by species; at the lowest it can be 1 kHz for some species and for other species the highest reaches up to 200 kHz. Bats that can detect 200 kHz cannot hear very well below 10 kHz. In any case, the most sensitive range of bat hearing is narrower: about 15 kHz to 90 kHz
40 dB sounds twice as loud as 30 dB and 8 times as loud as 10 dB (10 to 20 to 30 to 40 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8). Normal hearing ranges from 0 to 20 dB in all frequencies. From here on, the assumption is that you have a sensorineural hearing loss (that you have nerve damage to the inner ear). Nerve damage, unless sudden, is permanent. For conductive hearing losses, see your otolaryngologist (your ENT physician). If all of the X's (for the left ear) and all of the 0's (for the right ear) fall above the line you just drew, you have normal hearing. If anything is below that 20 dB line, you have a hearing loss. Your hearing loss is classified according to how far down the graph the marks go, and in what freqencies the loss occurs.
Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). A person who has hearing within the normal range can hear sounds that have frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz. The most important sounds we hear every day are in the 250 to 6,000 Hz range. Speech includes a mix of low and high frequency sounds: Sound intensity, or loudness, is measured in decibels (dB). 1  A person with hearing within the normal range can hear sounds ranging from 0 to 140 dB. 2  A whisper is around 25 to 30 dB.
