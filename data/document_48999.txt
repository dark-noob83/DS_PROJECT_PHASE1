Your nose and throat get inflamed and make a lot of mucus. With so much of your energy directed at fighting the cold virus, you're left feeling tired and miserable. One myth that needs to get busted: Getting chilly or wet doesn't cause you to get sick. But there are things that make you prone to come down with a cold.
1. Drink plenty of warm fluids. Drinking warm fluids helps to loosen the secretions in your sinuses so that your mucus flows more freely, making you feel better faster. Studies show that drinking warm fluids relieves cold symptoms such as runny nose, cough, sneezing, sore throat, and fatigue.
You can catch it from another person who is infected with the virus. This usually happens if you touch a surface that has germs on it -- a computer keyboard, doorknob, or spoon, for example -- and then touch your nose or mouth. You can also catch it if you're near someone who is sick and sneezes into the air. A cold begins when a virus attaches to the lining of your nose or throat. Your immune system -- the body's defense against germs -- sends out white blood cells to attack this invader.
The herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores can't be cured. After you get infected, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life. If you get cold sores often, treatment can reduce the number of cold sores you get and how severe they are.
It takes about two days to get a cold after exposure to the virus. In this video, Larry Gooss, DO, a family practice doctor at Chippenham & Johnston-Willis Hospitals, explains how virus can continue to live on surfaces.
Common colds, or simply colds, are usually quite harmless and go away again on their own. Although they are different to the flu, having the symptoms of a cold-like a cough, sore throat and runny nose-can be bothersome. A severe cold can make you feel weak and ill too. Most colds are caused by viruses. Antibiotics are not effective against colds because they only fight bacteria.
