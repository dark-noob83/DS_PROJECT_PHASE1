Uses of This Medicine. Clonidine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood passes through them more easily, which lowers blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen going to the heart is increased. This medicine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it.
The tablet and skin patch forms of clonidine are approved for the treatment of high blood pressure, while the epidural form is licensed to be used in combination with opiates to treat severe cancer pain. Clonidine can be given by an epidural for treating severe cancer pain. It should be used together with opiate medications (such as morphine) and only in people who do not respond adequately to opiates alone. In general, clonidine is more effective for nerve pain, compared to other types of pain.
