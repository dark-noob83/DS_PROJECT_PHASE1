Briefly, operational definitions define and thereby specify terms and phrases by presenting descriptions of the observations and/or measurements of the people, objects and events related to, and therefore relevant to, the term/phrase being defined operationally.
The operational definition of an empirical term (i.e., a descriptor of some element of physical experience) is the description of a specific process, or set of validation tests, accessible to more persons than the definer (i.e., said to be publicly accessible), whereby it is (or can be) repeatedly measured or tested.
Operational Definitions. An operational definition is a detailed specification of how one would go about measuring a given variable. Operational definitions can range from very simple and straightforward to quite complex, depending on the nature of the variable and the needs of the researcher. Operational definitions should be tied to the theoretical constructs under study. The theory behind the research often clarifies the nature of the variables involved and, therefore, would guide the development of operational definitions that would tap the critical variables.
An operational definition is a process by which the characteristics of a concept can be defined, including identification and classification. It consists of the methods or tests that are used in analyzing a given variable or concept, which can be used to confirm the validity of the information obtained.
An operational definition is a demonstration of a process-such as a variable, term, or object-relative in terms of the specific process or set of validation tests used to determine its presence and quantity.
Operational Definitions. An operational definition is a definition that defines the exact manner in which a variable is measured. Giving the steps used in defining each variable allows others to evaluate and potentially replicate a research study.
