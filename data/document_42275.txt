Each former president receives the same salary as a current member of the Presidential Cabinet. For 2013, the amount was $199,700 per year. This number does not take into account the extras the former leader is entitled to including a $96,000 stipend for office staff payroll and free postage for life.
The Presidential pension is not a fixed amount, rather it matches the current salary of Cabinet members (or Executive Level I personnel), which is $191,300/year as of March, 2008 (but see Salary Info section above for advice on how to track increases in this figure).
