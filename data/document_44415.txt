Angola went through a period of hyperinflation between 1991 and 1999. Before 1991, the highest denomination was 1,000 Kwanzas. But before the year was over, the highest denomination already reached 5,000,000 Kwanzas Reajustados. In the 1999 currency reform, 1 new Kwanza was exchanged for 1,000,000 Kwanzas Reajustados. The overall impact of inflation: 1 current Kwanza = 1,000,000,000 pre 1995 Kwanzas.

Unlike low inflation, where the process of rising prices is protracted and not generally noticeable except by studying past market prices, hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in nominal prices and in the supply of money, and the nominal cost of goods. Theories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between seigniorage and the inflation tax. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position.
Unfortunately, there is no exact percentage where inflation turns from “ordinary Inflation” to “Hyperinflation”. So you can’t say for instance that 9.9% inflation is ordinary but 10% inflation is hyperinflation. Typically in hyperinflation it just gets progressively worse. 1 Iraq 1987-1995 Total hyperinflation of 10,000 to 1. 2  Nicaragua 1988-1991 Total hyperinflation of 50,000,000,000 to 1. 3  Argentina 1975-1993 By the end the hyperinflation currency exchanged at 100 Billion to one. 4  Peru 1986-1991 Total hyperinflation of 1

Hyperinflation is not as uncommon as you think-. The most notorious recent case was in Zimbabwe and ran from 1998 – 2008. But North Korea experienced a less severe hyperinflation in 2010 -2011. Other recent examples include Belarus 1994-2002, Bosnia and Herzegovina 1992-1993 and Angola 1991-1999. Gold the First Line of Defense. The first line of defense against hyperinflation that everyone thinks of is precious metals especially Gold. The key problem is finding someone who has enough goods to sell you. Recently an ounce of gold has ranged in price from $1200 to almost $2000.
Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes with new numbers. Historically, there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to hard money. Theories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between seigniorage and the inflation tax. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position.
Not to be confused with Deflation. Disinflation is a decrease in the rate of inflation – a slowdown in the rate of increase of the general price level of goods and services in a nation's gross domestic product over time. It is the opposite of reflation. Disinflation occurs when the increase in the “consumer price level” slows down from the previous period when the prices were rising. If the inflation rate is not very high to start with, disinflation can lead to deflation – decreases in the general price level of goods and services.
Since hyperinflation is visible as a monetary effect, models of hyperinflation center on the demand for money. Economists see both a rapid increase in the money supply and an increase in the velocity of money if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. Theories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between seigniorage and the inflation tax. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position.
