Tundras are among Earth's coldest, harshest biomes. Tundra ecosystems are treeless regions found in the Arctic and on the tops of mountains, where the climate is cold and windy and rainfall is scant. Tundra lands are snow-covered for much of the year, until summer brings a burst of wildflowers.
Toyota Tundra Cold Air Intakes enhance engine performance to give you more power. Factory air intakes can suck warmer, dirtier air into your engine. With your Toyota Tundra Cold Air Intake, you upgrade your tubing and air filter. Mandrel-bent tubing and a high-quality air filter breathe cooler, cleaner air into your engine. Cool, clean air results in better combustion, meaning more horsepower and torque.
Arctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year. The soil there is frozen from 25–90 cm (10–35 in) down, and it is impossible for trees to grow.
K&N cold air intakes for the Toyota Tundra or any other vehicle can be found using K&N's Search by Vehicle tool. By providing a year, make, model and engine size, you will find all K&N performance upgrades available for that vehicle.
The tundra biome. Tundra is the coldest of all the biomes. Tundra comes from the Finnish word tunturi, meaning treeless plain. It is noted for its frost-molded landscapes, extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and short growing seasons. Dead organic material functions as a nutrient pool.
There are three types of tundra: arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions.
