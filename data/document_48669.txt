If you want to try Audible, they offer a 30 day free trial membership. After that, you pay $14.95 per month. If you cancel before the end of the 30 day trial, you won’t be charged anything. You can also find specials, like great teen reads for $3.99. Or good deals on popular books. For example, September 2013 releases from Stephen King and Nicolas Sparks only cost $10 right now. But I’m interested in the Artemis Fowl series.
Your eBook's new companion. Whispersync for Voice allows you to enjoy one book in two formats-Kindle eBook and Audible audiobook. Switch seamlessly between them, picking up on one where you left off in the other. It’s now available for thousands of titles. 
The books are a much, much better deal. Audiobooks are expensive and have a serious reason to be; there, someone actually needs to sit in a studio and actually get themselves recorded. That's where the Audible subscriptions come in-about $10 a piece is a far cry from the $50 or so I normally see them for. There's some throwing around of 30% and 80% discounts, but that's just what you already see -- the ~$15 or ~$22 of your subscription, managed correctly, can get you about five times as much in list price value; and the things you buy from the catalogue are going to be about 30% off.
Price, Convenience, Selection. Older books on iTunes don’t cost too much-about $10 per book. You can also find specials, like great teen reads for $3.99. Or good deals on popular books. For example, September 2013 releases from Stephen King and Nicolas Sparks only cost $10 right now. But I’m interested in the Artemis Fowl series.
1. Audible. If you like audiobooks, it's hard to go wrong with an Audible subscription. It starts with a free book as part of a 14-day trial. After that, you can sign up for a Listener Gold plan at $14.95 per month (or $149.95 annually, which is like getting two months for free). That gets you one credit per month, which is good for one audiobook--and big discounts on others
Audio Book Club Service, $14.95/$21.95 per month, automatic renewal. Audible.com is selling the right to listen to audio. They're not radio; they're more like a book club for spoken word. For your trouble of signing up, the first month of subscription is free. There's some throwing around of 30% and 80% discounts, but that's just what you already see -- the ~$15 or ~$22 of your subscription, managed correctly, can get you about five times as much in list price value; and the things you buy from the catalogue are going to be about 30% off.
Through its production arm, Audible Studios, Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. On January 31, 2008 Amazon.com announced it would buy Audible for about 300 million USD. The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon. The company is based in Newark, New Jersey 's 1 Washington Park high rise office building. 
Audible is widely regarded as the best audiobook service out there, and $14.95 per month for a one-book subscription is not a bad deal. But here's an even better one. For a limited time, you can get three months of Audible Gold for $1.95 per month when you apply coupon code TZ2014. That's a grand total of $5.85 for a subscription that would normally cost you nearly $45. And if you decide not to continue, you'll walk away with three audiobooks. Get a 3-month Audible Gold membership for $5.85. That's $39 less than what you'd usually pay, and the offer is good even for former subscribers.
The price of a subscription varies depending on what you get per month. $14.95 for one book and one month's subscription to e.g. an NPR program; $21.95 for two books. That's it. There's some throwing around of 30% and 80% discounts, but that's just what you already see -- the ~$15 or ~$22 of your subscription, managed correctly, can get you about five times as much in list price value; and the things you buy from the catalogue are going to be about 30% off.
