It has been recently found that wind speeds on Uranus range from 90 to 360 mph and the planet's average temperature is a frigid -353 degrees F. The coldest temperature found in Uranus' lower atmosphere so far is -371 degrees F., which rivals Neptune's frigid temperatures.
The effective temperature of Uranus is -216°C or -357°F. At 1 bar of pressure in the planet the temperature is -197°C or -322.6°F and at .1 bar of pressure in the planet the temperature is -220°C or -364°F. Although Uranus is not the furthest planet from the Sun it is definitely the coldest planet in our solar system.

Although not the hottest planet in our solar system, Mercury has the the most extreme temperature ranges. Temperatures can range from 90K to 700 K. Venus is slightly higher th … an 700K but has a more stable temperature.
The seventh planet from the sun, Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any of the planets in the solar system, even though it is not the most distant. Despite the fact that its equator faces away from the sun, the temperature distribution on Uranus is much like other planets, with a warmer equator and cooler poles.
