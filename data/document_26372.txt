Ohio State University Extension economist Barry Ward says, on average, Ohio cash rental rates in 2006-2007 have ranged between $.69 and $.74 per bushel of corn raised per acre and from $2.24 to $2.27 per bushel of soybeans per acre. But, $200- to $300-per-acre cash rent price levels are likely justified when taking corn and soybean per-acre income into account, economists say.
Agriculture.com Staff 10/13/2015 @ 9:51am. In many parts of the Midwest, farmland cash rents are moving to price levels beyond what many farmers might consider reasonable. But, $200- to $300-per-acre cash rent price levels are likely justified when taking corn and soybean per-acre income into account, economists say. Farmers struck up a conversation about cash rental rates in a recent Agriculture Online Farm Business discussion group
•180 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $259 per acre. •200 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $313 per acre. Rapid increase. The second factor is how fast cash rents on a farm have gone up in recent years. Between 2006 through 2013, average cash rents increased in Illinois by an average of 7.7% per year.
Pastureland, at $520 per acre, increased $45 from a year ago. Cash rent paid to landlords in 2011 for cropland increased from last year and is also a record high. Irrigated cropland rent averaged $190 per acre, an increase of $20. Across the state, dryland rent averaged $115 per acre, up $12 from a year earlier. Pasture rented for cash, which averaged $16.50 per acre, is up $0.50 from the previous year.
Mike Walsten, editor of LandOwner, said these prices, when compared to USDA’s August 2011 cash rent numbers, seem to reflect the recent rise in farmland prices of about 30%. On track. For example, USDA’s 2011 average cash rent price for Illinois was $183 per acre. The average price reported to Farm Journal Pulse was $256, about a 40% increase. Similar increases were seen in Indiana and Iowa cash rents. Nearly 1,200 farmers and ranchers across the country reported the highest cash rent they pay; results were then averaged by state. The states with the highest average cash rent per acre are: Idaho at $428; Washington at $346; Iowa at $289; Illinois at $256; and Minnesota at $233.
A cash rental rate can be based on a farm’s average yields (e.g., 5-year or 10-year average). For example, assume the average rental rates in your county are $1.25 per bushel for corn and $4.40 per bushel for soybeans, based on the latest survey information. If your farm has an average corn yield of 160 bu. per acre this results in a rental rate of $200 ($1.25 x 160 bu. 
Non-irrigated cropland rents ranged from an average of $14.00 per acre in St. Louis County, to $276.00 per acre in Nicollet County. Six counties had average rents greater $270.00 per acre and 10 counties had average rents less than $40.00 per acre. Cash rent paid for pasture in Minnesota averaged $26.00 per acre in 2014, down $2.00 from 2013. Average cash rents ranged from $8.60 per acre in Carlton County to $61.50 per acre in Brown County. 
140 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $151 per acre, 160 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $205 per acre, 180 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $259 per acre, and. 200 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $313 per acre. The second factor is how fast cash rents on a farm have gone up in recent years. Between 2006 through 2013, average cash rents increased in Illinois by an average of 7.7% per year. 
Applying the historical relationship of average cash rental rates ranging from 30 to 40 percent of crop revenues implies an average cash rental rate of $228 per acre in Illinois, just slightly above the current average of $223 per acre reported for 2013. Two additional scenarios are also outlined in Table 1.
