October 01, 2015 How I Earned 17,390 IHG Rewards Points for a $239 Stay TPG Special Contributor Eric Rosen spent a night at the Hotel Indigo in New York City earlier this month, earning 17,390 points from a single stay. Here’s how he did it. For IHG Rewards’ Fall Accelerate Promo, I was offered bonuses up to a potential total of 58,000 points. The first two of those were:….
I just posted this and checked my email and saw an offer to buy IHG Rewards Points with a 100% bonus. It looks targeted to Ambassador members. You can get 60,000 points for $345. That’s $28.75 per 5,000. See the post on Best Use of IHG Rewards Points to hear more about PointBreaks and how you can redeem free nights for 5,000 points at nice hotels. So the best way of buying points, for the flexible at least, is the legitimate way – sales. Earlier this year, IHG Rewards had a 100% bonus on buying points, which was not bad.

The $70 per 10 000 points trick. IHG lets you buy 10 000 points for $70 USD if you are just short of points for a reward night.

Given how ridiculously easy it is to earn that number, it can make staying at an Intercontinental hotel (normally 50 000 points per night) a very cheap affair. If you use the $70 per 10 000 points trick above, you effectively get a room for $35.
