energy is stored in the covalent bonds between phosphates with the greatest amount of energy approximately 7 kcal mole in the bond between the second and third phosphate groups this covalent bond is known as a pyrophosphate bond we can write the chemical reaction for the formation of atp as two processes convert adp into atp 1 substrate level phosphorylation and 2 chemiosmosis substrate level phosphorylation occurs in the cytoplasm when an enzyme attaches a third phosphate to the adp both adp and the phosphates are the substrates on which the enzyme acts
adenosine triphosphate adenosine triphosphate atp is considered by biologists to be the energy currency of life it is the high energy molecule that stores the energy we need to do just about everything we do free energy from hydrolysis of atp adenosine triphosphate atp is the energy currency of life and it provides that energy for most biological processes by being converted to adp adenosine diphosphate since the basic reaction involves a water molecule this reaction is commonly referred to as the hydrolysis of atp
definition adenosine triphosphate or atp for short is the energy currency of life atp is a high energy molecule found in every cell its job is to store and supply the cell with needed energy
atp adenosine 5 triphosphate a nucleotide that is the most important molecule for capturing and trans ferring free energy in cells hydrolysis of each of the two high energy phosphoanhydride bonds in atp is accompanied by a large free energy change Î´g of 7 kcal mole atp synthase a molecular motor atp synthase dalton s embedded in the inner membrane of mitochondria its function is to convert the energy of protons h+ moving down their concentration gradient into the synthesis of atp
adenosine triphosphate atp the energy currency or coin of the cell pictured in figfures 1 and 2 transfers energy from chemical bonds to endergonic energy absorbing reactions within the cell two processes convert adp into atp 1 substrate level phosphorylation and 2 chemiosmosis substrate level phosphorylation occurs in the cytoplasm when an enzyme attaches a third phosphate to the adp both adp and the phosphates are the substrates on which the enzyme acts
adenosine triphosphate adenosine 5 triphosphate atp is a multifunctional nucleotide and plays an important role in cell biology as a coenzyme that is the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer in this role atp adenosine triphosphate atp is the energy currency of life and it provides that adenosine triphosphate atp molecule found in all living organisms that is the main immediate source of usable energy for the activities of the
best answer atp means adenosine triphosphate it is literally made up of the nitrogenous base adenine and 3 phosphates the bonds holding phosphate together are high in energy they are often described as a spring that is compressed just waiting to be released atp adenosine tri phosphate is an adenosine that is attached to 3 phosphate groups atp is a form of energy that we need in order for our cells body to do our job atp is mostly made in mitochondria for more info check out http en wikipedia org wiki
atp is adenosine triphosphate it is a nitrogenous base called adenine with three phophate po3 groups attached to it it is basically the source of energy in the cell this energy is stored in the bonds between the phosphate groups with most of the energy in the bond between the second and third phosphate groups atp is made in the mitochondria of cells silfly 7 years ago thumbs up atp adenosine tri phosphate is an adenosine that is attached to 3 phosphate groups atp is a form of energy that we need in order for our cells body to do our job atp is mostly made in mitochondria for more info check out http en wikipedia org wiki
