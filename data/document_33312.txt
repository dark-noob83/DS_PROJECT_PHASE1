‘Citation’, ‘Hicksii’, ‘Stoveken’ and ‘Viridis’ are excellent choices for upright column-like specimens of the Taxus yew plant. ‘Capitata’ is an upright pyramidal form, which can attain a 20 feet to 40 feet height by 5 feet to 10 feet width.
Continued from page 1. On Page 1 I mentioned yews as evergreen shrubs that grow in shade. These plants can be trees or shrubs. They are shade-loving plants with a long history behind them. The hybrid cultivars of the Taxus x media group are crosses between Japanese yews and English yews.
Taunton yews grow about 3'-4' x 3'-4'. The plants require a soil with good drainage. The short, flat needles of yews are dark green on top and light green on their underside. New foliage in spring is bright green and soft. Taunton yews are hardy to Zone 4.
Taxus x media is notable for its dark green, one inch long evergreen needles. Although an evergreen, the yew’s foliage may winter burn or turn brown in its northern range (USDA plant hardiness zone 4) and melt out in its southern range (USDA zone 8).
Taxus (Tax'us) are beautiful evergreen trees and shrubs that are natives of North America, Europe and Asia. They belong to the Yew family, Taxaceae. The name is an old Latin one for Taxus baccata, the European Yew.
Taunton Yew Taxus x media 'Tauntonii' The best variety for our climate, Taunton yews are resistant to winter burn. Tauntons will grow about 3-4 feet wide and 3-4 feet tall. Left unpruned, they have a loose, flat-topped shape. Young shoots have olive green twigs. Taunton yews are hardy to Zone 4.
Yew is a great shrub for borders, entranceways, paths, specimen gardening, or mass plantings. In addition, Taxus yew shrubs tend to be drought resistant and tolerant of repeated shearing and pruning, making yew shrub care a relatively easy endeavor.
