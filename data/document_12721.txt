We shall derive the formulae for the area and perimeter of an equilateral triangle. Perimeter: Perimeter of an equilateral triangle whose side is 'a' units = (a+a+a) units = 3a units. Area: Area of an equilateral triangle whose side is 'a' units. = a2.

1 The area, perimeter and other data (side, height or angle), if the outside. 2  equilateral triangle would not need the third data. 3  2 angles and other data (if the value of the other data is not put aside. 4  the value of a at the time of drawing the triangle is 10).
Examples. Calculate the area of an equilateral triangle with a side of 10 cm. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle measures 0.9 dm and its height is 25.95 cm. Calculate the area of the triangle. P = 0.9 dm = 90 cm.
A regular hexagon with perimeter $1$ can be divided into $6$ equilateral triangles, each having side length $\frac{1}{6}$ as pictured below. We have found in part (a) the area of an equilateral triangle whose side length was $\frac{1}{3}$ unit.
Calculate the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 cm. Given an equilateral triangle with a side of 6 cm, find the area of the circular sector determined by the circle circumscribed around the triangle and the radius passing through the vertices. Calculate the side of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of 10 cm radius.
The Equilateral Triangle Formulas are, An equilateral triangle has 3 sides whose length are equal. The equilateral triangle has all the 3 internal angles equal to 60 o. Equilateral Triangle Formulas are used to calculate the area, altitude, perimeter and semi-perimeter of an equilateral triangle.
