To get more specific about the body parts of a mushroom, the fruiting body of the most common mushrooms have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae).
Mushrooms are often referred to as the fruiting body of a fungus. There are many steps in the life cycle of a fungus, but the eventual outcome for many macroscopic species is the formation of a fruiting body and the subsequent release of spores.
To get more specific about the body parts of a mushroom, the fruiting body of the most common mushrooms have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae). Indeed, since we are getting technical about it, there are two kinds of sporocarp that most people recognize.
