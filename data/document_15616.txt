Fitbit is a company based out of San Francisco, California United States that focuses on fitness and activity trackers. Many of the trackers are worn on the wrist like a bracelet. However, earlier models like the Fitbit One can clip onto pants or shirt lapels. The trackers can sync to a Fitbit mobile app found on iOS, Android, Windows, and Windows Phone. Fitbit trackers keep count of steps taken, length of nightly sleep, floors climbed, and distance traveled. Heart rate monitoring is also available in two models, the Charge HR and Surge. 
On the go or at your desk, your Fitbit dashboard is with you all the time. See all your achievement badges, analyze your charts and graphs with ease, and get instant access to the Fitbit community-all in one place. It's fun and free (and you don't even need a tracker to use it).
As with most Windows Phone apps, you will also be able to view Fitbit data via the Live Tiles on the Start screen, which saves you from having to launch the app itself. The native app will let you sync your Fitbit device directly with your smartphone, displaying stats from any Fitbit wireless tracker, including steps, distance, calories, active minutes, floors climbed and sleep quality.
