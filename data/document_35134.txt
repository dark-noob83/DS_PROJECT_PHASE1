Potatoes, like most vegetables, have insect pests and disease that can hinder their growth and reduce plant production. However, when you know what plants to place near the potatoes to help deter pests and help enhance growth, the potatoes are healthy and the companion plants benefit as well.
Never plant potatoes in a soil that has been planted with tomatoes, eggplant, and other nightshade vegetables in the last two years. Other plants that you should not plant with potatoes are carrots, asparagus, fennel, atriplex, turnip, onions, and sunflowers. Companion planting is useful in organic farming.
HorseradishHorseradish, like potatoes, does best in soil that is high in organic matter. It has won its good reputation as a companion plant for potatoes because it repels most of the bugs that attack potato plants. It is also said to encourage growth. Many horticulturists advise planting a horseradish plant at each corner of the potato patch for protection against insects in general.
Companion plants for potatoes include both vegetables and flowers. Beans, corn, eggplant, cabbage, peas, horseradish and parsnips all makes excellent companion plant for potatoes. Marigolds (Tagetes spp.) are beneficial, even though they are flower and not a vegetable. In turn, potatoes are a good companion crop for beans, because they repel Mexican bean beetles.
Antagonists. There is always good and bad, and the same is true with companion planting. Certain plants should not be used as companion plants for potatoes. These include turnips, pumpkins, cucumbers, rutabagas, sunflowers, tomatoes, squash and raspberry. These antagonistic plants can hinder potato growth.
