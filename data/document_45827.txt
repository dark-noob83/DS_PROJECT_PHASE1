High levels of radon are found throughout Multnomah and Clark County. Radon is second only to smoking as a leading cause of lung cancer. It is estimated that radon is responsible for over 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year.

Generally, the fan system requires little to no maintenance once installed.
Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer for non-smokers. At least 1 in 4 properties in the Portland/Vancouver metropolitan areahave elevated radon levels. Our experience includes testing, mitigation, and system design for homes, schools, multi-family housing projects, businesses, public buildings and commercial properties in Oregon, Washington, and California.
