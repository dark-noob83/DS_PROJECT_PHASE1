By far the most massive planet in our solar system, Jupiter features giant hurricanes, auroras, abstract artistic cloudswirls, and maybe even a solid core. It also protects Earth by gravitationally clearing the solar system of asteroids and comets. Credit: Space.com/NASA/JPL.
Since 1941 many astronomers have thought of Jupiter as a protective big brother for planet Earth-a celestial shield, deflecting asteroids and comets away from the inner Solar System.
The idea of Jupiter as protector was first proposed by planetary scientist George Wetherill in 19941. Wetherill showed that the planet's enormous mass — more than 300 times that of the Earth — is enough to catapult comets that might hit Earth, like a slingshot ,out of the Solar System.
The answer is yes … and no. Some astronomers believe that one reason Earth is habitable is that the gravity of Jupiter does help protect us from some comets. Long-period comets, in particular, enter the solar system from its outer reaches.
The main thing it does is it prevents comets and asteroids from hitting earth by pulling them towards itself with its enormous gravity. Some astronomers also think its gravity changes the paths of objects that would otherwise hit earth.
Jupiter--Earth's Menace or Saviour. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system whereas Earth is only the fifth largest among all planets. Jupiter, the massive gas planet, is capable of exerting immense gravitational force on other planets.
It’s rare for a comet to come within 1 astronomical unit of Earth (that is, one Earth-sun distance, 92 million miles, or about 150 million kilometers). But, in the year 1770, a Comet Lexell streaked past Earth at a distance of only a million miles.
