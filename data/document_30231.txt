Note: in case you choose the Standard Blu-ray disc and Split to 2 (or more) discs option to create a Blu-ray disc and the output file size is over 23.28 Gb, it will be splitted into several files, each of them under 23.28 Gb size. It's necessary to write them to several BDs.
A 25GB blank Blu-ray disc can store 5 times more data than a standard DVD on the same size blu-ray BD-R disc.

Blu-ray to MKV, Rip Blu-ray. One common complaint I hear about storing movies on a a hard drive is the large size of the HD movie files. Here are two rules of thumb regarding file size: 1  ISO files are exact replications of the Blu-ray disc. 2  These files run about 30-40 GB.

In this case choose Double-layer Blu-ray disc option and click OK. If your file is still too big to fit a single double-layer disc you might use an option to Shrink to 1 disc or Split to 2 (or more) discs. In the first case the video will be converted with reduced quality so that it could fit a single disc.
You can also convert from a Blu-ray disc directly! When you browse for your Input Video File, select your BD-drive, open the BDMV folder and select the index.bdmv file. It's also possible to select the STREAM folder stored in BDMV directory and load the 00000.m2ts file.
