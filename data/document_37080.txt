Fat has the most calories of all the nutrients: 9 calories per gram. In a healthy diet, about 30 percent of total daily calories should come from fat. This means eating about 50 to 80 grams of fat each day. Fat gives the body energy, too, but the body changes only about 10 percent of fat into glucose.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs.
Foods high in protein also tend to be high in fat. Protein-rich foods should provide 10 to 35 percent of your total daily calories. Adequate protein intake is essential as proteins are the main substances the body uses to build and repair tissues such as muscles, blood, internal organs, hair, skin, nails and bones.
Consuming 20 percent of your total calories from protein equates to 400 calories a day based on a 2,000 calorie diet. As a general rule, between 10 percent and 15 percent of your total calories should come from protein. So, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, at least 200 should come from protein, or about 50 grams. You should try to eat around one gram of protein per one kilogram of body weight, or around 0.4 grams per pound. An easier way to figure this out in your head is to take your weight, divide it in half, and subtract 10.
On a weight-loss program you should avoid overeating fatty foods. Limiting fat calories in the diet can also help decrease your overall total calorie intake. Fat should provide approximately 20 to 35 percent of your total daily calories and be mostly in the form of unsaturated fats from plant and fish sources.
