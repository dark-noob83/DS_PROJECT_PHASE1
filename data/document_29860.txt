Sucrose is a disaccharide that yeast cells convert to glucose for alcoholic fermentation. When the yeast cells produce CO 2, this gas is trapped in bubbles in a layer of foam. Your teacher will pass around a cup with a foam layer so you will know what it looks like.
Yeast use sugar during fermentation (anaerobic respiration) to convert monosaccharides into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Yeast cells were tested for their effectiveness in utilizing a variety of sugars for fermentation.
Alcoholic Fermentation. There is another way that the NADH molecule can be re-oxidized. Anaerobic conditions in yeast convert pyruvate to carbon dioxide and ethanol. This occurs with the help of the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase which removes a carbon dioxide molecule from the pyruvate to yield an acetaldehyde.
Glycolysis is the chemical breakdown of glucose to lactic acid. This process makes energy available for cell activity in the form of a high-energy phosphate compound known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Alcoholic fermentation is identical to glycolysis except for the final step (Fig. 1).
In alcoholic fermentation, pyruvic acid is broken down into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Lactic acid from glycolysis produces a feeling of tiredness; the products of alcoholic fermentation have been used in baking and brewing for centuries.
Since Pasteur's work, several types of microorganisms (including yeast and some bacteria) have been used to break down pyruvic acid to produce ethanol in beer brewing and wine making. The other by-product of fermentation, carbon dioxide, is used in bread making and the production of carbonated beverages.

(book) Another type of fermentation, that was dealt with in this lab, is called alcohol fermentation. This type of fermentation uses yeast to break pyruvate, made by glycolysis, into acetylaldehyde 2 which gives off a molecule of carbon dioxide.
Cellular respiration and alcohol fermentation are examples of this characteristic. Yeast, a single celled organism conducts fermentation when sugar is present, to make chemical energy, and in the process produce alcohol and carbon dioxide. Experiments were performed to understand this process better.
