â€¢ 3 year warranty. The 6051 is a general purpose colorimeter, equipped with easy-to-use conventional style controls, making it ideal for routine and educational use. Standard 10mm square cuvettes, semi-micro volume cuvettes, flowthrough or pour in/suck out cells can all be used with the standard sample holder. Technical Specification.
It is used in chemistry, and in industries such as colour printing, textile manufacturing, and paint manufacturing. A colorimeter measures the intensity of light shining through a coloured solution compared to the intensity of light passing into the solution.
Use for Colorimetric and Turbidimetric Determinations. These photometric colorimeters use specific light filters to give readings on a unique KlettTM scale. The readings are directly proportional to the concentration or optical density of a solution, in accordance with Beers Law.
The science of colorimetry is used to quantify the response of the human visual system and match human color perception for applications in a variety of industries.
The absorbance or transmittance intensity of a colored solute is used to define the specific mineral ions and concentration in solution. The colorimeter by LaMotte Smart3 is provided with various reagents to determine specific ions
Colorimetry is used in chemistry and in other sorts of places such as in industries colour printing, textile manufacturing, paint manufacturing and in food industries (including the chocolate industry). Colorimetry is also used in asprin.
Colorimetry is the study of absorbance and/or transmittance of light. A spectrophotometer type which reads the visible part of the Electro Magnetic (EM) spectrum is called a Colorimeter.
In colorimetry, the color of the sample is compared with a color of a standard in which the color is known. Colorimeter is the equipment used to measure the colored samples and give the appropriate absorptions. Spectrophotometry. Spectrophotometer is the instruments used in this technique.
