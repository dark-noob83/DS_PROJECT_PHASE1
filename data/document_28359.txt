Uses of NMR spectroscopy. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an analytical chemistry technique used in quality control and reserach for determining the content and purity of a sample as well as its molecular structure. For example, NMR can quantitatively analyze mixtures containing known compounds. The basis of NMR. The principle behind NMR is that many nuclei have spin and all nuclei are electrically charged. If an external magnetic field is applied, an energy transfer is possible between the base energy to a higher energy level (generally a single energy gap).
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic radiation. Multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a kind of FT NMR in which there are at least two pulses and, as the experiment is repeated, the pulse sequence is systematically varied. In multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance there will be a sequence of pulses and, at least, one variable time period
In thisdiscussion, we will focus on H NMR or proton magnetic resonance. Even though there are manyother spectrometers including C-NMR and N-NMR, hydrogen (H-NMR) was the first and is themost common atom used in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 
Over the past fifty years nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, commonly referred to as nmr, has become the preeminent technique for determining the structure of organic compounds. For nmr purposes, this small energy difference (Î´E) is usually given as a frequency in units of MHz (10 6 Hz), ranging from 20 to 900 Mz, depending on the magnetic field strength and the specific nucleus being studied.
This page describes what a C-13 NMR spectrum is and how it tells you useful things about the carbon atoms in organic molecules. The background to C-13 NMR spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance is concerned with the magnetic properties of certain nuclei. Features of a C-13 NMR spectrum. The C-13 NMR spectrum for ethanol. This is a simple example of a C-13 NMR spectrum. Don't worry about the scale for now-we'll look at that in a minute.
Introduction. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has become the dominant method of analysis for organic compounds, because in many cases it provides a way to determine an entire structure using one set of analytical tests. This is a workshop introducing the basics of NMR spectroscopy for students of organic chemistry. It is taught as part of the Chemistry 341 course at SUNY Potsdam.

This page describes what a proton NMR spectrum is and how it tells you useful things about the hydrogen atoms in organic molecules. The background to NMR spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance is concerned with the magnetic properties of certain nuclei. On this page we are focussing on the magnetic behaviour of hydrogen nuclei-hence the term proton NMR or 1H-NMR.
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, most commonly known as NMR spectroscopy, is a research technique that exploits the magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei. It determines the physical and chemical properties of atoms or the molecules in which they are contained. Most frequently, NMR spectroscopy is used by chemists and biochemists to investigate the properties of organic molecules, although it is applicable to any kind of sample that contains nuclei possessing spin.
