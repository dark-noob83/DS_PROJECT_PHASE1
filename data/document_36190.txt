Airplanes haven't always beeing made out of metal, in fact the earliest airplanes were amde out of pine wood and canvas. Newer, private aircraft can be made out of steel and a â€¦ nylon-canvas mixture.
Piston in the engine is usually made up of steel but some other major parts of the airplane is made up of aluminum alloys. Jet engines are built up of aluminum, steel and titanium alloys. An engineer always looks up for the appropriate metal and alloy to be used in the aircraft according to its application.
The same is true with Titanium. The earliest type of titanium alloy was called 6Al-4V Titanium, which means 6% Aluminum and 4% vanadium mixed in with the Ti. More recent alloys is an alloy with mixtures of 10-2-3 mixture of these metals. Landing gear are made of high-strength steel forgings.
Mostly aluminum and a little steel for wing and landing gear trunnions. Some new aircraft (airbusses and the not yet out Boeing 787) are composite non-metal material like carbon-fiber.
That depends on the type of plane. There are planes made from Wood and Fabric, to Aluminum Structure and Skin Aircraft, to aircraft made from plastic, to aircraft made out of composites.
Most airplanes today are made out of aluminum, a strong, yet lightweight metal. The Ford Tri-Motor, the first passenger plane from 1928, was made out of aluminum. The modern Boeing 747 is an aluminum airplane as well.
Different aircraft require different building materials. Aircraft can be constructed from wood, fabric, many types of metal, or even composite materials (e.g. carbon-fiber, fiberglass). Early aircraft such as the Wright Flyer were built with wood and fabric. The frame of the Wright Flyer was made from spruce and ash and many surfaces were covered with muslin, a fabric.
