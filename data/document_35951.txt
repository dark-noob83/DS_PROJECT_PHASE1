Provided they are maintained and run properly, heat pump pool heaters have life spans of 10 to 20 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Most gas and electric heaters typically have life spans of five to 10 years. You can heat a pool with a solar setup.
The cost to run a pool heat pump is $100-$200 per month. Gas Pool Heaters How Much Do Gas Pool Heaters Cost? Propane or Natural, same price. Gas pool heaters are sized according to the size of the pool, or if you have an attached spa that you want to heat to over 100 degrees.
How They Work. Gas pool heaters use either natural gas or propane. As the pump circulates the pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and then to the heater. The gas burns in the heater's combustion chamber, generating heat that transfers to the water that's returned to the pool.
To replenish this heat using a gas pool heater would cost 732 x 0.025 = $18.30 @2.5cents/MJ, the approximate price of gas in Sydney. This cost would be the output cost from the gas pool heater. The input cost for the gas for an 84%-efficient gas pool heater = (100/84) x 18.30 = $21.80.
Upfront Costs. Though they are less expensive to operate, electric heat pump pool heaters cost more upfront than both gas and electric resistance heaters. Heat pumps can cost up to $5,000, while the majority of gas and electric resistance heaters are available for around $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. The cost for installing heat pumps and gas heaters averages about $300 to $500, including labor and materials.
Using natural gas, and assuming 7 months of active pool heating use per year, the cost of gas heating a 32 m 2 pool in southern QLD to central/north eastern NSW is likely to be $600-$1,200 per annum. And that’s assuming you’re also using a pool cover; if you’re not using a pool cover, the running costs double.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, heating a pool with 1,000 square feet of surface area with an electric resistance or gas heater costs around $500 per month, compared with the much lower expenditure of roughly $100 for a heat pump.
Today, you'll find some gas pool heaters with 89%–95% efficiency. The following table shows how much you can save for every $1,000 in annual pool heating costs by installing a gas pool heater that's 95% efficient.
