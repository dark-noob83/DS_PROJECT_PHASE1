A test is considered biased when the scores of one group are significantly different and have higher predictive validity, which is the extent to which a score on an assessment predicts future performance, than another group. Most test biases are considered cultural bias. Cultural bias is the extent to which a test offends or penalizes some students based on their ethnicity, gender or socioeconomic status. 
Cultural bias is the phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, location of body parts, mate selection, concepts of justice, linguistic and logical validity, acceptability of evidence, and taboos.
The problem of cultural bias is central to social and human sciences, such as economics, psychology, anthropology and sociology, which have had to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias. In brief, any normative belief of a human being seems to be caused by culture, and thus can be reasonably isolated as a cultural bias. See goodness and value theory.

Since the test is culturally biased toward LGBT students, the professor should not give the assessment to this population, since it does not produce results that accurately reflect the abilities of
