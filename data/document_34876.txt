Advertisements. I am wondering how much do you generally pay for tuition for Goddard school for 4 year old, 5 days a week. We were quoted 870/month and wanted to find out if this is generally considered reasonable. They do seem to be on the high side compared to most other schools and day care facilities.
1 This depends on the age of your child-- price for 2 year olds will be much higher than a 4 year old. 2  It also depends on the place. 3  We have been through preschool at 4  ... We live in a nice part of Vegas and pay $195 for the week. 5  This school prepped our daughter for private school and I feel they did a good job.
