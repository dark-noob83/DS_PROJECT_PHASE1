Surgical spirit is not the same as US 'rubbing alcohol'. You want isopropanol, but it will not be easy (or cheap!) to find. I eventually got it (years ago) in a chemists, after being thoroughly questioned about what i wanted to use it for, and it cost £5 for 500ml. Yep...
Making the world better, one answer at a time. No. White spirit is a turpentine substitute used for thinning paint or cleaning paint brushes or rollers. Surgical spirit is a mixture of ethanol, methanol (to make it undrinkable) and sometimes oil of wintergreen or methyl salicylate. On a similar note, methylated spirit is similar to surgical spirit but contains pyridine as well as methanol and a purple dye to make it undrinkable.

Castor oil is included in the formula for certain brands of surgical spirit. It is obtained from the castor bean plant and has many industrial and medicinal applications. In surgical spirit, castor oil acts as a mild anti-fungal and is useful in lubricating skin as it heals. Though it is sometimes used as a food additive and an oral medicine, castor oil is dangerous if consumed in moderate to large quantities.
Ethanol is a colorless, flammable liquid used in many medicinal and industrial processes, as well as in drinking alcohol. In surgical spirits, ethanol is the key component and active ingredient. Although it is created through the same process as drinking alcohol, ethanol is toxic because of its purity and is denatured, or chemically changed, to make it unfit for consumption.
