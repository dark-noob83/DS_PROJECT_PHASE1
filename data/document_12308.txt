To be on the safe side, you should allow about 10 feet. Calculate the number of square feet in the walls. Multiply the length times the height of each wall. Then add up the results. For example, for a 15-by-30-foot garage with walls 10 feet high, you have two walls that are 15-by-10 feet and that are 30-by-10 feet. This gives you a total of 900 square feet. Figure the area of the garage door by multiplying the planned width by the height.
Again, most blocks are sixteen inches long. Thus, if you use a factor of .75, you will find how many block to use in one course. For a 100 feet long wall, you would multiply 100 x .75 = 75. 
Basement blocks generally do not go all the way up to the second level. They generally go a block or two above ground and at least to the frost line depth. Here. where I live in Michigan, the frost level is 48  below ground. However, I have a basement with 12 high block walls. 
Calculate the surface area of a single block in the wall, including its mortar allowance. For example, if your standard concrete block is 1 foot by 0.5 feet and is separated from its neighbours by a half-inch of mortar, then each block accounts for 1.0417 x 0.5417, or 0.5643 square feet.
You will need 338 blocks. 11 bags of mortar. 1 yards of sand. And here the blocks go for about $1.40 plus tax and $60 delivery fee. You would need about 60 80 pound bags of premixed mortar mix. At a cost of about $315 plus tax if you decide to go with the premix. Widths vary from 4 to at least 12. The standard math for computing concrete blocks is length x width / .89. Each block is .89 s.f. of face coverage. So for a wall 30' x 10' would be 300 s.f./ .89 =337 block per face.
Find the number of concrete blocks required for 1 square foot of wall. Most concrete blocks are approximately 8 inches high by 16 inches long. Multiply the height by the length and divide the result into 144 (the number of square inches in a single square foot). Then add up the results. For example, for a 15-by-30-foot garage with walls 10 feet high, you have two walls that are 15-by-10 feet and that are 30-by-10 feet. This gives you a total of 900 square feet. Figure the area of the garage door by multiplying the planned width by the height.
Confidence votes 13. Calculate the exterior face area of he wall you want to build and the face area of the side of the cinder block (add about 1/2 inch to length and 12 inch to width for mortar thickness). Divide the wall area by the block area This is the number of blocks you require. This is how I figure out how many blocks you will need: First measure the length of walls for the blocks in feet. Second divide that number by 4 then multiply the total by 3. That will give you total blocks needed for one course of blocks. 
You'll need 45 bricks across, and 15 bricks high, meaning you need a total of 675 cinder bricks.. The average cost of a cinder brick at Lowe's or Home depot is ~$1.35, so your looking at about ~$911.00 in total cost for this wall of yours. Widths vary from 4 to at least 12. The standard math for computing concrete blocks is length x width / .89. Each block is .89 s.f. of face coverage. So for a wall 30' x 10' would be 300 s.f./ .89 =337 block per face.
A standard cement (cinder) block with mortar seam gives you a sixteen inch linear run, so you only need 22.5 blocks to run thirty feet. You will need 330 regular blocks and 15 half blocks to build your wall. The rest of the first answerer's info is pretty close. Widths vary from 4 to at least 12. The standard math for computing concrete blocks is length x width / .89. Each block is .89 s.f. of face coverage. So for a wall 30' x 10' would be 300 s.f./ .89 =337 block per face.
Brick Calculators and Block Calculators Before you can build a retaining wall or any other masonry wall you will need to be able to calculate the concrete masonry blocks you will need to order. Use this calculator to calculate the amount of concrete block needed to construct a masonry wall. Nick Toth's Retaining Wall.
