Hypothermia, the medical condition of low body temperature, is defined as core temperature of 95 Â°F or lower. At this point, the body will take actions aggressive action such as shivering to increase temperature.
1. body temperature-temperature of the body; normally 98.6 F or 37 C in humans; usually measured to obtain a quick evaluation of a person's health. blood heat. temperature-the degree of hotness or coldness of a body or environment (corresponding to its molecular activity).

body temperature the temperature of the body of a human or animal; see temperature. core temperature the temperature of structures deep within the body, as opposed to peripheral temperature such as that of the skin. critical temperature that below which a gas may be converted to a liquid by increased pressure.
Heatstroke is a condition caused by your body overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures. This most serious form of heat injury, heatstroke can occur if your body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher.
Medical Definition of CORE TEMPERATURE. : the temperature deep within a living body (as in the viscera). What made you want to look up core temperature?
temperature. the degree of sensible heat or cold, expressed in terms of a specific scale. See Table of Temperature Equivalents in the Appendices. Body temperature is measured by a clinical thermometer and represents a balance between the heat produced by the body and the heat it loses.
