One out of five pastors has to work a second job to support himself and his family. The average pastor’s salary of $28,000 a year is close to that of a teachers’ average salary in the United States which is $42,000 a year. As I stated before, these are the two lowest paid professionals with degrees in the nation. Then average 10% tithing for a church of 75 parishioners in America. So we will say all parishioners are families and cut the 75 in one-third. 25 x $5193 = $129,825. Yes, I understand that some money goes to the church rent, and bills, and then some overhead.
His church designated $55,000 of his $60,000 salary as a housing allowance. Reverend Black had other housing expenses of $10,000, but the fair rental value of the home (furnished, including utilities) was $25,000. There is no limit on the amount of a minister’s salary that a church can designate as a housing allowance. In appropriate situations, a church could designate 100% of a minister’s salary as
Example: Reverend Black made a $50,000 down pay-ment on a home. His church designated $55,000 of his $60,000 salary as a housing allowance. Reverend Black had other housing expenses of $10,000, but the fair rental value of the home (furnished, including utilities) was $25,000.
Example: Reverend Smith owns his own home, and his church designated 40% ($16,000) of his $40,000 salary as an annual housing allowance in advance. His actual housing expenses for the year were $15,000. The fair rental value of his home (furnished, including utilities) was $17,000. There is no limit on the amount of a minister’s salary that a church can designate as a housing allowance. In appropriate situations, a church could designate 100% of a minister’s salary as
Thus if a church has a budget of $50,000 then the pay for the Pastor should be $23,000 to $32,000 a year. If the budget is $100,000 then the pay should be $45,000 to $55,000 a year. Again with all things equal, a church of 100 people should give at least $2000 a week. (That's $20 a person which is 8% of minimum wage-which is below the recommended 10% tithe) This would bring a total of $104,000 a year. A church of 100 people should easily be able to pay at least $45,000 for a Pastor. So if the giving is low, his pay should be low. For example: A church of 100 people and each person on the average only gives $5 then they would bring in $500 dollars a week. Thus the Pastors pay will be lower than if the church members gave $10 or $20 or $50 per person. 6.
Utilities, insurance, upkeep, etc this money, as well as the pay of the Pastor only comes from the congregation. So if the giving is low, his pay should be low. For example: A church of 100 people and each person on the average only gives $5 then they would bring in $500 dollars a week. Thus the Pastors pay will be lower than if the church members gave $10 or $20 or $50 per person. 6.
Example: Reverend Smith owns his own home, and his church designated 40% [$16,000] of his $40,000 salary as an annual housing allowance in advance. His actual housing expenses for the year were $15,000. The fair rental value of his home (furnished, including utilities) was $17,000. His church designated $55,000 of his $60,000 salary as a housing allowance. Reverend Black had other housing expenses of $10,000, but the fair rental value of the home (furnished, including utilities) was $25,000.
Here are some rough rules of thumb for estimating how much you should expect to pay for various utilities: During winter months, or if you don’t use air conditioning, expect to pay $30-$50 a month for electricity. In some buildings, if you have a gas range, you’ll have to pay for the natural gas that you use during cooking. (And in some buildings, the natural gas will also provide your heat.) With cooking, the cost is minimal — $15 a month at most, usually quite a lot less. It really all depends how much you cook at home.
Example – #1 – this pastor receives a cash salary of $45,000 per year and lives in a church owned parsonage with a monthly Fair Market Rental Value (FMRV) of $1600; the annual FMRV is $19,200. The church pays the utilities (which they should) that amount to $2,800 per year. His annual self-employment tax (Social Security) will amount to $9,467 ($45,000 + 19,200 + 2,800 = $67,000 x 92.35% = $61,875 x 15.3% = $9,467) of which the church agrees to pay $6,500 (9.8% of $67,000). 5. Life Insurance – $100,000 of term life insurance, paid by the church, with the wife as beneficiary – this protects the church and provides for the family upon a premature death. The church can pay the premiums on the policy but only the premium on the first $50,000 is a tax-free fringe benefit. The pastor should provide his own additional life insurance as needed, probably in the $500,000 range
