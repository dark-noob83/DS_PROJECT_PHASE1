Whole Turkey Oven Temperature Cooking Time (hours) Temp when cooked 4-8 pounds 325 degrees F 2 - 3 hours 160 - 170 8-12 pounds 325 degrees F 3 - 4 hours 160 - 170 12 - 16 pounds 325 degrees F 4 - 5 hours 160 - 170 16 - 20 pounds 325 degrees F 5 - 6 hours 160 - 170 20 - 24 pounds 325 degrees F 6 - 7 hours 160 - 170. The following chart is for whole turkey cooked at an oven temperature of 325 degrees. Allow slightly longer times for turkeys which are cooked in a slower oven, and conversely less time for a higher temperature oven. If you have a convection oven, cut time by as much as 1/3 or consult manufacturer's instructions.
1 A whole turkey is safe when cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165 °F as measured with a food thermometer. 2  Check the internal temperature in the innermost part of the thigh and wing and the thickest part of the breast. 1 If using an oven-proof food thermometer, place it in the turkey at the start of the cooking cycle. 2  It will allow you to check the internal temperature of the turkey while it is cooking. 3  For turkey breasts, place thermometer in the thickest part. 4  For whole turkeys, place in the thickest part of the inner thigh
1 The turkey is done when the thigh meat reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. 2  To get an accurate reading, be sure that your thermometer is not touching the bone. 3  If your turkey has been stuffed, it is important to check the temperature of the dressing; it should be 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). During the last 45 minutes of baking, remove the foil tent to brown the skin. Basting is not necessary, but will promote even browning. The only true test for doneness is the temperature of the meat, not the color of the skin. 1 
1 After about 3 hours, insert an oven-safe thermometer deep into the thigh without touching the bone. 2  Begin checking the turkey for doneness about 30 minutes before the recommended cook time. 3  Your turkey is done when the temperature with a meat thermometer is 180° F in thigh and 165° F in breast or stuffing. 1 When the turkey is about ⅔ done, loosely cover breast and top of drumsticks with a piece of foil to prevent overcooking. 2  Your turkey is done when the temperature with a meat thermometer is 180° F in thigh and 165° F in breast or stuffing. 3  Lift turkey onto platter, and let stand for 15 minutes before carving.
1 If your turkey has been stuffed, it is important to check the temperature of the dressing; it should be 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). 2  When the turkey is done, remove from the oven and allow to stand for 20-30 minutes before carving. During the last 45 minutes of baking, remove the foil tent to brown the skin. Basting is not necessary, but will promote even browning. The only true test for doneness is the temperature of the meat, not the color of the skin. 1  The turkey is done when the thigh meat reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
1 Place your turkey in the oven. 2  When the turkey is about ⅔ done, loosely cover breast and top of drumsticks with a piece of foil to prevent overcooking. 3  Your turkey is done when the temperature with a meat thermometer is 180° F in thigh and 165° F in breast or stuffing. 1 When the turkey is about ⅔ done, loosely cover breast and top of drumsticks with a piece of foil to prevent overcooking. 2  Your turkey is done when the temperature with a meat thermometer is 180° F in thigh and 165° F in breast or stuffing. 3  Lift turkey onto platter, and let stand for 15 minutes before carving.
1 Cook the turkey with the proper oven temperature, and cook it thoroughly. 2  Use a meat thermometer to verify that the turkey has cooked to the proper doneness (170ºF for the breast meat and 180ºF for the thigh meat). 3  Store leftovers promptly in the refrigerator or freezer. 1 If you stuff the turkey, you must use a meat thermometer to ensure that the stuffing has reached a safe minimum temperature of 165°F. 2  When using leftover stuffing that was originally cooked inside the turkey, the stuffing must be reheated to a minimum temperature of 165°F to ensure that it is safe to eat.
1 A whole turkey should be cooked until the internal temperature of the breast meat reaches 170°F and the deepest portion of the thigh reaches 180°F. 1 If you stuff the turkey, you must use a meat thermometer to ensure that the stuffing has reached a safe minimum temperature of 165°F. 2  When using leftover stuffing that was originally cooked inside the turkey, the stuffing must be reheated to a minimum temperature of 165°F to ensure that it is safe to eat.
The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that the turkey be cooked to a temperature of 165°F (74°C), as measured in the innermost part of the thigh. If the thigh is 165°F, the breast meat is likely to be 10°F hotter.
