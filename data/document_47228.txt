In this case, there is 1 cycle per 60 seconds. So the frequency is f = 1 cycle / (60 s) = (1 / 60) Hz. Answer: A. Frequency refers to the number of occurrences of a periodic event per time and is measured in cycles/second.
Frequency = cycles per second = 793 cycles/60.0 seconds = 13.2 cycles/s = 13.2 Hz Period = seconds per cycle = 60.0 s/793 cycles = 0.0757 seconds Amplitude of Vibration The final measurable quantity that describes a vibrating object is the amplitude.
While period is measured in seconds per cycle, frequency is measured in cycles per second. Consider our wave with a period of 2 seconds. Since the wave completes one cycle every two seconds, then its frequency is one half or 0.5 Hz. So you see-period and frequency are reciprocals of each other.
It also prepares your body for pregnancy each month. A cycle is counted from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young teens.
Frequency = cycles per second = 793 cycles/60.0 seconds = 13.2 cycles/s = 13.2 Hz Period = seconds per cycle = 60.0 s/793 cycles = 0.0757 seconds. In this problem, the event that is repeating itself is the clapping of hands; one hand clap is equivalent to a cycle.
For each dot, f is the frequency in hertz (Hz) – meaning the number of times per second (i.e. cycles per second) that it flashes – while T is the flashes' period in seconds (s), meaning the number of seconds per cycle. Each T and f are reciprocal.
The menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. A normal menstrual cycle can be as short as 21 days or longer than 35 days. For most women, it lasts 25 - 30 days. But it's common for your cycle to vary from month to month.
In this case, there are 10 cycles per 2 minutes (also known as 10 cycles per 120 seconds). So the frequency is f =10 cycles / 120 s = 0.0833 cycles/s. Answer: D. Frequency refers to the number of occurrences of a periodic event per time and is measured in cycles/second.
Period refers to the time for something to happen and is measured in seconds/cycle. In this case, there are 11 seconds per 33 vibrational cycles. Thus the period is (11 s) / (33 cycles) = 0.33 seconds. 9.
