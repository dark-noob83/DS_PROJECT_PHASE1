The lungs are surrounded by a double membrane called pleura. This membrane has two layers, a parietal pleura and a visceral pleura. The parietal pleura is attached to the chest wall and the visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs. Between these layers of pleura is a potential space i.e. a space that doesn’t exist but it could exist if something goes wrong
The lungs occupy most of the space in the thoracic cavity. The heart sits between the right and left lung. The lungs are soft and spongy because they are mostly air spaces surrounded by the alveolar cells and elastic connective tissue. Each lung is enclosed by a double-layered serous membrane, called the pleura. The visceral pleuron is firmly attached to the surface of the lung. Visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura that lines the wall of the thorax. The small space between the visceral and parietal pleurae is the pleural cavity. 
The ribs surround the lungs in the thorasica cavity. Pleural visceral lung pleura. parietal pleura lines the thoracic wall and diaphrag … m. it is the pleura The membranes that surround the lungs are collectively called the Plurae.
It has two layers: 1) The parietal layer (which makes contact with the body wall) 2) The visceral layer (which surrounds the … lungs) While it has these two layers, the pleural membrane is in fact one continuous 'bubble' of membrane-the fact the lungs are inside it gives it it's two layers. Pleural visceral lung pleura. parietal pleura lines the thoracic wall and diaphrag … m. it is the pleura The membranes that surround the lungs are collectively called the Plurae.
Each lung is surrounded by two layers of serous membrane known as pleurae. These are: __________ pleura covers the surface of the lung. __________ pleura lines the thoracic wall. The space between is called the ____________ cavity and it is filled with ___________ fluid. This fluid assists breathing movements by acting as a ________________. 3.
Between the parietal and visceral pleura is the pleural cavity, which creates a hollow space for the lungs to expand into during inhalation. Serous fluid secreted by the pleural membranes lubricates the inside of the pleural cavity to prevent irritation to the lungs during breathing. 
2) The visceral layer (which surrounds the lungs). While it has these two layers, the pleural membrane is in fact one continuous 'bubble' of membrane-the fact the lungs are inside it gives it it's two layers. The outer layer of a serous membrane is called the parietal layer and is always attached to the surrounding tissues. The inner layer is called the visceral layer and is firmly … attached to the organ it covers. Answered. In Cardiovascular Health.

Each lung is enclosed by a double-layered serous membrane, called the pleura. The visceral pleura is firmly attached to the surface of the lung. At the hilum, the visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura that lines the wall of the thorax. 
The inner layer covers organs in bodily cavities and is called the visceral membrane; this inner layer of epithelial cells is followed by a connective tissue; after the connective tissue is the second layer of epithelial cells of the serous membrane called the parietal layer. The Latin anatomical name is tunica serosa. 1 The pleura is the serous membrane that surrounds the lungs in the pleural cavity; the pericardium is the serous membrane that surrounds the heart in the pericardial cavity. 2  The peritoneum is the serous membrane that surrounds several organs in the abdominopelvic cavity.
