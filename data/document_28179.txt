Soap is produced by the saponification (hydrolysis) of a triglyceride (fat or oil). (See Figure 1.) In this process the triglyceride is reacted with a strong base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide to produce glycerol and fatty acid salts.
In simple terms, saponification is the name for a chemical reaction between an acid and a base to form a salt. When you make soap using the cold process soap making method, you mix an oil or fat (which is your acid) with Lye (which is your base) to form soap (which is a salt).
Saponification Explained. In simple terms, saponification is the name for a chemical reaction between an acid and a base to form a salt. When you make soap using the cold process soap making method, you mix an oil or fat (which is your acid) with Lye (which is your base) to form soap (which is a salt).
Saponification commonly refers to the reaction of a metallic alkali such as Lye (A.K.A. Sodium Hydroxide or NaOH) with an animal or vegetable fat, or oil to produce soap. In this reaction, two products result: Soap and Glycerin. If you’re into chemical reaction formulas, see it below.
The term saponification is the name given to the chemical reaction that occurs when a vegetable oil or animal fat is mixed with a strong alkali. The products of the reaction are two: soap and glycerin. Water is also present, but it does not enter into the chemical reaction.
Saponification is the alkaline hydrolysis of the fatty acid esters. Example: The chemical reaction between any fat and sodium hydroxide is a saponification reaction. triglyceride + sodium hydroxide (or potassium hydroxide) → glycerol + 3 soap molecules. 1 of 1.
This reaction is catalyzed by a strong acid or base. Saponification is the alkaline hydrolysis of the fatty acid esters.
