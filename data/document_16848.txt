Passengers get charged when they cancel flights, but generally airlines don’t. Alaska Airlines does not have a change or cancellation fee for changes made more than 60 days before departure. After departure, the fee is $125 for all paid and award tickets, except refundable first class. Same day confirmed changes are just $25.
The fee is $110 for award flights. There is no fee to change or cancel a flight ticketed within 24 hours, so long as the reservation was made at least 7 days prior to departure. United Airlines charges change fees of $200 for domestic flights and up to $400 or more for international itineraries. Same day changes can be made for $75, but that fee is waived for MileagePlus Premier Gold, Premier Platinum and Premier 1K members.
And it really is any passenger. The standard fee is $0. The award fee is $0. The elite fee is $0. No one has to pay a cancellation fee if it’s at least 60 days before departure, which makes a lot of sense because the airline still has two months to sell the ticket to someone else. (The cheapest discount fares tend to start disappearing around 3-6 weeks before departure.).
Yet its change fees are far more reasonable than those of other airlines. Alaska charges $75 for an online change and $100 if it’s done through a call center. Effective Oct. 30, its call-center change fee jumps to $125. But any changes made two months before a flight don’t incur any fees.
