If you must use a touchless/self-serve car wash, keep in mind that engine cleaner and regular wash water all go through the same wand. Make sure to always start the wash on high-pressure rinse and spray it against the wall for at least 20 seconds before aiming it at your vehicle.
· just now. Report Abuse. Some touchless car washes use very high pressures so if any of the seals/weatherstrips on the car are borderline bad, water can easily find its way into the vehicle. Personally I find the old fashioned by hand method is still the best. Yes, it's more time consuming but it gets the best results...
Mike L. Dear Mike, Taking your car through an automatic car wash is a good idea – especially in winter when the effects of salt can be extremely damaging to your car. Today’s car wash systems are safe, unlike the old brush systems your dad may remember.
Brushless or Touchless. Only take your car to automated car washes that are brushless or touchless. Older car washes utilized rough brushes that can severely damage modern car finishes and clear coats; even older paint finishes can be scratched by the older brushes.
RE: are touchless car washes safe? Hey guys, i was wondering what your thoughts were on touchless car washes? i love having a clean car inside and out, so i went to an automatic car wash every week (the kind with the spinning brushes).
In fact, automatic car washes can be safer for your car's finish than washing your car yourself because do-it-yourselfers sometimes don't use enough water to safely remove dirt; or they wash the car in direct sunlight -- which can burn spots in the paint.
