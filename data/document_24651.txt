When the wave reaches shallow water, however, it slows down at the leading edge. This causes the wave to bunch up and increase in height, even to dangerous proportions
When the water depth is about one and one-third. times the wave height, the crest of the wave breaks, pro-. ducing surf.5 When the water depth becomes less than. 1/20 the wavelength, waves in the surf zone begin to be-. have as shallow-water waves (see Figure 8—6). (b) A diagrammatic view of an idealized ocean wave showing its characteristics. Longitudinal and transverse waves are called body. waves because they transfer energy through a body of. matter.

A 20 or 30 metre high wave would devastate a shoreline, but would be hardly noticeable if it passed beneath a ship in deep water. Certainly shallow water will travel faster than deep water for the same volume of water moving past a point p … er unit of time. And if you think about it, it will become clear. Let's look at water in a pipe and make a comparison.   Two pipes of different diameter have water moving through them.
In fluid dynamics, dispersion of water waves generally refers to frequency dispersion, which means that waves of different wavelengths travel at different phase speeds. Water waves, in this context, are waves propagating on the water surface, and forced by gravity and surface tension. As a result, water with a free surface is generally considered to be a dispersive medium. Surface gravity waves, moving under the forcing by gravity, propagate faster for increasing wavelength. For a fixed water depth, long waves (with large wavelength) propagate faster than shorter waves. In the left figure, it can be seen that shallow water waves, with wavelengths λ much larger than the water depth h, travel with the phase velocity. with g the acceleration by gravity and cp the phase speed.
Shallow-water waves include wind-generated waves. that have moved into shallow near-shore areas; tsunami. (seismic sea waves), generated by earthquakes in the. ocean floor; and the tides, which are a type of wave gen-. erated by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and. the Sun.

When a wave goes from deep water to shallow water, it decreases in size and strength. This is because shallow water does not have the required power to transmit the wave, and … so its velocity decreases. Certainly shallow water will travel faster than deep water for the same volume of water moving past a point p … er unit of time. And if you think about it, it will become clear. Let's look at water in a pipe and make a comparison.   Two pipes of different diameter have water moving through them.
Shallow-water waves move at a speed that is equal to the square root of the product of the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s/s) and the water depth-let's see what this implies: In the Pacific Ocean, where the typical water depth is about 4000 m, a tsunami travels at about 200 m/s, or over 700 km/hr. Note the vastness of the area across which the tsunami travels-Japan, which is over 17,000 km away from the tsunami's source off the coast of Chile, lost 200 lives to this tsunami. Also note how the wave crests bend as the tsunami travels-this is called refraction.
