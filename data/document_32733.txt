In adults, three conditions are known to cause aortic stenosis. 1  Progressive wear and tear of a bicuspid valve present since birth (congenital). 2  Wear and tear of the aortic valve in the elderly. 3  Scarring of the aortic valve due to rheumatic fever as a child or young adult. Over time, excessive wear and tear leads to calcification, scarring, and reduced mobility of the valve leaflets. About 10% of bicuspid valves become significantly narrowed, resulting in the symptoms and heart problems of

Aortic calcification, which is also called sclerosis, is a buildup of calcium deposits in the aortic valve in the heart. The aortic valve allows blood to flow through the heart, and the calcium buildup that accumulates there can impede the flow of blood as the heart pumps. This narrowing of the aortic valve is called aortic valve stenosis. A heart murmur detected by a stethoscope is the first sign of aortic calcification. Calcium is normally found in the blood, but it can stiffen the aortic valve in some people. View slideshow of images above.
Atherosclerosis appears to play a major role in diseases of the aortic arch, descending thoracic, and abdominal aorta. Atherosclerosis can result in weakening of the aortic wall, making it prone to aneurysm formation or dissection.

Calcium buildup on the valve. With age, heart valves may accumulate deposits of calcium (aortic valve calcification). Calcium is a mineral found in your blood. As blood repeatedly flows over the aortic valve, deposits of calcium can accumulate on the valve's leaflets. These deposits may never cause any problems. These calcium deposits aren't linked to taking calcium tablets or drinking calcium-fortified drinks.
Aortic valve calcification is a condition in which calcium deposits form on the aortic valve in the heart. These deposits can cause narrowing at the opening of the aortic valve. This narrowing can become severe enough to reduce blood flow through the aortic valve, a condition called aortic valve stenosis. Aortic valve calcification may be an early sign that you have heart disease, even if you don't have any other heart disease symptoms. Calcification and stenosis generally affect people older than age 65. When it occurs in younger people, it's often caused by: 1  A heart defect that's present at birth
The most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients 65 years of age and over is called senile calcific aortic stenosis.. With aging, protein collagen of the valve leaflets is destroyed, and calcium is deposited on the leaflets. Over time, excessive wear and tear leads to calcification, scarring, and reduced mobility of the valve leaflets. About 10% of bicuspid valves become significantly narrowed, resulting in the symptoms and heart problems of
Overview. Radiologic detection of calcifications within the heart is quite common. The amount of coronary artery calcification correlates with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). Calcification of the aortic or mitral valve may indicate hemodynamically significant valvular stenosis. 
Calcium is a mineral naturally found in the blood, and as blood flows through the heart, it can leave behind tiny amounts of calcium. Typically, calcium that builds up naturally does not cause any problems, but in some people, it can cause stiffening of the aortic valve, resulting in aortic calcification. This stiffening can narrow the heart valve, impeding the flow of blood through the heart. A heart murmur detected by a stethoscope is the first sign of aortic calcification. Calcium is normally found in the blood, but it can stiffen the aortic valve in some people. View slideshow of images above.
