Electricity prices in selected countries in 2014 (in U.S. dollar cents per kilowatt hour). This statistic shows electricity prices in leading economies worldwide in 2014. In the United States, electricity prices stood at 10 U.S. dollar cents per kilowatt hour. 
In the United States for example, the average residential cost of a kilowatt hour in Wyoming is 6.2 cents and goes all the way up to 25.12 cents in Hawaii. To determine this cost, how many kilowatts a device uses is multiplied by how many hours it is used to get kWh, which are then multiplied by the price of electricity per kWh. watts ÷ 1,000 = kWh kWh × hours of operation × rate = cost.
The high cost of crude oil used to generate the state's electricity is driving the price, EIA energy economist Tyler Hodge told me. Idaho had the lowest price, at about 8 cents per kWh. So the typical US household would pay about $73 for electricity each month in Idaho. People in Hawaii pay the most for electricity, about 33 cents per kWh. A Hawaiian household whose electricity use was around the national average would have a monthly electric bill over $300.
To achieve this goal, SunShot works to lower the price of solar electricity to $0.06 per kilowatt hour (KWh) -- a cost target that will make solar-generated power to be fully cost-competitive with traditional energy sources by the end of the decade. 
The average price people in the U.S. pay for electricity is about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. (Context: A typical U.S. household uses about 908 kWh a month of electricity.). People in Hawaii pay the most for electricity, about 33 cents per kWh. A Hawaiian household whose electricity use was around the national average would have a monthly electric bill over $300.
A year ago, in January 2013, a KWH cost 12.9 cents. The increase in the price of a KWH from January 2013 to January 2014 was about 3.9 percent. During the year, the price of a KWH of electricity usually rises in the spring, peaks in summer, declines in fall, and is at its lowest point in winter. In 2013, the average price of a KWH in each of the 12 months of the year set a record for that particular month
Average residential rates by state ranged from 8.64 to 36.90 cents per kilowatt-hour (kwh). The national average was 12.56 cents per kwh. The map shows average residential rates by all investor-owned utilities by state. 
Residential electricity prices have risen from a national average of $0.0725 per kilowatt-hour at the start of 2001 to the aforementioned $0.1284 per kilowatt-hour in May 2014. That would be Hawaii. The state's electricity prices — the highest in the U.S. — are nearly three times higher than the national average of $0.1284 per kilowatt-hour. Hawaii's electricity price of $0.37 per kilowatt-hour equates to a $334 monthly electricity bill for the average consumer, according to calculations based on EIA data. That comes out to more than $4,000 per year spent on electricity
A kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour, or 3.6 megajoules. Energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example: a 100-watt (i.e. 0.1 kilowatt) light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800 W⋅h or 0.8 kW⋅h. If the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatt-hour, it would cost 0.1 kW × 8 h × $0.25/kW⋅h = $0.20. Whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatt-hours consumed, commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption (the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes).
