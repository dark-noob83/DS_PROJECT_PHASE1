SUMMARY: Mutations of the CASK gene are associated with X-linked mental retardation with microcephaly and disproportionate brain stem and cerebellar hypoplasia in females.
CASK-related intellectual disability, as its name suggests, is caused by mutations in the CASK gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK).
Mutations of the calcium / calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) gene have recently been associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) with microcephaly, optic atrophy and brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia, as well as with an X-linked syndrome having some FG-like features.
Mutations in the CASK gene (Xp11.4) have been reported to cause X-linked intellectual disability and brain malformation. The original patients characterized had severe intellectual disability, brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly.
Description. The CASK gene encodes a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase that is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family. MAGUKs are scaffolding proteins associated with intercellular junctions (summary by Atasoy et al., 2007). Cloning and Expression.
CASKMUTATION.org. The CASK gene mutation can result in a very broad spectrum, from letal to mildly or not affected.The effects of the mutation are dependent on genetic and epigenetic factors.
The CASK gene codes for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase. The CASK protein interacts with multiple other proteins and is thought to be involved in synaptic interaction, protein trafficking, and regulation of neural development.
