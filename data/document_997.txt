Dosage. The amount of Vitamin C needed for children is different than for adults. According to the Daily Recommended Intake on the Baylor College of Medicine website, kids between the ages of two and three need 15 mg of Vitamin C a day.
Children's vitamin C supplements come in tablet, chewable and liquid forms. As much as 6 percent of American children over 6 years old may be deficient in vitamin C, reported a 2012 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Vitamin C is water soluble, so any excess is flushed from the body in your child's urine. However, megadoses can still cause nausea, diarrhea, kidney stones, and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining). Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 400 mg of vitamin C a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 650 mg a day. Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.
For adults, the recommended dietary reference intake for vitamin C is 65 to 90 milligrams (mg) a day, and the upper limit is 2,000 mg a day. Although too much dietary vitamin C is unlikely to be harmful, megadoses of vitamin C supplements may cause: 1  Diarrhea. 2  Nausea. 3  Vomiting.
