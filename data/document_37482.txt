1 Experts say fish oil, which contains omega-3s, can help treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory conditions. 2  Studies have found that omega-3s can help people with rheumatoid arthritis lower their doses of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. 
RA Facts. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that affects one or more small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet. Flare-ups come and go, and the disease and worsening symptoms progress over time. 
Since rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, its inflammation can affect organs and areas of the body other than the joints. Inflammation of the glands of the eyes and mouth can cause dryness of these areas and is referred to as Sjogren's syndrome. Dryness of the eyes can lead to corneal abrasion. A. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis come and go, depending on the degree of tissue inflammation. When body tissues are inflamed, the disease is active. When tissue inflammation subsides, the disease is inactive (in remission). Remissions can occur spontaneously or with treatment and can last weeks, months, or years.
Some people take vitamins and mineral supplements that have been touted for arthritis relief, like calcium, or vitamins C, D, and E. Yet it is possible to go overboard and get too much of these or other nutrients — and that could be harmful. Too much iron can be toxic, causing symptoms like fatigue, joint pain, and depression. High-dose calcium supplements have been linked to an increased risk for heart disease as reported in a the National Institutes of Health-AARP diet and health study published in the JAMA Internal Medicine in 2013.
For people who have mild rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), appropriate supplements may alleviate symptoms while those who have moderate RA and OA may be able to lower their dose of conventional medicines. Research also suggests omega-3s may help arthritis patients lower their dose of NSAIDs. Scientists are exploring the effects of other supplements on arthritis pain, too, including borage seed oil and turmeric. However, the best dosages and possible long-term side effects of these supplements are largely unknown.
Rheumatoid arthritis, along with all other autoimmune diseases, is a byproduct of a weak immune system. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease, mainly characterized by inflammation of the lining of the joints. It can lead to long-term joint damage, resulting in chronic pain, loss of function and disability. Although rheumatoid arthritis can have many different symptoms, joints are always affected. Rheumatoid arthritis almost always affects the joints of the hands such as the knuckle joints, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and/or feet.

5 Replies. The most commonly deficient vitamins for people dealing with rheumatoid arthritis are vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate (vitamin B9), vitamin D, vitamin B12 and vitamin E. It is preferable to get these vitamins in your diet however if that is not possible then supplements can be used. 
Introduction. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease in which various joints in the body are inflamed, leading to swelling, pain, stiffness, and the possible loss of function. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks joints and other tissues. The pattern of joints affected is usually symmetrical, involves the hands and other joints, and is worse in the morning.
