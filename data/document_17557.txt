The Aiken Crater, located at the Northern end of the Basin, and the South Pole, located at the Southern end of the Basin gives it its official name; the South Pole-Aiken Basin[13].

Location and Details of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The South Pole-Aitken Basin is located at the southern pole of the far side of the Moon. The basin is approximately 2500 kilometers (about 1550 mi) in diameter and some 12 kilometers (about 7.5 mi) deep.
The Aitken Basin (also spelled Aiken Basin), is located near the south pole of the moon.

The basin is approximately 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) wide and 13 kilometers (just over eight miles) deep[11].
