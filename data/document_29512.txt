However, if it is a poem, article, short story, etc.. these are not physically able to sit on shelves, and in this case, you put them in quotations.

Best Answer: You italicize or underline titles of longer works, such as movie titles, book titles, longer poems (like The Odyssey), album names, etc. Use quotation marks for shorter works like short poems, chapters of a book, magazine articles, etc. Source(s): I'm an English teacher. lil_miss_education · 9 years ago.
If you use italics for one novel’s title, use italics for every novel’s title; don’t switch to quotation marks or underlining halfway through an article, or even in a different article of the same publication.
