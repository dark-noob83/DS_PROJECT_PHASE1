According to a 2015 analysis of CPS labor force participation data, the average retirement age* in 2013 was about 64 for men and about 62 for women, about the same as a decade ago. (p. 1, 3, fig. 5). *Average retirement age is defined as the age at which the labor force participation rate drops below 50 percent.
According to the 2015 EBRI Retirement Confidence Survey, the age at which workers plan to retire has crept upward over time. In particular, the percentage of workers who expect to retire after age 65 has increased, from 11 percent in 1991, to 19 percent in 2000, 24 percent in 2005, 33 percent in 2010,...
For example, someone who belongs to a demographic in which the average retirement age is 60 and has a life expectancy of 83 will need to plan to have enough money to last for at least 23 years of life after retirement.
But that may not happen, a new study suggests. A study of Shell Oil employees shows that people who retire at age 55 and live to be at least 65 die sooner than people who retire at 65. After age 65, the early retirees have a 37% higher risk of death than counterparts that retired at 65. That's not all. People who retire at 55 are 89% more likely to die in the 10 years after retirement than thos
Waiting until age 60 or older to retire appeared to make little difference in the risk of death. Mortality did not differ for the first five years after retirement at 60 compared with continuing to work at 60, the researchers reported (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI, 0.82-1.31).
Interestingly, the researchers discovered that during the first five years of retirement, the mortality rate for employees who retired at age 60 was similar to that of those who retired at age 65 (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22).
During the same period, male life expectancy has increased significantly by almost 10 years, from 65.47 years in 1950 to 75.2 years in 2005 (data from CDC). As a result of those two trends, the average expected time in retirement for men has increased from 0 in 1950 to 13.5 years in 2005. Comments: 1.
