Share. In advance of Tuesday's release of the new 2015 U.S. News & World Report Law School Rankings: here is a spreadsheet of the 202 ABA-accredited law schools by median LSAT scores for the law school class entering in Fall 2013 (which counts 12.5% in the forthcoming rankings).
LSAT scores range from 120 to 180 — 120 is the lowest, 180 the highest. According to the FNBC blog, a good LSAT score is 160 or higher. They also mention that as part of your LSAT score, you’ll see a percentile rank that lets you know what percentage of test takers in the last five years scored below you.
Each question in the various test sections is weighed equally. A good LSAT score is a score that would likely be acceptable by the majority of law schools. The average LSAT score is 150 and puts the student in the 50th percentile. Generally a score of about 160 is acceptable to most law schools. However, for the top-tiered law schools, the LSAT score must be at least 171, or in the 98th percentile, for the student’s application to be competitive. For example, for 2010-2011 LSAT re-takers who originally scored 145, 65.1% percent saw a score increase, but the increase was on average only 2.4 points, while 28.2% of these re-takers had a decrease in score. Furthermore, different schools take different approaches as to how they factor multiple test scores
What's a good LSAT score? Funny you should ask. Your LSAT score can range anywhere from a 120 (low) to a 180 (killer). Even though the average LSAT score is approximately a 150, you'll have to do much better than that to get into one of the top 15 law schools in the country! Before you complete your LSAT registration, see below for the low and high ranges of LSAT scores for admittance into some top law schools around the country.
Let’s take a look at the LSAT and GPA scores for the top five law schools in the country as determined by the Gourman Report. —. 1  Harvard — LSAT 170 – 176, GPA 3.74 – 3.95. 2  Yale — LSAT – 169 – 177. According to the FNBC blog, a good LSAT score is 160 or higher. They also mention that as part of your LSAT score, you’ll see a percentile rank that lets you know what percentage of test takers in the last five years scored below you.
A perfect example of this is Yale’s 173 Median LSAT score. This median score is an approximation of what it takes to get into the school with a balanced resume and admissions application but with a 176 LSAT score you would have about a 40 percent chance of admission to Yale Law. It’s not difficult to find the median LSAT score of the school you desire; generally speaking a top tier school (ranked #1-50) outside of the T14 (Top 14 schools) will have a median LSAT score of above 162. In the Top 14 schools (and thereabout) you can expect to be required to have a Median LSAT score of above 168
