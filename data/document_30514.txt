This page allows calculation of one degree of latitude and longitude. Lengths are calculated in nautical miles, statute miles, feet, and meters.
Each degree of latitude is approximately 69 miles (111 kilometers) apart. The range varies (due to the earth's slightly ellipsoid shape) from 68.703 miles (110.567 km) at the equator to 69.407 (111.699 km) at the poles. This is convenient because each minute (1/60th of a degree) is approximately one mile. A degree of longitude is widest at the equator at 69.172 miles (111.321) and gradually shrinks to zero at the poles. At 40Â° north or south the distance between a degree of longitude is 53 miles (85 km).
The number of kilometers per degree of longitude is approximately. where theta is the latitude in degrees and r_earth is approximately 6378 km. The number of kilometers per degree of latitude is approximately the same at all locations, approx.
AT LATITUDE 40 DEGREES (NORTH OR SOUTH)One degree of latitude = 111.03 km or 68.99 miOne minute of latitude = 1.85 km or 1.15 mi.One degree of longitude = 85.39 km or 53.06 miOne minute of longitude = 1.42 km or .88 miOne second of longitude = 23.72 m or 77.82 ft.
This calculator requires the use of Javascript enabled and capable browsers. This script will calculate the length of one degree of both latitude and longitude, for a specific latitude. Lengths for both are calculated in nautical miles, statute miles, feet, and meters. Enter the specific latitude. Click on Calculate.
