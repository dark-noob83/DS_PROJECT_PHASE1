Parabolic antennas are also classified by the type of feed, that is, how the radio waves are supplied to the antenna: 1  Axial or front feed – This is the most common type of feed, with the feed antenna located in front of the dish at the focus, on the beam axis, pointed back toward the dish. An advantage of parabolic antennas is that most of the structure of the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a wide range of frequencies, that is a wide bandwidth.
1 High directivity: As with the gain, so too the parabolic reflector or dish antenna is able to provide high levels of directivity. 2  The higher the gain, the narrower the beamwidth. Parabolic reflector antenna applications. There are many areas in which the parabolic / dish antenna may be used. Its performance enables it to be used almost exclusively in some areas. 1  Direct broadcast television: Direct broadcast or satellite television has become a major form of distribution for television material.
A parabolic antenna is an antenna that uses a parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. Design. The operating principle of a parabolic antenna is that a point source of radio waves at the focal point in front of a parabolic reflector of conductive material will be reflected into a collimated plane wave beam along the axis of the reflector.
The parabolic dish antenna is the form most frequently used in the radar engineering of installed antenna types of. Figure 1 illustrates the parabolic antenna. A dish antenna consists of one circular parabolic reflector and a point source situated in the focal point of this reflector. This point source is called “primary feed” or “feed”. The circular parabolic (paraboloid) reflector is constructed of metal, usually a frame covered by metal mesh at the inner side

The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is that it has high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. An advantage of parabolic antennas is that most of the structure of the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a wide range of frequencies, that is a wide bandwidth.
Circular paraboloid. A parabolic (or paraboloid or paraboloidal) reflector (or dish or mirror) is a reflective surface used to collect or project energy such as light, sound, or radio waves. Its shape is part of a circular paraboloid, that is, the surface generated by a parabola revolving around its axis. The parabolic reflector transforms an incoming plane wave traveling along the axis into a spherical wave converging toward the focus. The parabolic reflector functions due to the geometric properties of the paraboloidal shape: any incoming ray that is parallel to the axis of the dish will be reflected to a central point, or  focus .
Parabolic antennas are also classified by the type of feed, that is, how the radio waves are supplied to the antenna: Axial or front feed-This is the most common type of feed, with the feed antenna located in front of the dish at the focus, on the beam axis. A disadvantage of this type is that the feed and its supports block some of the beam, which limits the aperture efficiency to only 55 - 60%. Parabolic reflector. Design. The operating principle of a parabolic antenna is that a point source of radio waves at the focal point in front of a parabolic reflector of conductive material will be reflected into a collimated plane wave beam along the axis of the
1 High gain: Parabolic reflector antennas are able to provide very high levels of gain. 2  The larger the 'dish' in terms of wavelengths, the higher the gain. 3  High directivity: As with the gain, so too the parabolic reflector or dish antenna is able to provide high levels of directivity.
