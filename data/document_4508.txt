4. Plant sumac seeds directly outside in autumn. Select a spot in sun or partial sun with well-draining soil. Plant each seed at a depth of 1/3 to 3/4 inches, about 8 inches apart. Water well after planting.
Germinating the Seeds. To germinate staghorn sumac seeds place them in a warm room away from direct sunlight. Regularly mist the soil in the pot with a spray bottle to keep it moist. After germination, remove the plastic wrap and position the pot in a sunny window so the seedlings can grow.
Soak the seeds in hot water. Place the sumac seeds in a cup. Pour enough water into a pot so that it measures roughly five times the volume of the seeds. Heat the water on the stove until it reaches 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour the heated water over
Place them in the refrigerator for 30 days at a temperature of about 41 degrees Fahrenheit. Plant sumac seeds directly outside in autumn. Select a spot in sun or partial sun with well-draining soil. Plant each seed at a depth of 1/3 to 3/4 inches, about 8 inches apart. Water well after planting.
Sowing the Seeds. Staghorn sumac seeds are ready for sowing after the cold treatment. Fill a pot with moist seed-starting mix up to 1/2 inch from the top. Tamp down the soil and evenly spread the seeds over the soil. Sprinkle a 1/8-inch layer of seed-starting mix over the seeds.
Plant the staghorn sumac seed in spring after all threat of frost has passed. Plant each seed 1/2-inch deep. Plant neighbouring seeds 1 inch apart. Since staghorn sumac has such low germination rates, plant your entire supply of seed, or up to 100 seeds per square foot of seed bed.
