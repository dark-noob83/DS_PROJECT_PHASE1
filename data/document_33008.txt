I want to paint my engine before reinstalling it in my truck. If I am correct the color for the 1958 235 Apache engine is a gray valve cover, block and oil pan. Many of the remaining components are black with the oil bath air cleaner bowl being red.
The PA 23-150 Apache hit the market in 1954, evolved to 160-hp engines in 1957, then leaped to 235 hp per side as simply a lower-powered version of its offspring, the 250-hp Aztec, which had debuted in 1960. The last year of Apache production was 1965, for the Aztec had stolen its thunder.
GROSS WEIGHT INCREASE A computer assisted engineering study has culminated in an STC allowing Diamond Aire to increase the maximum gross weight of the Piper PA23 (150 HP Apache) Geronimos, from 3684 pounds to 4000 pounds. Down time 2 weeks.
This modification does more for performance and aesthetics than any other mod except the 180 HP engine conversion. Airspeed is increased by ten to twelve mph. Rate of climb, single engine performance, CG stability and cabin ventilation are substantially increased. Modifications are made of impact resistant fiberglass.
Lighter weight props with dynafocal engine mounts reduces noise and vibration which results in lower operating costs, more comfort and increased performance. Optional Q-Tip Props reduce sound levels by five DB and slightly increase climb speed.
