That outlet is called a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). It's there to protect people from electrical shock, so it is completely different from a fuse. The question on appliance plugs talks about fuses. The idea behind a fuse is to protect a house from an electrical fire.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A GFCI receptacle. A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) or Residual Current Device (RCD) is a device that shuts off an electric power circuit when it detects that current is flowing along an unintended path, such as through water or a person.
A GFCI is a ground fault circuit interrupter. A ground fault circuit interrupter is an inexpensive electrical device that, if installed in household branch circuits, could prevent over two-thirds of the approximately 300 electrocutions still occurring each year in and around the home.
A GFCI, or ground fault circuit interrupter, is a device designed to prevent accidental electrocutions, particularly in high-risk areas with flowing water such as bathrooms or kitchens.
Ground Fault Interrupter. Ground fault interrupters are designed to protect from electrical shock by interrupting a household circuit when there is a difference in the currents in the hot and neutral wires. Such a difference indicates that an abnormal diversion of current from the hot wire is occuring.
A ground fault circuit interrupter, called a GFCI or GFI, is an inexpensive electrical device that can either be installed in your electrical system or built into a power cord to protect you from severe electrical shocks. GFCIs have played a key role in reducing electrocutions.
