The Earth's atmosphere stretches from the ground to about 300 miles up, although it is only breathable up to about 30,000 feet (6 miles). The actual atmosphere extends hundreds of miles more into space (the exosphere), but becomes so thin that it is essentially non-existent.
View full size image. Earth's atmosphere is about 300 miles (480 kilometers) thick, but most of it is within 10 miles (16 km) the surface. Air pressure decreases with altitude. At sea level, air pressure is about 14.7 pounds per square inch (1 kilogram per square centimeter).
Most of the earth's atmosphere (80 to 90%) is found in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer where we live. This layer, where the earth's weather occurs, is within about 12 km (7 miles) of the earth's surface. The stratosphere goes up to about 53 km (29 miles).
The Stratosphere is located 10-45 miles up. However a part of Earth's atmosphere called the Ionosphere starts at about 100 miles above the earth, extending to approx. 600 miles above the Earth. So if you truly wanted to be clear of the Earth's atmosphere in its entirety, go beyond 600 miles to touch true space.
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere starts at Earth's surface and goes up to a height of 7 to 20 km (4 to 12 miles, or 23,000 to 65,000 feet) above sea level. Most of the mass (about 75-80%) of the atmosphere is in the troposphere. Almost all weather occurs within this layer.
