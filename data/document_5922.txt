Photo: Herbert Gustafson. Ring-tailed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups of about 11 to 17 animals but which range in size from six to 35 at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve and four to 31 at Berenty Private Reserve (Sussman 1991; Hood & Jolly 1995; Sauthers pers. comm.).
Ring-tailed lemurs can be found in the dry woodlands of southwestern Madagascar. They live together in social groups of up to about 25 lemurs and are very territorial. A group s range can be as small as around 15 acres and as large as 60. Ring-tailed lemurs mark their territory with scents produced in glands in their wrists. They will often fiercely defend their territories from other groups.
Ring-tailed lemurs exhibit female philopatry and the core of the social group is the dominant matriline (Jolly 2003). Because females almost always remain in their natal groups while males emigrate into a new group, ring-tailed lemur social groups are centered around a group of related adult females and their offspring.
Male and female ring-tailed lemurs are similar physically. They are roughly the same size, measuring about 42.5 cm (1.4 ft.) from head to rump and weighing roughly 2.25 kg (5 lb.). Highly social creatures, ring-tailed lemurs live in groups averaging 17 members. Their society is female-dominant, and a group will often contain multiple breeding females. Females reproduce starting at 3 years of age, generally giving birth to one baby a year.
Distribution and Habitat. Ring-tailed lemurs are found in the southwest portion of Madagascar. They live in arid, open areas and forests. Ring-tailed lemurs live in territories that range from 15 to 57 acres (0.06 to 0.2 km 2) in size.
The social structure of the Lemur is very interesting. They live in small groups that move around with each other. These family groups have females that are dominate over the males. It can be very difficult to tell the difference between the males and the females.
