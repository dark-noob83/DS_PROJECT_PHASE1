Host Blake continues the Blog Series for Outlander Cast! Today's choice is An Open & Honest Letter To Starz by Blake Larsen. Dear STARZ-You need to wake up. It's time to evolve. I don't mean the way you say to your little brother when he puts your panties on his head and runs around the house.
'Outlander' cast lives in the past-and the far past. Time travel is a tricky business. Caitriona Balfe can vouch for that, playing a woman who is transported 200 years into the past in Starz' 'Outlander,' which is based on Diana Gabaldon's book series. Post to Facebook.
Outlander Cast: The Outlander Podcast with Mary and Blake shared Diana Gabaldon's post.
Weber, who will appear in most of the France-set episodes, is a French actor whose credits include the Tom Fontana-created Canal+ series Borgia and Agatha Christie: Poirot. Cavanah is a Scottish actor who has appeared on Hatfields & McCoys and the British series Eastenders and Doctors.
