1 A salt is soluble if it dissolves in water to give a solution with a concentration of at least 0.1 moles per liter at room temperature. 2  A salt is insoluble if the concentration of an aqueous solution is less than 0.001 M at room temperature. 3  Slightly soluble salts give solutions that fall between these extremes.
Insoluble Salts. An insoluble salt is a salt that not dissolves in water at room temperature. Insoluble salts in water include: (a) all carbonates except ammonium carbonate [(NH4)2CO3], sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3).
If an insoluble salt forms by the reaction of soluble substances in water and falls out of solution, we call it a precipitate (see image). Common insoluble (sparingly soluble) salts are carbonates, hydroxides, sulfates, and sulfides. Sodium hydroxide is added to cobalt (II) nitrate. The reaction produces sodium nitrate (soluble) and cobalt (II) hydroxide, which is only sparingly soluble. The cobalt (II) hydroxide forms a dark precipitate.
Search the Dictionary. Many ionic metal compounds are insoluble in water. We call these compounds insoluble salts, although, as we shall see, it is usually better to describe them as sparingly soluble salts. Calcium carbonate, copper (I) chloride, and lead sulfide are examples of such salts.
The first soluble solution will contain cation (metal ion) for the insoluble salt while the second soluble solution will contain anion (nonmetal ion) for the wanted insoluble salt. The double decomposition reaction means the reaction two aqueous solutions are mixed to formed an insoluble as well as
