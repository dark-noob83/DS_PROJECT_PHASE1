A male duck is called a ‘drake’, you can identify the male duck by its brightly coloured feathers. They use these coloured feathers to attract the female ducks for mating. Here is a beautifully coloured Drake with a purple plumage, shiny green head colouring, silvery white body and grey wings with blue markings.
The Short Answer: The short answer is that the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) males (drakes) are forcing the female mallard to mate with them. And for the reasons discussed below, forced copulation is far more common in waterfowl (ducks, geese, swans) than in other types of birds.
The female ducks will then lead the male ducks to their breeding ground in spring. The breeding ground will usually be the place where the female duck was hatched. The female duck builds her nest with grass or reeds or even in a hole in a tree. The male duck will guard their territory by chasing away other couples.
Mallard ducks average around 20 to 26 in length and can weigh 2 to 3 lbs. The male is known as a drake and the female is called a hen; the flocks are called sords when they are in flight. They are common in North American, Europe and Asia. The ubiquitous mallard is capable of cross-breeding with many other species. They are also the ancestor of most domestic ducks.
Description The mallard is a large, dabbling duck with broad wings. The male’s (drake) dis-tinctive green head and brown chest are separated by a white neck-ring, contrastedby gray sides, a brown back, and a black rump.
The Mallard Duck is the most common of the North American Ducks. The male has a bright green head, white neck band, rusty breast, pale grey body and a violet blue speculum bordered in white. He has black central tail feathers which curl up (“Duck Tail”). His beak is yellow and his legs are orange.
