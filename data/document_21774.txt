Definition of NITRIDE. : a binary compound of nitrogen with a more electropositive element.
Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) is a relatively new member of the advanced ceramics family, having been developed in the 1960’s. It is used in many varied applications, but lends itself particularly to applications where high temperatures are involved.
Noun. 1. nitride-a compound containing nitrogen and a more electropositive element (such as phosphorus or a metal). chemical compound, compound - (chemistry) a substance formed by chemical union of two or more elements or ingredients in definite proportion by weight. magnesium nitride-a nitride containing nitrogen and magnesium.
What You Should Know. BLACKNITRIDE™, or Ferritic Nitrocarburizing, is the thermochemical that simultaneously diffuses nitrogen and carbon into the surface of ferrous metals. During the process, a two-part surface layer is formed, an outer iron nitride layer with a nitrogen diffusion layer below it. During this treatment, nitrogen and carbon are absorbed by and diffused into the surface of the metal.
Silicon nitride is a man made compound synthesized through several different chemical reaction methods. Parts are pressed and sintered by well developed methods to produce a ceramic with a unique set of outstanding properties.
nitride. (nī′trīd′). n. Trivalent nitrogen, or a compound of nitrogen, especially a binary compound of nitrogen with a more electropositive element.
