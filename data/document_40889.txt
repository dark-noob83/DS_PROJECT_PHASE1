Group B strep is not a sexually transmitted disease (STD) . The bacteria that causes group B strep normally lives in the intestines, vagina, or rectum, and approximately 25% of all healthy women carry group B strep bacteria. For most women there are no symptoms of carrying the GBS bacteria.
Also known as GBS or baby strep, group B strep disease in newborns most commonly causes sepsis (infection of the blood), pneumonia (infection in the lungs), and sometimes meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining around the brain).

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacterial infection that can be found in a pregnant womanâ€™s vagina or rectum. This bacteria is normally found in the vagina and/or rectum of about 25% of all healthy, adult women. Women who test positive for GBS are said to be colonized.

For most women there are no symptoms of carrying the GBS bacteria.
GBS bacteria are a normal part of the commonly found bacteria in the human body. Normally, the presence of GBS does not cause problems. In certain circumstances, however, Group B Strep bacteria can invade the body and cause serious infection; this is referred to as Group B Strep disease. Group B Strep should not be confused with Group A Strep, which causes strep throat. A person whose body carries Group B Strep bacteria but who does not show signs of infection is said to be colonized with Group B Strep.
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacteria that is found in the lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy adults and in the vagina and/or lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy, adult women.

A person whose body carries Group B Strep bacteria but who does not show signs of infection is said to be colonized with Group B Strep. GBS colonization is not contagious
Group B Strep Infection Cause. Group B strep infections are caused by bacteria from the species and genus Streptococcus agalactiae. Streptococci were divided into groups in 1933 by mixing the strains with antibodies that were produced in rabbits. Group B strep is a cause of infection in pregnant women.
