Avascular tissue is that which does not contain blood vessels or lymphatics. Examples include: The epithelial layer of the skin, cartilage, and the cornea and lens of … the eye. There are some types of connective tissue that are composed of elastic fibers that are avascular, too.
a·vas·cu·lar. Without blood or lymphatic vessels. without a blood supply. avascular necrosis death of tissue due to lack of blood supply, usually referring to bone, following injury. Other causes in bone include hyperbaric exposure (diving), excessive intake of corticosteroids or alcohol, and some diseases.
Avascular Necrosis. Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a disorder resulting from a temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to the bone. Blood carries essential nutrients and oxygen to the bones. When the blood supply is disrupted (avascular), the bone tissues begin to break down (necrosis).

Unlike bone and all other connective tissue types, cartilage is avascular, lacking blood vessels. For this reason alone, cartilage does not possess the regenerative capacity of bone or the other connective tissue types. Remember, nutrient delivery is essential for tissue repair.

Connective tissue may or may not be avascular-it depends on the composition of the connective tissue. Avascular tissue is any tissue that does not contain blood vessels or lymphatics. Examples include epithelial tissue layers and the cornea.
Avascular necrosis is the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply. Also called osteonecrosis, avascular necrosis can lead to tiny breaks in the bone and the bone's eventual collapse. The blood flow to a section of bone can be interrupted if the bone is fractured or the joint becomes dislocated.
