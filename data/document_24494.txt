Japanese Castle Architecture covers the design,construction and key buildings within Japanese Castles. Japanese castles came to be built in a variety of environments, but all were constructed within variations of a fairly well-defined architectural scheme.
Architecture. The distinctive feature of a traditional Japanese building is the way in which the house is open to nature. The main materials used are wood, earth, and paper, and the construction spreads out sideways rather than upwards.
The earliest Japanese architecture was seen in prehistoric times in simple pit-houses and stores that were adapted to a hunter-gatherer population. Influence from Han Dynasty China via Korea saw the introduction of more complex grain stores and ceremonial burial chambers.
Himeji Castle, also called Shirasagijo (White Heron Castle) due to its white outer walls, is the best preserved castle in all of Japan. It serves as a classic example of Japanese castle architecture, having been designated a national treasure in 1931.
The rich tradition of Japanese architecture is best exemplified by the sacral buildings, such as Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. The Ise Shrine is probably the most well known of the Shinto shrines. Its typical features are columns made from cypress and the traditional thatched roof.
Japanese Architecture. Japanese architecture has a very long history. It is considered to have begun in the fifth century BC. Some evidences of prehistoric architecture from this time has survived in the form of terra-cotta houses and pit houses built by the Japanese neolithic tribe, known as Jomon.
Japanese architecture (日本建築, Nihon kenchiku) has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.
