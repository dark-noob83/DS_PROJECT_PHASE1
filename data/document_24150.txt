The main function of the tricuspid valve is to prevent back flow of  the blood into the right atrium. The structure consists of 3  leaflets and 3 papillary muscles. the tricuspid valve is a valve so the flow of blood does not go backwards through the heart. It is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle in the heart. You c … an pull up a picture in google of the lableing of the heart and can see the tricuspid valve in the heart. 2 people found this useful.
As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the pulmonary valve opens. The closure of the tricuspid valve prevents blood from backing into the right atrium and the opening of the pulmonary valve allows the blood to flow into the pulmonary artery toward the lungs. Left Ventricle. Left Ventricle: The left ventricle receives oxygenated blood as the left atrium contracts. The closure of the mitral valve prevents blood from backing into the left atrium and the opening of the aortic valve allows the blood to flow into the aorta and flow throughout the body. Aortic Valve. Aortic Valve: The aortic valve separates the left ventricle from the aorta.
The tricuspid valve prevents back flow of blood into the right atrium. This valve is weakened by drug abuse. The back flow of blood is also known as regression or tricuspid regurgitation. The tricuspid valve can be affected by rheumatic fever, which can cause tricuspid stenosis or tricuspid insufficiency (also called tricuspid regurgitation). Some patients are born with congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve.
The tricuspid valve, or right atrioventricular valve, is on the right dorsal side of the mammalian heart, between the right atrium and the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve can be affected by rheumatic fever, which can cause tricuspid stenosis or tricuspid insufficiency (also called tricuspid regurgitation). Some patients are born with congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve.

Use a probe or your finger and see that they lead to the left atrium. 22. In the space below, explain the function of the pulmonary veins. 23.

For the type of tooth, see dental anatomy. The tricuspid valve, or right atrioventricular valve, is on the right dorsal side of the mammalian heart, between the right atrium and the right ventricle. The function of the valve is to prevent back flow of blood into the right atrium. The tricuspid valve can be affected by rheumatic fever, which can cause tricuspid stenosis or tricuspid insufficiency (also called tricuspid regurgitation).

The four heart valves include: Click image to enlarge. Tricuspid valve. This valve is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. Pulmonary valve. The pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Mitral valve. This valve is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Aortic valve. When the left ventricle relaxes, the aortic valve closes and the mitral valve opens, to allow blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The left atrium contracts, allowing even more blood to flow
