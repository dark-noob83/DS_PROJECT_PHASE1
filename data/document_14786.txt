What is the current if 0.25c of charge pass through a point in a circuit in 0.5 seconds? If 0.25 coulombs of charge passes through a point in a circuit in 0.5 seconds, then the current is 0.5 amperes. Current is coulombs per second, so divide 0.25 by 0.5 to get 0. … 5. BJ Sullivan.
1 When a voltage source is connected to a circuit, the voltage will cause a uniform flow of electrons through that circuit called a current. 2  In a single (one loop) circuit, the amount of current at any point is the same as the amount of current at any other point. 1 In a single (one loop) circuit, the amount of current at any point is the same as the amount of current at any other point. 2  If a circuit containing a voltage source is broken, the full voltage of that source will appear across the points of the break. 3  The +/- orientation of a voltage drop is called the polarity.
Answer: D. In a series circuit, the current is the same at each resistor. If the light bulbs are identical, then the resistance is the same for each resistor. The voltage drop (I•R) will be the same for each resistor since the current at and the resistance of each resistor is the same. The current in a series circuit is the same at each resistor present in the circuit. Since each light bulb has the same resistance (identical bulbs) and the same current, they will have the same power output (P = I 2 R as discussed in the previous Lesson).
In a series circuit, the current through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component. 
The movement of this charge round a circuit is called the electric current. Electric current is the rate of flow of charge round a circuit. The current at a point in the circuit is the amount of charge that passes that point in one second. Electric current is measured in AMPERES (AMPS, symbol A). A current of 1 A is flowing in a circuit if a charge of 1 coulomb passes any point in the circuit every second. 
Current. The transfer of charge (i.e. moving charge) is called current. More specifically electric current is the rate of flow of charge i.e. the amount of charge passing a given point in a circuit each second. The unit of current is the Ampere (A) and 1 Amp is therefore 1 Coulomb of charge passing each second. 1 A = 1 C / s.
What is the current if 0.25c of charge pass through a point in a circuit in 0.5 seconds? If 0.25 coulombs of charge passes through a point in a circuit in 0.5 seconds, then the current is 0.5 amperes. Current is coulombs per second, so divide 0.25 by 0.5 to get 0. … 5. Answered.
So a current of 0.583333 A means 0.583333 Coulombs of charge pass through that point every second. How many Coulombs will therefore pass that point in 12 minutes? Well it is 0.58333 times the number of seconds in 12 minutes, which is 12 x 60 = 720. 
The amount of charge passing any point in the circuit in 2.00 seconds is(1) 1.26 × 10 19 C (3) 2.52 × 10 19 C(2) 2.00 C (4) 4.00 C39. A 20.-ohm resistor has 40. coulombs passing through it in 5.0 seconds.
