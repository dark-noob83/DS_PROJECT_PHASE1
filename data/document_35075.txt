Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that, like Earth, it is a rocky body. In size and mass, it is similar to Earth, and is often described as Earth's sister or twin. The diameter of Venus is 12,092 km (only 650 km less than Earth's) and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because of its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's sister planet because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.
Confidence votes 72. Venus and Earth have sort of the same size. That is why Venus is also known as the Earth's twin sister. But actually, Venus' diameter is 12,104 km, while Earth's is 12,756 kilometers. So, there's little difference, but Venus is a bit smaller. It is slightly smaller than Earth. The diameter of Venus is about 0.949 times that of Earth. 
In comparison, Mount Everest is only 5.4 miles (8.8 km) above Earth's sea level. Ishtar Terra is about the size of Australia, and contains the four mountain ranges of Venus, providing potential evidence that the planet's surface may be in motion. Aphrodite Terra lies just to the south of the equator. Venus is a rocky, terrestrial planet like Earth, and likely formed the same way at the same time. It has a mass of 4.87 trillion trillion kilograms, about 82 percent that of its sister planet. Like its size, its density is comparable to Earth at 5.243 grams per cubic centimeter.
Venus has a diameter that is about 95% of Earth’s. It is 12,100 km across. The Venusian surface area is around 90% of our own at 4.6×10 8 km 2. The planet has a volume of 9.38×10 11 km 3. That puts it a little over 85% of Earth’s volume. One final way to measure the size of Venus is to consider its mass.
1 Venus is sometimes called Earth’s sister planet. 2  This is because their size is very similar (there is only a 638 km different in diameter) and Venus has around 81% of Earth’s mass. 3  They are also similarly located with Venus being the closest planet to Earth. 1 One day on Venus is longer than one year. 2  Due to the slow rotation on its axis, it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one rotation. 3  The orbit of the planet takes 225 Earth-days – making a year on Venus shorter on day on Venus.
Often called Earth's sister planet, Venus is the closest in size, with a mass of more than 80 percent that of our planet and a diameter of only a few miles less. It is also the closest planet to our own in terms of location. Venus is a rocky, terrestrial planet like Earth, and likely formed the same way at the same time. It has a mass of 4.87 trillion trillion kilograms, about 82 percent that of its sister planet. Like its size, its density is comparable to Earth at 5.243 grams per cubic centimeter.
It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis. The planet’s orbit around the Sun takes 225 Earth days, compared to the Earth’s 365. Venus is often called the Earth’s sister planet: The Earth and Venus are very similar in size with only a 638 km difference in diameter, Venus having 81.5% of the Earth’s mass. Both also have a central core, a molten mantle and a crust.
Venus and Earth Compared Venus, the second planet from the Sun, lies, on average, 108 million km from the Sun, about 30% closer than the Earth. Venus is often referred to as our sister planet because of similarities in size, mass, density and volume. 
Saturn is one of the gassy planets and is huge compared to the size of Earth. Saturn has a diameter of 120,536km much bigger than Earth. Earth, however only has a diameter of … 12,756km. If you were smart enough you would work out Saturn is 9.45 x Earth. 
Density, mass, and volume. Venus is a rocky, terrestrial planet like Earth, and likely formed the same way at the same time. It has a mass of 4.87 trillion trillion kilograms, about 82 percent that of its sister planet. Like its size, its density is comparable to Earth at 5.243 grams per cubic centimeter.
