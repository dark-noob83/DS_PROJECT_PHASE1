The lac operon is involved with the breakdown of lactose to use as a food source. The trp operon produces products that are used to manufacture an amino acid, tryptophan. The pathway controlled by the trp operon is an example of an anabolic pathway. The lac operon controls a catabolic pathway, one that breaks down complex molecules to release energy for biological work. The lac operon is controlled both by the abundance of its substrate, lactose, and by the abundance of glucose, an alternative to glucose. As there is no alternative to tryptophan the control of the trp operon is less complex than that of the lac operon.
The tryptophan (trp) operon in E. coli is a negative control repressible system. It’s negative control because the system produces a repressor which functions to turn off the operon. It’s repressible because, unlike the lac operon, repression occurs when a critical substance is abundant in the cell. This means that the cell only metabolizes lactose if glucose is low and lactose is plentiful. The cell uses a negative control system (the lac operon) to respond to the availability of lactose in the environment. Negative control. means that it’s a system in which the active substance acts to turn off function.
The trp operon is an operon — a group of genes that are used, or transcribed, together — that codes for the components for production of tryptophan. The trp operon is present in many bacteria, but was first characterized in Escherichia coli. In the lac operon, allolactose binds to the repressor protein, allowing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein effectively blocking gene transcription.
lac operon (lactose operon) is an operon required for the transport and metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coli and many other enteric bacteria. Although glucose is the preferred carbon source for most bacteria, the lac operon allows for the effective digestion of lactose when glucose is not available. The protein that is formed by the lacI gene is known as the lac repressor. The type of regulation that the lac operon undergoes is referred to as negative inducible, meaning that the gene is turned off by the regulatory factor (lac repressor) unless some molecule (lactose) is added.
The genes encoding these are clustered together in a single operon with its own promoter and operator. In this case, however, the presence of tryptophan in the cell shuts down the operon. When Trp is present, it binds to a site on the Trp repressor and enables the Trp repressor to bind to the operator. In the absence of lactose, the repressor protein encoded by the I gene binds to the lac operator and prevents transcription. Binding of allolactose to the repressor causes it to leave the operator. This enables RNA polymerase to transcribe the three genes of the operon

The lac operon regulates expression of the three lac genes by regulating the efficiency of that process. Negative Control of Transcription: Immediately upstream of the three lac genes is a fourth gene which is responsible for negative regulation of the operon. This gene expresses a protein called the lac repressor. The repressor can bind to a short sequence of the lac promoter. At the 5' end of the lac operon is a promoter. The promoter is the site where RNA polymerase binds to DNA to initiate transcription. The amount of mRNA produced from a given operon depends on the efficiency of promoter recognition.
