Our Planets Radius and Diameter. If we where to start at the equator and go around, the Earth’s equatorial diameter is 7,926 miles or 12,756 kilometers. (in 1980 a B-52 plane took 47 hours to fly around the planet, it was refueled in flight. The average speed of a plane is about 550 mph).
The planet's rotation causes it to bulge at the equator. Earth's equatorial diameter is 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers), but from pole to pole, the diameter is 7,900 miles (12,720 km) — a difference of only 40 miles (64 km).
It contains 99.86% of all of the mass of the entire Solar System. The Sun is 864,400 miles (1,391,000 kilometers) across. This is about 109 times the diameter of Earth. The Sun weighs about 333,000 times as much as Earth. It is so large that about 1,300,000 planet Earths can fit inside of it. Earth is about the size of an average sunspot! 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos.
Earth's circumference (the distance all the way around the equator) is 24,901 miles (40,075 kilometers). Its diameter (the distance from one side to the other through Earth's center) is 7,926 miles (about 12,756 kilometers). Earth is slightly smaller when measured between the North and South Poles which gives a diameter of 7,907 miles (12,725 kilometers). Earth bulges out a bit more around the equator than around the poles because of its rotation (spin).
The circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 kilometers or 24,900 miles. This refers to how big the Earth is around it’s fattest middle part, like if you were to measure the length of a string going around the center of the Earth at the equator.
