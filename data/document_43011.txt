Some of the most common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, lupus, Hashimoto’s thyroid disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, and asthma.
Autoimmune diseases and digestive related problems (Crohn’s disease, Celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, IBD, IBS, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial cystitis, multiple sclerosis) can be very debilitating and can take over your whole life.
Most people have never heard about a protein called vinculin, but a recent study of 165 IBS, 30 IBD and 26 healthy controls found that people with IBS have higher levels of (auto) antibodies to this protein than do healthy controls or people with inflammatory bowel disease.
1 3. 2  IBS, as well as Crohns disease, leaky gutsyndrome, and colitis are not auto-immune diseases. 3  4. 4  The associated symptoms that peopleexperience with these disorders are a reactionof the immune system, but it is not the cause. 5  5.
Follow. IBS treatment should not be centered around treating an auto-immune disease. IBS, as well as Crohn's disease, leaky gut syndrome, and colitis are not auto-immune diseases. The associated symptoms that people experience with these disorders are a reaction of the immune system, but it is not the cause.

Irritable bowel syndrome* (IBS) is a “syndrome,” meaning a group of symptoms. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort often reported as cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and/or constipation.
From what I understand, IBS is currently not considered to be an autoimmune disease.The second part of your question, could an autoimmune disease cause IBS is a little trickier.
This leaky gut situation also causes digestive and intestinal problems. Candida overgrowth, Celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammable bowel disease (IBS), allergies, malabsorption and loads of other autoimmune diseases are all associated with a leaky gut. I think that dealing with leaky gut is the way to also deal with the other problems that are linked to it.
