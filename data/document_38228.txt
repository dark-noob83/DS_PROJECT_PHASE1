Voltage is another word for electrical potential difference. Potential difference between point A and B is also known as the voltage between point A and point B. It is also defined as the amount work to be done to move a unit charge (+1 Coulomb) from B to A. Voltage is measured in the unit Volts (V).
Potential Difference vs Voltage. Potential difference and voltage are two terms used in engineering to describe a difference of the potential in two points. Voltage is referred to electricity where potential difference can be related to electrical, magnetic and gravitational fields.
Voltage. Voltage is electric potential energy per unit charge, measured in joules per coulomb (= volts). It is often referred to as electric potential, which then must be distinguished from electric potential energy by noting that the potential is a per-unit-charge quantity.
2. Potential difference with respect to electric field is called as the voltage. 3. Voltage is measured in Volts (V) and unit of measuring potential difference is changed with the type of the energy field (V for electric, J/kg for gravitational etc).
The potential difference between two points in an electric circuit is the work done when a coulomb of charge passes between the points. You can calculate the size of a potential difference using this equation: V = W รท Q. 1  V is the potential difference in volts, V. 2  W is the work done (energy transferred) in joules, J.
1 Potential difference is the work done per unit charge. 2  A potential difference of 1 V means that 1 joule of work is done per coulomb of charge. ( 3 1 V = 1 J C -1) Potential difference in a circuit is measured using a voltmeter which is placed in parallel with the component of interest in the circuit.
A potential difference, also called voltage [voltage: The potential difference of a cell, electrical supply or electric component. It is measured in volts, 'V'.
