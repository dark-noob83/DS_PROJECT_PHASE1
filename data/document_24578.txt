Kittens grow up so quickly. The little ones seem to lose their baby teeth as rapidly as they get them. Your furry cutie's deciduous teeth -- her first teeth -- probably will begin falling out when the kitten is 12 weeks old. That's about the time the adult set starts emerging.
Kittens loose their baby teeth (called deciduous) at the age of 11 to 30 weeks. These teeth will be replaced by permanent teeth by the age of 6 months. Before losing their baby teeth, kittens experience sore gums and probably eat less that normally.
Losing kitten baby teeth is normal. Kittens are born with no teeth and their first set of teeth, called deciduous teeth appear at 2 weeks of age. Adult teeth usually arrive at around 8 to 10 months and teeth will stop growing once a kitten reaches adulthood. Symptoms.
Cats lose their deciduous or baby teeth from 11 to 30 weeks of age. During this time they may eat less because of sore gums. By the age of about 6 months, they have their permanent teeth.
Baby Teeth Loss. Kittens do indeed lose all of their 26 baby teeth, just like human children lose their baby teeth, the ASPCA indicates. A kitten generally starts losing teeth at 3 months, around the time her adult incisors begin to slowly grow in. The incisors are followed by adult molar, premolar and canine teeth.
