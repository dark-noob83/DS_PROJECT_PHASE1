Multiply this by the number of employees and again by the number of weeks that you operate annually. Step 2. Multiply your employees' hours by the labor rate, which is equivalent to the average employee wage. This gives your total, annual labor cost. Related Reading: Hourly Employees & Benefits. Step 3.

Labour costs. The average hourly labour cost in the EU-28 was estimated at EUR 24.60 in 2014 and at EUR 29.20 in the euro area (EA-18). However, this average masks significant differences between EU Member States, with hourly labour costs ranging between EUR 3.80 and EUR 40.30 (Figure 1). Labour costs are made up of costs for wages and salaries plus non-wage costs such as employers’ social contributions.
Divide the weekly payroll figure by your total weekly sales. If your restaurant brought in $28,157 and you spent $5,350 on labor, your labor cost percentage would be about 19 percent, or $5,350 divided by $28,157. For example, if your wait staff receives $2.50 per hour plus tips, and your servers work a total of 360 hours in a week, you incur $900 in payroll for your wait staff. If you pay cooks $10 hourly, and they work a total of 200 hours weekly, you pay $2,000 weekly to kitchen staff.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the average cook in a fast-food restaurant earned $9.04 an hour in 2013. [2] The SEIU’s push for $15 an hour would consequently raise fast-food wages by at least 66 percent. Paying $15 an hour would raise fast-food restaurants’ total costs by approximately 15 percent. [3]. Fast-food restaurants could not pay this additional amount out of their profits. The typical restaurant has a profit margin of just 3 percent before taxes. [4] That works out to approximately $27,000 a year [5] —less than the annual cost of hiring one full-time employee at $15 an hour.
This is the total amount you spent in a payroll cycle on labor and is your labor cost. For example, if a restaurant has payroll expenses of $4,000, plus $306 in FICA taxes, $600 for unemployment coverage and $444 in worker's compensation, its total labor cost is $5,350 for the period. Step 10. Measure your labor costs as a percentage of sales to ensure you’re not overstaffed. For example, if your wait staff receives $2.50 per hour plus tips, and your servers work a total of 360 hours in a week, you incur $900 in payroll for your wait staff. If you pay cooks $10 hourly, and they work a total of 200 hours weekly, you pay $2,000 weekly to kitchen staff.
