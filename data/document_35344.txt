The purpose of heat fixing the bacteria to the slide is so during  the gram staining procedure the bacteria doesn't wash off. If you  didn't heat fix the bacteria to the sli … de, it would not stay on the  slide.
It helps the cells adhere to the slide so that they can be stained. The purpose of heat fixing is to kill the organisms without serious distortion. They adhere better to the slide and also take up dye more easily.
In order to heat fix a bacterial smear, it is necessary to first let the bacterial sample air dry. Then either place the slide in the slide holder of a microincinerator, or pass the dried slide through the flame of a Bunsen burner 3 or 4 times, smear side facing up.
Heat fixation is the procedure used to adhere a bacterial smear to  a glass slide for viewing by a compound microscope. It denatures  the proteins on the surface of the bact … eria causing them to be  sticky.
1 Prepare a smear of Bacillus megaterium, allow the smear to dry and then heat-fix. 2  Place the slide on the staining rack in the sink and flood the smear with malachite green stain. 3  Heat the stain to steaming by passing a lit bunsen burner over the smear.

To heat fix a bacterial smear you would put the specimen on the  slide and either put slide on a slide warmer or over a Bunsen  burner for a few seconds. Heat fixing a bacte … rial smear does kill  the specimen but it makes the bacteria stick the slide to withstand  the rinsing process.
