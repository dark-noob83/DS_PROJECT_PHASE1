Pear-shaped is a metaphorical term with several meanings, all in reference to the shape of a (European) pear, i.e. tapering towards the top. A failed bank robbery, for example, could be said to have gone pear-shaped. The origin for this use of the term is in dispute. The OED cites its origin as within the Royal Air Force; as of 2003 the earliest citation there is a quote in the 1983 book Air War South Atlantic.

However recent research shows that the health benefits of the pear shape may not be what was first thought.
