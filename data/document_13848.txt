The IRS severely limits the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA for individuals that are married but file separately. If you do not have income you will not be allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA. If your income is less than $10,000 you cannot contribute up to the limit. Your contribution is reduced. If you file as single, head of household, or married filing separately (if you did not live with your spouse at any time during the year) your income must be less than $116,000 to contribute up to the limit. If your income falls between $116,000 and $131
The $181,000 represents the maximum modified adjusted gross income a married couple filing jointly in 2014 can have and still contribute the full $5,500 to a Roth IRA (or $6,500 if 50 or older anytime during 2014). The ability to contribute money to a Roth disappears entirely if your joint income is $191,000 or more. I’ve seen two different numbers for the income limit for married couples to be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA in 2014 -- $181,000 and $191,000.

If you file as single, head of household, or married filing separately (if you did not live with your spouse at any time during the year) your income must be less than $116,000 to contribute up to the limit.
