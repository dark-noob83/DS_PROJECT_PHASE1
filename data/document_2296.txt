The Colosseum or Flavian Amphitheatre is a large ellipsoid arena built in the first century CE under the Roman emperors of the Flavian dynasty: Vespasian (69-79 CE), Titus (79-81 CE) and Domitian (81-96 AD). Roman architecture continued the legacy left by the earlier architects of the Greek world, and the Roman respect for this tradition and their particular reverence for the established architectural orders, especially the Corinthian, is evident in many of their large public buildings.
The Colosseum, (the Flavian Amphitheatre) is one of Rome's most famous buildings and enduring monuments to the culture of the ancient Romans. Construction was initiated by the Emperor Vespasian around 72 AD. His son Titus reigned over its completion and the official opening ceremonies, about 8 years later, in 80 AD. It was built near the site of Nero's Domus Aurea Golden House.

The Colosseum's partial destruction allows us to see into the bowels of the amphitheatre, in a way that no ancient could. Indeed, the very top section of the Colosseum is separated from other spectators by a 5m- (16ft-) high wall. Modern scholars often say that the hierarchy of seating mirrored the social hierarchies of Roman society.
The name Flavium is the family/dynasty name of the Roman Emperors who built the Colosseum. The present day name Colosseum, or rather Colosseo, is said to have come from the colossal 35m (115 feet) high bronze statue of Nero, The Colossus, that stood between the stadium and the Roman Forum. The ancient Roman Colosseum was the first free-standing amphitheater. It has an elliptical (oval) plan with a length of 189m (620 feet), height 48m (158 feet) and width 156m (512 feet). The central area of the arena is 88m (287 ft) long and 55m (180 ft) wide
Construction of the Ancient Roman Colosseum was started by Emperor Vespasian in 70 A.D. After Vespasian's death in 79 A.D. his son Titus completed and inaugurated the Roman Colosseum in 80 A.D. The opening ceremony is documented to have lasted 100 days and between 5000 and 11000 wild animals were killed. The ancient Roman Colosseum was the first free-standing amphitheater.

Construction planning. Emperor Titus Â© The Colosseum was opened in AD 80 by Vespasian's son and successor, Titus. Given the scale of the enterprise it was built remarkably quickly. And given the site, in a valley where there was previously a lake, it had to be planned carefully. Indeed, the very top section of the Colosseum is separated from other spectators by a 5m- (16ft-) high wall. Modern scholars often say that the hierarchy of seating mirrored the social hierarchies of Roman society.
The Colosseum was the biggest ampitheatre ever built by the Romans, measuring 600 meters (2,000 feet) across and 50 m (165 ft) high. It is believed to have seated between 45,000 and 73,000 spectators, arranged in five stepped galleries, accessed through a system of 80 doors and passageways.
