The meaning of 4.5 MPa/FV is that the pressure vessel or similar component is designed for a pressure of 4.5 Mega Pascals (gauge pressure), or Full Vacuum conditions. One Mega Pascal = Millions of Pascals. One MPa (gauge pressure) = 145.03 PSIG.
In the following spreadsheet, the Excel Fv function is used to calculate the future value of an investment of $1,000 per month for a period of 5 years. The present value is 0, the interest rate is 5% per year and the payments are made at the end of each month. Formulas:
In the example below, the Excel Fv function is used to calculate the future value of an investment of $2,000 per quarter for a period of 4 years.
