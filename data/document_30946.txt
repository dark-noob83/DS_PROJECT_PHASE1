Bake Until Opaque and Flaky. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for fillets or 350 degrees F for a dressed fish. You can bake the fillets at a lower temperature, if desired, but remember to increase the cooking time. Bake salmon fillets or steaks, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness.
Standard baking temperature is 350 degrees, which works just fine for fish. But you can get away with setting the temperature even lower. This extends the cooking time, which may help if other ingredients in the dish need more time to cook.
