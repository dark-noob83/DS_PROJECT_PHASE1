Quinoa is actually not a grain. It is a pseudocereal seed used by many as a gluten free substitute. It is a commonly used staple crop in South America, specifically grown in the Andes. Quinoa has a favorable protein content and contains a number of minerals and B-vitamins.
Protein in Quinoa: One of the best reasons to enjoy quinoa is because it has a high-protein content, which makes it a great cholesterol-free and low-fat source of protein for vegetarians and vegans. According to the USDA nutrient database, 1 cup of cooked quinoa (185 g) contains 8.14 grams of protein.
Quinoa is considered a whole grain. It is the seed of a leafy plant related to spinach. Although most plant-based foods do not contain complete proteins containing all of the essential amino acids, quinoa is a complete protein. This makes quinoa a particularly beneficial food for those who do not eat animal products.
1 In comparison to cereal grasses like wheat, quinoa is higher in fat content and can provide valuable amounts of heart-healthy fats like monounsaturated fat (in the form of oleic acid). 2  Quinoa can also provide small amounts of the omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).
Protein in Quinoa. Most whole grains do not contain the amino acid lysine, or contain very little lysine. Quinoa, however, supplies this amino acid along with the other eight essential amino acids in amounts that are balanced well for the needs of humans.
Quinoa is gluten-free, high in fiber and a complete protein, meaning it has all nine amino acids. Quinoa also contains high amounts of lysine, manganese, magnesium, iron, copper and phosphorus. Due to quinoa being a complete protein, it is an excellent food choice for the gluten-free vegan.
