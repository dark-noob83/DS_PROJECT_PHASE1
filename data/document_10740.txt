Plant analysis allows the crop or plant to tell us what nutrition it lacks. It is critical that the correct plant part and stage of growth be sampled and that the lab be clearly informed of this. The normal nutrient concentration differs between the various plant parts.
There is often not a strong relationship between the nutrient levels in soil and in plant tissue. This is because many factors affect the ability of plants to take up nutrients. Tissue testing is the best way to find out the nutritional composition of plants.
The need for potash in a fertilizer program can be determined from plant analysis and soil testing. Soil testing is the most reliable predictor of this need. Suggested management practices for this nutrient vary with crop.
Analysis of plant tissues is an extremely useful tool for growers. Not only can plant tissue testing be used to monitor the nutrient status of plants but it can help identify nutrient deficiencies and imbalances. This allows growers to more effectively tailor their nutrient management programs to meet a crop's specific needs.
Only plant analysis can identify the actual nutrient status of a plant or crop. While soil testing identifies the nutrients offered to the crop, plant analysis identifies how well the plants are utilizing soil and applied nutrients.
Plant analysis can often determine the cause of these differences and indicate the best method to correct the problem. Sample when abnormalities are discovered. Two plant and two soil samples are recommended. This includes collecting soil and plant samples from the normal and abnormal areas.
Fertilizer recommendations are not provided with plant tissue analysis. Use the results along with soil tests and suggestions from University of Connecticut Extension Specialists to modify your fertilizer regime. Lead is a contaminant and not a plant nutrient.
