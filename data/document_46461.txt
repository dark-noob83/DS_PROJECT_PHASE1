When it is time to insert Skyla, your healthcare provider will first examine your pelvis, to determine the size, shape, and position of your uterus, and then cleanse your cervix and vagina with an antiseptic solution. Your healthcare provider will use a slim plastic tube that contains Skyla to place the medication.
You can also view the insertion video using the left-hand side navigation. Skyla contains 13.5 mg of levonorgestrel (LNG) released in vivo at a rate of approximately 14 mcg/day after 24 days. This decreases progressively to 5mcg/day after 3 years.
They will swab the inside of your vagina, and uterus to make a sterile environment. Next they will insert a device which is called sounding which measures your uterus for proper placement of the Skyla. After she measures your uterus she will take the sound out of of you and insert the tube with Skyla inside of it.
Learn About the Skyla Inserter. Skyla comes in an inserter that is designed for single-handed loading. The T-body is horizontally prealigned in the insertion tube and held in place by the threads that are locked and fully contained inside the handle. This is what makes the unit non-reloadable.
Timing of Insertion. 1  Insert Skyla into the uterine cavity during the first seven days of the menstrual cycle or immediately after a first trimester abortion. 2  Postpone postpartum insertion and insertions following second trimester abortions a minimum of six weeks or until the uterus is fully involuted.
The actually placement of the Skyla didn't hurt at all. Here's how they do it. They insert a speculum inside you like you are having a pap smear. Next they use forceps to grip your cervix to make it straight, which makes Skyla insertion easier and more effective.
If you think the Skyla IUD is not properly in place, use a non-hormone method of birth control (condom, or diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy until your doctor is able to replace the Skyla IUD.
