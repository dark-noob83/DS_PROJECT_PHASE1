Answers. Best Answer: okay, the key is to convert daily caloric intake (which is assumed to be the same as the bodies daily energy use) and covert that to joules. lets assume your body uses 2500 calories in one day. Food calories are actually measured in kilocalories. (Ambiguous much?) one calorie is = 4.2Joules 250,000 calories x (4.2J / calorie) = 10,500kJ per day Watts = Joules/second Your body uses 10,500kJ in one day. One day has 86,400 seconds. About 120 watts
An hour is just 3600 seconds so a Watt hour is simply 1 Watt (Or 1 Joule per second) for 3600 seconds which equals 3600 Joules. 1 kWh is 3600,000 joules and 1 kW is 1000 joules per second. Now that's out of the way, we basically have three different ways of measuring energy usage per person. 1. I used the calorie calculator linked in the references section to calculate how much energy I would use in a day and it came out to 2266 calories which is 9480 joules. This will vary depending on your size, gender, age and level of activity.
Human power is work or energy that is produced from the human body. It can also refer to the power (rate of work per time) of a human. Power comes primarily from muscles, but body heat is also used to do work like warming shelters, food, or other humans. The average level of human power that can be maintained over a certain duration of time, say over the extent of one minute or one hour is interesting to engineers designing work operations in industry.
New study shows why the brain drains so much of the body's energy. By Nikhil Swaminathan | April 29, 2008. © ISTOCKPHOTO/VASILIY YAKOBCHUK. It is well established that the brain uses more energy than any other human organ, accounting for up to 20 percent of the body's total haul.
Municipal planners assume each individual (regardless of whether or not it is a family) uses about 150 gallons of water a day. They also assume that about 100 gallons of … that enters the sewer system in that day. Each person uses about 80-100 gallons of water per day. So it depends how many people in the family. Each person uses 80-100 gallons of water per day. 
That's easy. The energy requirement of an average man is 2,500 Calories per day, and one Calorie is 4184J. Therefore he emits about 10.5MJ/day or about 120W. An average woman requires 2,000 Calories per day, so she emits about 97W.
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): Most of the body's energy, about 60-70%, goes to supporting the ongoing metabolic work of the body's cells. This includes such activities as heart beat, respiration and maintaining body temperature. To determine your BMR: For adult females-Multiply body weight by 10; add the body weight to this value. [i.e., for a 120 lb female, 1,200 + 120 = 1,320 cal/day BMR]. Energy Expended During Physical Activity: The second component of the equation depends upon your level of physical activity. Physical activity has a profound effect on human energy expenditure and contributes 20-30% to the body's total energy output.
a) Use Table 5.4 for men aged 18 to 30 years. b) Calculate the 24-hour BMR by interpolating between body weights of 65 and 70 kg and multiply the interpolated BMR/kg by the populations average weight of 68 kg: mean of 108 and 104 = 106 kJ/kg × 68 kg = 7 208 kJ/day. 
That is like 12.5 gigawatts per million people or 12.5 kW per person. To be sure, that must be a cost of $0.63 an hour or about $15 a day just for energy. Lots of people must be using a lot less than that $15 a day. I used the calorie calculator linked in the references section to calculate how much energy I would use in a day and it came out to 2266 calories which is 9480 joules. This will vary depending on your size, gender, age and level of activity.
