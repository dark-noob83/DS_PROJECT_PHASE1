4) The process in which the nuclei of unstable atoms can become more stable by emitting particles and/or electromagnetic radiation is called radioactive decay. 5) High-energy electromagnetic radiation released by a radioactive nucleus are called gamma rays. Return to questions. 1) A positively charged particle made up of two protons and two neutrons and released by a radioactive nucleus is the alpha particle. 2) An electron released by a radioactive nucleus that causes a neutron to change into a proton is called a beta particle. 3) The amount of time for half the atoms in a radioactive sample to decay is called the half-life
The loss of an alpha particle or a beta particle from an unstable nucleus is often accompanied by the loss of a gamma ray. A gamma ray is a form of high-energy radiation. It is similar to an X ray but of somewhat greater energy. Some unstable nuclei can decay by the emission of gamma rays only. The forms of radiation most commonly emitted by a radioactive nucleus are called alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. An alpha particle is the nucleus of a helium atom. It consists of two protons and two neutrons. Consider the case of a radium-226 atom.

Best Answer: Too much mass in the nucleus will cause it to be unstable. Radioactivity is the process of an atom shooting out subatomic particles and energy in order to make the atom more stable. 
When an unstable nucleus of a radioactive isotope spontaneously  decays, the radioactive decay process is normally gamma radiation,  beta particle or alpha particle emission … . This is called Carbon12.   Carbon14 with 6 protons and 8 neutrons, is unstable and decays by releasing a beta particle from its nucleus to become a stable isotope, Nitrogen14. which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. That refers to an isotope that is unstable-the atoms will decay after a while.
Radioactive decay, also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity, is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting radiation. A material that spontaneously emits such radiation — which includes alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays and conversion electrons — is considered radioactive. Alpha decay is one type of radioactive decay, in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, and thereby transforms (or decays) into an atom with a mass number decreased by 4 and atomic number decreased by 2.
1 Radioactivity. 2  This breakdown is called radioactive decay of the unstable nucleus of the atom (radioisotope). 3  In the breakdown of the unstable nucleus, energy is released by the emission of alpha, beta and gamma ionising radiation (see diagram below). 1 This breakdown is called radioactive decay of the unstable nucleus of the atom (radioisotope). 2
