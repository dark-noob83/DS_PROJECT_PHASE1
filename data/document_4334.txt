Preheat grill to medium-high. Lightly coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray. Place pork chops on grill, and cook for 5 minutes on one side. Flip chops over and brush marinade on chops, add pineapple to grill and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes.
1 In deep bowl mix all marinade ingredients. 2  Marinate at least 2 hours. 3  Remove from marinade and cook over medium-high heat on greased grill for no more than 15 minutes or until done. 4  Cooking time for second side is shorter by 1-2 minutes.
That's easy. Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Remove the pork chops from the bag and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook until the pork chop releases from the grill, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for another 3 minutes. If using a grill pan, be sure to do in batches so you don't steam the chops. And don't worry if you have neither; you can do this in a pan.
