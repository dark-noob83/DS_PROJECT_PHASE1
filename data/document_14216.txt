The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your healthcare provider. Shingles vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people aged 50 years and older. However, CDC does not have a recommendation for routine use of shingles vaccine in people 50 through 59 years old. People 60 years of age or older should get shingles vaccine. They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don't remember getting the disease
1 They sell the shingles vaccine per shot and the price for this can reach anywhere from $220 to $250 per shot. 2  Since this is deemed medically necessary, most health insurance providers will cover this vaccination. 1 They have walk in clinics that can offer the vaccinations right on the spot. 2  They sell the shingles vaccine per shot and the price for this can reach anywhere from $220 to $250 per shot. 3
1 The risk of shingles begins to rise after age 50, but about half of cases occur in people 60 and older, and symptoms usually are more severe in that age group. 2  People who have already had shingles still can get the vaccine. 3  The shingles vaccine generally is considered safe. 1 The shingles vaccination can be somewhat difficult to get because it requires storage in a special freezer. 2  Check to see if your doctor offers it. 3  Or, Walgreens' Take Care Clinics offer the shingles vaccine, as do some other pharmacies.
The shingles vaccine (Zostavax) is recommended for adults age 60 and older, whether they've already had shingles or not. Although the vaccine is approved for people age 50 and older, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn't recommending it until you reach age 60. The shingles vaccine is a live vaccine given as a single injection, usually in the upper arm. The most common side effects of the shingles vaccine are redness, pain, tenderness, swelling and itching at the injection site, and headaches. Some people report a chickenpox-like rash after getting the shingles vaccine.
Your risk of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) increases as you get older. CDC recommends that people 60 years old and older get shingles vaccine to prevent shingles and PHN. Shingles vaccine has been used since 2006. Zostavax® is the only shingles vaccine currently approved for use in the United States. This vaccine reduces the risk of developing shingles by 51% and PHN by 67%. People 60 years of age or older should get shingles vaccine. They should get the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, which is caused by the same virus as shingles. Studies show that more than 99% of Americans aged 40 and older have had chickenpox, even if they don't remember getting the disease
Another way of looking at it is 175 people would have to be vaccinated to prevent one case of shingles, and 1,087 would need to be treated to prevent one case of postherpetic neuralgia (lingering nerve pain after an initial attack)—at a cost of $150–$300 per shingles vaccination. In the placebo group, 3.3 percent of the study participants developed shingles, compared to 1.6 percent in the vaccine group. Yes, that’s a 50 percent difference, but the real, absolute risk reduction is just 1.7 percentage points.
1 It is most effective in people aged 60 to 69, and it prevents shingles about 50 percent the time; in patients who do get shingles anyway, the vaccination can prevent post-herpetic neuralgia, the sometimes-debilitating pain that can persist after the shingles rash clears. 1 The shingles vaccination can be somewhat difficult to get because it requires storage in a special freezer. 2  Check to see if your doctor offers it. 3  Or, Walgreens' Take Care Clinics offer the shingles vaccine, as do some other pharmacies.
1 The shingles vaccine is not recommended by the CDC for anyone younger than 60 because it has not yet been thoroughly studied in those age groups. 2  The risk of shingles begins to rise after age 50, but about half of cases occur in people 60 and older, and symptoms usually are more severe in that age group. 1 The shingles vaccination can be somewhat difficult to get because it requires storage in a special freezer. 2  Check to see if your doctor offers it. 3  Or, Walgreens' Take Care Clinics offer the shingles vaccine, as do some other pharmacies.
The vaccine is indicated for the prevention of shingles in those aged between 50 and 59 years, and in the prevention of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia and the reduction of acute and chronic zoster-associated pain in those aged 60 years or older.
