If you want to cook the prime rib at a higher temperature, start out a 450 degrees F for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F, and roast for 12 to 13 minutes per pound. I would err on the lower amount of time side and roast at 12 minutes per pound or in the case of your prime rib 2.5 to 3.0 hours. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: For a boneless prime rib it averages about 15 minutes per pound at 350F, but it really is best to have a meat thermometer. For medium-rare, you want to take it out of the oven at 135, because it's going to keep cooking a bit, even after it's out of the oven.
1 *NOTE* if desired you can cover the roast loosely with foil the first hour and then uncover and cook for the remaining time. --------------------------------------------. 2  APPROXIMATE COOKING TIMES for the prime rib cooked at 350°F after the 20 minute cooking time at 450°F. 3  Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F. 1 Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F. 2  Medium-rare; cook 14-16 minutes per pound or to 140°F (I would not recommend cooking a prime rib any more than medium-rare). 3  Since every oven cooks differently cooking times are only approximate.
Low and Slow Cooking: Like traditional Barbecue, pork ribs should be cooked low and slow. For maximum flavor you will need to maintain a temperature about 200 to 225 degrees F. at all time. Figure 1 hour of smoking per pound of ribs. One (1) full rack of ribs can be smoked in approximately 4 hours or more. Do not speed up the cooking time by raising the temperature-your pork will end up tough and chewy! The last 1/2 hour of cooking, start brushing the ribs with the Pineapple Glaze.
An alternate method of roasting which causes less shrinkage in the total weight is to roast the meat at 325 F throughout the entire cooking time, in which case, allow 20 minutes per pound for rare, 25 for medium, or 30 minutes for a well done roast. Place in a 300-325 F oven until the internal temperature is slightly less than that for the desired degree of doneness listed in the chart below. Allow roast to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before carving, during which time the temperature will continue to rise several degrees.

Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 1 hour 45 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour 30 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°. 4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare
Place the roast in a roasting pan and add 1 1/2 cups red wine and 1/2 cup beef stock to the bottom of the pan. Roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to roast to the desired degree of doneness, about 18 minutes per pound for rare and 22 minutes per pound for medium. Let stand at least 5 minutes before carving. De-fat the pan juices and serve alongside the beef.

1 After 20 minutes of high heat cooking reduce heat to 350°F and continue to roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes OR until the meat thermometer reads 130°F for rare doneness OR 140°F for medium-rare doneness, that is the way a prime rib really should be served, check your roast after 1 hour cooking time. 1 Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F. 2  Medium-rare; cook 14-16 minutes per pound or to 140°F (I would not recommend cooking a prime rib any more than medium-rare). 3  Since every oven cooks differently cooking times are only approximate.
