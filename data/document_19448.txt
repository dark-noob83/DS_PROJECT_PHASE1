That results in a shortfall of $2,000 a month, or $24,000 per year. And $24,000 x 25 = $600,000. Thatâ€™s the amount you need in your individual retirement account, 401(k) or other savings vehicle to close the gap of $2,000 a month.
How we calculate the amount you will save. To figure out how much you will save by the time you retire, we first estimate your future income by growing your current income at a rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). Then, we determine what the sum of your annual contributions will be between now and retirement.
More than half of working Americans have no retirement plans; start saving as soon as possible. The average person with a retirement plan -- particularly a 401(k) -- has just a little more than $60,000 saved, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute's May 2012 Retirement Confidence Survey.

The average retirement age is 62 and the average length of retirement is 18 years. Bankrate.com provides a retirement calculator that enables you to figure out how much you need to have stocked away so that you can have set monthly income after retirement.
Based on a 7.5 percent annual percent yield on investments with 2 percent annual inflation over 20 years, Bankrate's calculator determined that you need to have saved $205,243.23 for a $1,000 monthly income in retirement; $410,486.46 for a $2,000 monthly income; and $615,729.70 for $3,000.
Financial experts estimate that the average person, after it all nets out, will need about 75 percent to 80 percent of their preretirement income to sustain their standard of living after they retire. But this is just a rule of thumb. Do your research, and then do the math to see how much retirement savings you need.
The rule of thumb for retirement accounts is that you should withdraw no more than 4 percent a year. If you have $100,000 in savings, that means $4,000 a year, or about $333 per month.
