Overview. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a primary disease of heart muscle that results in fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricle and the subepicardial region of the left ventricle. Patients are at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death (see the image below).
1 ARVC a primary disease of the heart muscle. 2  It most commonly affects the Boxer, however, it is also reported in the English Bulldog, American Staffordshire, and rarely in cats. 3  It is characterized by the progressive replacement of normal heart muscle cells by fat and/or fibrous tissue.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC; also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia – (ARVD)) is a heart muscle disease that can cause life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities and, rarely, significant “weakening” of the right side of the heart.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a form of heart disease that usually appears in adulthood. ARVC is a disorder of the myocardium, which is the muscular wall of the heart. This condition causes part of the myocardium to break down over time, increasing the risk of an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) and sudden death. ARVC may not cause any symptoms in its early stages.
Physician's Version Meet Our Physicians. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), is a genetic cause for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a condition in which the heart stops beating.
