DATE_FORMAT. The DATE_FORMAT command assigns a format template to the definition of an object that has a DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP_TZ, TIMESTAMP_LTZ, DSINTERVAL, or YMINTERVAL data type. The datetime format template is a template that describes the format of datetime data stored in a character string. The template does not change the internal representation of the value in the Database. When you convert a character string into a date, the template determines how Oracle OLAP interprets the string.
This is number value of that date. Now if I go to Format Cells for cell B2 and I set that it's a Date field (and not General) I get it in correct format: Ok, let's try to do that on cell A2 (which is originally exported from TOAD). I go to Format Cells for cell A2. It is General.

Some of the datetime format elements cannot be used in the TO_* datetime functions, as noted in Table 2-7, Datetime Fields and Values . The following datetime format elements can be used in timestamp and interval format models, but not in the original DATETIME format model: FF, TZD, TZH, TZM, and TZR.
For example, a value that you insert into a DATE column must be a value of the DATE datatype or a character string in the default date format (Oracle implicitly converts character strings in the default date format to the DATE datatype).
Re: Date format st,th and nd. Not that I know of. I believe that I have seen people write custom functions to do this. If you do a Google search, you might be able to find some of these functions people have written.
NOTE: If you click the Default button to change the default date format in the Date and Time dialog box, the default date is NOT changed when you restart Microsoft Word. When you click Field on the Insert menu and then click Date under Field names, the default date is determined by a registry setting.
