Some of these toxins are waste products from normal metabolic activities – carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid are examples of endogenous toxins that your body churns out by the second. Unless your health is severely compromised, your body is well equipped to eliminate these endogenous toxins from your system.
Bacteria produce toxins as a byproduct. They are formed when the bacteria produce energy for themselves by changing one substance into another, and in some cases, there are by … products, some of which can be toxins. Answered. In Conditions and Diseases.
Waste Composition. The more organic waste present in a landfill, the more landfill gas is produced by bacterial decomposition. Some types of organic waste contain nutrients, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, that help bacteria thrive. When these nutrients are present, landfill gas production increases.
A toxin, by definition, is a substance that is highly poisonous to living creatures. Toxins generally originate from such living sources as plants, animals, and bacteria. In today's highly industrialized world, however, humans create toxins as by-products of the processes used to produce goods, food, and energy.
Nitrites are the byproduct of the ammonia-eating bacteria, and are also highly toxic to fish. Like the cycling in step one, you must build up enough nitrites to form a second colony of bacteria that will dispose of them as they are produced. These bacteria will in turn create nitrate.
