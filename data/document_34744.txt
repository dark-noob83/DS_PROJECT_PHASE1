411 The human digestive system is made up of a group of organs working together. The digestive tract is made up of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and the large intestine. There are also associated organs that support the digestive tract, such as; the liver, gall bladder, and the pancreas.
For the Digestive System page, see Anatomy/Digestive System. Various parts of the digestive tract secrete many enzymes and fluids. This page is a comprehensive list of those secretions, their source, and their functions. 1  Enzymes speed up digestive processes to make digestion faster. 2  Hormones can stimulate digestion, and the release of hormones into the organs.
Food enters the mouth and passes to the anus through the hollow organs of the GI tract. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system. The digestive system helps the body digest food. Bacteria in the GI tract, also called gut flora or microbiome, help with digestion.
These two are active only within our digestive system. These enzymes have one main job â€” to digest our food. DIGESTIVE ENZYMES are made by our body's organs. Digestive enzymes are secreted by the salivary glands, stomach, pancreas, and the small intestine. [Technically, digestive enzymes are also considered to be metabolic enzymes whose metabolic role is to digest food.
The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum, the first segment of the small intestine. These enzymes break down protein, fats, and carbohydrates. The pancreas also makes insulin, secreting it directly into the bloodstream. Insulin is the chief hormone for metabolizing sugar.
