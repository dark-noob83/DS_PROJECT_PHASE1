Depending on whom you ask, driving for Lyft or UberX is either a gold mine or an exploitative labor practice. Uber last year infamously claimed many of its drivers made more than $90,000 per year, but it did not account for the cost of driver expenses like gas and car maintenance.
Uber gets 20% of that, the limo company gets approx 40% & the driver gets approx 40%. So if revenue is $400, uber gets $80, limo company gets $160 & driver gets $160. Driver needs to pay for gas so $160 - $25 gas = $135 net for an 8 hour shift. SUN-Wed are slower nights so approx $250-300 revenue for 8 hr shift.
Uber driver pay varies depending on where you live and how many hours you drive. I make between $20 and $25 an hour in Los Angeles. Studies across the nation show that Uber drivers make over $19 an hour on average. In New York City, the average Uber driver makes over $30 an hour.
As I already explained, how much money an Uber driver makes depends on numerous factors. As a practical example, let’s assume you make $20 an hour after taxes and expenses, and you work 40 hours a week, like a regular full-time job: $19 x 40 hours/week= $760 a week.
There is also no such thing as an Uber driver salary. As described above, drivers are paid a portion of the fare for every ride that is given. As promised, here is an example of my pay for one 10 ½ hour day: $256.30 / 10.5 hours = $24.41 an hour.
Uber has made some lofty claims about just how much its drivers can make a year. Uber has said its UberX drivers can make a median income of $90,000 a year in New York, as long as they drive over 40 hours per week. It s ays drivers can make up to $60,000 per year in Dallas. UberX is the startup's cheaper tier service. In New York, UberX is the startup's lower-cost, lower-level black car service.
