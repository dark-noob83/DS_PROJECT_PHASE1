Many people are called to serve in other ways, such as missionaries. Missions cost a lot of money. As of 2012, religious organizations spent an average of $121,000 a year to send two people, namely couples, on mission work. But this number doesn’t cover just the salary of missionaries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics categorizes missionaries as other religious workers. As of 2012, the average salary was $30,650 a year. (reference 1). The top 10 percent of earners made more than $50,510, while the bottom 10 percent earned less than $17,610 annually.
Also, many missionaries don’t know how to answer it! According to Simply Hired, the average salary for a job including “missionary” is $69,000 (!). If you limit it to “Christian missionary,” then it drops to $39,000(!). Part of the difficulty in answering this question is that there is no average missionary. The Southern Baptist IMB says that the “average cost to support an individual missionary” is $52,000 annually (but what about families, and is that salary and ministry expenses??).
Missionary Wages. The amount you can expect to earn really depends on the organization funding the mission. For example, Campus Crusade for Christ offered an annual salary of $2,549 for a single missionary and $6,502 for a missionary family in 2009.

With Change Volunteers, the pay is anywhere from $35,000 to $50,000 for a mission in Africa

Missionaries are typically supported through the church, which will decide on financial need. The income for a missionary varies greatly, because of the exchange rates and cost of living in a particular country, etc. Over 60,000 of them (currently) save their money to serve for 18 to 24 months with no financial compensation at all. __________________________.
