The Silurian Period occurred from 443 million to 416 million years ago. It was the third period in the Paleozoic Era. It followed the Ordovician Period and preceded the Devonian Period. During this time, continental landmasses were low and sea levels were rising.
Cambrian Period. The Cambrian Period is the first period of the Paleozoic Era spanning from approximately 540 to 500 million years ago. It was named in 1835 by the geologist Adam Sedqwick, after the region of Cambria in Southern Wales and England, where rocks of this age were first found.
Getting To Know the Age: The Ordovician Period is in the Paleozoic Era, which is set in the Phanerozoic Eon. The period began approximately 510 million years ago and ended 440 million years ago, totaling 70 million years, or 1.52% of geologic time (Prothero). Possible nicknames: Ordo the Obvious, the Drama Queen.
THE ORDOVICIAN (2008 Presentation). Introduction: The Ordovician Period is in the Paleozoic Era, which is in the Phanerozoic Eon. The Ordovician started about 488.3 million years ago, and it ended about 443.7 million years ago. It encompassed about 45 million years, or 0.970% of geologic time.
The Ordovician Period. The Ordovician Period lasted almost 45 million years, beginning 488.3 million years ago and ending 443.7 million years ago.* During this period, the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean, and most of the world's land was collected into the southern supercontinent Gondwana.

The Cambrian Period is the first geological time period of the Paleozoic Era (the “time of ancient life”). This period lasted about 53 million years and marked a dramatic burst of evolutionary changes in life on Earth, known as the Cambrian Explosion..
