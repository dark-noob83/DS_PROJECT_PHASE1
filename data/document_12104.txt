Average total cost, when combined with price, determines per unit profit or loss that a profit-maximizing firm receives from short-run production. If price is greater than average total cost, then the firm receives positive economic profit per unit.
Average Total Cost Formula. The average total cost is sometimes referred to as the per unit total cost since it is calculated by taking the total cost of production and dividing that by the number of units produced (quantity). In variable form, it looks like this: TC / Q = ATC.
Average total cost, sometimes referred to as the per unit total cost, is the per unit cost. This includes fixed costs, those costs that are required for production but do not change based on output, and variable costs, those costs that increase (or decrease) as output increases (or decreases).
Definition of Average Total Cost. When economists, production managers, or others refer to average total cost, they are referring to the per unit cost that includes all fixed costs and all variable costs. Knowing average total cost is critical in making pricing decisions, as any price below average total cost will result in a financial loss.
