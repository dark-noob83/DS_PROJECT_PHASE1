The germ theory of disease states that some diseases are caused by microorganisms. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease.
From Conservapedia. The Germ theory of disease, developed in the 1860s and 1870s by Louis Pasteur, states that tiny living beings are the cause of infectious diseases. The theory was developed to explain puerperal fever, or Child bed fever.
Louis Pasteur and the germ theory of disease. The work of people like Jenner and Semmelweiss led doctors and scientists to think that perhaps infectious diseases were caused by an infectious agent or 'germ'. This was the germ theory of disease. It took a very long time for this idea to be accepted.
Prior to germ theory, it was widely believed that disease was spread by noxious odors. As disease-spreading conditions-rotting meat, open sewage, and such things-was often highly odorous, the smell and disease were associated.
The germ theory was proposed in the mid-16th century and gained widespread credence when substantiated by scientific discoveries of the 17th through the late 19th century. It supplanted earlier explanations for disease, such as Galen's miasma theory.
