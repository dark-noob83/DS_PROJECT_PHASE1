And Gretchen Wilson isn't George Strait. So, after three No. 1 albums — including her 2004 five-times-platinum debut Here for the Party — Gretchen Wilson came down. Hard. The tumble started just a year and a half after her five-week No. 1 Redneck Woman.
She first signed with Epic Records in 2003 and released Here for the Party in 2004. She has released seven studio albums to date including one Christmas album in 2013. Wilson currently has one daughter by the name of Grace France Penner with former partner, Mike Penner. Wilson is a known Cardinals fan and sang the national anthem in the 2004 World Series at Busch Stadium. She received her GED in 2007 and is an active Republican. She performed at a rally in honor of John McCain and Sarah Palin in 2008.
