However, under harsh conditions such as prolonged period of chilly, wet weather, or snow & cold, or when ice coats most of the wild berries, bluebirds will benefit from receiving feeder food. Meal worms, suet, sunflower hearts, softened fruits, and cornmeal muffins can all be fed to bluebirds. Most of these will be accepted during the cold weather months if bluebirds have wintered over. But, meal worms are the best food to feed bluebirds and they will readily eat them year-round. During the breeding season, it is nice to feed meal worms because the harried parents will gratefully accept them to help feed their ravenous young.

Starvation probably will not occur for several more weeks, but it is best to have the snakes feeding as soon as possible. How long the hatchlings can survive without starving depends upon how much yolk reserve the snake has at the time of hatching, the temperature the snake is kept at, and how active the snake is. [Note: Depending upon the species, hatchlings may be housed together and just separated at feeding time.]. Provide a shelter or other place for the snake to hide itself. Keep the food items small. Small items are more easily digested than larger items.
Some hatchlings may feed as soon as they emerge from the egg, but most probably will not. Do not feel compelled to try to feed the snakes until after they've shed for the first time, which will be about a week or two after hatching. Snakes should start feeding within a month or so of hatching. [Note: Depending upon the species, hatchlings may be housed together and just separated at feeding time.].

The embryos use their egg tooth to peck their way through the shell. This hard tip on the beak eventually falls off. Eastern Bluebirds take 1-6 hours to pip through the shell (it can take an Albatross 6 days!) It can take 24-48 (rarely 72) hours for all eggs to hatch. NEVER remove unhatched eggs until 4 days have passed since the first one hatched. Note: some people count this as Day 1. See another close up of a newborn
