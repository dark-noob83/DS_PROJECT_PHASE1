Par value, also known as Face value, is the value of the bond at maturity. Almost all bonds have a $1,000 par value. Bond prices are almost always quoted as a percentage of par, so you will hear prices such as 99 or 101.5. These refer to the percentage of $1,000, and mean $990 and $1,015 per bond respectively.
In this case: a $500 coupon divided by the $10,500 face value, for a yield to maturity of 4.76%. In this way, a bond’s coupon and its actual yield are not necessarily the same.
A bond is issued with a stated value, known as the par, or face, value. This is the value at which the bond will be bought back by the issuer upon its maturity. Though there are exceptions to the rule, most bonds are issued with a $1,000 par value.
Zero Coupon Bonds are issued at a discount and mature at Par ($1,000). The value of the bond increases mathematically by a slight amount every day during the life of the bond. The mathematical value of the bond on a given day is its accreted value (or accumulated value to date).
For example, if a $1,000 par value bond has a 5% coupon rate, each year the holder of that bond will earn 5% of $1,000, or $50 (0.05 x $1,000 = $50). Yield-to-maturity is the yield calculation used to compare the values of bonds with different issue and maturity dates, coupon rates, and par values.
For example if a bond is issued when prevailing interest rates are 5% at $1,000 par value with a 5% annual coupon, it will generate $50 of cash flows per year to the bondholder. The bondholder would be indifferent to purchasing the bond or saving the same money at the prevailing interest rate.
Shorthand reference to 1%. In the context of a “bond,” a “point” means $10, since a “bond” with this reference means $1,000 (no matter what the actual denominations of the bonds of the issue). An issue or a security that is “discounted two points” is quoted at 98% of its par value.
1 Maturity date is the date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bond holder the face value of the bond. 2  Issue price is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds.
