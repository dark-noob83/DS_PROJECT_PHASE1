SCADA stands for supervisory control and data acquisition. It is a type of software application program for process control. SCADA is a central control system which consist of controllers network interfaces, input/output, communication equipments and software.
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is a system that collects data from various sensors at a factory, plant, or in other remote locations and sends this data to a central computer that then manages and controls the data.
A SCADA system performs four functions: 1. Data acquisition. 2. Networked data communication. 3. Data presentation. 4. Control. These functions are performed by four kinds of SCADA components: 1. Sensors (either digital or analog) and control relays that directly interface with the managed system.
Architecture: Generally SCADA system is a centralized system which monitors and controls entire area. It is purely software package that is positioned on top of hardware. A supervisory system gathers data on the process and sends the commands control to the process.
SCADA systems are used by private companies and public-sector service providers. SCADA works well in many different types of enterprises because they can range from simple configurations to large, complex projects.
SCADA (Supervisory control and data acquisition) is an industrial automation control system at the core of many modern industries, including: 1  Energy. 2  Food and beverage. 3  Manufacturing. 4  Oil and gas. 5  Power. 6  Recycling. 7  Transportation. 8  Water and waste water.
Best Answer: SCADA stands for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition. It generally refers to an industrial control system: a computer system monitoring and controlling a process.
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems have traditionally played a vital role by providing utilities with valuable knowledge and capabilities that are key to a primary business function-delivering power in a reliable and safe manner.
