As of June 2011, Jupiter has 67 confirmed natural satellites, or moons orbiting the planet Jupiter. 50 are named moons and 17 have provisional designations based on the year … they were first sighted. Confidence votes 13.0K. Jupiter has several natural satellites (moons), over 60 have been confirmed. It has no man made satellites in orbit around it, but did have one between 1995 and 2003, an orbiter called Galileo.
Of the 14 satellites of Neptune, the largest is Triton, which is in a retrograde (backward) orbit around the planet. Triton is the largest moon in the solar system to do this. On July 15, a 14th moon of Neptune, provisionally called S/2004 N 1, was announced. Neptune has seven inner moons.

Earth has one moon. Mars has 2 moons. Jupiter has 67 moons, the most out of the planets in our solar system. Saturn has 62 moons, the second planet to have the most moons. Uranus has 27 moons.
Mars-2. Jupiter-63. Saturn-60. Uranus-27. Neptune-13. The number of known moos has been steadily growing with the improvement of technology. The number has nearly doubled from NASA’s 2003 information. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and our Moon is the fifth largest. The smallest is a tie between S/2003 J 9 and S/2003 J 12, in orbit around Jupiter. Scientist theorize that there were moons around Mercury and Venus, but may have impacted the surface of their primaries in ancient history. 
Many planets in our solar system have more than one moon. Mars has two moons, Jupiter has 67, Saturn 62, Uranus 27, Neptune 14. Those numbers keep changing, and you can see a relatively current count of solar system moons here from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
The Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) were named by Simon Marius soon after their discovery in 1610. Since 2003, 16 additional moons have been discovered but not yet named, bringing the total number of known moons of Jupiter to 67. As of 2013, this is the most of any planet in the Solar System; but additional undiscovered, tiny moons may exist.
Lately, this question has had a changing answer! For many years, we knew of 16 moons for the largest planet in our solar system. In the last few years, about two dozen new moons have been announced by astronomers. However, being announced does not mean that these become official moons of the planet. 
Outward from Jupiter: Each of the Jovian planets has a number of moons, although Jupiter has the most with more than 60 catalogued to date. Jupiter's 4 largest moons exhibit some of the most interesting geology in the solar system. They were discovered by Galileo Galilei and are known as the Galilean moons.
