Michigan's Adventure does not close due to poor weather. On rainy days, some rides may close for safety reasons, and will be re-opened as soon as safely possible. If lightning is overhead, all rides will close until the lightning passes.
Our park map is available online. In addition, once you arrive at Six Flags Great Adventure, there are park maps available on Main Street as soon as you enter the park. They are also available at Guest Relations.
There are lockers at the front entrance as well as at the entrance to the waterpark. If you plan to use the waterpark attractions, you should rent a locker at the waterpark as shirts, shorts and shoes are required in the amusement park at all times. Waterpark lockers close at waterpark closing time.
During most of the summer, the park closes at 9:00 PM. It is a strict closing, meaning some rides and things close down earlier so that all riders will be off by closing time. â€¦    For detailed hours, visit www.miadventure.com. 3 people found this useful.
Children two years old and younger receive free admission to Six Flags Great Adventure & Wild Safari and Hurricane Harbor. A guest does not need a season pass until they turn three years old. Once your child is three years old, the price would be the same as the other passes.
You'll notice that the Disney California Adventure park hours aren't the same as its sister park, Disneyland. In fact, Disney California Adventure hours are almost shorter than Disneyland's hours ---and that's because Disneyland attracts a greater crowd.
Michigan's Adventure does not have a kennel, and pets are not allowed inside the park. We strongly suggest that guests do not bring pets to the park for any reason. Pets should never be left in a parked vehicle.
