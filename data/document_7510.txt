at the first location the wind always blows at 15 mph giving a power density of 189 w m2 at the second site the speed fluctuates the wind is at 10 mph half the time power density 56 w m2 and at 20 mph the other half power density 448 w m2 the amount of power available in the wind is determined by the equation w 1 2 r a v3 where w is power r is air density a is the rotor area and v is the wind speed
from the diagram above the angular speed is the same for each red circle wind turbine tip speed ratio tsr is the speed of the tip divided by the speed of the wind for example if the tip speed is 120 miles hour and the wind speed is 20 miles hour than the tsr 120 20 6 anemometers are often attached to wind turbines to control the start up mechanism of wind turbines in low wind speeds and also the shutting down of wind turbines in dangerously strong winds wind speed is a contributing factor to the energy output potential of a wind turbine the greater the wind speed the greater the energy output assuming everything else is kept unchanged wind speed has an approximately cubic relationship with energy output
wind speed is typically judged as the velocity of wind most measurements of air movement are taken of outside air and there are several factors that can affect it average wind speed is often determined by an anemometer and is usually categorized in a standardized measurement scale called the beaufort scale 
wind speed is the rate at which air flows past a point above the earth s surface wind speed can be quite variable and is determined by a number of factors which will be discussed in this section wind power wind power is a measure of the energy available in the wind it is a function of the cube third power of the wind speed if the wind speed is doubled power in the wind increases by a factor of eight 23 the amount of power available in the wind is determined by the equation w 1 2 r a v3 where w is power r is air density a is the rotor area and v is
the terms wind energy or wind power describe the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power this mechanical power can be used for specific tasks such as grinding grain or pumping water or a generator can convert this mechanical power into electricity to power homes businesses schools and the like wind turbines wind turbines like aircraft propeller blades turn in the moving air and power an electric generator that supplies an electric current simply stated a wind turbine is the opposite of a fan instead of using electricity to make wind like a fan wind turbines use wind to make
wind observations are measured in two ways wind speed and wind direction where possible measuring devices should be in a large open area away from possible interference such as building trees etc
wind can be used to do work the kinetic energy of the wind can be changed into other forms of energy either mechanical energy or electrical energy when a boat lifts a sail it is using wind energy to push it through the water this is one form of work 
wind is a form of solar energy winds are caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun the irregularities of the earth s surface and rotation of the earth wind flow patterns are modified by the earth s terrain bodies of water and vegetative cover wind turbines wind turbines like aircraft propeller blades turn in the moving air and power an electric generator that supplies an electric current simply stated a wind turbine is the opposite of a fan instead of using electricity to make wind like a fan wind turbines use wind to make
wind speed is a measurement of the speed of movement of the air and is typically reported in miles per hour mph or kilometers per hour kph reports for maritime and aeronautical operations may use those or knots nautical miles per hour instrument anemometer wind is the natural motion of the air roughly parallel to the earth s surface it is caused by the unequal heating and cooling of the earth and atmosphere by the sun which produces differences in air pressure
