Unilamellar liposome is a spherical chamber/vesicle, bounded by a single bilayer of an amphiphilic lipid or a mixture of such lipids, containing aqueous solution inside the chamber. There are giant unilamellar liposomes/vesicles (GUVs), which have an average diameter of 100 µm. GUVs are mostly used as models for biological membranes in research work. Each lipid bilayer structure is comparable to lamellar phase lipid organization in biological membranes, in general.
The major types of liposomes are the multilamellar vesicle (MLV, with several lamellar phase lipid bilayers), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV, with one lipid bilayer), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. Liposomes can also be designed to deliver drugs in other ways. Liposomes that contain low (or high) pH can be constructed such that dissolved aqueous drugs will be charged in solution (i.e., the pH is outside the drug's pI range).
The bilayer structure of liposomes is nearly identical to the bilayer construction of the cell membranes that surround each of the cells in the human body. This occurs because of the unique composition of phospholipids. Although research has not clearly shown how the nutrients in a liposome are actually released, there are a couple of theories. One theory suggests that the phospholipids are processed in the liver as fats and that this process releases the nutrient.
Liposomes are most often composed of phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine, but may also include other lipids, such as egg phosphatidylethanolamine, so long as they are compatible with lipid bilayer structure. A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to unhealthy tissue. Liposomes can also be designed to deliver drugs in other ways. Liposomes that contain low (or high) pH can be constructed such that dissolved aqueous drugs will be charged in solution (i.e., the pH is outside the drug's pI range).
A liposome is a spherical vesicle having at least one lipid bilayer. The liposome can be used as a vehicle for administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical drugs. Liposomes can be prepared by disrupting biological membranes (such as by sonication). Liposomes can also be designed to deliver drugs in other ways. Liposomes that contain low (or high) pH can be constructed such that dissolved aqueous drugs will be charged in solution (i.e., the pH is outside the drug's pI range).

Liposomes are bilayer (double-layer), liquid-filled bubbles made from phospholipids. Over 50 years ago, researchers discovered that these spheres could be filled with nutrients and used to protect and deliver these agents into the body and even into specific cells of the body. Although research has not clearly shown how the nutrients in a liposome are actually released, there are a couple of theories. One theory suggests that the phospholipids are processed in the liver as fats and that this process releases the nutrient.
A Liposome is a tiny bubble (vesicle), made out of the same material as a cell membrane. Liposomes can be used to deliver ingredients and actives to the cells where they will be used. The name liposome is derived from two Greek words: ‘Lipos’ meaning fat and ‘Soma’ meaning body. Dermaviduals Liposomes: Dermaviduals hosts a whole load of Liposome serums to be blended into Prescriptive Serums, DMS – High Classic or used neat. Liposomes are already useful as their small and skin like composition allows for easy penetration and can be used as a carrier of good skin ingredients.
There is yet another benefit to the liposome-the lipids used to construct the fatty part of the molecule (lecithin, CLA, and other oils) are welcomed by the cell wall because that is just what the cell wall needs for replacement parts and construction of new membranes. The resulting configurations are called liposomes and offer a unique delivery system for nutrients and even drugs because these microscopic spheres are so tiny that it takes a very powerful microscope to identify them.
