The pancreas has an endocrine function because it releases juices directly into the bloodstream, and it has an exocrine function because it releases juices into ducts. Enzymes, or digestive juices, produced by the pancreas are secreted into the small intestine to further break down food after it has left the stomach. The gland also produces the hormone insulin and secretes it into the bloodstream in order to regulate the body's glucose or sugar level. Knowledge center. The pancreas is a gland organ that is located in the abdomen. It is part of the digestive system and produces important enzymes and hormones that help break down foods.
It functions as an exocrine organ by producing digestive enzymes, and as an endocrine organ by producing hormones. Insulin is the most important hormone produced by the pancreas. The pancreas secretes its digestive enzymes, through a system of ducts into the digestive tract, while it secretes its variety of hormones directly into the bloodstream. The pancreas has both an exocrine and an endocrine secretion. The exocrine secretion is made up of a number of enzymes that are discharged into the intestine to aid in digestion. The endocrine secretion, insulin, is important in the metabolism of sugar in the body

The pancreas is a small (5 to 6 inches) gland that produces insulin and enzymes used for digestion. Insulin regulates the use of blood sugar throughout the body and is therefo … re necessary for life. The pancreas also produces a fluid that neutralizes stomach acid. The beta cells of the pancreas also make insulin which helps control blood glucose levels and allows glucose to enter the cells to be used for energy. Pancreas: Function The pancreas is a small organ, approximately six inches long, located in the upper abdomen, and adjacent to the small intestine.
In pancreatitis, enzymes of the exocrine pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas. Detection of some of these enzymes, such as amylase and lipase in the blood, along with symptoms and findings on X-ray, are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis. The pancreas is a secretory structure with a internal hormonal role (endocrine) and an external digestive role (exocrine) . It has two main ducts, the main pancreatic duct, and the accessory pancreatic duct. These drain enzymes through the ampulla of Vater into the duodenum.

The pancreas produces and secretes digestive enzymes which break down carbohydrates (amylase) and fats (lipase).  The beta cells of the pancreas also make insulin which helps control blood glucose levels and allows glucose to enter the cells to be used for energy. Pancreas: Function The pancreas is a small organ, approximately six inches long, located in the upper abdomen, and adjacent to the small intestine.
The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme.

It has two main ducts, the main pancreatic duct, and the accessory pancreatic duct. These drain enzymes through the ampulla of Vater into the duodenum.
