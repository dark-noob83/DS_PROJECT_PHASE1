Aluminium is the most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. The aluminium-containing bauxite ores gibbsite, boehmite böhmite and diaspore are the basic raw material for primary aluminium. Production, proven economically viable reserves of bauxite are sufficient to supply at least another 100 years at current. demand
Aluminium production starts with the raw material bauxite. Bauxite is a mineral found mostly in a belt around the equator. Bauxite, containing 15-25 percent aluminium, is the only ore that is used for commercial extraction of aluminium today. The bauxite occurs mostly in the tropics, in horizontal layers normally beneath a few meters of overburden.
The method. The bauxite (red-brown solid) - aluminium oxide mixed with impurities-is extracted from the earth. The extracted aluminium oxide is then treated with alkali, to remove the impurities. This results in a white solid called aluminium oxide or alumina.
How to extract aluminium from its ore. The method. The bauxite (red-brown solid) - aluminium oxide mixed with impurities-is extracted from the earth. The extracted aluminium oxide is then treated with alkali, to remove the impurities. This results in a white solid called aluminium oxide or alumina. The alumina is then transported to huge tanks.
Other aluminium ores. The aluminium industry is also preparing to use ores other than bauxite in the future. Research to develop extraction processes from other minerals is ongoing, and in the future we envision using more recycled metal, from buildings, for example.
