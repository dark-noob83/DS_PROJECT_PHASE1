Carbon tetrachloride is not flammable, so it can be used in fire extinguishers or as an additive to make other chemicals nonflammable. It is also very useful as a raw material in synthesizing larger, more complicated organic compounds. organic chlorine useful compounds. Carbon tetrachloride is an organic chemical that is commonly used as a solvent. It is also called tetra chloromethane and is composed of molecules that have one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms bonded together in the shape of a tetrahedron.
In the carbon tetrachloride molecule, four chlorine atoms are positioned symmetrically as corners in a tetrahedral configuration joined to a central carbon atom by single covalent bonds. Because of this symmetrical geometry, CCl 4 is non-polar. Methane gas has the same structure, making carbon tetrachloride a halomethane. As a solvent, it is well suited to dissolving other non-polar compounds, fats, and oils. It can also dissolve iodine. 
CAS ID #: 56-23-5. Summary: Carbon tetrachloride is a manufactured chemical that does not occur naturally. It is a clear liquid with a sweet smell that can be detected at low levels. It is also called carbon chloride, methane tetrachloride, perchloromethane, tetrachloroethane, or benziform. Carbon tetrachloride is most often found in the air as a colorless gas. It is not flammable and does not dissolve in water very easily. 
Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) is a colorless liquid and a solvent. Even though it is not flammable, we still recommend a secure chemical storage building or container that meets specific regulations for storing Carbon Tetrachloride. That’s why we suggest one of the following: CHEMLoc, DRUMLoc. 1 Store in compliant chemical storage building. 2  Compatible Details: 3  Description: Carbon tetrachloride, also known by many other names, is the organic compound with the formula CCl4. 4  It was formerly widely used in fire extinguishers, as a precursor to refrigerants, and as a cleaning agent.
It is also called carbon chloride, methane tetrachloride, perchloromethane, tetrachloroethane, or benziform. Carbon tetrachloride is most often found in the air as a colorless gas. It is not flammable and does not dissolve in water very easily. Highlights. Carbon tetrachloride does not occur naturally. Exposure to this substance results mostly from breathing air, drinking water, or coming in contact with soil that is contaminated with it. Exposure to very high amounts of carbon tetrachloride can damage the liver, kidneys, and nervous system.
Carbon tetrachloride is miscible with most aliphatic solvents and it is a solvent itself. The solubility in water is low. It is non-flammable and fairly stable in the presence of air and light. Decomposition of carbon terachloride forms phosgene, carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid. It is made by combining elemental chlorine with simple carbon compounds like methane or carbon disulfide. It is a liquid at room temperature, with a freezing point of -9.4°F (-23°C) and a boiling point of 170.6°F (77°C). Carbon tetrachloride dissolves other organic materials such as oils, fats, and grease very well.

It's also called carbon chloride, methane tetrachloride, perchloromethane, tetrachloroethane, or benziform. Trade names include Benzinoform, Freon 10, Halon 104, Tetraform, or Tetrasol. Carbon tetrachloride is most often found as a colorless gas. It's not flammable and doesn't dissolve in water very easily. It was used in the production of refrigeration fluid and propellants for aerosol cans, as a pesticide, as a cleaning fluid and degreasing agent, in fire extinguishers, and in spot removers. 
Chemical reference number (CAS): 56-23-5. Carbon tetrachloride (Carbon tet) is a non-flammable colorless liquid with a heavy, sweet odor. Before 1970, carbon tet was widely used as a cleaning fluid in home and industry. Until 1986, the chemical was used as a grain fumigant. Carbon tet is still used to manufacture propellants and other industrial chemicals
