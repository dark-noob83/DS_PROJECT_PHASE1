In most of Canada Daylight Saving Time begins at 2:00 a.m. local time on the second Sunday in March.
In most states in the USA and in most provinces in Canada, Daylight-Saving Time (DST) is observed. During DST the time is shifted forward by 1 hour to EDT; which is 4 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT-4). After the Summer months Eastern Time is shifted back by 1 hour to US Eastern Standard Time (EST) or (GMT-5).
Eastern Standard Time (EST) is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) . This time zone is a standard time zone and is used in: North America, Caribbean, Central America. This time zone is often called Eastern Time Zone. See full time zone map.
The Eastern Time Zone is also known as Eastern Standard Time (EST) falls mostly along the east coast of North America.
