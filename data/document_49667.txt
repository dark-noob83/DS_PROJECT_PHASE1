A CBC (complete blood count) blood test can be used to monitor MCH levels in blood. Lab Tests Online explains that the MCH aspect of a CBC test â€œis a measurement of the average amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin inside a red blood cell.
A. MCH stands for mean corpuscular hemoglobin. It estimates the average amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell, measured in picograms (a trillionth of a gram). Automated cell counters calculate the MCH, which is reported as part of a complete blood count (CBC) test.
The MCH blood test is only one of three indices of red blood cells, the other two being MCV and MCHC. These measurements can help in diagnosing medical problems. Normal hemoglobin levels should be between the range of 26 to 33 picograms for each red blood cell.
The MCH blood test is done as a component of a blood test called a Complete Blood Count (CBC), which evaluates the composition of the blood, checking hematocrit, white blood cells (WBC) and platelets as well as hemoglobin and red blood cells (RBC). It is usually ordered to get an overview of general health.
What High Levels Mean. MCH levels in blood tests are considered high if they are 35 or higher. A normal hemoglobin level is considered to be in the range between 26 and 33 picograms per red blood cell. High MCH levels can indicate macrocytic anemia, which can be caused by insufficient vitamin B12.
MCH blood test. An MCH blood test checks your Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin. MCH is part of a CBC or complete blood count. The test is designed to measure the average amount of hemoglobin carrying oxygen inside red blood cells. Some cells will have an MCH that is higher, whereas red cells that are microcytic will have lower values.
