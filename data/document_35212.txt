What is Uranus like? Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue. Uranus also has faint rings.
Just similar to the other planets that are considered as giant, Uranus consists of a ring system, a number of moons and magnetosphere. Its configuration is unique from among the other planets because the rotation of its axis is tilted sideways near its plane of revolution in the sun.
It appears that Uranus does not have a rocky core like Jupiter and Saturn but rather that its material is more or less uniformly distributed. Uranus' atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane. Like the other gas planets, Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around rapidly.
Uranus Facts. Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It’s not visible to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope. Uranus is tipped over on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees.
Like the other gas planets, Uranus has rings. Like Jupiter's, they are very dark but like Saturn's they are composed of fairly large particles ranging up to 10 meters in diameter in addition to fine dust. There are 13 known rings, all very faint; the brightest is known as the Epsilon ring.
Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and the first to be discovered by scientists. Although Uranus is visible to the naked eye, it was long mistaken as a star because of the planet’s dimness and slow orbit. The planet is also notable for its dramatic tilt, which causes its axis to point nearly directly at the sun.
Uranus is a called a Jovian Planet (or a Giant Planet), like Neptune, Saturn, and Jupiter. Uranus takes approximately 84 years to orbit the Sun. Uranus and Neptune each h … ave a mass about 15 times that of the earth and hence only 5% as great as Jupiter.
