If it gets more severe and causes symptoms, your low hemoglobin count may indicate you have anemia. A low hemoglobin count is generally defined as less than 13.5 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter (135 grams per liter) of blood for men and less than 12 grams per deciliter (120 grams per liter) for women.
A low hemoglobin count is a commonly seen blood test result. Hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb) is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. In many cases, a low hemoglobin count is only slightly lower than normal and doesn't affect how you feel.
Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a part of your red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen through your body. If you do not have enough iron, your body makes fewer and smaller red blood cells. Then your body has less hemoglobin, and you cannot get enough oxygen. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia.
If your red blood cell count is low, you might be told you have anemia. Anemia means your blood has too little hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of the red blood cell (RBC) that carries oxygen to all the cells in your body. Normal levels of hemoglobin can vary a bit based on age, sex, and which lab does the test.
A hemoglobin count is the amount of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries iron in it, which allows it to carry much more oxygen than your blood could if it didn't have the iron. If your hemoglobin is low, that usually means that your red blood cell count is low. That could have any one of many causes, from an iron deficiency (if you're male you might not want to correct this. More iron in your blood means more cholesterol plaques in your arteries, and thus more heart disease.
