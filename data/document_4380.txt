In philosophy, ethics defines what is good for the individual and for society and establishes the nature of duties that people owe themselves and one another.

(August 2007). Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy in which ethics is based solely on human faculties such as logic, reason or moral intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance (which is the source of religious ethics). Secular ethics frameworks do not necessarily contradict all theological values. For example, the Golden Rule or a commitment to non-violence, could be supported by those within religious and secular frameworks.
