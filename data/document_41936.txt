Caddies travel all over the world with players for weekly tournaments, usually about 30 weeks a year. Medioimages/Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty Images. Pay structure. Most PGA Tour caddies make a salary of between $1,000 and $1,500 a week, plus a percentage of the player’s winnings each week. Ablestock.com/AbleStock.com/Getty Images. What most caddies make. Caddies on the PGA Tour who work 30 weeks a year will usually make at least $50,000 annually. That figure goes up depending on how successful the caddie’s golfer is during the year.
Using the 2013 PGA Tour Money List, the minimum Tiger Woods' caddie would have received was $427,671. Because Tiger won five times in 2013, it's reasonable to assume the caddie made far more. In all, 33 golfers made more than $2 million in 2013. That means those caddies would receive a minimum of $100,000 in bonuses. Another 50 golfers made between $1-$2 million, resulting in bonuses of at least $50,000. And if you were the caddie who finished 125th on the money list (the last person to guarantee a PGA Tour card for 2014), you would have received at least $30,508 in bonuses.
Caddies don't have an annual salary like most people do. The President of the Professional Caddies Association (PCA) recently told reporters that high end caddies typically earn a base weekly salary of somewhere between $1,000-$1,500. Again, caddies negotiate this deal with the golfer on a case by case basis. Some could make more. Some could make less. The average PGA Tour player plays between 20-30 events per year, so it would make sense to assume that the average salary would range from $20,000-$45,000. Bonuses: The real money for caddies comes from bonuses. The PCA President also explained that caddies earn at least 5% what the golfer makes in a given week. Another 50 golfers made between $1-$2 million, resulting in bonuses of at least $50,000. And if you were the caddie who finished 125th on the money list (the last person to guarantee a PGA Tour card for 2014), you would have received at least $30,508 in bonuses.
Caddies are paid on the basis of how well their player performs: a base salary of $1,000 a week plus 5% of the tournament purse, 7% of a top 10 and 10% for a victory, according to Cone. But they do get paid. A lot. At the top end, caddy pay days can be better than many players in the field. Since June 2006, Tony Navarro, Adam Scott’s caddy, has pulled in $442,548; Allistair Matheson, who walks with Geoff Ogilvy, made $337,888.
The Facts. A PGA tour caddy can make several arrangements with a player concerning his salary. Most PGA Tour caddies make between $1000 and $1500 per week, but they also make a percentage of what the player wins in the tournaments. This usually equates to 5 percent of any finish outside the top 10. Players breaking into the top 10, but not winning, will share 7 percent of their prize with their caddies.
