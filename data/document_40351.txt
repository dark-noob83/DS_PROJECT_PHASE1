Branches of the Trigeminal Nerve. The ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve leave the skull through 3 separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum, and the foramen ovale, respectively.
1 Olfactory nerve is the only sensory cranial nerve that projects directly to the cerebral cortex. 2  Optic nerve terminates in thalamus. 3  Vagus nerve is the only cranial nerve which supplies in areas other than head and neck. 4  Trochlear nerve is the only cranial nerve to emerge from dorsal surface of brain stem.
The ophthalmic nerve is the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. It arises from the convex surface of the gasserian ganglion, in the dura of the lateral wall of the cavernous venous sinus under CN IV and above the maxillary nerve, as seen in the image below. Diagram showing the structures in the cavernous sinus.
The trigeminal nerve is the fifth cranial nerve and its primary role is relaying sensory information from the face and head, although it does provide motor control to the muscles of mastication.
The semilunar (gasserian or trigeminal) ganglion is the great sensory ganglion of CN V. It contains the sensory cell bodies of the 3 branches of the trigeminal nerve (the ophthalmic, mandibular, and maxillary divisions). The ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory.
