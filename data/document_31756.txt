With medium chicken thighs: with bone in, bake about 40 minutes. Put on rack if desired and after 20 minutes turn the meat. Oven temp 400 or 350 for a little longer. I assum … e you will be using herbs, etc. Hope this heps.
Directions. 1  Arrange chicken thighs/leg quarters skin side up in a shallow baking dish. 2  Sprinkle with garlic powder. 3  Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce on each piece. 4  Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 minutes to an hour, until the skin is crisp and brown and the meat is ready to fall off the bones.
Just lay the chicken inside. Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165°F. Boneless, skinless thighs cook quickly. Check after 20 minutes, and if they are not quite up to temperature, put back in the oven and continue cooking and checking the temperature in 5-minute increments.
45 mins to an hour for bo … ne-in chicken (thighs,legs,breast) at 350 degrees ..either way,pierce it with a fork,if the juice comes out clear and NOT pink, it is cooked.    I always bake my thawed chicken breasts at 375 degrees for 50 min. and they come out juicy and fully cooked. The juices need to run clear.

Insert a meat thermometer in the center of the chicken thigh about halfway between the top and bottom of the piece of meat. Bake the chicken thigh until the temperature reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which should take approximately 30 to 40 minutes depending on the thickness of the meat.
Bake the chicken, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink inside. You can bake the chicken legs in a 375°F. oven, if desired. Increase the baking time to 45 to 50 minutes.
