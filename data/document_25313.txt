The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression —the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell.
The cell wall is responsible for providing structural support for the cell. It prevents the cell from bursting when excess water enters. Animal cells do not have a cell wall … , only a cell membrane. The main function of the cell membrane is to keep substances out of and inside the cell. 1 person found this useful. Scott Wohlgamuth.
The Cell Nucleus: The cell nucleus is a membrane bound structure that contains the cell's hereditary information and controls the cell's growth and reproduction. It is the command center of a eukaryotic cell and is commonly the most prominent organelle in a cell. Like the cell membrane, the nuclear envelope consists of phospholipids that form a lipid bilayer. The envelope helps to maintain the shape of the nucleus and assists in regulating the flow of molecules into and out of the nucleus through nuclear pores.
In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. nuclei; from Latin nucleus or nuculeus, meaning kernel) is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types have no nuclei, and a few others have many. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression —the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell.
What constitutes a cell? More than any other structures, it's the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane. Explore the form and function of these three critical cell parts in this video segment adapted from Carolina Biological Supply's An Introduction to the Living Cell. Transcript.
The word nucleus is derived from a Latin word nucleus or nuculeus which means 'kernel'. Nucleus a double-membrane bound cell organelle present in eukaryotic cells. The nucleus constitutes most of the genetic material of the cell-the DNA. The nucleus maintains the integrity of the genes which regulate the gene expression, in-turn regulating the activities of the cell. Plant cell nucleus is a double-membrane bound organelle. It controls the activities of the cell and is known as the master mind or the control center of the cell. The plant cell wall has two layers-the outer membrane and the inner membrane, which encloses a tiny space known as perinuclear space.
the main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. It is the nucleus, or, rather, those things in it, that control what the cell does, including those activities that keep the cell alive, as well as the things it does to contribute to the functioning of the organism whose structure it is a part of. 4 people found this useful.

The nucleus of the cell contains much of the DNA of the cell, and it regulates the activities of that cell, whatever those activities are. The nucleus is composed of chemical … structures that orchestrate chemical reactions that make the cell function.

Animal cell nucleus is a membrane bound organelle. It is surrounded by double membrane. The nucleus communicates with the surrounding cell cytoplasm through the nuclear pores. The DNA in the nucleus is responsible for the hereditary characteristics and protein synthesis. Plant cell nucleus is a double-membrane bound organelle. It controls the activities of the cell and is known as the master mind or the control center of the cell. The plant cell wall has two layers-the outer membrane and the inner membrane, which encloses a tiny space known as perinuclear space.
