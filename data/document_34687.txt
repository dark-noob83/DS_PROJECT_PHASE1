Although cholesterol is synthesized from squalene in human body, dietary intake of squalene does not elevate serum cholesterol level. Amounts of squalene present in human tissues vary, being rich in areas which have high sebaceous glands (face, forehead) and low in areas having poor sebaceous glands.
Cholesterol synthesized by the liver, as well as any dietary cholesterol in the liver that exceeds hepatic needs, is transported in the serum within LDLs. The liver synthesizes VLDLs and these are converted to LDLs through the action of endothelial cell-associated lipoprotein lipase.
Cholesterol is also the precursor from which the body synthesizes vitamin D. One of the major uses of cholesterol is the synthesis of bile acids. These are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and are secreted in the bile. They are essential for the absorption of fat from the contents of the intestine.
Cholesterol is synthesized in human body from squalene (Fig. 3). Squalene is cyclized by an enzyme called squalene cyclase to form cholesterol (Liu et al., 1975). Steps involved in the process are cyclization and carbocation. Squalene epoxide formed is converted to lanosterol by the enzyme catalase.
BioFiles 2007, 2.7, 3. Cholesterol levels in the body come from two sources, dietary intake and biosynthesis. The majority of cholesterol utilized by healthy adults is synthesized in the liver, which produces ~70% of the total daily cholesterol requirement (~1 gram). The other 30% comes from dietary intake.
