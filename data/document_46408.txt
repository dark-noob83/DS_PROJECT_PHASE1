The sciatic nerve branches into different parts of the body along its path, hence its ability to supply such a large area of the body. It is a mixed-function nerve, meaning that it contains both sensory neurons and motor neurons.
The sciatic nerve is a major nerve of the lower limb. It is a thick flat band, approximately 2cm wide – the largest nerve in the body. In this article, we shall look at the anatomy of the sciatic nerve – its anatomical course, motor and sensory functions, and its clinical correlations.
Location. The sciatic nerve is the largest single nerve in the body. It begins in the lower part of the back and runs through the hip/buttock region, giving off two branches; the articular branch, which provides nerve function to the hip-joint, and the muscular branch, which extends into the muscles of the thigh.
Sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is the dominant nerve that innervates the lower back and the lower extremities. It travels from the lower spine, through the pelvis, and down each leg. It is the longest and widest nerve in the human body.

Sciatica is pain, tingling, or numbness produced by an irritation of the nerve roots that lead to the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is formed by the nerve roots coming out of the spinal cord into the lower back. It goes down through the buttock, then its branches extend down the back of the leg to the ankle and foot.
Save. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and runs from the lower portion of the spine, through the buttocks and down into the thigh and lower leg. It is responsible for feeling and movement in the major muscles of the hamstring, lower leg, and foot.
