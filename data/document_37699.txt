Official records aren't kept of BASE jumps, but Aiello estimates that 10,000 people around the world have jumped at some point. The number of weekly BASE jumpers is probably about 1,000 and another 1,500 people may jump a couple times a year. Aiello stopped counting his BASE jumps after his 1,000th in 2003. Most regular BASE jumpers have probably flown in a wingsuit at some point, but only a small number regularly jump in one, Aiello said. Of that number, only 20 to 50 people in the world practice the type of terrain flights Potter did, flying through canyons and just inches from rock walls and treetops.
BASE #1 was awarded to Phil Smith of Houston, Texas in 1981. The 1000th application for a BASE number was filed in March 2005 and BASE #1000 was awarded to Matt Harley Moilanen of Grand Rapids, Michigan. As of December 2014, over 1,850 BASE numbers have been issued. 1 On August 26, 1992 Nic Feteris and Glenn Singleman (two Australians) made a BASE jump from an altitude of 20,600 feet (6286 meters) jump off Great Trango Towers Pakistan. 2  It was the world's highest BASE jump off the earth at the time.
The BASE Fatality Statistics (BFS) is a statistical breakdown of fatalities from 1981 to present out of 272 fatalities (Updated to October 9, 2015). Media Advisory-This information is proprietary and only for the internal use of the BASE jumping community. 
Just Base-Jumping heroes! BASE jumpers are the people that are using a parachute to jump from fixed objects. “BASE” is an acronym that stands for categories of objects from which they can jump: Building, Antenna, Span (bridge), and Earth (cliff). Basenumbers.org is an unofficial website that tracks the numbers and their dates. It has a chart that gives an idea of the growth of the sport. It is not mandatory to get your BASE number. There are many successful BASE jumpers without a number.
BASE jumping as of 2006 has an over-all fatality rate estimated at about one fatality per sixty participants. A study of 20,850 BASE jumps from the same site (the Kjerag Massif in Norway) reported 9 fatalities over the 11-year period from 1995 to 2005, or 1 in every 2,317 jumps. 1 On August 26, 1992 Nic Feteris and Glenn Singleman (two Australians) made a BASE jump from an altitude of 20,600 feet (6286 meters) jump off Great Trango Towers Pakistan. 2  It was the world's highest BASE jump off the earth at the time.
BASE jumping, also sometimes written as B.A.S.E. jumping, is parachuting or wingsuit flying from a fixed structure or cliff. BASE is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: building, antenna, span, and Earth (cliff). 1 On August 26, 1992 Nic Feteris and Glenn Singleman (two Australians) made a BASE jump from an altitude of 20,600 feet (6286 meters) jump off Great Trango Towers Pakistan. 2  It was the world's highest BASE jump off the earth at the time.
BASE jumping is one of the world’s most dangerous recreational activities. This BASE Jumping Fatality List table shows a statistical breakdown of fatalities from 1981 To present. The nature of BASE jumping is that many of the statistics about this sport have to be taken with a grain of salt. No one keeps records on the many jumps that happen at night, in the boondocks or with no one else around. However, the current BASE number is above 1,800, and the World BASE Fatality List reached 97 on Feb 6, 2013
Carl developed the BASE number system soon thereafter. Anyone who accomplishes a jump is recorded in a notebook. When they complete one jump of each type, they are assigned a BASE number in sequence of the people who have completed all four types before. Carl was BASE number 4. In 1984, he died while BASE jumping in Norway.
