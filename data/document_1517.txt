The problem and biggest expense is engineering a slab and perhaps moving concrete back to make it happen. I'd guess starting at $20,000 if the house is built and now you want to add garage space. If building from start seems like many builders will add for $8000-$15000 1 car space depending on the neighborhood. 
Adding a garage to a home can require an extensive amount of work, and for this project we will assess the cost of building an attached garage of 676 square feet (26'x26') to a pre-existing home (this is going to easily accommodate two vehicles, provide storage and even have room for a small work area). 1 According to author Stu Silverman the average cost of adding a garage begins at roughly $7,500, and for a two-car garage the average costs will go much higher. 2  This sort of structure will average at $27,040. 3  The resale value of this update would hold at $21,635, or a nearly 81% return on investment

Denise Sands, Agent, Naples, FL. The cost to build a garage can vary from state to state. In PA, I have seen the price to be a low of $15,000 to a high of $25,000 for a 2 car garage. However, as with most improvements to your home, the value of your property does not increase proportionately. You can expect to receive an appraised value of $5,000 to $10,000 for this addition

1 The cost of adding a porch can range from $50-$120 for do-it-yourself materials for a simple concrete slab to $3,000-$6,000 to have someone pour a 50x20-foot slab. 1 Adding new floor space for a 400-square-foot family room can run $10,000-$20,000 for a do-it-yourself project, or $30,000-$100,000 or more for an addition built by a contractor.
1 Upgrading the quality of materials can bump the cost to $55 a square foot, or $13,200 for a minimum single-car structure, $21,000 for a two-car garage and $47,000 or more for the dream version. 1 Accomplished do-it-yourselfers can cut costs considerably; materials for a single-car garage with a door but no windows start at $3,000-$4,000, depending on the size and style.
According to CostHelper, contractors usually charge $35 to $45 per square foot for a basic garage, and up to $55 per square foot for a garage built with higher quality materials. For a basic single-car garage, that comes to between $9,240 and $11,880. A higher-end, single-car structure might cost as much as $14,520. According to Garaga, a single garage should be at least 12 feet wide by 22 feet long (264 square feet), and a double garage should be 18 feet wide by 22 feet long (396 square feet). Building bigger can bring the price up. Costhelper says an 850-square-foot garage with plenty of storage space could cost $38,000 or more.
