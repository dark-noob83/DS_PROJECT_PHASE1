It is also called the Golgi apparatus or Golgi complex. The function of the Golgi body includes sorting and processing proteins. After proteins are assembled in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, they travel to the Golgi body for processing and distribution throughout the cell or to an extracellular destination.
Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824l, USA. ERD2-GFP targeted to Golgi bodies in an Arabidopsis trichome cell. The Golgi apparatus is an organelle that is central to the life of the plant cell and is composed of hundreds to thousands of mini-stacks that move in the cytoplasm.
The Golgi bodies receive proteins and other newly formed materials from the endoplasmic reticulum package them, and distribute them to other parts of the cell.
The Golgi apparatus (GA), also called Golgi body or Golgi complex and found universally in both plant and animal cells, is typically comprised of a series of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered sacs called cisternae that look something like a stack of deflated balloons.
The function of the Golgi apparatus is that it modifies, sorts, and packages proteins. It receives protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and prepares them for secretion from the cell. This often involves adding carbohydrates to the proteins to make glycoproteins.
Golgi Apparatus. A major organelle in most eukaryotic cells is the structure of membrane-bound sacs called the Golgi apparatus (or Golgi body, Golgi complex, dictyosome). It acts to process and package the macromolecules such as proteins and lipids that are synthesized by the cell. It has been likened to the cell's post office.
