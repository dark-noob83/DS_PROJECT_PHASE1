WHO WE ARE. Kentucky has 38,000 cattle farms (2009) with the average herd size of 27 head and the majority being family-owned. The state is home to over 2.15 million cattle (2012) making it the fourteenth largest cattle state. 
If the mature weight of our cows is a normal distribution around the average, then by definition half weigh more than 1,350 lbs. That's where the problem lies in terms of production efficiency. That leads us to an even more important question. According to the “National Market Cow and Bull Beef Quality Audit — 2007,” a survey of 23 packing plants, the average BCS for 2,800 head of cows was 4.53. Based on a BCS of 4.53, the expected range in dressing percent is 45-49%, with the average at 47%.
1 Bigger Cows, More Feed. 2  The amount of beef produced per cow has seen an 18% improvement over the past 20 years. 3  The average cow size across all breeds is 1,390 lbs., with less than 100 lbs. For the Angus breed, yearling weight, which is considered a reliable indicator of mature weight, has increased 96 lbs. since the early 1970s. In that same time period, Angus steer weights have increased 300 lbs., and heifers are up 239 lbs., on average.
The average beef cow herd is 40 head, but operations with 100 or more beef cows compose 9 percent of all beef operations and 51 percent of the beef cow inventory. Operations with 40 or fewer head are largely part of multi-enterprises, or are supplemental to off-farm employment. 
By dividing the cows' average carcass weight — 475 lbs. in 1975 and 621 lbs. in 2005 — by 47%, we approximate the live weights at slaughter, which is 1,010 lbs. and 1,321 lbs., respectively. A 1,321-lb. cow at slaughter is a big cow, but that's not her mature weight. The mature weight for cows is established at a constant BCS of 5.0. Because the BCS was estimated at 4.5, the average slaughter weight must be adjusted to a BCS of 5.0 to determine her mature weight. According to the “National Market Cow and Bull Beef Quality Audit — 2007,” a survey of 23 packing plants, the average BCS for 2,800 head of cows was 4.53. Based on a BCS of 4.53, the expected range in dressing percent is 45-49%, with the average at 47%.
Generally dairy cattle are a little taller than beef cattle. For example, Holsteins average around 6 to 7 feet in height and weigh around 1300 to 1500 lbs, whereas an Angus cow averages over 4 to 6 feet in height and average around 1200 to 1400 lbs. Beefalo bulls weigh an average of 2000 lbs. Cows average around  1500 lbs. Beefalo calves are typically born smaller than beef  calves but they gain weight quickly and norma … lly catch up in size  by the time they start eating grass and hay. 1 person found this useful.
The average cow size across all breeds was 1,390 lbs., with less than 100 lbs. separating the heaviest and lightest breeds. Herefords came in heaviest, at 1,419 lbs., followed by Angus at 1,410 lbs., then Red Angus at 1,409 lbs. For the Angus breed, yearling weight, which is considered a reliable indicator of mature weight, has increased 96 lbs. since the early 1970s. In that same time period, Angus steer weights have increased 300 lbs., and heifers are up 239 lbs., on average.

Over the course of thirty years we have increased the mature size of our cows over 300 pounds. Today the average cow in the U.S. weighs 1350 pounds. The more important issue is not so much with the average itself but with the distribution around that average, more specifically the heavier cows. If the mature weight of our cows is a normal distribution around the average then by definition one half of our cows have a mature weight over 135
