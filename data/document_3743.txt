So, how much does the average American spend on groceries each month? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics charts a wide variety of areas including employment, inflation, average pay and benefits, as well as consumer spending. In 2009, they found that the average American spent $6,443 annually food. This works out to spending about 13 percent of the annual household income on food, and a little more than half of that goes to the grocery store. If you divide the annual number by an average of two visits to the grocery store per week, that comes to roughly $60 per trip. Of course, some people make more frequent trips, while others stock up in larger amounts once or twice a month.
