Most patio heaters run on propane, natural gas or electricity. Depending on the fuel type you prefer there are different styles available. Propane and electric patio heaters are available in portable/tabletop, standup, hanging and ceiling/wall mounting. BTU or Btu (The British thermal unit) is a unit of energy equal to about 1.06 kilojoules. It is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. You can compare patio heaters by the amount of BTU’s produced.
Electric patio heaters are directional and there is no heat loss, there is no upfront fuel cost and based on the required (3) 4000 Watt (4KWh) for 40,000 BTU's the average cost of electrical usage per hour is $1.316. BTU or Btu (The British thermal unit) is a unit of energy equal to about 1.06 kilojoules. It is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. You can compare patio heaters by the amount of BTU’s produced.
The cost to install a gas pool heater is $500-$1500 How Much does it Cost to Run a Gas Pool Heater? Like heat pumps, the cost to heat a pool with gas will vary, by pool size and temperature rise, and also by month. The cost to install a pool heat pump is $500-$1000. How Much does it Cost to Run a Pool Heat Pump? It depends on many factors, such as how much you are raising the temperature, outside air temperature, wind speed and whether you cover the pool or not. The largest factor may be the cost of electricity in your area.
The cost to run a pool heat pump is $100-$200 per month. Gas Pool Heaters How Much Do Gas Pool Heaters Cost? Propane or Natural, same price. Gas pool heaters are sized according to the size of the pool, or if you have an attached spa that you want to heat to over 100 degrees. The cost to install a pool heat pump is $500-$1000. How Much does it Cost to Run a Pool Heat Pump? It depends on many factors, such as how much you are raising the temperature, outside air temperature, wind speed and whether you cover the pool or not.

Gas pool heaters are sized according to the size of the pool, or if you have an attached spa that you want to heat to over 100 degrees. Most inground pools will install at least a 250K Btu gas heater, up to a 400K size. The cost to install a pool heat pump is $500-$1000. How Much does it Cost to Run a Pool Heat Pump? It depends on many factors, such as how much you are raising the temperature, outside air temperature, wind speed and whether you cover the pool or not. The largest factor may be the cost of electricity in your area.
Cost per kilowatt hour will determine how much it costs to run an electric heater. All electric heaters run on the principle of turning electricity into heat. The most common way to do this is to power up a wire coil and then use a small built-in fan to blow the heat out of the heating enclosure. Apply the formula 1,500 x 24 ÷ 1,000 x $0.20 to determine the cost to run the space heater for a day. (Dividing by 1,000 changes watt hours to kilowatt hours.) In this case, it will cost $7.20 if it was running for 24 hours straight.
A. Typical 2KW electric patio heater will cost approximate 21p per KW per hour. LPG gas patio heater at max heat (13KW) will cost 16 per KW, turn it down to 7KW and the cost goes down to less than 11p per KW. In the same way as heating a building, electric heating is far more expensive than gas heating. At full power a 13kw patio heater will use less than 1kg of LPG per hour. Older 16kw gas guzzlers burn a great deal more. By fitting the latest high energy burners they'll give plenty of heat without costing a fortune wasting energy and money.
A Propane heater producing 40,000 BTU’s and the average cost of filling a propane cylinder (5 gal) of $16 (approx. 10 hours of fuel), makes the average cost $1.60/per hour for a propane patio heater. Consult your owner manual thoroughly before installing your patio heater. BTU or Btu (The British thermal unit) is a unit of energy equal to about 1.06 kilojoules. It is approximately the amount of energy needed to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. You can compare patio heaters by the amount of BTU’s produced.
Outdoor heaters or patio heaters are often gas powered, but if you want a more cost efficient solution then an electric halogen heater can make a viable alternative. The benefits include: 1  lower running costs (about 10% of a gas heater). 2  near silent operation. 3  no harmful emissions. 4  instant heat. 5  no flammable fuel sources.
