For instance, if you give your daughter $20,000 on December 17, $6,000 of it is taxable. You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax. But if you give your daughter $10,000 in December and wait to hand over the other $10,000 until January 1, both gifts are tax-free.
In 2014, you may give someone up to $14,000 in gifts before paying any gift tax. The $14,000 annual gift exclusion is a limit on nontaxable gifts per person, and you may give multiple people up to $14,000 each without incurring any tax liability. However, the amounts of your annual gift exclusions are limited to a lifetime total of $5,3400 ($10,680,000 for married couples for Tax Year 2014.
How the gift tax works. Currently, you can give up to $14,000 each to any number of persons in a single year without incurring a taxable gift ($28,000 for spouses splitting gifts).
Giving Can Reduce Estate Tax. Giving gifts to friends and family can potentially reduce estate tax liability for individuals with substantial wealth. You can give away $13,000 a year to as many recipients as you wish without eating into your tax unified credit. Giving $13,000 each year to family members like children and grandchildren is a way to draw down the size of your estate and reduce the amount of wealth you leave behind that is subject to the estate tax.
If you use up your lifetime unified credit, further gifts in excess of $13,000 incur a gift tax. The annual gift exemption is $26,000 for married couples.
If your child is married, you can also give up to $14,000 each to his or her spouse. If youâ€™re married, you and your spouse can both make gifts, meaning the maximum gift one couple can gift another couple without filing a gift tax is $56,000. This amount is per calendar year, and does not roll over from year to year.
You first use the annual exclusion to reduce the gift by $14,000 to $100,000. To avoid paying gift tax on the remaining $100,000, you can use an amount equal to the estate tax on $100,000 of your unified credit.
