Although estimates of Hurricane Katrina's staggering toll on the treasury are highly imprecise, costs are certain to climb to $200 billion in the coming weeks. The final accounting could approach the more than $300 billion spent in four years to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Katrina was ten times more destructive than the second most expensive hurricane, Andrew, which was also a Category 5 storm when it hit Florida in 1992. It destroyed $35 billion in property, slightly more than Hurricane Ike, which was a Category 4 at its peak, and cost the U.S. economy $24.9 billion in 2008.
NEW YORK (AP)  Hurricane Katrina caused at least $125 billion in economic damage and could cost the insurance industry up to $60 billion in claims, a leading risk assessment firm said in updated estimates Friday.
That's how one senator's off-the-cuff remark that Hurricane Katrina would cost the federal government $200 billion became the de facto estimate.
In 1992, the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Louisiana cost $35 billion. The price for the 6.7-magnitude temblor in the Northridge area of Los Angeles in 1994 was $15 billion to $20 billion. Members of the Louisiana congressional delegation say it could cost $100 billion just in New Orleans.
The Facts on Hurricane Katrina's Damage. The actual cost of Hurricane Katrina's damage was between $96-$125 billion, with $40-$66 billion in insured losses. Half of these losses were a result of flooding in New Orleans. An estimated 300,000 homes were destroyed or otherwise made uninhabitable.
The median cost is the most accurate measure of the middle of the data because Hurricane Katrina's immense damage, at $145 billion (2011 adjusted), inflates the average cost of a hurricane to close to $9 billion.
