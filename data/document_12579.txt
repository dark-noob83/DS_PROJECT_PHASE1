In the USA a principal contract is about 540 base pay under 8 hours. An extra can make between 50 to Union Extra of 250 base pay under 8 hours. Over time and meal penalties, you get more. If it is a Principal player, they get residuals every time the commercial airs. Off camera, meaning if the principal is not seen in the final cut, they get paid anyway, but a slightly lower rate. 
For SAG (union) actors, the base rate is this: Extras are paid on union scale, with provisions for overtime, costumes, and special duties. Currently, the basic rate for an 8-hour work day for a SAG extra ranges from US $126 to US $309. It all depends on how much you do in the movie. I am non-union, but generally when working on a Union shoot even non-union extras are paid union wages. I did a job for a film called Tenure in 2005 or something like that. I worked a 15 hr day. I made over $1,000. Not sure if things have changed drastically since then but 100 dollars a day seems quite low.
Session Payment. Extras are paid a session fee of $342.40, regardless of where the commercial will air. To figure out an extraâ€™s hourly rate, divide the session rate of $342.40 by eight, the number of hours SAG considers the session rate to cover. Commercial extras earn $42.80 an hour for the first eight hours that they work. Extras who must work more than eight hours are entitled to overtime pay. If meal breaks do not occur on time, extras receive damages. They receive $25 for each of the first two half hours a meal break is late and $50 for each half-hour after.
You can mail the SAG-AFTRA Residuals Trust Department at 5757 Wilshire Boulevard, 7th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036. Performers may also submit their update request in writing by fax at (323) 549-6550. A signature is required in each case. 
For example, for reruns in syndication, the actor is paid 40 percent of the applicable minimum rate for the first rerun program, dropping to 30 percent for the second rerun, 25 percent for the third rerun, and so on until it reaches 5 percent for the 12th rerun and beyond. Currently, residuals on television broadcasts of movies are 3.6 percent; video and DVD is 4.5 percent on the first million dollars of gross receipts and 5.4 percent thereafter. If the movie's producer is also the distributor, then residuals are calculated based on a percentage of the wholesale price paid for the movie. For DVD and home video, the percentage is applied to 20 percent of gross receipts instead of 100 percent of gross receipts
For example, the first Class A use is paid at the same rate as the session fee, $627.75. The second use within the 13-week cycle is $143.95 for an on-camera performer. Uses #3-13 are paid at $114.20 each and the 14th and each use thereafter is paid at $54.75. 1 4th Audition & thereafter: No payment is due for the first 2 hours as long as 3 or fewer performers are called back per role, and none of those performers is on their first audition. ( 2 For each additional half-hour, $39.25 is due.) Otherwise, a performer is entitled to $313.90 for the first 4 hours.
Variables. As a non-union extra, your hourly rate varies widely. On a union production, which may employ non-union background actors after it has met the union quota, non-union extras typically make $8 per hour, as of 2013. At the high end, non-union extras earn about $100 dollars per eight-hour day, or $12.50 an hour. For the 9th, 10th and 12th hours of a workday, you'll receive time-and-a-half pay. If the workday extends beyond 12 hours, SAG rules entitle you to double-time pay. After the 16-hour mark, the hourly rate for SAG extras increases exponentially.
Report Abuse. Most extras do get paid. it all depends on how big the movie is to how much you get paid. A while back i was a movie extra on Charlottes web and got paid $150 a day and did 10 days.. It's great pay for just walking around in the background!! I am non-union, but generally when working on a Union shoot even non-union extras are paid union wages. I did a job for a film called Tenure in 2005 or something like that. I worked a 15 hr day. I made over $1,000. Not sure if things have changed drastically since then but 100 dollars a day seems quite low.
