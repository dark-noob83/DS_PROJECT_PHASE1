Fluorescent lamps-These have the advantage of higher light efficiency with low heat. This type of lamp is the most widely used for supplemental light. It is available in a variety of colors but cool-white lamps are the most common.
TYPES OF GREENHOUSES. There are two basic types: attached and free-standing. An attached structure may be even-span, lean-to, or window-mounted. A free-standing type is usually even-span (symmetrical roof).
Types of Greenhouses. Generally speaking, there are three types of greenhouses: lean-to, detached, and ridge and furrow or gutter connected (Figure 1). Few lean-to greenhouses are used for commercial production because of limitations in size. This type of house is the most popular among hobbyists. Figure 1.
Many different coverings are available for greenhouses. Just as there are many sizes and shapes of greenhouses, there are several types of greenhouse coverings. While all let sunlight into the greenhouse, some coverings are more expensive than others. The coverings also vary on their durability.
The newest type of grow lights use LED technology. One major advantage to the LED lights is the small size. LED lights are only a few inches in diameter and are easy to mount. In some greenhouses, LED lights may be the only practical light option.
