Painkillers are analgesics, or groups of drugs and medications that are intended to reduce or ease pain. Painkillers can range in function and have specific purposes, such as treatment for migraine pain for example, or for the purpose of treating general pain symptoms. 1 Combinations: There are painkillers that are used in combination to provide pain relief through multiple sites of action. 2  Examples include Percocet and Vicodin, which are a combination of opiates and acetaminophens.
You need a prescription for weaker opioids that are not in combination with paracetamol, most NSAIDs (for example, indometacin, or diclofenac), as well as stronger opioids (for example, morphine, diamorphine and tramadol).

Taking painkillers. If you are taking painkillers to control pain, it is very, very important that you take them regularly as prescribed by your doctor. Some people try to take as few as possible by spacing them out. Then you may be in pain before you take your next tablet. This is not good pain control. There are many different painkillers for mild, moderate and severe pain. It is important to help your doctor or nurse get your dose right by giving honest, detailed information about your pain and how well your painkillers are working. If your painkillers are not controlling your pain, there are plenty of others to try.
If the dose you are taking is not enough for you, you will probably find that your pain comes back before the next dose of morphine is due. It is important to keep a note of how much morphine you take and when. Then your doctor or nurse can work out how much you need every 24 hours. Opioids (pronounced oh-pee-oyds) were first made from the juice of the opium poppy. But many are now manmade in a laboratory. There are different types of opioid painkillers. Some are used for mild or moderate pain and others for severe pain.
Step one: Non-opioid drugs for mild pain. Mild pain is treated with painkillers such as paracetamol, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Paracetamol can be used for most types of mild pain.

Chronic pain can be a serious threat to your well-being — but painkillers, which are prescribed to improve the quality of life for people with pain, present a different kind of threat: Addiction and overdose. For example, if you find that the same dose of painkillers that helped you three months ago isn’t quite easing the pain this month, you should contact your doctor to figure out whether you need a higher dose and, if so, how much. Addiction, on the other hand, leads to less rational behaviors, says Compton.
