Measure the depth of your vessel sink and retrofit its support surface to meet the requirements of your sink height. For instance, if you have a 6 1/2 inch high sink vessel and want to maintain a sink height of no more than 34 inches, you will need a countertop or dresser that sits no more than 27 1/2 inches high.
A sink installed at the height of the toilet is incorrectly installed, but toilets are in the 16- 20 inch range. A sink at 30 inches is fairly standard, but if your family is tall, you can go to 36 inch and above, in my market called a luxury height.
Standard Sink Heights. Standard bathroom sink heights range from 29 inches to as much as 36 inches high, depending upon personal preference and the type of sink. For example, pedestal sinks are built between 29 and 33 inches high, while bathroom vanity cabinets with set-in sinks range from 30 to 36 inches in height.
Tall Cabinets. There is no preferred height for tall units. Having said that, you can easily determine the ideal height by adding up the floor unit height, benchtop thickness, splashback and wall unit heights (720mm + 33mm + 450mm + 720mm = 1923 +1/-4mm).
30 inches is the height of the top of the toilet tank. I assumed there was a standard height for sinks so I did not specify to the plumber. He said wall mount sinks standard is lower than vanity or pedestal sink.
The Old Standard. The standard height for bathroom sinks used to be 30 inches. Vanities were built at 28-1/2 inches and a 1-1/2-inch countertop with sink was added on top. These 30-inch-high vanities and sinks are still available and many people find them preferable.
