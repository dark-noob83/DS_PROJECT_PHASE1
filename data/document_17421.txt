Last year, US giant Pfizer, the world's largest drug company by pharmaceutical revenue, made an eye-watering 42% profit margin. As one industry veteran understandably says: I wouldn't be able to justify [those kinds of margins].. In the UK, for example, there was widespread anger when the industry regulator predicted energy companies' profit margins would grow from 4% to 8% this year. Last year, five pharmaceutical companies made a profit margin of 20% or more-Pfizer, Hoffmann-La Roche, AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly.

That’s around 40 percent more than the next highest spender, Canada, and more than twice as much as than countries like France and Germany spend. That’s in part because the U.S. has always been a very attractive market for pharmaceutical companies: It’s big, accounting for 34 percent of the world market; has low levels of price regulation; and offers few barriers to market entry once FDA approval has been secured.
Extrapolated to the global market, pharmaceutical revenue loss is estimated to be $564 billion annually (59% of the $956 billion in actual total global revenue, and 37% of the $1,520 billion in potential total global revenue). 30 On the pharmaceutical revenue side, however, the impact of medication non-adherence had yet to be accurately quantiﬁ ed. The market assumption relied upon to date, and quoted extensively, has been $30 billion globally, 8,10 which we felt was a gross underestimate—prompting this project.
Teradata Magazine predicted that by 2007, $40 billion in U.S. sales could be lost at the top 10 pharmaceutical companies as a result of slowdown in R&D innovation and the expiry of patents on major products, with 19 blockbuster drugs losing patent. The top three best-selling drugs in the United States in 2013 were Abilify ($6.3 billion,) Nexium ($6 billion) and Humira ($5.4 billion). The best-selling drug ever, Lipitor, averaged $13 billion annually and netted $141 billion total over its lifetime before Pfizer's patent expired in November 2011.
Total value of U.S. consumption of pharmaceutical drugs in 2009 was $300 billion, or about 40 percent of the worldwide market share, and reflected a 37-percent increase since 2003. 1 The total value of shipments by domestic producers in 2009 was $142 billion, with $46 billion in estimated exports. 
For the first time ever, in 2011, global spending on prescription drugs topped $954 billion, even as growth slowed somewhat in Europe and North America. The United States accounts for more than a third of the global pharmaceutical market, with $340 billion in annual sales followed by the EU and Japan. (pdf) Emerging markets such as China, Russia, South Korea and Mexico outpaced that market, growing a huge 81 percent. The top three best-selling drugs in the United States in 2013 were Abilify ($6.3 billion,) Nexium ($6 billion) and Humira ($5.4 billion). The best-selling drug ever, Lipitor, averaged $13 billion annually and netted $141 billion total over its lifetime before Pfizer's patent expired in November 2011.
• The global generic medicines market is worth over US$ 80 billion, about 30% of total sales, and is much larger than the commonly reported market in unbranded generics alone. • Patterns of medicines consumption differ between high-and low-income countries. The market share of the USA alone rose from 18.4% of the world total in 1976 to over 52% in 2000. • In low-income countries, the share of pharmaceuticals consumed fell from 3.9% of the total in 1985 to 2.9% in 1999, and their share of sales fell from 0.98% in 1990 to 0.64% in 2000.
Implications Our estimate of $188 billion in pharmaceutical revenue lost annually in the US alone and $564 billion globally due to medication non-adherence is the most accurate estimate to date and points to a far more signiﬁ cant problem than previously believed or acknowledged. 30 On the pharmaceutical revenue side, however, the impact of medication non-adherence had yet to be accurately quantiﬁ ed. The market assumption relied upon to date, and quoted extensively, has been $30 billion globally, 8,10 which we felt was a gross underestimate—prompting this project.
The total level of pharmaceutical revenue worldwide had reached nearly one trillion U.S. dollars. North America is responsible for the largest portion, generating more than 40 percent of these revenues. This is mostly due to the leading role of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Based on prescription sales, NYC-based Pfizer is the world’s second largest pharmaceutical company. In 2013, the company generated some 45 billion U.S. dollars in pure pharmaceutical sales, while total revenue stood at nearly 52 billion U.S. dollars. Other top global players from the United States are Johnson & Johnson, Merck and AbbVie
