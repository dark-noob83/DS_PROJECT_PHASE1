Biotechnology can be defined as the controlled and deliberate manipulation of biological systems (whether living cells or cell components) for the efficient manufacture or processing of useful products. 
The technology that uses living organisms to produce and improve desired products or to manipulate the environment is Biotechnology. Or The use of biological organisms or process in manufacturing industries. Article Summary: The technology that uses living organisms to produce and improve desired products or to manipulate the environment is Biotechnology. DNA fingerprinting is also known as DNA profiling or molecular fingerprinting.
The science of biotechnology can be broken down into subdisciplines called red, white, green, and blue. Red biotechnology involves medical processes such as getting organisms to produce new drugs, or using stem cells to regenerate damaged human tissues and perhaps re-grow entire organs. Blue biotechnology, rarely mentioned, encompasses processes in marine and aquatic environments, such as controlling the proliferation of noxious water-borne organisms.
1 At the beginning of each process development phase, one needs a production cell line or strain that is able to express the protein of interest. 2  Genetic engineering is employed to produce cell lines and strains that are genetically stable, that grow to high densities in a tank environment, and are highly productive. 1 Because of the nature of the antibody molecule, it is possible to 'industrialize' antibody manufacturing, creating in essence an 'antibody assembly line' or standardized platform. 2  This is in contrast to the manufacture of other therapeutics, where manufacturing procedures must often be developed from scratch.
Biotechnology. Biotechnology is the application of biological processes in the development of products. These products may be organisms, cells, parts of a cell, or chemicals for use in medicine, biology, or industry. History of biotechnology. Biotechnology has been used by humans for thousands of years in the production of beer and wine. In a process called fermentation, microorganisms such as yeasts and bacteria are mixed with natural products that the microorganisms use as food.
DNA Fingerprinting-Biotechnological Process. Article Summary: The technology that uses living organisms to produce and improve desired products or to manipulate the environment is Biotechnology. DNA fingerprinting is also known as DNA profiling or molecular fingerprinting.
Insulin crystals. Biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2). 1 Some examples are the designing of organisms to produce antibiotics, and the engineering of genetic cures through genetic manipulation. 2  White biotechnology, also known as industrial biotechnology, is biotechnology applied to industrial processes.
Part of the Nanotechnology glossary: Biotechnology is the use of biological processes, organisms, or systems to manufacture products intended to improve the quality of human life. Blue biotechnology, rarely mentioned, encompasses processes in marine and aquatic environments, such as controlling the proliferation of noxious water-borne organisms.
1 Green biotechnology is biotechnology applied to agricultural processes. 2  An example would be the selection and domestication of plants via micropropagation. 3  Another example is the designing of transgenic plants to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. 1 Some examples are the designing of organisms to produce antibiotics, and the engineering of genetic cures through genetic manipulation. 2  White biotechnology, also known as industrial biotechnology, is biotechnology applied to industri
