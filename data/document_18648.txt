Archaeabacteria is a kingdom in the domain Archaea, and Eubacteria is a kingdom in the domain Bacteria. Both kingdoms contain bacteria that are prokaryotic, unicellular, and a â€¦ utotrophs or heterotrophs. However, Arechaeabacteria have cell walls without peptidoglycan which is the opposite from Eubacteria.
2. Archaebacteria are single celled creatures, while Eubacteria are more complex in nature. 3. Eubacteria has been studied more by human beings because they are found in greater numbers in their environment. They have also been studied more extensively because some have economic importance.
In the past, archaea were classified as bacteria and were called archaebacteria. But it was discovered that archaea have a distinct evolutionary history and biochemistry compared with bacteria. The similarities are that archaea and eubacteria are single-celled organisms that do not have a nucleus or organelles.
The eubacteria and archaebacteria are probably the least known of this categorization. Eubacteria and archaebacteria are two very different kinds of bacteria, each with their own identities and use in our daily lives. Archaebacteria are one of the oldest of organisms found on planet earth. They are composed of a single cell and are called prokaryotes.
Monerans can be classified into three major groups: the eubacteria (True bacteria), cyanobacteria (blue green algae) and archaebacteria (ancient bacteria). The eubacteria are the commonly encountered bacteria in soil, water and living in or on larger organisms, and include the Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.
Archaeabacteria is a kingdom in the domain Archaea, and Eubacteria is a kingdom in the domain Bacteria. Both kingdoms contain bacteria that are prokaryotic, unicellular, and autotrophs or heterotrophs. However, Arechaeabacteria have cell walls without peptidoglycan which is the opposite from Eubacteria.
The three groups are thermophiles, halophiles and methanogenes. Archaebacteria have evolutionary similarities to both eubacteria and eukaryotic organisms, such as humans. The domain bacteria contains the kingdom eubacteria and is known as true bacteria.
