Fractionated coconut oil has a longer shelf life and is more stable than most of the other types of coconut oil. Due to the amount of processing fractionated coconut oil goes through, it is more expensive than most of the other types of coconut oil are.
Fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the whole oil: Certain components of the oil are separated or removed from the oil for a particular use. Different uses of fractionated coconut oil include industrial, medical applications and beauty products. However, it is not the complete, virgin coconut oil.
Features. Fractionated coconut oil is made by using steam and pressure hydrolysis of coconut oil into glycerol and free fatty acids. The fatty acids are then fractionated into the long-and medium-chain acids before medium-chain acids are recombined with the glycerol to create MCT oil, according to Ensminger.
As the name implies, Fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the coconut oil from which almost all the long chain triglycerides are removed, thus leaving mainly the medium-chain triglycerides and making it an absolutely saturated oil.
Fractionated coconut oil is coconut oil that has been processed or “fractioned” to create a very shelf-stable oil. The fraction of the oil that is used is very high in saturated fat, and this product can be used in a wide variety of ways.
Coconut oil has both long-chain and medium-chain fatty acids, but is made up mainly of the medium-chain fatty acids. In fractionated coconut oil, the long-chain fatty acids are removed. You&rsquo;ll often hear fractionated coconut oil referred to as MCT oil, advises the Texas Department of State Health Services.
F ractionated coconut oil is saturated oil. Fractionated coconut oil is processed in a way that removes all the long chain fatty acids, leaving only the healthy medium chain fatty acids.
