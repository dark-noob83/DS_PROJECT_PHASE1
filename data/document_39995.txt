A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a base unit of measure to indicate a decimal multiple or fraction of the unit. Metric prefixes are sometimes called SI prefixes. Each prefix has a unique symbol that is added to the unit symbol. For example, the prefix mega-may be added to ton to indicate multiplication by one million; one megaton is equal to one million tons (1 Mt = 1,000,000 t). Metric prefixes are sometimes used with imperial and US customary units such as microinch and kilopound. In accounting, finance, oil and gas and several other industries, M is sometimes used for a thousand from mille, which is the Roman numeral for a thousand.

In ancient times, the cubit was usually defined to equal 24 digits or 6 palms. The Egyptian royal or long cubit, however, was equal to 28 digits or 7 palms. In the English system, the digit is conventionally identified as 3/4 inch; this makes the ordinary cubit exactly 18 inches (45.72 centimeters). The British Admiralty, in 1830, defined the cable to equal exactly 0.1 nautical (Admiralty) mile, which is 608 feet or about 185.3 meters. Some navies are now using a metric cable equal to exactly 200 meters (about 656.17 ft).
