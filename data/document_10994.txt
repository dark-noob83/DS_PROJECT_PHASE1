Assuming that 2.8 gallons of ethanol are produced per bushel of corn processed, returns would decline by about $0.10 per gallon. If the DDGS/corn price ratio declined to the long term average of 0.91, returns from ethanol production in this example would decline by $0.13 per gallon. With all other prices unchanged, a decline in the price of DDGS would result in a corresponding decline in net returns. The magnitude of that decline can be illustrated using prices as of March 6, 2015--$169.50 per ton for DDGS and $136 per ton ($3.81 per bushel) for corn.
Ethanol prices have tumbled from a 2005 high of nearly $1.75 per gallon (rack) in January to $1.23 in early April. Ethanol splash/rack prices were as low as $1.14-$1.19 per gallon in high-volume markets like Des Moines, Iowa City, Sioux City and Omaha last week (week of April 4-8).. $0.44–$0.31 / liter. Ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol, or grain alcohol, is a flammable, colorless chemical compound found in alcoholic beverages.
If the price of corn remained constant and the ratio declined to 1.0, the price of DDGS would decline by $33.50 per ton, or $0.017 per pound. Assuming that 16 pounds of DDGS are produced per bushel of corn the price decline would result in a decline in returns of $0.27 per bushel. With all other prices unchanged, a decline in the price of DDGS would result in a corresponding decline in net returns. The magnitude of that decline can be illustrated using prices as of March 6, 2015--$169.50 per ton for DDGS and $136 per ton ($3.81 per bushel) for corn.
Economists associate the decline in price with an oversupply of ethanol, which in turn is caused by rather low domestic consumption and increased ethanol production. Ethanol prices have tumbled from a 2005 high of nearly $0.44 per liter (rack) in January to $0.31 in early April. The lowest prices of ethanol were recorded at $0.28 - $0.29 per liter in high-volume markets like Des Moines, Iowa City, Sioux City, and Omaha during the week of April 4-8. Ethanol splash/rack prices were as low as $1.14-$1.19 per gallon in high-volume markets like Des Moines, Iowa City, Sioux City and Omaha last week (week of April 4-8).. $0.44–$0.31 / liter. Ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol, or grain alcohol, is a flammable, colorless chemical compound found in alcoholic beverages.
Crystallization expense savings would be somewhat offset by increased fermentation expenses. Using the 2003-04 average sugar beet market price of $39.15 per ton, the feedstock cost would be approximately $1.58 per gallon of ethanol produced, representing approximately 67 percent of total ethanol production costs. The stoichiometric (theoretical) yield of ethanol from sucrose is 163 gallons of ethanol per ton of sucrose (Rein). The maximum obtainable yield under ideal conditions is estimated at 94.5 percent of theoretical yield, or 154 gallons per ton.
Feedstock and enzyme costs each accounted for a relative 27 percent and 16 percent. Yields have also improved since 2008. According to BNEF, the maximum theoretical ethanol yield per dry metric ton of corn stover is 427 liters. In 2008, yields reached 58 percent of that maximum, increasing to 66 percent in 2012. The reduced cost of enzymes has also be a factor contributing to the reduction in cellulosic ethanol production costs. BNEF said enzymes contributed 30 percent of the total production cost in 2008, but represented only 16 percent of the cost in 2012, a 72 percent reduction.
While the cost to produce corn ethanol averaged approximately 67 cents per liter ($2.54 per gallon), the cost to produce cellulosic ethanol was about 94 cents per liter ($3.55 per gallon). The reduced cost of enzymes has also be a factor contributing to the reduction in cellulosic ethanol production costs. BNEF said enzymes contributed 30 percent of the total production cost in 2008, but represented only 16 percent of the cost in 2012, a 72 percent reduction.
BNEF estimates that the minimum price at which ethanol can be profitably sold based on the semi-commercial plants currently coming online is approximately 94 cents per liter, a 46 percent improvement of the pilot scale costs of $1.75 per liter in 2008. The reduced cost of enzymes has also be a factor contributing to the reduction in cellulosic ethanol production costs. BNEF said enzymes contributed 30 percent of the total production cost in 2008, but represented only 16 percent of the cost in 2012, a 72 percent reduction.
The sugarcane price per ton paid to Brazilian sugarcane growers closely tracks the world raw sugar price. From 1985 to 2000, the world raw sugar price varied in the 4 to 13 cents per pound range. Over the same period, the sugar cane price paid to growers in Brazil ranged from about $7.00 to $14.00 per ton of cane. The stoichiometric (theoretical) yield of ethanol from sucrose is 163 gallons of ethanol per ton of sucrose (Rein). The maximum obtainable yield under ideal conditions is estimated at 94.5 percent of theoretical yield, or 154 gallons per ton.
The estimated coefficient for corn is 0.66, which means a $1 per ton increase in the price of corn increases the price of DDGS by $0.66 per ton. This is substantially smaller than the 0.85 coefficient that we estimated previously. The first estimated coefficient for soybean meal is 0.13, which means a $1 per ton increase in the price of soybean meal over March 2007-December 2010 and October 2014-March 2015 increases the price of DDGS by $0.13 per ton. With all other prices unchanged, a decline in the price of DDGS would result in a corresponding decline in net returns. The magnitude of that decline can be illustrated using prices as of March 6, 2015--$169.50 per ton for DDGS and $136 per ton ($3.81 per bushel) for corn.
