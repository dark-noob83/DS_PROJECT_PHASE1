The cerebrum is divided into two parts, the right side of the brain controls the left side of your body, and the left side of your brain controls the right side of your body. Since your brain is the control panel for your entire body, it doesna€™doesnâ t hurt to get an elementary school lesson on its main components and how they work to keep you. Going your brain is the mother, ship with all the control over every inch of your, body inside and. out
Now the cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres-the left and right hemispheres. For the most part the hemispheres exhibit what we call Contralateral control: which means the left hemisphere controls the right side of out body and the right hemisphere controls the left side.

While both sides of the cerebrum (right and left) are involved in all the activities listed above, brain research shows that the left side of the cerebrum is used more for language and logical processing, while the right side is more for visual and intuitive processing. The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain. It oversees many everyday activities. These include motor function, cognitive abilities (thinking and reasoning), sensory impulse interpretation, speech and language, bowel and bladder control, sexual desire, and emotional control.
The cerebrum is a large part of the brain containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In humans, the cerebrum is the superior-most region of the central nervous system. The cerebrum is also divided into approximately symmetric left and right cerebral hemispheres. With the assistance of the cerebellum, the cerebrum controls all voluntary actions in the body.
Unlike the cerebrum, the left cerebellum controls the left side of the body, and the right cerebellum controls the right side of the body. Other important parts of the brain. The brain is not a solid organ. There are fluid-filled cavities within the brain called ventricles. The brainstem is located in front of the cerebellum. The brainstem is like the hard-drive of a computer. It is the main control panel for the body that passes messages back and forth between the brain and other parts of the body. The cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the spinal cord are all connected to the brainstem.
The cerebrum (right and left) is the upper, front portion of the brain and consists of two hemispheres, or halves. The two hemispheres are connected by the corpus callosum, which is a large bundle of nerve fibers. The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain. It oversees many everyday activities. These include motor function, cognitive abilities (thinking and reasoning), sensory impulse interpretation, speech and language, bowel and bladder control, sexual desire, and emotional control.
The cerebellum is at the back of the brain, below the cerebrum. It’s a lot smaller than the cerebrum, but a very important part of the brain. The cerebellum controls your balance, movement, and coordination. Because of your cerebellum, you can stand upright, and your muscles coordinate for you to move around.

The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is divided into 2 parts (halves) called the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The 2 hemispheres are connected by a bridge of nerve fibres called the corpus callosum. The right half of the cerebrum (right hemisphere) controls the left side of the body.
