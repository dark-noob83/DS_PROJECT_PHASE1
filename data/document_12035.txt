The structure of an arteriole is:             Arterioles are tiny branches of arteries that lead to capillaries.   These are also under the co … ntrol of the sympathetic nervous system, and constrict and dialate, to regulate blood flow. Arterioles are small diameter vessels that branch off of your arteries. They inevitably connect arteries to capillaries. You can find them pretty much anywhere in your body.
An arteriole /ɑrˈtɪəri.oʊl/ is a small diameter blood vessel in the microcirculation that extends and branches out from an artery and leads to capillaries. Arterioles have muscular walls (usually only one to two layers of smooth muscle) and are the primary site of vascular resistance. The greatest change in blood pressure and velocity of blood flow occurs at the transition of arterioles to capillaries. Brain arterioles are particularly sensitive to pH with reduced pH promoting vasodilation. A number of hormones influence arteriole tone such as angiotensin II (vasoconstrictive), endothelin (vasoconstrictive), bradykinin (vasodilation), atrial natruretic peptide (vasodilation), and prostacyclin (vasodilation).
The efferent arterioles are blood vessels that are part of the urinary tract of organisms. The efferent arterioles form from a convergence of the capillaries of the glomerulus. They play an important role in maintaining the glomerular filtration rate despite fluctuations in blood pressure. 
Arteriole: A small branch of an artery that leads to a capillary. The oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) makes the blood in arterioles (and arteries) look bright red. 
You won't believe these 10 facts about people. An arteriole is a small blood vessel that forms a connection between small arteries and capillaries. Arterioles are an important part of the circulatory system. From the arteriole, blood passes into the capillaries. Pores in the walls of the capillaries allow for the exchange of nutrients and wastes that are carried away in the venules connected at the other side. Ad.
These vessels are supplied by small arteries, and small arteries in turn get their blood supply from the large arteries of the body. From the arteriole, blood passes into the capillaries. Pores in the walls of the capillaries allow for the exchange of nutrients and wastes that are carried away in the venules connected at the other side. Ad. Arterioles play an important role in determining how much blood is distributed to organs and tissues
The afferent arteriole in a nephron is a larger diameter then the outgoing efferent arteriole and this increase the blood pressure in the glomerulus capillaries resulting in t … he ultrafiltration of the blood into the Bowman's capsule.

An arteriole is the same thing, but smaller. When the blood vessels (veins and arteries) are supplying blood to a place, the arteries will get much smaller and thinner, going from artery to arteriole to capillary and out the other side. Hope that helps! Source(s): 
Arterioles are very tiny arteries. In some areas of the body there are places where arteries and veins come together in tiny formations to swap oxygenated blood (in th … e arteries) for unoxygenated blood (in the veins). Arterioles are small diameter vessels that branch off of your arteries. They inevitably connect arteries to capillaries. You can find them pretty much anywhere in your body.
