Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD. Nov. 1, 2012 (Boston) -- A pricey new treatment for prostate cancer called proton beam therapy appears to cause slightly less diarrhea, bloating, and cramping than traditional radiation treatments. But the effect is short-lived, a new study suggests.
Therefore, the likelihood of urinary, rectal, sexual side effects, and secondary cancers is lower with proton. In 2010, Medicare spent $1.06 billion on conventional (X-ray) radiation therapy. That same year, Medicare spent $41.8 million on proton therapy, or less than 4% of X-ray cost.
1 For example, Aetna considers proton therapy experimental for certain types of cancer, such as esophageal cancer. 2  For patients not covered by health insurance, radiation therapy can cost $10,000-$50,000 or more, depending on the type of cancer, number of treatments needed and especially the type of radiation used.
