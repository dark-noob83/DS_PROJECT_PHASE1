What does the surgery cost? Spay/neuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country. The low end of the range can be as inexpensive as $50-75 (often in spay/neuter clinics), while vets in major metropolitan areas, where rents and labor costs are very high, often charge several hundred dollars. See our veterinary listings.
It is not cheap, though. Expect around $100+ for a neuter and $200+ for a spay, they need to use a different anesthesia for rabbits than with dogs and cats, make sure you use a rabbit knowledgeable vet. Rabbits can make good pets for some people, as long as you have realistic expectations. Rabbits can get pregnant at 13 weeks of age, so keep them separate until spayed & neutered. Female rabbits have a reproductive cancer rate near 85%, so an unspayed female almost always lives a very short life.
