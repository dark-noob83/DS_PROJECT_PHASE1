The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. Pancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of severe, acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is sudden swelling (inflammation) of the pancreas. A pancreatic pseudocyst may occur in someone with chronic pancreatitis. It may also occur after trauma to the abdomen, more often in children.
Other tests that may be used in the workup of a pseudocyst include: Blood tests. These tests measure levels of certain substances in the blood. A test showing high levels of amylase or lipase, enzymes produced by the pancreas, may indicate inflammation of the pancreas. Ultrasound (sonography).
Back to Top Causes. The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach that produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones, insulin and glucagon. Pancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of severe, acute pancreatitis.
Pseudocysts of the pancreas are abnormal collections of fluid, dead tissue, pancreatic enzymes, and blood that can lead to a painful mass in the pancreas. Pseudocysts usually develop several weeks after an episode of acute pancreatitis (a sudden, painful inflammation of the pancreas).
A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of fluid around the pancreas. The fluid in the cyst is usually pancreatic juice that has leaked out of a damaged pancreatic duct. Pancreatic pseudocysts arise after acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis.
The two most common causes of pancreatitis are gallstones (bile that has hardened into little pebble-like masses) and chronic, heavy alcohol use. Pancreatitis can also result from certain diseases or injury. Pancreatic pseudocysts can develop as a serious complication of pancreatitis.
