One acre is a measure of area which is equal to 4840 sq yd or 1/640  square mile. It does not matter what shape it has.    Historically an acre was the amount of land … a set of oxen could  plough in 1 day. Answer by Ablex. Confidence votes 824. There are 43,560 square feet in one acre so take the length times the width in feet and divide by that figure to find the number or fraction of an acre. If the property is irregular, take length times width of each roughly rectangular chunk and add them together before dividing.
Area is defined as Length times Width 1 Acre (43,560 square feet) is a piece of land whose Length times Width is 43,560. Or if we take the square root of 43,560 we get 208.7 … In other words if a piece of land is 208.7 feet on one side and 208.7 feet on another side this would be 43,560 square feet. Answer by Ablex.

acre. acre, measure of land area used in the English units of measurement. The acre was originally the area a yoke of oxen could plow in a day and therefore differed in size from one locality to another. It is now fixed as 10 square chains or 160 square rods, i.e., 4,840 sq yd, 43,560 sq ft, or 1/640 sq mi. | Share | Cit
The Answer: Because an acre is a measure of area, not length, it is defined in square feet. An acre can be of any shape—a rectangle, a triangle, a circle, or even a star—so long as its area is exactly 43,560 square feet. 
Acres and square footage are terms that are applied to the area of a piece of land. These measurements are extremely important when buying or selling a piece of property. You also may have to measure acres or feet if you are planning a landscaping or building project. An acre is equal to 43,560 square feet. Each side of the square should equal 208.71 feet, which is equal to 1 acre. Create different shapes that equal an acre by dividing the product 43,560 by various values. For instance, you could have a lot that was 150 feet on two of the sides and 290.4 feet on the other two sides.
Finally, to determine the acre-feet of your pond, multiply the surface area in acres by the average depth in feet. The result equals the volume of your pond in acre-feet.. For example, if your pond is one surface acre with a 4-foot average depth, you would have 4 acre feet of water (1 x 4 = 4 acre-feet). 
1 For example, an area that has a width of 500 feet, and a length of 700 feet would be calculated by multiplying 500 by 700. 2  In this case the area is 350,000 square feet. 3  Once you have the total size in square feet, meters or yards you need to convert this into acres. Method 1 of 2: Calculating Acreage for Regularly Sized Land Parcels. 1. Determine the length of the area. To calculate the acreage of a parcel of land you first need to calculate its area in another unit of measurement, which you can then convert into acreage. This is most commonly done with feet, yards, or meter
The area that is the irregular portion of this parcel forms the shape of a triangle. So the dimensions that you need to enter into the Acre Calculator are 70 feet for the width and 20 feet for the length. The Calculate button produces the result at .04 of an acre. The first thing to do is subtract 20 feet from the longer side so the parcel then forms the shape of a rectangle. 1  Enter 70 in the land width (in feet) space. 2  Enter 140 in the land length (in feet) space. 3  Click the Calculate button to find that the area is .22
