Age restrictions on making contributions. Effective 1 July 2013, the government has removed the upper age limit applicable to the Superannuation Guarantee, allowing older workers to continue to grow their super if they are still working, regardless of their age. If the employee is aged between 65 and 74, any additional employer contributions (including those made under a salary sacrifice arrangement) and voluntary after-tax contributions made by the employee are subject to a work test.
1 For the 2015/2016 year: the maximum SG that an employer is legally required to contribute is the equivalent of 9.5% of a person’s salary up to a maximum salary of $50,810 per quarter ($203,240 a year). 2  The maximum quarterly SG payment works out to be $4,826.95 per quarter, that is, $19,307.80 for the year. 1 For the 2013/2014 year: the maximum SG that an employer is legally required to contribute is the equivalent of 9.25% of a person’s salary up to a maximum salary of $48,040 per quarter ($192,160 a year).
For most people, this limit is $50,000 per annum. But if you’re over 50, the cap is $100,000 per annum until 30 June 2012. Concessional contributions up to the limit are taxed at the rate of 15% and this tax is paid by the super fund. If you exceed this limit in a particular year, the excess contributions over the limit will be taxed at an additional 31.5% and the tax bill for this will be sent to you. You will be allowed to withdraw money from your super fund to pay this liability. 
The Work Test applies to people aged 65 to 74 years who want to contribute to their super. To be eligible to make contributions to your super, if you are aged 65 to 74, you must have worked for at least 40 hours over 30 consecutive days in the financial year you wish to make a contribution. You can make any type of contributions to super to the age of 75 if eligible. There is no upper age limit for SG (Superannuation Guarantee) contributions. If you’re working and eligible your employer must pay.
For the 2013/2014 year, the annual non-concessional (after-tax) contribution limit is $150,000, although if you are under the age of 65 the bring-forward rule means that you can bring forward two years of non-concessional contributions, so that you can contribute $450,000 to your fund, if you have the money. The annual after-tax contributions limit applies to each member of the fund, which means that a couple can make up to $300,000 in non-concessional contributions for the 2013/2014 year or as much as $900,000 over a three-year period.
The existing rules relating to upper age restrictions for super contributions are: 1  Voluntary concessional (before-tax) contributions can be made until the fund member turns 75. 2  Non-concessional (after-tax) contributions can be made until the fund member turns 75. Any super contribution made by an individual aged 74 must be received by the super fund within 28 days of the end of the month in which an individual turns 75. For example, if Gerard turns 75 in May, then his super contribution must be registered by his super fund by 28 June.
If your earnings (assessable income, reportable fringe benefits and reportable employer super contributions) are less than $31,920 in the year you make a personal contribution, the Government will contribute 50 cents for every $1 you contribute up to a maximum of $500. Employers are required to contribute only up to a maximum of $16,470 per annum for the 2012/13 financial year (9% 2 of $183,000 known as the maximum contribution base). An employer is not required to make superannuation contributions for employees who earn less than $450 per month.
There is a limit on how much you can put into super each year by salary sacrifice. Most people can contribute up to $30,000, including your employer's 9.5% super guarantee contribution. This is called the concessional contributions cap. If you are eligible and earn $37,000 or less per year, the government may make a further contribution to your super. This amount, up to $500 annually, will be 15% of the before-tax contributions you or your employer made to your super account during the financial year.
For the 2013/2014 year, the maximum you can contribute is $150,000 in a single financial year, and they must also satisfy a “Work test”. If you exceed the $150,000 non-concessional limit, then the excess contributions are subject to the 46.5% penalty tax. The annual after-tax contributions limit applies to each member of the fund, which means that a couple can make up to $300,000 in non-concessional contributions for the 2013/2014 year or as much as $900,000 over a three-year period.
