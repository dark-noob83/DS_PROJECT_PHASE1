By Regina Bailey. Definition: In genetic variation, the genes of organisms within a population change. Gene alleles determine distinct traits that can be passed on from parents to offspring. Gene variation is important to the process of natural selection.
Variation can be measured at the individual level, i.e. differences between individual people, or at the population level, i.e. differences between populations living in different regions. Word origin: Latin variātiōn - (s. of variātiō), equiv. to variāt(us) .
Variation, in biology, any difference between cells, individual organisms, or groups of organisms of any species caused either by genetic differences (genotypic variation) or by the effect of environmental factors on the expression of the genetic potentials (phenotypic variation).
