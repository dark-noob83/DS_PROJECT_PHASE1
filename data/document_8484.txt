7.4.2. Definition. Let G be a finite group, and let p be a prime number. A subgroup P of G is called a Sylow p-subgroup of G if |P| = p k for some integer k 1 such that p k is a divisor of |G| but p k+1 is not.7.4.3. Lemma. Let G be a finite group with |G| = mp k, where k 1 and m is not divisible by p. If P is a normal Sylow p-subgroup, then P contains every p-subgroup of G. 7.4.4.a) Conjugacy of elements defines an equivalence relation on any group G. (b) Conjugacy of subgroups defines an equivalence relation on the set of all subgroups of G. 7.2.3
Definition with symbols. The derived subgroup or commutator subgroup of a group, denoted as or as, is defined in the following way: 1  It is the subgroup generated by all commutators, or elements of the form where. 2  It is the normal closure of the subgroup generated by all elements of the form. The notion of derived subgroup or commutator subgroup naturally arose in the context of finding a natural choice for a good composition series for a solvable group -- solvable groups arise very naturally in the fundamental problems dealt with in Galois theory.
(a) Conjugacy of elements defines an equivalence relation on any group G. (b) Conjugacy of subgroups defines an equivalence relation on the set of all subgroups of G. 7.2.3. Definition. Let G be a group. For any element x G, the set. { a G | axa -1 = x }. { a G | aHa -1 = H }. 7.2.4.
Symbol-free definition. The derived subgroup or commutator subgroup of a group is defined in the following equivalent ways: 1  It is the subgroup generated by all commutators of the whole group. 2  It is the normal closure of the subgroup generated by all commutators of the whole group. The notion of derived subgroup or commutator subgroup naturally arose in the context of finding a natural choice for a good composition series for a solvable group -- solvable groups arise very naturally in the fundamental problems dealt with in Galois theory.
A group G is an abelian group if and only if the derived group is trivial: [ G, G ] = { e }. Equivalently, if and only if the group equals its abelianization. See above for the definition of a group's abelianization.A group G is a perfect group if and only if the derived group equals the group itself: [ G, G ] = G. Equivalently, if and only if the abelianization of the group is trivial.he commutator subgroup can also be defined as the set of elements g of the group which have an expression as a product g = g 1 g 2 ... gk that can be rearranged to give the identity.
The derived (sub)group (or commutator (sub)group) of a group is the smallest normal subgroup of such that the quotient group is abelian. Specifically, let be a group. The group generated by the set of commutators of is called the derived group of. It is also called the commutator group of, though in general it is distinct from the set of commutators of. It is a normal subgroup of —in fact, it is a characteristic subgroup.
Then is the normal subgroup generated by the set of commutators of elements of. Proof. Let be the normal subgroup generated by the commutators of elements of. By definition, . On the other hand, the set generates the group; since the elements of commute, is abelian, and hence.he group generated by the set of commutators of is called the derived group of. It is also called the commutator group of, though in general it is distinct from the set of commutators of. It is a normal subgroup of —in fact, it is a characteristic subgroup.
(Redirected from Derived subgroup). In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, the commutator subgroup or derived subgroup of a group is the subgroup generated by all the commutators of the group. The commutator subgroup can also be defined as the set of elements g of the group which have an expression as a product g = g 1 g 2 ... gk that can be rearranged to give the identity.
