ISAM (pronounced eye sam) stands for Indexed Sequential Access Method. It is a technique for storing and accessing data in a file on secondary storage, for example a disk. ISAM is not a stand-alone program; it is a library of functions that implement an algorithm. It is the heart of many modern database systems.
ISAM stands for Indexed Sequential Access Method, a method for indexing data for fast retrieval. ISAM was originally developed by IBM for mainframe computers. Today the term is used for several related concepts: Specifically, the IBM ISAM product and the algorithm it employs.
CA Gen. ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) is a file management system developed at IBM that allows record s to be accessed either sequentially (in the order they were entered) or randomly (with an index). Each index defines a different ordering of the records.
