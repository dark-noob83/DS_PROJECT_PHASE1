Most planners have at least three types of packages: day of service, consulting and full-service planning. 1 For about $1,500, a day-of planner will help create a wedding timeline, confirm with vendors and handle the wedding day. 2  For about $3,700, a planner will handle the wedding day and offer planning advice and guidance, but will make the couple do the pre-wedding footwork, such as making phone calls.

Report Abuse. I was looking for one in the Sacramento area. I really had no idea how much they cost. Well for a wedding of 50 guests including the bridal party I was quoted $5,200-$7,800. Our wedding budget is not one that would allow that to be spent on a planner. I was kinda shocked. I know that they can do a lot with larger weddings, but ours if fairly small and the venue already has just about everything there. 
Given the average U.S. couple drops $30,000 to tie the knot, it’s no wonder a bride-to-be can experience a bad case of sticker shock. Of course, in an expensive metro area like Los Angeles, the news gets worse. Consider, for example, the prestigious 90210 zip code, where weddings can average as much as $50,000. It’s enough to send even the most traditional bride off to Vegas. But don’t fold just yet. Instead, with a little forethought, you can stage a spectacular Los Angeles wedding without going all in. In fashion crazy Los Angeles, every girl wants to dress to the nines, especially on her wedding day. But fancy designer wedding dresses can cost upwards of several thousands of dollars, which takes a serious bite out of your budget.
