Consider growing onion chives for cooking. Onion chives, also called common chives, are the most popular variety of the plant. Onion chives are slightly onion flavored and scented (as the name suggests), and are used in salads and as toppings for many cooking dishes for a subtle flavor enhancement.
Chives are a member of the onion family, but unlike most onions, the greens are harvested instead of the bulb. In comparison to standard onions, chives have a much milder taste. The small grass-like herb is often added to soups, salads, and sauces for it's light flavor and aesthetic appeal.
Used raw, green onions/scallions add a bit of texture, color, and a milder taste to your cooking than regular onions, as in this recipe for guacamole. They are also delicious grilled whole. Chives are a completely different species, Allium schoenoprasum,  McNeal says.
up vote 8 down vote accepted. Chives are an herb, green onions are part of...well an onion. They are often used in similar ways and in similar dishes. You can substitute one for the others in most cases, but I could not say they are interchangeable.
Chives nutrition facts. Sweet, mild-onion flavored chives are fresh top greens in the onion family of bulb vegetables. Its stiff, hollow, tubular leaves appear similar to that of onions, but smaller in diameter, and appear somewhat like grass from a distance.
In the United States, green onions and scallions may be used interchangeably, however, they are not the same. Green onions have long, slender, green stalks that end in small, white onion bulbs. Chives on the other hand, although part of the bulbous onion family have inconspicuous bulbs. The bulbs are so tiny that they almost pass off as non-existent. Their green stalks are long, tender, and hollow, and resemble grass blades.
Chives are an herb, related to onions and garlic, with long green stems and a mild, not-too-pungent flavor. The green stems are the part of the chives that are used as an herb.
