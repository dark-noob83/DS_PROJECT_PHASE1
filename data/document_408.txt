It is really hot during the day but it is much cooler during the night so that's why rats stay underground during the hot day and come out during the cooler night.
Rats and mice are usually active at night and are not likely to gain entry through open doors and windows during the day. The exception might be when they are under real pressure to find food and shelter. Then they may take the risk of venturing out
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Most definitely. Although mice tend to come out in the night when most of the occupants of the house are asleep or immobile. This allows them to stealthily infiltrate any of your food bags, crumbs etc. During the day time, mice will normally not come out, but if opportunities exist then they surely can.
Hypothesis. The activity levels of the mice will increase when tested at night, when the lights are off, when compared to during the day when the lights are on. Activity level is defined by number of rotations the mice do in a 10-minute period.
If you do see a mouse during the day, you have a real problem. They usually only come out at night, and only during daylight, if they are having trouble getting food. The daytime mice you see, are not the aggressive mice in the group, but the ones that have to wait for the big guys to eat first. Take action or move out.
