On the other hand, the atoms (ions) in ionic materials show strong attractions to other ions in their vicinity. This generally leads to low melting points for covalent solids, and high melting points for ionic solids. For example, the molecule carbon tetrachloride is a non-polar covalent molecule, CCl 4. It's melting point is -23°C. By contrast, the ionic solid NaCl has a melting point of 800°C
In chemistry, an ionic compound is a chemical compound in which ions are held together in a structure by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonds. The positively charged ions are called cations and the negatively charged ions are called anions. 
Materials with ionic bonds normally conduct electricity only in a liquid state. However metals, which have what are sometimes called delocalized ionic bonds, also conduct el … ectricity in the solid state. It is now customary to consider metallic bonds a separate class from both ionic and covalent bonds. The compound formed when Fluorine and Sodium reacts, Sodium Fluoride, is ionic. Ionic compounds are formed when a non-metal, such as Fluorine, reacts with a metal, such as Sod … ium.
Ionic compounds. Ionic bonds form when a metal reacts with a non-metal. Metals form positive ions; non-metals form negative ions. Ionic bonds are the electrostatic [electrostatic: An electrostatic force is generated by differences in electric charge (ie positive and negative) between two particles.
A chemical equation is a way to describe what goes on in a chemical reaction, the actual change in a material. Chemical equations are written with the symbols of materials to include elements, ionic or covalent compounds, aqueous solutions, ions, or particles. There is an arrow pointing to the right that indicates the action of the reaction. The materials to the right of the arrow are the products, or materials that have been produced by the reaction. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that in a chemical reaction no mass is lost or gained. The Law of Conservation of Mass applies to individual types of atom.

Ionic substances form giant ionic lattices lattice: A lattice is a regular grid-like arrangement of atoms in a material. containing oppositely charged ions. They have high melting and boiling points, and conduct conduct: To allow electricity, heat or other energy forms to pass through. Metals form positive ions; non-metals form negative ions. Ionic bonds are the electrostatic [electrostatic: An electrostatic force is generated by differences in electric charge (ie positive and negative) between two particles.
] forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions. Positively charged Na ions and negatively charged Cl ions. The oppositely charged ions are arranged in a regular way to form giant ionic lattices lattice: A lattice is a regular grid-like arrangement of atoms in a material. . Ionic compounds compounds: Substances formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements. often form crystals as a result. Metals form positive ions; non-metals form negative ions. Ionic bonds are the electrostatic [electrostatic: An electrostatic force is generated by differences in electric charge (ie positive and negative) between two particles.
An ionic bond is typically formed between a metal and a non-metal. A bond between two elements caused by a difference in charge created by the donation of an electron by one of the atoms to another. The compound formed when Fluorine and Sodium reacts, Sodium Fluoride, is ionic. Ionic compounds are formed when a non-metal, such as Fluorine, reacts with a metal, such as Sod … ium.
