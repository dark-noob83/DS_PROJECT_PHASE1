Despite numerous studies, the actual cause of the inflammatory bowel diseases remains elusive. It is likely, however, that these chronically recurring episodes of inflammation in the human bowel are related to a complex interaction between various environmental factors and a hereditary predisposition for these diseases.
Crohn's disease is an IBD that cause inflammation of the lining of your digestive tract. In Crohn's disease, inflammation often spreads deep into affected tissues. The inflammation can involve different areas of the digestive tract — the large intestine, small intestine or both.

By Carla Hightower, MD. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to those conditions that cause chronic irritation, redness, and swelling (inflammation) of the gastrointestinal tract. This type of inflammation is associated with a disorder in the body’s immune system.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two different chronic conditions or diseases that may be related, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both diseases consist of inflammation of the wall of the bowel or intestines-hence the name-leading to bowel that is inflamed, swollen and that develops ulcers.
