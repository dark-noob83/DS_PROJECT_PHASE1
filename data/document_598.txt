Rabies Virus Classification. Rabies virus belongs to the order Mononegavirales, which are viruses with a non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA genome. As stated above, the rabies virus is part of the Rhabdoviridae family of viruses, which includes at least three genera of animal viruses:
Rabies is caused by negative strand RNA-viruses belonging to the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae of the order Mononegavirales.
Causes. The rabies virus is a single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Lyssavirus, which is in the family Rhabdoviridae. It is transmitted through the exchange of blood or saliva from an infected animal, and very rarely through breathing in the escaping gases from decomposing animal carcasses.
Main article: Rabies virus. The rabies virus is the type species of the Lyssavirus genus, which encompasses other similar viruses. Lyssaviruses have helical symmetry, with a length of about 180 nm and a cross-sectional diameter of about 75 nm.
Scientific Name for Rabies: A Summary. The preferred scientific name for rabies is the rabies virus. The rabies virus, which is an RNA virus, is part of the Rhabdoviridae family of viruses. It appears that there are several variations of the rabies virus that are able to cause rabies.
The rabies virus has a cylindrical morphology and is the type species of the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family.
Rabies virus belongs to the order Mononegavirales, viruses with a nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA genomes. Within this group, viruses with a distinct bullet shape are classified in the Rhabdoviridae family, which includes at least three genera of animal viruses, Lyssavirus, Ephemerovirus, and Vesiculovirus.
