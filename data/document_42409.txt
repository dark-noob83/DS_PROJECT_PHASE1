Place the tied corn into the sugar water and soak it for three hours prior to grilling. The soaking will help keep the corn juicy and moist while grilling. Preheat the grill. If you have a charcoal grill, light it about 30 minutes before you wish to cook the corn and allow the coals to become completely gray.
1 Prepare your grill, gas or charcoal, with direct, high heat, about 550Â°F. 2 Remove just the visible silks from the tips of the corn. Place the corn in their husks on the hot grill. Cover. Turn the corn occasionally, until the husks are charred on all sides, about 15 to 20 minutes. 3 Remove corn from grill. Let sit for 5 minutes. Use a hand towel to protect your hands while removing the silks and charred husks from the corn. Serve hot, with butter.
The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling. This lets the husk soak lots of water. Then place the corn, still in husk, on a hot grill for about 10 minutes, ~1/4 turn, 10 minutes, turn... until the husk gets brown, even burnt.
1 Place the corn with husks in a pan of water and allow them to soak for 1 to 3 hours before placing on the grill. 2  The longer it soaks the better. 3  Grill the prepared corn directly over medium heat. 4  Cook for 20 to 30 minutes, turning frequently. 5  Corn will begin to steam when it is done.
Soak the corn (optional). Some cooks like to soak their corn before grilling. If you choose to soak your corn, completely immerse the whole corn cobs in a pot or bowl of cold water for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. This allows the corn kernels to soak up additional moisture, making them plump and juicy.
