Ancestry's test uses microarray-based autosomal DNA testing, which looks at person’s entire genome using a sample of saliva. The AncestryDNA autosomal test targets the last few hundred or thousand years. This makes it easier for people to learn more about their more immediate family history.
In summary, Ancestry.com’s AncestryDNA test provides a genetic ethnicity/region calculation based on about 700,000 SNPs and a large collection of both public and proprietary reference databases. The product can currently categorize DNA into at least 22 different ethnicities/regions, with more to come.
Next, we sort the matches by relationship and send you a list of your DNA family. Then it’s your turn. You can use the information to compare ancestors, contact matches through a private and secure message, share what you know, see exactly how you’re related and get new information about the family.
You might be wondering how exactly the DNA test works. There are a few different options to choose from. You can choose a DNA without a subscription to the Ancestry.com service, a DNA test with a subscription to U.S. discovery service or a DNA test with World explorer. Once you choose an option, Ancestry.com will ship you a test kit. The test kit has a small mouth swab which you wipe on the inside of your mouth.
AncestryDNA is an autosomal DNA test that examines your unique genetic code for clues about your family history. Then we use genetic science to determine family relationships within our database of AncestryDNA members and your ethnicity origins.AncestryDNA extracts your DNA from a small saliva sample.
In contrast to Y-chromosome or mitochondrial DNA tests, which only test one line of a person's family and provides information about ancestry several thousand years ago, the AncestryDNA autosomal test targets the last few hundred or thousand years.
