Prokaryotic DNA can be found in a coiled loop floating in the cytoplasm in a region called the nucleoid (meaning nucleus-like). In other words, the nucleoid is the area in a prokaryotic cell where DNA is located. Prokaryotes compress their DNA into a small space through a process called supercoiling. Supercoiling DNA allows it to be packaged efficiently into the small cell.
t is located all throughout the cytoplasm. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus so the DNA is located in the cytoplasm. The DNA in prokaryotic cells is also usually found in a circular ring that is coiled up into figure eights called supercoils.

The DNA in a prokaryote is found in a (usually single) chromosome and in plasmids within the cytoplasm. The chromosome is circular, and consists of a circular molecule of DNA associated with proteins. Its length ranges from about 160,000 to 12,000,000 base pairs.
