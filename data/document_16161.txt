You do not purchase a Roth IRA; rather, you establish it and then fund it. Once funds are deposited in the account, you are free to invest them in a variety of securities, such as stocks, bonds, CDs or mutual funds. A Roth IRA can be a helpful way to save for retirement. Unlike a tax-deferred traditional IRA, a Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars. However, when you begin to make qualified withdrawals, the proceeds are tax-free

With a Roth IRA, you make contributions with money on which you've already paid taxes. Your money can then potentially grow tax-free, with tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided that certain conditions are met. 1. 1. A distribution from a Roth IRA is tax-free and penalty-free provided that the five-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: age 59½, death, disability, qualified first time home purchase. 2.

1 With a traditional IRA, you pay taxes when you withdraw the money, at which point they are taxed as if they are income. 2  For example assume you turn 60, have $1 million in a Traditional IRA, and choose to withdraw $50,000 per year. 3  That $50,000 would be taxed at whatever your income tax rate is at the time. 1 Roth IRA's also allow you to withdraw your contributions any time, tax-free. 2  The key word here is contributions. 3  Any profits from your contributions are subject to the 10% penalty tax unless withdrawn after 59.5.
A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRA rules dictate that as long as you've owned your account for 5 years* and you're age 59½ or older, you can withdraw your money when you want to and you won't owe any federal taxes. No age limit. Contributions to a Roth IRA don't have to stop when you reach age 70½, the cut-off for a traditional IRA. You can put money in your account for as many years as you want, as long as you have earned income that qualifies.
