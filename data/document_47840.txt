Chemical Resistance Gloves. These gloves may be made of rubber, neoprene, polyvinyl alcohol or vinyl, etc. The gloves protect hands from corrosives, oils, and solvents. The following table is provided as a guide to the different types of glove materials and the chemicals they can be used against.
The corrosive glove is similar in appearance to the scientist glove, except it is covered with an unknown, highly corrosive green chemical that inflicts acid damage on a Critical Hit. In addition to the damage caused by the initial attack, the acid will continue to drain HP for a few seconds afterwards.
Gloves should also be worn whenever it is necessary to handle rough or sharp-edged objects, and very hot or very cold materials. The type of glove materials to be used in these situations include leather, welders gloves, aluminum-backed gloves, and other types of insulated glove materials. Careful attention must be given to protecting your hands when working with tools and machinery.
Industrial gloves for protection against corrosive chemicals. Corrosive chemicals such as acids and bases are commonly used in a lot of industrial applications. Provide your workers who have to handle these types of chemicals with chemical-resistant work gloves. Chemical-resistant gloves are formulated to resist chemical degradation thereby protecting your workers hands. These work gloves can be made from nitrile, latex, neoprene, vinyl, PVC or rubber.
The following is a guide to the most common types of protective work gloves and the types of hazards they can guard against: Disposable Gloves. Disposable gloves, usually made of light-weight plastic, can help guard against mild irritants. Fabric Gloves.
Gloves should be worn when handling corrosive chemicals. Nitrile gloves should be adequate for handling most of these in general laboratory settings. An MSDS should be reviewed if handling may involve extended or high exposure to lab personnel to ensure adequate skin protection is provided.
