There are currently two recognized species of wolves, the Canis lupus, or grey wolf, and the Canis rufus, or red wolf. These are two of the species that comprise the Canidae family in the Carnivora order. The red wolf’s Genus name, Canis, is Latin for dog. Rufus is Latin for red, in reference to the red wolf’s coloration. While scientists believe there are roughly 15 subspecies of grey wolves worldwide, there is only one subspecies of the red wolf, the Canis rufus rufus. The Canis rufus floridanus and the Canis rufus gregoryi are the only two other subspecies of the red wolf, but both are now extinct.
Coyotes and wolves are in the same family (Canidae) and genus (Canis) , but are separate species, just as foxes and wolves are separate species. Like wolves, coyotes have been persecuted because of their predatory nature.
The Gray Wolf is closest related to the German Shepherd. The Canidae Family originated from the species Canis Ferox. This was a primitive ancestor of the Gray Wolf that led to the Canis Lepophagus, which is the originating ancestor for the Gray Wolf and all of it's related Canidae Family members.
The genus Canis includes wolves, coyotes, jackals, and the domestic dogs. In the midwestern U.S. at least three members of the genus are found in sites that date from the last Ice Age. These three members are the dire wolf (Canis dirus), the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and the coyote (Canis latrans).
