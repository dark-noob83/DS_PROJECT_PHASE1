Answers. Best Answer: The .925 does mean sterling silver and the FB may be a Hallmark. You did not state what is on the medallion so I don't know where it was made. On some silver items the FB stands for Franz Bibus a Czech silversmith. Best I can do without seeing the item.
good chance it means 10k gold filled but you can always take it to a pawn or jewelry store to have it gold tested. I am a gold buyer and the above answer is half correct. The part where you should take it to a gold buyer and have it tested is correct. The part where they think it is filled may not be correct. I have here a ring I just purchased that says 10k F I have tested the ring and it is pure 10k gold. No filled or plating.
It simply means that the ring is made of 18K gold. 750 indicates that the ring is made up of 75% gold.
