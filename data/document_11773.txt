Triglycerides in plasma are derived from fats eaten in foods or made in the body from other energy sources like carbohydrates. Calories ingested in a meal and not used immediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to fat cells to be stored.
A triglyceride is made of three long chain fatty acids (hydrocarbons) attached to one molecule of glycerol.
A triglyceride is also called a simple lipid and is the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. They are derived from one glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules by dehydration synthesis.
Simply put, triglycerides are fat in the blood, and a high triglyceride level can increase the risk of heart disease. Just what your triglyceride levels mean and how much lowering triglycerides reduces heart disease risk is less clear.
Answer by Banana54. Confidence votes 2.7K. A triglyceride is made of three long chain fatty acids (hydrocarbons) attached to one molecule of glycerol. The number of hydrocarbons in the chains determine the nature of the triglyceride; all three chains may be the same length, or each a different length.
Triglycerides: The major form of fat stored by the body. A triglyceride consists of three molecules of fatty acid combined with a molecule of the alcohol glycerol. Triglycerides serve as the backbone of many types of lipids (fats). Triglycerides come from the food we eat as well as from being produc
By Yolanda Smith, BPharm. Triglycerides are the most common type of fat digested in the body and can be either consumed in the diet or produced in the body. They normally circulate in the bloodstream to supply energy to cells and are stored in body fat as an emergency store of energy.
