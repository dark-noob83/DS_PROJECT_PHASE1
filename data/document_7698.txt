Because there are no multicast routing protocols provided with Windows 2000, the maintenance of entries in the IP multicast forwarding table is a function of IGMP, a component that is added as an IP routing protocol.
IGMP snooping is the process of listening to Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) network traffic. The feature allows a network switch to listen in on the IGMP conversation between hosts and routers. By listening to these conversations the switch maintains a map of which links need which IP multicast streams.
IGMP is a network layer (Layer 3) protocol used to establish membership in a Multicast group and can register a router to receive specific Multicast traffic. (Refer to RFC 1112 and RFC 2236 for information on IGMP versions 1 and 2.).
The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is an Internet protocol that provides a way for an Internet computer to report its multicast group membership to adjacent routers.
However, when acting as the proxy, the router performs the host portion of the IGMP task as follows: 1  When queried, the router sends membership reports to the group. 2  When one of the hosts joins a multicast address group that none of other hosts belongs to, the router sends unsolicited membership reports to that group.
Understanding IGMP Proxy. The purpose of IGMP proxy is to enable a multicast router to learn multicast group membership information and be able to forward multicast packets based upon the group membership information.
The purpose of IGMP proxy mode is to connect a Windows 2000 router to a multicast-enabled IP internetwork, such as the MBone, or a private intranet that is using multicast routing protocols, such as DVMRP and PIM.
