1 trillion = (10^3)^(3+1) = 10^12 which is 1 followed by 12 zeros, ie 13 digits. 1  In those countries that use the long scale (based on power of a million) such as Europe. 2  In those countries that use the short scale (based on powers of a thousand) such as USA.
The number 6 trillion trillion can represent two different numbers, because there are two scales in use. The short scale is used in the US, while the long scale is still in … use in some countries. The number 6 trillion trillion (short scale) is 6 x 1024, or 6 septillion, with 24 zeros.
1 trillion = (1 million)3 = (106)3 = 1018. so 1 trillion has 19 digits (a '1' followed by eighteen '0's). 1 trillion = (1 thousand)3+1 = (103)4 = 1012. so 1 trillion has 13 digits (a '1' followed by twelve '0's). * In those countries that use the long scale (based on powers of a million) like Europe: 1 trillion = (10^6)^3 = 10^18 which is 1 followed by 18 zeros, ie 19 digits.
Numbers [edit]. 1  Trillion (short scale) (1,000,000,000,000; one million million; 10 12; SI prefix: tera-), the current meaning in both American and British English.
(1012 sec)/(3.16 x 107 sec/yr) = 31,546 years! Six trillion seconds equals 189,276 years. Now, as an aside, along with the nearly six trillion miles in the light-year, you might be interested to know that there are nearly five trillion dollars in the current U.S. national debt.
Thus billion and trillion are coined from the Latin prefixes bi- (n = 2) and tri- (n = 3), respectively. In the American system for naming large numbers, the name coined from the Latin number n applies to the number 10 3 n +3.
The number 1 trillion has 12 zeroes. Written in numerical notation, 1 trillion is equivalent to 1,000,000,000,000. A â it is also sometimes called one thousand billion and is written in scientific notation AS—1a 1ã 10 12 or just. 10 12
Trillion may mean: 1  Trillion (short scale) (1,000,000,000,000; one million million; 10 12; SI prefix: tera-), the current meaning in both American and British English.
