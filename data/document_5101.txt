synaptic vesicles. The chemical synapse is bounded by the ________ neuron, from which neurotransmitters are released across the synaptic cleft, to the ________ neuron, where the receptors for that neurotransmitter are located.
An action potential cannot cross the synaptic cleft between neurones. Instead the nerve impulse is carried by chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals are made by the cell that is sending the impulse (the pre-synaptic neurone) and stored in synaptic vesicles at the end of the axon.
Molecules of neurotransmitters are stored in small packages called vesicles (see the picture on the right). Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal when their vesicles fuse with the membrane of the axon terminal, spilling the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. Unlike other neurotransmitters, nitric oxide (NO) is not stored in synaptic vesicles.
Neurotransmitters are formed in a presynaptic neuron and stored in small membrane-bound sacks, called vesicles, inside this neuron. When this neuron is activated, these intracellular vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the synapse, a process called exocytosis.
At rest, neurotransmitter-containing vesicles are stored at the terminal of the neuron in one of two places. A small number of vesicles are positioned along the pre-synaptic membrane in places called active zones.. This is where neurotransmitter release occurs.
Neurotransmitters and Neuroactive Peptides. Communication of information between neurons is accomplished by movement of chemicals across a small gap called the synapse. Chemicals, called neurotransmitters, are released from one neuron at the presynaptic nerve terminal.
