The combination of 0.9% saline (dehydration correction) and 0.18% saline (maintenance fluid) averages to approximately 0.45% (half-normal) saline. This approximation is acceptable because the kidneys will sort out what to keep and what to excrete. Step 1: In the ER, the child is estimated is having 10% dehydration.

Due to critical shortage with normal saline and half-normal saline 1000 ml bags for injection, the following action plan will be implemented for adult patients, for new and active orders. Note some exclusions apply-see bullet point 5.
Effect of normal saline and half normal saline on serum electrolytes during recovery phase of diabetic ketoacidosis. Basnet S(1), Venepalli PK, Andoh J, Verhulst S, Koirala J. Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.
a solution of 0.45% NaCl used for mucosal hydration. As the water in the solution evaporates, the saline concentration increases, achieving nearly normal saline concentration in the respiratory tract.
Normal Saline is 0.9% salt in water. This is also known as Isotonic Saline, and it contains the same percentage of salt as is normally found in the human body. The taste of tears are a good way of understanding Isotonic or Normal Saline. Half Normal Saline is 0.45% saline in water, and is called Hypotonic Saline. It is dangerous to give this in an IV unless prescribed by a physician after consulting laboratory tests on the patient. This is due to its osmolality. Formal Saline, or Formalin, is 10
Reputation: 696. choosing between half saline(.45%) and normal saline(.9%) for treatment of hypernatremia .Now to deal with this remember half saline is Hypotonic which will drop the serum saline at very fast pace and risking central pontine myelolysis.
