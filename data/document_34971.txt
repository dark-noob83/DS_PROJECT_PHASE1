1 Trail riders often choose Quarter Horses which can cost $1,000-$4,000 or saddle mules (half horse and half donkey), which run $1,000-$3,500. 2  Quarter horses are also used for rodeo/barrel racing or working cattle, along with Arabians and Thoroughbreds.
COST FACTOR... So, your daily feed for the care of one healthy 1100 lb. horse will average between .75 and $4.80 per day for grain and will be around $4.40 per day for hay. That total is $4.40 to $8.80 per day. Multiply by 30 days per month, and your average cost to feed a healthy 15H horse is a minimum o f $132.00 and can easily go as high as $264.00. That cost can increase easily depending on the amount of work your horse is in, as well as its breed.
The cost of keeping a horse varies widely depending on where you live and the level of service your stable provides. Simple pasture boarding can cost as little as $100 a month. However, stable boarding can cost $500 or more.
1 Horses are measured by the hand.. 2  Stalls sizes vary from 8x8-foot pony stalls to 12x12-foot stalls for horses 17 hands and taller. 3  Common Veterinary costs include the Farrier (horseshoer) which runs $25-$100 every six weeks; hoof trimming, for $12-$75 and shots, for $10-$95 per dose.
As an example, if you pay $3000 for a horse, the costs of keeping the horse over 10 years is 7 to 37 times the cost of buying it. It should be noted that the above is typical costs only. A minority of horse owners pay much more or much less than this.
The price of horses varies according to what they will be used for--Trail Riding, Rodeo/barrel racing or English jumping--and how much training the animal has. The basic rule of thumb is the more training and experience a horse has, the more it will cost.
1 Grain can run about $20-$40 per 50-pound sack. 2  Tack--necessary riding equipment--includes a saddle, bridle, halter and saddle pad and runs $400-$1,500, depending on the quality and style. 3  Buckets and grooming supplies can cost around $50-$100.
Keeping a horse is becoming a luxury. But how much does the 'average' horse cost? What's the difference between a free horse, a $500 horse, a $5000 horse and one that can cost well over the ten or twenty thousand dollar mark?
