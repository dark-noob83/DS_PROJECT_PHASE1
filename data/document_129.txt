1 Horizontal clearance: under or along a bridge shall be the full paved width of the rest of the road. 2  Bridges longer than 200 feet (61 m) can be narrower, with a minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) on both sides of the travel lanes. 3  Bridge strength: New bridges are to have at least MS 18 (HS-20) structural capacity. 1 In this case, the minimum width is 30 feet (9.1 m), with at least 2 feet (61 cm) more than the approach for the sum of the shoulder widths, but at least 24 feet (7.3 m) total, and at least 1.5 feet (46 cm) on each side for a safety walkway.
Member. _________________You're never late, with a Scania V8. 16'6 is the minimum height of a motorway bridge. The tallest curtainsiders are about 15' tall, with some bridges there doesn't appear to be much spare room as they pass under, the steep one near Lancaster springs to mind. For any abnormally tall load movements, the route must be planned. There are a couple of bridges on the M5 that have height signs on them-the bridge clearence on the inside lane can be less than 16 feet, and so is signed.
On roads other than motorways there are advance warning signs advising lorry drivers of the height restriction of a bridge they may be approaching, and this height restriction is again displayed at the apex of the arch of the bridge itself. The maximum vehicle/load height is recommended to be 16ft 3ins (4.93m), though there's no actual law to restrict maximum height. andy-hughes. Think about how many times an accident has been reported on a motorway about a lorry failing to clear a bridge-I suspect that will be never.
Stone 2 states that jumping from 150 feet (46 metres) or higher on land, and 250 feet (76 metres) or more on water, is 95% to 98% fatal. 150 feet/46 metres, equates to roughly 10 to 15 stories in a building, depending on the height of one story. 250 feet is the height of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Ideally, anyone jumping on land should try and land on their head, as this maximises the chances of fatal head injuries

Best Answer: There isn't one. Since the height of lorries varies between 10 feet and 16 feet, it's impossible to give a minimum height that 'most' can get under.. However, the minimum height of an unmarked bridge (i.e. no height indicator) must be 16 feet 6 inches. Source(s): H.G.V driver for 15 years. Nightworks · 8 years ago.
Height of motorway bridges in the UK is 16 ft or thereabouts unless otherwise stated. There are a few exceptions where the height is lower, but few and far between.

NEED height of bridges over motorway generally (M32 near St Werburghs / St Pauls if you can be so specific!!)?
There are bridges over the motorway in Germany and Holland for instance which are 4.0 metres. Switzerland, most of the many tunnels on their motorway system have a 4.0 metre height limit, that's not just a sign prohibiting vehicles over 4.0 metres, it's a physical restriction.
