At HEB, I believe I paid about $20 or so a paycheck (paid weekly). This meant $80-$100 per month on health insurance that I was not used to paying before. The paid holidays only amount to 5 total days: New Years Day, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. I'm sure that if you're considering a job at HEB, you could call their HQ human resources staff and ask about benefits. They could certainly calculate what it would cost you. Call the Arsenal HQ building-I believe that's where HR is based.
