Fermented and cultured milks may actually predate recorded history however. A type of yogurt is thought to have originated by nomadic tribes of Eastern Europe and western Asia. The word yogurt is Turkish in origin. The ancient Assyrian word for yogurt, lebeny meant life. It's interesting to note that the modern word 'probiotic' can literally be translated to For Life.
Traditionally, Greek Yogurt may be made from either ewe’s milk or cow’s milk, though cow’s milk is most commonly found in brands sold in the United States. Its thick and creamy texture, created by straining or boiling away excess liquid, defines it from other types of yogurt.
According to The Encyclopedia of Healing Foods, yogurt was refined and developed by the Turkish people in the eighth century, when the Turks added bacteria that grew well in warm environments to pitchers of milk.

Greece is the obvious guess, but the history of where this yogurt originated is unclear. This is because Greek yogurt, or “strained yogurt,” is common in South Asia, the East Mediterranean, the Middle East, the U.S. and Greece. Greek yogurt is created from a centuries-old technique of straining out liquid whey, creating a thick, creamy yogurt without the addition of gums, thickeners or milk fat.
