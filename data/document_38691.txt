Somatic efferent neurons are motor neurons that conduct impulses from the spinal cord to skeletal muscles. These neurons are multipolar neurons, with cell bodies located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Somatic efferent neurons leave the spinal cord through the ventral root of spinal nerves. Visceral efferent neurons are motor neurons that conduct impulses to smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, & glands. These neurons make up the Autonomic Nervous System. Some visceral efferent neurons begin in the brain; others in
Typically, a stimulus causes ionic changes in the receptor neuron's dendrites, which lead to the formation of action potentials in the receptor neurons. These action potentials travel the sensory neuron, which connects to a motor neuron (and possibly an ascending neuron) in the spinal cord. The action potential causes neurotransmitter release within the presynaptic cell. The neurotransmitter binds to the postsynaptic cell and elicits an action potential there. The nervous system has many types of sensory neurons. Nerve endings on one end of each neuron are encased in a special structure to sense a specific stimulus. 1  Chemoreceptors sense chemicals. 2  The olfactory bulb that monitors your sense of smell has chemoreceptors that sense odors (chemicals in the air).
Neurons are classified as either motor, sensory, or interneurons. Motor neurons carry information from the central nervous system to organs, glands, and muscles. Sensory neurons send information to the central nervous system from internal organs or from external stimuli. Interneurons relay signals between motor and sensory neurons. The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, and a complex network of neurons. This system is responsible for sending, receiving, and interpreting information from all parts of the body.
Interneurons, or associative neurons, carry information between motor and sensory neurons. These fundamental members of the nervous system also vary with respect to their functions. 1  Sensory neurons carry signals from the outer parts of your body (periphery) into the central nervous system. The sensory neuron passes the message to a motor neuron that controls your leg muscles. Nerve impulses travel down the motor neuron and stimulate the appropriate leg muscle to contract. The response is a muscular jerk that happens quickly and does not involve your brain.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Sensory neurons are nerve cells that transmit sensory information (sight, sound, feeling, etc.). They are activated by sensory input, and send projections to other elements of the nervous system, ultimately conveying sensory information to the brain or spinal cord. The somatic sensory system includes the sensations of touch, pressure, vibration, limb position, heat, cold, and pain. The cell bodies of somatic sensory afferent fibers lie in ganglia throughout the spine. These neurons are responsible for relaying information about the body to the central nervous system.
Motor neurons are among the largest neurons in the central nervous system and have long axons that travel along peripheral nerves to innervate skeletal muscles. Motor neurons receive two types of synaptic inputs from descending pathways, spinal interneurons and segmental afferents: (1) excitatory and inhibitory inputs that directly affect membrane potential and (2) neuromodulatory inputs that alter the effects of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs on membrane potential.
1 Sensory neurons carry signals from the outer parts of your body (periphery) into the central nervous system. 2  Motor neurons (motoneurons) carry signals from the central nervous system to the outer parts (muscles, skin, glands) of your body. 3  Interneurons connect various neurons within the brain and spinal cord. The sensory neuron passes the message to a motor neuron that controls your leg muscles. Nerve impulses travel down the motor neuron and stimulate the appropriate leg muscle to contract. The response is a muscular jerk that happens quickly and does not involve your brain.

Sensory neurons receive impulses and carry them from the sense organs to the spinal cord or brain. Interneurons connect sensory and motor neurons and interpret the impulse. Motor neurons carry impulses from the brain and spinal cord to muscles or glands. 1  Draw and label the structure of a typical nerve cell. The Neuron. The neuron, a nerve cell, is the functional unit of the nervous system that carries the impulse (the message) to the appropriate part of the nervous system or interprets the impulse and allows a response. There are three types of neurons and each has different functions.
Motor neurons are large neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord that innervate skeletal muscle; those innervating the same muscle are grouped in proximity to form a motor neuron pool. Motor neurons receive two types of synaptic inputs from descending pathways, spinal interneurons and segmental afferents: (1) excitatory and inhibitory inputs that directly affect membrane potential and (2) neuromodulatory inputs that alter the effects of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs on membrane potential.
