If for the ecosystem of a polar bear: Abiotic means nonliving. The abiotic factors for a polar bear would be for example; ice. Ice is nonliving along with water. without water the bear would get dehydrated. Biotic means living. The biotic factors for polar bears would be, for example, fish. This provides nutrients to the bear
Abiotic and Biotic Relations. The major abiotic factors that affect polar bears are the cold, snow and water. The extreme cold in the Arctic region that the polar bear inhabits means that it has adapted in several ways. The polar bears have grown long, thick fur and have a thick layer of blubber just under the skin. They also have small ears and tails, which reduces the loss of cold through these areas
Water. Water is an abiotic factor in the Arctic region. Polar bears are strong swimmers. They dive into holes in the ice to hunt for fish and seals. Their paws serve as paddles to propel them through the water. Their nostrils close while they are under water, preventing any accidental inhalation of water. Snow is an abiotic factor in the Arctic ecosystem. Unlike other bears in warmer parts of the world, polar bears have white fur. This serves to help them blend into the snow in their natural habitat. This adaptation is necessary because of their huge size.
Abiotic Factors At The North Pole -- Arctic. The polar regions of the Arctic are about 21 million square miles of land, ice and water. Temperatures in the Arctic average below zero in the winter and about 35 degrees in the summer. The Arctic receives approximately 100 inches of precipitation a year, mostly snowfall. Biotic Factors At The North Pole. Many animals live in the Arctic, although no trees grow there, and plants grow only a few inches high. There are large land mammals such as polar bears, musk oxen and caribou.

Biotic factors are the living things that make up an ecosystem, such as plants and animals. Abiotic factors are the nonliving material or chemical factors in an ecosystem, like the weather. The natural ecosystem of a polar bear is the Arctic tundra. Snow is an abiotic factor in the Arctic ecosystem. Unlike other bears in warmer parts of the world, polar bears have white fur. This serves to help them blend into the snow in their natural habitat. This adaptation is necessary because of their huge size.

A couple of abiotic factors in the polar ice ecosystem are: 1. . Terrestrial biome are land ecosystems. Multiple ecosystems and hundreds of plant and animal species exist in the tundra biome. Tundra means land without trees and its come from the Finnish word tunturia, meaning treeless plain. What are the abiotic and biotic factors of the desert biome?Introduction to abiotic factors of the tundra. It encompasses both arctic and alpine tundra. mammals (arctic foxes, wolves, and polar bears. . . . Tundra means land without trees and its come from the Finnish word tunturia, meaning treeless plain.
