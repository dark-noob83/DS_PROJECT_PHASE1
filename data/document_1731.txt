For the year 2012, annual child-rearing expenses per child for a middle-income, two-parent family ranged from $12,600 to $14,700, depending on the age of the child. A family earning less than $60,640 per year can expect to spend a total of $173,490 (in 2012 dollars) on a child from birth through high school.
The estimate is 1.8 percent higher than the previous year. That equates to roughly $12,800 - $14,970 per child per year for a two-parent family with a median annual income between $61,530 and $106,540. The annual cost can vary based on factors like the child's age, the number of children in the family and the family's income and location. Back then, a middle-income family could have expected to spend $25,230 ($198,560 in 2013 dollars) to raise a child until the age of 18, according to the new report, which also notes that [h]ealth care expenses for a child have doubled as a percentage of total child-rearing costs during that time..
To raise a child born in 2013 to the age of 18, it will cost a middle-income couple just over $245,000, according to newly released estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

An additional $515 per year was tacked on to the clothing expenses of children up to age two for diapers, for a total annual cost of $1,300 all in. Let me just add that, in some cases, it may be a little optimistic to expect a child to be out of diapers by age two. But when we added up all of the expenses we arrived at $243,660 as the total cost of raising a typical child to age 18 (in other words, until the day before his or her 19th birthday). That’s $12,825 per child per year or $1,070 per month.
The average cost of raising a child born in 2013 up until age 18 for a middle-income family in the U.S. is approximately $245,340 (or $304,480, adjusted for projected inflation), according to the latest annual Cost of Raising A Child report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

If prospective parents were to tally the cost of having a baby before they conceived, the U.S. population would undoubtedly suffer a serious decline.

From day care to the monthly grocery bill, the cost of raising a child is climbing at a rate that many families can't keep up with. It will cost an estimated $241,080 for a middle-income couple to raise a child born last year for 18 years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday. That's up almost 3% from 2011 and doesn't even include the cost of college. At the same time, wages aren't keeping up.
