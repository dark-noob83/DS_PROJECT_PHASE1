The name, rodent ulcer, was used because of the tendency of this type of basal cell carcinoma to form an ulcer or sore on the skin with ragged edges. This could give the appearance of being gnawed on by a rodent. Another name for this type of basal cell carcinoma is Jacobi’s ulcer. Basal cell carcinomas are classified based on what the cancer looks like under a microscope. The classification includes nodular, micronodular, superficial, sclerosing or infiltrative.
