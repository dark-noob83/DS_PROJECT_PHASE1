As a Water sign, Pisces (aka the Fish) is primarily compatible with all Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio and, of course, other Pisceans). Compatibility is also good between Pisces and Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn). Virgo, however, is a special case since Pisces and Virgo are opposing signs in the Zodiac. Pisces relationships with Air and Fire signs require diligence and commitment. Relationships with Gemini and Sagittarius are probably the most challenging since they both square the Pisces sign on the Zodiac wheel.
Pisces have an intuitive and psychic ability more then any other zodiac signs. They trust their gut feelings and if they do not, they quickly learn to because they realize that their hunches are usually correct. Pisces downfall is their sensitivity and their inability to reject another person.
Pisces is the twelfth sign of the zodiac, and it is also the final sign in the zodiacal cycle.

These folks are selfless, spiritual and very focused on their inner journey. They also place great weight on what they are feeling.
