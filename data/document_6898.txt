Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Chromosomes are single strands of DNA. Bacterial DNA is packaged into a single chromosome that is a continuous loop. In both cases, the DNA must be folded or coiled so that it will fit into the cell.
In prokaryotes, the circular chromosome is contained in the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid. In contrast, in eukaryotes, all of the cell's chromosomes are stored inside a structure called the nucleus. Each eukaryotic chromosome is composed of DNA coiled and condensed around nuclear proteins called histones.
Chromosomes are made up of a DNA-protein complex called chromatin that is organized into subunits called nucleosomes. The way in which eukaryotes compact and arrange their chromatin not only allows a large amount of DNA to fit in a small space, but it also helps regulate gene expression.
In their replicated form, each chromosome consists of two chromatids. Chromosome unraveling to show the base pairings of the DNA. The chromosomes-and the DNA they contain-are copied as part of the cell cycle, and passed to daughter cells through the processes of mitosis and meiosis.

This DNA is tightly packed into structures called chromosomes, which consist of long chains of DNA and associated proteins. In eukaryotes, DNA molecules are tightly wound around proteins-called histone proteins-which provide structural support and play a role in controlling the activities of the genes.
Mitosis. Mitosis is a form of eukaryotic cell division that produces two daughter cells with the same genetic component as the parent cell. Chromosomes replicated during the S phase are divided in such a way as to ensure that each daughter cell receives a copy of every chromosome.
