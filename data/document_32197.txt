When fat mass decreases, the level of plasma leptin falls so that appetite is stimulated until the fat mass is recovered. There is also a decrease in body temperature and energy expenditure is suppressed. By contrast, when fat mass increases, so do leptin levels and appetite is suppressed until weight loss occurs. In this way leptin regulates energy intake and fat stores so that weight is maintained within a relatively narrow range. Leptin also plays an important role in regulating and modulating the onset of puberty.
Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the hunger hormone. Both hormones act on receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to regulate appetite to achieve energy homeostasis. When leptin binds with the leptin receptor, it activates a number of pathways. Leptin resistance may be caused by defects in one or more part of this process, particularly the JAK / STAT pathway. Mice with a mutation in the leptin receptor gene that prevents the activation of STAT3 are obese and exhibit hyperphagia.
Leptin is a cell-signalling hormone vital in the regulation of appetite, food intake and body weight. Studies have shown that an absence of leptin in the body or leptin resistance can lead to uncontrolled feeding and weight gain. By contrast, when fat mass increases, so do leptin levels and appetite is suppressed until weight loss occurs. In this way leptin regulates energy intake and fat stores so that weight is maintained within a relatively narrow range. Leptin also plays an important role in regulating and modulating the onset of puberty.
Hormone leptin and obesity. Leptin has sometimes been referred to as the  obesity hormone or fat hormone, but also the starvation hormone. Scientists discovered leptin in 1994 and it was quickly touted as a weight loss treatment. In other words, we all have a leptin floor but are missing a leptin ceiling. Leptin resistance occurs when your leptin is high and you are overweight, but your brain cannot see it. In other words, your brain is starved while your body is obese. Some researchers have referred to this as brain starvation.
The role of leptin and ghrelin in the regulation of food intake and body weight in humans: a review. Klok MD(1), Jakobsdottir S, Drent ML.

The purpose of this review is to provide background information on the leptin and ghrelin hormones, their role in food intake and body weight in humans, and their mechanism of action.
Leptin acts as a hormone that modulates the size of the adipose tissues in the body. It regulates food intake and body weight. Leptin also acts on specific receptors in the hypothalamus to inhibit appetite through both counteractive and stimulatory mechanisms: By contrast, when fat mass increases, so do leptin levels and appetite is suppressed until weight loss occurs. In this way leptin regulates energy intake and fat stores so that weight is maintained within a relatively narrow range. Leptin also plays an important role in regulating and modulating the onset of puberty.
Leptin and ghrelin are two hormones that have been recognized to have a major influence on energy balance. Leptin is a mediator of long-term regulation of energy balance, suppressing food intake and thereby inducing weight loss. Ghrelin on the other hand is a fast-acting hormone, seemingly playing a role in meal initiation. The purpose of this review is to provide background information on the leptin and ghrelin hormones, their role in food intake and body weight in humans, and their mechanism of action.
In short, leptin is the way that your fat stores speak to your brain to let your brain know how much energy is available and, very importantly, what to do with it. Therefore, leptin may be on top of the food chain in metabolic importance and relevance to disease. By Dr. Mercola Leptin, a hormone that plays a key role in regulating energy intake and energy expenditure, may be one of the most important hormones in your body that will determine your health and lifespan. Insulin is another, and the two work in tandem.
