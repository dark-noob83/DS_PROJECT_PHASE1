Fish back is the remains of processed fish, where the filet has been taken off and what's left is called 'fish back' or cuttings, mainly the head, the tail and the fins, and it is now becoming part of the protein diet in our meals, he stated. Mr Speaker, the impoverishment of our people has gotten worse since 2012. People are no longer talking about oxtail and curry goat. As a matter of fact, chicken back is now priced way above the means of many Jamaicans. What many are forced to buy these days is fish back, he told the House. The government benches responded with dismay, obviously hearing the term, fish back, for the first time. But, Holness insisted that the protein had replaced chicken back, as the staple for poor Jamaicans
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a test that “maps” the genetic material in a person’s cells. This test can be used to visualize specific genes or portions of genes. FISH testing is done on breast cancer tissue removed during biopsy to see if the cells have extra copies of the HER2 gene. 
Grant said that Rainforest did not have figures on the volume of fish back sold per week. However, the product is included in the combined sales of offals, which, he said, stood at 50,000 pounds weekly. But the volume, he emphasised, will vary depending on the demand for fillets and steaks. Tweet. ALTHOUGH out-of-touch Parliamentarians were hearing of fish back for the first time when Opposition Leader Andrew Holness spoke about the product in his budget presentation two weeks ago, the fact is that it has been on the market here for more than 10 years.
8. Bring your fish in with a net. When you've got the fish tired out and reeled in, bring it out of the water and have a partner catch it in your fishing net, or carefully catch it yourself. Be wary of the fish's sharp spines and the hook, which might be sticking out through the fish's mouth. Don't use the reel to pull in the fish, except for very small fish. Keep the line tight and use your arms to pull it toward you, then reel in the slack line. 1  More fish are lost to loose lines than anything else. 2  A loose line provides an opportunity for your fish to throw the hook right out of it's mouth.
A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward.
It's not waste, Grant emphasised. When you compare fish back to chicken back, a chicken back has a lot of fat and skin. So, pound for pound, a fish back with all of that meat, we think, is better value for money, he said. Tweet.

The anatomy of fish is often shaped by the physical characteristics of water, the medium in which fish live. Water is much denser than air, holds a relatively small amount of dissolved oxygen, and absorbs more light than air does. The skeleton of the fish is either made of cartilage (cartilaginous fishes) or bones (bony fishes). The main features of the fish, the fins, are bony fin rays and, except the caudal fin, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported only by the muscles. The ribs attach to
The outer body of many fish is covered with scales, which are part of the fish's integumentary system. The scales originate from the mesoderm (skin), and may be similar in structure to teeth. Some species are covered instead by scutes. Others have no outer covering on the skin. The skeleton of the fish is either made of cartilage (cartilaginous fishes) or bones (bony fishes). The main features of the fish, the fins, are bony fin rays and, except the caudal fin, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported only by the muscles. The ribs attach to
