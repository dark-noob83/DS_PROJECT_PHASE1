Density is defined as how tightly or loosely packed a substance is, or to the number of things or people in a certain area. An example of density is population density, which refers to the number of people in a certain geographic area.
The higher an object's density, the higher its mass per volume. The average density of an object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. A denser object (such as iron) will have less volume; than an an equal mass of some less dense substance (such as water). Density may denote how much of a certain substance, object or occurrence is present per unit area or volume.
Science Projects for Kids: Density and Volume teaches kids about density, or how compact a substance is, and volume, or how much space a substance occupies. Science is not just for scientists -- it's for everyone who's interested in the world around them and what makes things tick.
This week weâ€™ll look at density. Density is a measurement of how solid something is. Specifically it is the mass per unit volume of a substance. If you have two objects of the exact same size (volume), the more dense object will weigh more than the less dense object. So there are two things contributing to density: 1  The mass of the atoms or molecules that makes up the material.
Definition of DENSITY. 1. : the quality or state of being dense. 2. : the quantity per unit volume, unit area, or unit length: as a: the mass of a substance per unit volume b: the distribution of a quantity (as mass, electricity, or energy) per unit usually of space (as length, area, or volume).
Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given unit volume (density = mass/volume). It is usually expressed in kg/m^3. Put simply, if mass is a measure of how much stuff there is in an object, density is a measure of how tightly that stuff is packed together.
