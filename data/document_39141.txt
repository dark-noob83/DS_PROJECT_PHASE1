The average cost per launch was about $1.2 billion (in 2010 dollars) during the shuttle's operational years from 1982 to 2010. But it rises to $1.5 billion per flight when factoring in lifetime program costs, according to the new analysis, which covered the 131 shuttle missions flown between 1982 and 2010. But that proved enough data for Pielke and Radford to come up with ballpark figures. The average cost per launch was about $1.5 billion over the life of the US space-shuttle programme, according to a University of Colorado-Boulder analysis.
Suppose SpaceX is correct when it estimates that the cost of a launch will drop to $22 per kilogram with the advent of reusability. While that is not 100 times cheaper than a Falcon Heavy’s $90 million for 53 metric tons—that would be closer to $17 per kilogram—it’s still plenty cheap. If humanity devoted another $1.375 trillion to, say, spending on launch costs at $22 per kilogram from 2031 to 2103, it could launch the equivalent of more than 10 Great Pyramids into orbit on 3,092 reusable Falcon Heavy flights per year. That would be a nice monument to the current century
If the SLS is able to meet the $500 million target, it would end up being cheaper to fly than the space shuttle. The shuttle program cost about $209 billion (in 2010 dollars) over its lifetime and made a total of 135 flights, yielding an average cost per launch of more than $1.5 billion. Two or three flights per year. In its initial incarnation, the SLS will be capable of lifting 70 metric tons of payload. NASA is eyeing $500 million as a target right now for the Space Launch System (SLS) when it begins making roughly one flight per year, which could begin happening after 2023. But things could change as the SLS program — which was just announced in September 2011 — matures, officials said.
Another factor that contributes to the expense associated with satellites is the cost of putting one into orbit. It is estimated that a single satellite launch can range in cost from a low of about $50 million to a high of about $400 million. Launching a space shuttle mission can easily cost $500 million dollars, although one mission is capable of carrying multiple satellites and send them into orbit. Transponders alone hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to maintain, while bandwidth cost per MHz is priced at a minimum of about $3,500 a month. Running a satellite at a 36MHz bandwidth will cost over $1.5 million a year.
The lowest and least believable, of $500 million per launch, is from an unofficial NASA document that does not specify if the figure includes the estimated $30-billion development cost or even the annual operating budget, exclusive of costs for specific launches. $14.3 billion cost per launch. So, compared to the shuttle, how much would an SLS launch (of 130 tons) cost per pound if it was launched at several different conceivable rates. I have put the numbers for the intermediate launch frequencies into the figure below.
At the same time, it only costs about $100 million per launch, while the Delta 4 Heavy launches cost $435 million each (calculated from an Air Force contract of $1.74 billion for 4 launches). A different calculation method yields the same result. Considering that the cost of shuttle launches has recently been pegged at $1.5 billion apiece, (about $75 million per ton of payload), in most cases it would be far cheaper to build a new payload than to bring it back in a shuttle.
Satellites are not cheap business. They cost a lot of money to design, construct, launch and monitor. Just how much money? If you have at least $290 million in your bank account, that money can go into making a satellite that can track and monitor hurricanes. Transponders alone hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to maintain, while bandwidth cost per MHz is priced at a minimum of about $3,500 a month. Running a satellite at a 36MHz bandwidth will cost over $1.5 million a year.
The giant rocket NASA is building to carry astronauts to Mars and other destinations in deep space may cost $500 million per launch when it's flying regularly, space agency officials said Tuesday (Sept. NASA is eyeing $500 million as a target right now for the Space Launch System (SLS) when it begins making roughly one flight per year, which could begin happening after 2023. But things could change as the SLS program — which was just announced in September 2011 — matures, officials said.
Million with an “m.” That’s less than the cost of seven Falcon Heavy launches at the $90 million list price. The Enterprise only cost $19 million to build back then. For a little bit more, we can launch the 37,200-metric-ton 1952 reference mission to Mars as proposed by Wernher von Braun. If humanity devoted another $1.375 trillion to, say, spending on launch costs at $22 per kilogram from 2031 to 2103, it could launch the equivalent of more than 10 Great Pyramids into orbit on 3,092 reusable Falcon Heavy flights per year. That would be a nice monument to the current century
