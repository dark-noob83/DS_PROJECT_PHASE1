Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis. Panniculitis occurs when there is inflammation of the layer of fat lying underneath the skin. The inflammation causes red rounded lumps (nodules) to form just below the skin surface, which are tender. Erythema nodosum most commonly affects both shins. 1 Streptococcal infections are also a common trigger for erythema nodosum in adults. 2  Sarcoidosis. 3  This is a condition where inflammation causes tiny lumps of cells to form in various organs in your body, most commonly in the lungs and lymph glands. 4  The lumps are called granulomas.
Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that is located in a part of the fatty layer of skin. Erythema nodosum results in reddish, painful, tender lumps most commonly located in the front of the legs below the knees. The tender lumps, or nodules, of erythema nodosum range in size from a dime to a quarter. Erythema nodosum is initially managed by identifying and treating any underlying condition, along with the skin lesions. Treatments for erythema nodosum include anti-inflammatory drugs, and cortisone by mouth or injection. Colchicine is sometime used effectively to reduce inflammation.
Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammatory condition characterised by inflammation of the fat cells under the skin, resulting in tender red nodules or lumps that are usually seen on both shins. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, and typically resolves spontaneously within 3–6 weeks. 
The tender lumps, or nodules, of erythema nodosum range in size from one to five centimeters. The nodular swelling is caused by a inflammation in the fatty layer of skin. Erythema nodosum can be self-limited and resolve on its own in three to six weeks. Upon resolution, it may leave only a temporary bruised appearance or leave a chronic indentation in the skin where the fatty layer has been injured. Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that is located in a certain portion of the fatty layer of skin. Erythema nodosum (also called EN) results in reddish, painful, tender lumps most commonly located in the front of the legs below the knees
11. Erythema nodosum is a condition that causes red rounded lumps (nodules) to form just below the skin surface, most commonly on the shins. In most people, no specific cause or trigger can be found. But in some people a trigger (commonly a streptococcal infection or sarcoidosis) can be identified. 1 Streptococcal infections are also a common trigger for erythema nodosum in adults. 2  Sarcoidosis. 3  This is a condition where inflammation causes tiny lumps of cells to form in various organs in your body, most commonly in the lungs and lymph glands. 4  The lumps are called granulomas.

Erythema nodosum is a painful inflammation of the connective tissues beneath the skin’s surface. It is characterized by lumps or nodules beneath the skin that are about an inch across, and are firm, red and warm to the touch. 
Erythema nodosum, a painful disorder of the subcutaneous fat, is the most common type of panniculitis. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis. Erythema nodosum may be the first sign of a systemic disease such as tuberculosis, bacterial or deep fungal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis that affects subcutaneous fat in the skin, usually first evident as an outcropping of erythematous nodules that are highly sensitive to touch. 1 Most nodules are located symmetrically on the ventral aspect of the lower extremities.
