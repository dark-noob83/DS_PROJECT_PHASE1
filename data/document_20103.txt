Electrolyte: A substance that dissociates into ions in solution and acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes, informally known as lytes. Electrolyte replacement is needed when a patient has prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, and as a response to strenuous athletic activity.
The concentration of electrolytes in the body is controlled by a variety of hormones, most of which are manufactured in the kidney and the adrenal glands. Sensors in specialized kidney cells monitor the amount of sodium, potassium, and water in the bloodstream. Electrolytes are the smallest of chemicals that are important for the cells in the body to function and allow the body to work.
Electrolytes are salts that become charged molecules, called ions, when they are dissolved in a liquid. Their electrical charges and ability to conduct electricity helps the body to send electrical signals from one cell to another. Electrolytes are found in a well-balanced diet that is rich in vegetables and fruit. People who exercise regularly should replace their electrolytes by drinking sports drinks that are fortified with potassium and sodium.
Maintaining an Electrolyte Balance. The balance of electrolytes in your body can be changed easily by sweating, vomiting and diarrhea. That is why it is important to replenish them. Electrolytes are found in a well-balanced diet that is rich in vegetables and fruit. People who exercise regularly should replace their electrolytes by drinking sports drinks that are fortified with potassium and sodium. Electrolytes and their importance to the human body is undeniable
1 Calcium is the most abundant electrolyte in the body. 2  99 percent of calcium is stored in the teeth and bones where it helps to make and keep them strong. 3  Moreover, calcium is also critical for muscle contraction, nerve signaling, blood clotting and maintaining normal heart function. Maintaining Electrolytes. In order to stay healthy, it is critical to replace electrolytes lost through sweat or as a result of a poor diet. A diet that includes whole grains, leafy greens, fresh fruits and vegetables usually provides the electrolytes your body needs.
Definition. Electrolytes are ions that form when salts dissolve in water or fluids. These ions have an electric charge. Positively charged ions are called cations. Negatively charged ions are called anions. In North America, commonly used over-the-counter electrolyte replacements include: 1  Sports drinks formulated to replace electrolytes lost through sweating. 2  Dietary supplements in the form of tablets and powders containing electrolytes. 3  Electrolyte replacements for children such as Pedialyte, Naturalyte, or Rehydralyte.
Electrolytes Overview. Electrolytes are the smallest of chemicals that are important for the cells in the body to function and allow the body to work. Electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and others are critical in allowing cells to generate energy, maintain the stability of their walls, and to function in general. They generate electricity, contract muscles, move water and fluids within the body, and participate in myriad other activities
The serum values and individual functions for these electrolytes are: 1  Calcium is the most abundant electrolyte in the body. 2  99 percent of calcium is stored in the teeth and bones where it helps to make and keep them strong. Maintaining Electrolytes. In order to stay healthy, it is critical to replace electrolytes lost through sweat or as a result of a poor diet.

Electrolytes are chemicals that form electrically charged particles (ions) in body fluids. These ions carry the electrical energy necessary for many functions, including muscle contractions and transmission of nerve impulses. Electrolytes are chemicals that form ions in body fluids. They help make sure specific bodily functions run at optimal levels. Too few electrolytes will cause the body to cramp.
The Committee placed a strong focus on sodium and potassium because of the substantial body of research linking these electrolytes to levels of blood pressure. Part B, Introduction, provides background information on the problem of elevated blood pressure and its control.
