Anesthesia: You might think that anesthesia would be included with the price of a colonoscopy. After all, it’s not surprising that many patients would want to be anesthetized when they are having a colonoscopy. But for quite awhile, patients were being billed for anesthesia, which by itself can run be $1,000 or more.
1 However, it can cost significantly more -- up to about $1,500 if performed in a hospital, which would charge a facility fee. 2  The disadvantage of flexible sigmoidoscopy is that the doctor only is able to view half of the colon, and it is recommended every five years instead of every 10.
1 Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which does not require sedation and can be performed in a doctor's office in 20 minutes or less, costs about $100 to $300, with an average of $200, according to The Kentucky Cancer Consortium and the Action Plan on Colorectal Cancer for the State of Texas.

A colonoscopy is a screening test for colon cancer. It is recommended that people of average risk get a colonoscopy or other type of screening every 10 years starting at age 50. People at high risk should begin screening earlier, and sometimes more often, according to the American Cancer Society.
If you are covered with a health insurance, you are typically going to pay an average of $1,000 or slightly higher depending on how much the deductibles and the coinsurance amounts. For those not covered by medical insurance, the cost can range from $2,000-$3,000.
If you are having a routine screening because you turned 50 or earlier if you are high risk because of family history your insurance is meant to pay for your colonoscopy. Here is what I ended up having to pay: Surgical center fee – $400. Doctor fee – $700. Labs for 2 colon polyps and biopsies – $200.
