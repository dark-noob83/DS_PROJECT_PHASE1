Preparing them is as simple as tossing the legs with your favorite flavor combinations and popping them in the oven at a fairly high heat. Read on for three ways to make chicken legs: honey baked, spicy hot, and rosemary garlic. Bake the chicken. Put the chicken in the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes.
