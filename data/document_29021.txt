The Golden Gate Bridge was named for the entrance to the San Francisco Bay. Army Captain John C. Fremont named the strait “Chrysopylae” or Golden Gate in 1846. Building a Bridge across this strait was a feat of modern engineering. People from around the world come to see its legendary beauty.
Construction of the Golden Gate Bridge started in 1933. The bridge, which was designed by engineer Joseph Strauss was built to connect San Francisco with Marin County across the 1600 meter (+5000ft) wide strait known as the Golden Gate which links the San Francisco Bay with the Pacific Ocean.
The Golden Gate Bridge was built simply, to connect San Francisco to Marin County. The San Francisco Bay has rough currents and ferries were the only way to get across. Building a bridge just made it easier.
