On the morning of 1 July 1916, the British army detonated a mine in the village of La Boisselle, just north of Albert in France. It was the first day of the Battle of the Somme, during the First World War. The Friends of Lochnagar Association, chaired by Richard Dunning, maintains the crater today and organizes a memorial ceremony every July 1st, at 7:30am, to commemorate the beginning of the Battle of the Somme. It is possible to walk all around the edge of the crater, but access to the crater itself is not permitted.
The crater itself was caused by two charges of ammonal, of 24,000lb and 30,000lb. It was blown along with 16 others at 0728 on the morning of 1 July 1916 as a two-minute precursor to the start of the offensive. The Lochnagar Crater measured 300ft across and 90ft deep (200ft wide and 81ft deep by 1919). An annual ceremony takes place every year at a wooden cross at the crater on 1 July to commemorate the first day of the Somme offensive. The crater receives around 75,000 visitors a year and is thus one of the most popular sites on the Western Front.

Lochnagar Crater history. The Lochnagar Crater (Lochnagar Mine Crater) located in the village of La Boisselle in France’s Picardie region, is the site where one of the first explosions of the Battle of the Somme took place on 1 July 1916. Directions to Lochnagar Crater: Lochnagar Crater is located in farmland just next to the centre of the village of Ovillers-La-Boisselle along route D929, just north east of the town of Albert. It is approx 21 miles north east of Amiens along route D929.
Lochnagar Crater. Description: On the 1st July 1916, the men leaving their positions for battle at 7:30am had no idea that they were going towards almost certain death. Just before the infantry assault began, several mines were blown, which were intended to destroy parts of the German front line and create huge craters. The Friends of Lochnagar Association, chaired by Richard Dunning, maintains the crater and organises each 1st July a very moving ceremony which starts at 7:30am, and commemorates the beginning of the Battle of the Somme.
The mine was named after Lochnagar Street, the British trench from which the gallery was driven. It was one of eight large and eleven small mines that were placed beneath the German lines on the British section of the Somme front. The Lochnagar mine was sprung at 7:28 a.m. on 1 July 1916, the First day on the Somme. The Lochnagar mine consisted of two chambers with a shared access tunnel (see map) . The shaft was sunk in the communication trench called Lochnagar Street. It was probably the first deep incline shaft, which sloped from 1:2–1:3, to a depth of about 95 feet (29 m).
The Lochnagar Crater, at La Boiselle, is privately owned by Richard Dunning, having been bought in 1978 to save at least one of the original 1 July 1916 Somme craters from being filled in and built upon by local farmers. There are also several memorials at the site of the crater, including a memorial seat. An annual ceremony takes place every year at a wooden cross at the crater on 1 July to commemorate the first day of the Somme offensive. The crater receives around 75,000 visitors a year and is thus one of the most popular sites on the Western Front.
The Tyneside battalions which attacked at Lochnagar Crater fought with 34th Division as: 1  the 102nd Tyneside Scottish Brigade (20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd Battalions Northumberland Fusiliers) and. 2  the 103rd Tyneside Irish Brigade (24th, 25th, 26th and 27th Battalions Northumberland Fusiliers). 19th Division Memorial, La Boisselle. 50.02187473171607. 2.696773409843445. Lochnagar Crater is located on the southern part of the 1916 Somme battlefields to the south of the D929 Albert-Bapaume road and immediately south of the village of La Boisselle. From the D929 enter the village of La Boisselle in the direction of Contalmaison
The Lochnagar mine crater is one of several which remain visible on the Western Front today. In the Somme area, others may be seen at Hawthorn Ridge near Beaumont Hamel and on the edge of High Wood. Others can be seen in Flanders, particularly around Messines. Just off the D929 on the right (towards the Lochnagar crater) is the la Boiselle Tyneside memorial seat. This location is just to the north-west of the 'Glory Hole' and also almost exactly on the British front line of July 1st, 1916.
