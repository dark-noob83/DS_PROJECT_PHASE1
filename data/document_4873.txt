The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other. Convergent Boundaries.
Churning currents of molten rocks below the tectonic plates causes their movement; these currents propel the tectonic plates causing them to move/hit each other. What causes the currents under the tectonic plates is the heat in the surface s core. There are three different types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, plates move into each other; divergent, plates move apart; and transform, plates move sideways in relation to
A: The three primary causes for tectonic plate movement are the convection of material in the mantle, gravity and the rotation of the planet. These forces cause each of the seven major plates and numerous other microplates to move independently of the others at a rate of a few centimeters per year. Know More.
Plates at our planet s surface move because of the intense heat in the Earth s core that causes molten rock in the mantle layer to move. It moves in a pattern called a convection cell that forms when warm material rises, cools, and eventually sink down. As the cooled material sinks down, it is warmed and rises again.
