6. Green beans are a good source of plant fibre, vitamin K, vitamin C, and manganese. If your dog has a tendency to put on weight, then replacing some of her regular food with green beans is a great low calorie way to fill her up and help her maintain a healthy weight. Many dogs enjoy green beans frozen.
7. Eggs are a great source of very digestible protein, riboflavin, and selenium. For some dogs that are prone to digestive upset, eggs can give them a little protein boost. Adding eggs to your dog’s food is a healthy treat. Make sure to use cooked whole egg, as raw egg whites can cause biotin deficiency.
Either way can be good for dogs–with a few caveats. Many of the foods that are good for us are also good for our dogs, and the reverse is true too. In other words, do feed them lean meats, whole grains, and vegetables. Don’t empty your leftover lasagna, rolls, or fries into your dog’s bowl.
Protein sources should be your first choice. Dogs can easily digest meats. Top choices include chicken, beef, fish, turkey, rabbit and lamb. In addition to meats, eggs are a high source of protein. Certain dairy products like cheese, yogurt and cottage cheese provide protein as well as much needed calcium for your dog.
Carbohydrates and Grains. Carbohydrates are a source of calories for your dog. However, like dairy products, some dogs are allergic to wheat-based grains. Good sources of carbohydrates include foods like brown and white rice and plain pasta. If you are looking for a fun snack to share with your dog, consider air-popped popcorn. This treat provides potassium, phosphorous, magnesium and calcium.
