Read on... INTRODUCTION Bushido, literally translated Way of the Warrior, developed in Japan between the Heian and Tokugawa Ages (9th-12th century). It was a code and way of life for Samurai, a class of warriors similar to the medieval knights of Europe.
The unwritten code of the Samurai is called the Bushido code, translated as the Way of the Warrior. Bushido is a system of standards that became the life force of the samurai during the feudal periods in Japan.
Bushidō, (武士道) literally meaning the way of the warrior, is a Japanese word for the way of the samurai life, loosely analogous to the concept of chivalry. Bushido is a modern term rather than a historical one. The way itself originates from the samurai moral values, most commonly stressing some combination of frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honor unto death.
