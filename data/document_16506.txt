We decide on the distance that our moon is from our planet. We divide the distance into the radius and get a small number. We divide that small number by 2. Then we look up our answer in a Tangent Table to get how many degrees wide the moon is in the sky. The Radius of a moon is 1500 miles. (This is bigger than our moon) The Distance to this moon is 300,000 miles.
The average distance to the moon is 382,500 kilometers. The distance varies because the moon travels around Earth in an elliptical orbit. At perigee, the point at which the moon is closest to Earth, the distance is approximately 360,000 kilometers. At apogee, the point at which the moon is farthest from Earth, the distance is approximately 405
Example: A Theoretical System The Radius of a moon is 1500 miles. (This is bigger than our moon) The Distance to this moon is 300,000 miles. 1500 = 0.005 This number is the (Tangent of Theta) 300,000 2 Multiply 0.005 by 2 to get the Tangent of Theta.
Confidence votes 59. The moon measures about 2160 miles (3476 km) across. The distance is about one fourth the diameter of the Earth, and 400 times smaller than that of the sun.
The moon's surface area is about 14.6 million square miles (38 million square kilometers), which is less than the total surface area of the continent of Asia (17.2 million sq mi or 44.5 million sq km).
