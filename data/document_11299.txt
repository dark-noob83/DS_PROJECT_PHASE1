Answer by Adam Went. Confidence votes 576. The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, is an iron sulfide with the formula FeS2. This mineral's metallic luster and pale-to-normal, brass-yellow hue have earned it the nickname fool's gold because of its resemblance to gold.
Report Abuse. The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, is an iron sulfide with the formula FeS2. This mineral's metallic luster and pale-to-normal, brass-yellow hue have earned it the nickname fool's gold due to its resemblance to gold. Pyrite is the most common of the sulfide minerals.
Pyrite is a very common mineral, found in a wide variety of geological formations from sedimentary deposits to hydrothermal veins and as a constituent of metamorphic rocks. The brassy-yellow metallic colour of pyrite has in many cases lead to people mistaking it for Gold, hence the common nickname 'Fool's gold'.
Pyrite has the same chemical formula as the rarer mineral Marcasite, but it crystallize s in a different crystal system, thereby classifying it as a separate mineral species.
Best Answer: Aside from the naturally occurring FeS2 which is called pyrite, the compound would have the chemical name iron (II) persulfide. The iron and sulfur atoms in FeS2 are arranged as Fe-S-S rather than S-Fe-S. The S2^2- is the persulfide, and is the analog of peroxide, O2^2-.
Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster. It has a chemical composition of iron disulfide (FeS 2) and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks worldwide.
