Old crow watching hungrily, from his perch in yonder tree. In my garden I'm as free as that feathered thief up there. Inch by inch, row by row, gonna make this garden grow. All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground. Inch by inch, row by row, Someone bless the seeds I sow. Someone warm them from below, 'til the rain comes tumbling down. Pulling weeds and picking stones, man is made of dreams and bones.

Grain for grain, sun and rain, I'll find my way in nature's chain. I tune my body and my brain to the music of the land. Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow. All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground. Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow. Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down.
