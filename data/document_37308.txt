Knee Ligaments. The knee ligaments can be split into two pairs, the collateral ligaments (around the sides of the joint) and the cruciate ligaments (inside the joint). Ligaments are thick fibrous bands like ropes and their job is to provide stability by holding bones together.
Muscles are attached to the bones by bands called tendons. Ligaments and tendons are made of tissue that is strong enough to hold the joint in place but flexible enough not to tear under normal movement. The placement of tendons and ligaments determines how different joints are able to move.
The human skeleton is composed of both fused and individual bones supported by ligaments, tendons, muscles and cartilage. Bones can move because of the way they are joined together. The place where two or more bones come together is called a joint. The bones at a joint are held together by strong bands of tissue called ligaments which allow the bones to move.
Where bones meet. Joints are the place where two bones meet. All of your bones, except for one (the hyoid bone in your neck), form a joint with another bone. Joints hold your bones together and allow your rigid skeleton to move.
