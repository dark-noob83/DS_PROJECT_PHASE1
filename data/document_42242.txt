A stretch reflex, also referred to as a deep tendon reflex or myotatic stretch reflex, is a physical response to the extension of a muscle. In essence, it is a process that causes a contraction, thereby stopping a stretch.
myotatic reflex. n. Tonic contraction of the muscles in response to a stretching force, due to stimulation of muscle proprioceptors. Also called deep tendon reflex, stretch reflex.
The Myotatic Reflex. If the name “ myotatic reflex ” doesn’t ring a bell, this is the reflex that your physician checks on when he sharply taps the tendon in your knee, and you end up moving your leg as a result. This reflex involves only 2 neurons, one synapse, one stimulus, one muscle, and one response.
The stretch reflex is caused by a stretch in the muscle spindle. When the stretch impulse is received a rapid sequence of events follows. The motor neuron is activated and the stretched muscles, and its supporting muscles, are contracted while its antagonist muscles are inhibited.
The stretch reflex; which is also often called the myotatic reflex, knee-jerk reflex, or deep tendon reflex, is a pre-programmed response by the body to a stretch stimulus in the muscle.

The stretch reflex (myotatic reflex) is a muscle contraction in response to stretching within the muscle. It is a monosynaptic reflex which provides automatic regulation of skeletal muscle length. When a muscle lengthens, the muscle spindle is stretched and its nerve activity increases.
The myotatic reflex starts in the muscle spindle which constantly and spontaneously produces an afferent impulse to the spine and therefore the brain – at a rate of at least 5 – 50 times per second.
