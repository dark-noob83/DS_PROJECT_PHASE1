Telekinesis is the most common power in the Halliwell line. Carriers include Melinda Warren, Prue, Penny, Chris, Wyatt, Paige and the granddaughter from 'Forever Charmed'. Piper's freezing power has only recurred in her mother (apart from Melinda Warren) and Phoebe is the only witch that is known of (apart from Melinda Warren) to receive the premonitions power. Prue and Phoebe's past lives are the only witches in the line not to receive Warren powers. Phoebe had pyrokinesis (the ability to create fire) and Prue had cryokinesis (the ability to generate ice). Similarly, Paige's past life could control the elements although we only saw her control wind and fire.

I just recently drove threw the neighborhood. Someone is currently living in the Charmed house and it looks nothing like the show. But I must say, the houses on that street where charmed filmed are just beautiful. would recomend driving by if you in the neighborhood. Donâ€™t be disappointed when you see the interior, though. While Charmed does use the Carroll Avenue home to film exteriors, the interiors are filmed exclusively on a sound-stage. Until next time, Happy Stalking!
