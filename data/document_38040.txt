antacid. 1. counteracting acidity. 2. an agent that counteracts acidity; antacids are often used in the treatment of peptic ulcer. Substances that act as antacids include sodium bicarbonate, aluminum hydroxide gel, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and magnesium trisilicate.
Antacids work by counteracting (neutralising) the acid in your stomach. They do this because the chemicals in antacids are bases (alkalis) which are the opposite of acids. A reaction between an acid and base is called neutralisation. This neutralisation makes the stomach contents less corrosive.
Antacids are a group (class) of medicines which help to neutralise the acid content of your stomach. Antacids include aluminium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate and magnesium trisilicate.
Even if used occasionally and in moderation, antacids can cause problems for people with special medical conditions. The opposite of an acid is a base, and that's exactly what an antacid is. Antacids make you feel better by increasing the pH balance in your stomach. The pH system is a scale for measuring the acidity or alkalinity of a given environment (in this case, your stomach). The scale goes from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral.
