Big time. The pending closure of Mercy Hospital in the southeast Kansas community of Independence appears to be the catalyst. Soon after hospital officials announced plans to close the facility, expansion advocates went on the offensive, charging that the state’s rejection of Medicaid expansion helped seal its fate.

The Medicaid expansion debate in Kansas is heating up.
But hospitals in Kansas and the other 21 states that have not expanded Medicaid don’t have access to that offsetting revenue, and many are struggling as a result, particularly low-volume facilities in rural areas not classified as critical access hospitals.

Two southeast Kansas hospitals — one in Independence, the other in Fort Scott — are among several in Kansas that might have to close in part due to the state’s failure to expand Medicaid. To prevent that, both are actively negotiating potential partnerships with neighboring hospitals.
In what is becoming a sad testament to the dangers of political brinkmanship, hospitals all across the nation are having to close their doors simply because their GOP governors refuse to expand Medicaid.
In states like Kansas and Missouri that have chosen not to expand Medicaid, hospitals have lost their uncompensated care reimbursements and not gained the new Medicaid money. “That’s put many of our local hospitals in a bit of a bind, yes,” Francis said.
Expanding Medicaid will save hundreds of millions of dollars for Missouri in the long run. If we don’t expand Medicaid, Missouri hospitals will continue to lose federal funding, which would force 40 to 50 percent of the state’s rural hospitals to close.
