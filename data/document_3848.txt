4.1 Introduction. The Moon revolves around Earth in an elliptical orbit with a mean eccentricity of 0.0549. Thus, the Moon's center-to-center distance from Earth varies with mean values of 363,396 km at perigee to 405,504 km at apogee. The lunar orbital period with respect to the stars (sidereal month) is 27.32166 days (27d 07h 43m 12s).
The Moon orbits Earth in the prograde direction and completes one revolution in approximately 27.322 days (a sidereal month). Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre (common center of mass), which lies about 4600 km from Earth's center (about three quarters of the radius of Earth). On average, the Moon is at a distance of about 385000 km from Earth's center, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii. With a mean orbital velocity of 1.023 km/s, the Moon moves relative to the stars each hour by an amount roughly equal to its angular diameter, or by about 0.5°. The plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5.1°, whereas the Moon's spin axis is inclined by only 1.5°.
It took Apollo 11, that's the spaceship that carried Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin to the moon in 1969, 4 days 6 hours and 45 minutes to get to the moon. They took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 1:32 pm on 7/16/1969, and the lunar module landed on the moon at 8:17 pm on 7/20/1969. The moon is about 220,000 kilometers from the Earth. You do the math. (The number I am getting in my head is a little less than one kilometer per second, or about 3,000 km/h, or about 2,000 mi/h). I think that the Chinese are planning on repeating this particular experiment. We will see what they come up with.
For a more detailed discussion, see the. How long does it take? It takes the Earth one year to orbit the Sun and it takes Mars about 1.9 years (say 2 years for easy calculation) to orbit the Sun. The elliptical orbit which carries you from Earth to Mars is longer than Earth's orbit, but shorter than Mars' orbit. It depends on the details of the orbit you take between the Earth and Mars. The typical time during Mars's closest approach to the Earth every 1.6 years is about 260 days. Again, the details depend on the rocket velocity and the closeness of the planets, but 260 days is the number I hear most often give or take 10 days.
The Moon's Orbit and Rotation. It takes the Moon 27.322 days to go around the Earth once. Because of this motion, the Moon appears to move about 13 against the stars each day, or about one-half degree per hour. RSS Feeds. The Earth's Moon is the fifth largest in the whole solar system, and is bigger than the planet Pluto. The Moon has a nearly circular orbit (e=0.05) which is tilted about 5 to the plane of the Earth's orbit. Its average distance from the Earth is 384,400 km
Takes about an hour to take off and reach orbit, maybe half-a-day for shake down and making sure everything is right, 5 days for the transfer, another half-day for stabilizing orbit around Moon, descent, landing, so I guess one could get there in 6 days, using the most economical route. It takes 3 days to get the Moon if you leave Earth at escape velocity of 25,000 MPH. But because the rocket engines use up all their fuel in 10 minutes or so, most of the time you are coasting. And you are coasting up against Earth's gravity, slowing down all the time.
A rocket ship, on its way to the moon, can get up to almost 25,000 miles per hour in order to escape the Earths atmosphere. However, it does not go that fast the whole way. Also, the ship cannot fly directly from the Earth straight to the moon surface. When it gets to the moon, the rocket needs to fly around and figure out a good spot to land. The first mission to stop on the moon with astronauts on it, Apollo 11, landed about four days after leaving the Earth surface. The moon is about 220,000 kilometers from the Earth. You do the math. (The number I am getting in my head is a little less than one kilometer per second, or about 3,000 km/h, or about 2,000 mi/h). I think that the Chinese are planning on repeating this particular experiment. We will see what they come up with.
If you ignore the earth's orbit around the sun, the moon takes 27.32 days to go 360 degrees around us. In other words, the time it takes to cover 360 degrees of the celestial sphere. But since we orbit the sun, the moon has to travel farther than 360 degrees to reach the same point, with respect to the earth and sun. 29.53 days. That's its synodic period, which is the amount of time it takes to go through its phases. This is by far the most commonly used figure. It has a 27.32 day sidereal revolution around the earth, with respect to the stars. The reason for the difference is because the earth orbits the sun.
