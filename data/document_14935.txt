WATER AND HUMANS. * The human body is more than 60 percent water. Blood is 92 percent water, the brain and muscles are 75 percent water, and bones are about 22 percent water. * A human can survive for a month or more without eating food, but only a week or so without drinking water.
The average adult human body is 50-65% water, averaging around 57-60%. The percentage of water in infants is much higher, typically around 75-78% water, dropping to 65% by one year of age. Body composition varies according to gender and fitness level, because fatty tissue contains less water than lean tissue. The average adult male is about 60% water.
The average human body is estimated to be about 60 to 70 percent water. The percentage may be as high as 75% in infants, decreasing to 57-60% in adults. This does not include water that is part of hydrated chemical compounds in the body, which can only be removed chemically or by heat drying.
The percentage of body weight that is water therefore varies inversely with body fat. In the average lean adult male around 60% of the body weight is water. The remaining body weight consists of 16-18% fat with 22-24% protein, carbohydrate and other solids.
Water accounts for about one half to two thirds of an average personâ€™s weight. Fat tissue has a lower percentage of water than lean tissue and women tend to have more fat, so the percentage of body weight that is water in the average woman is lower (52 to 55%) than it is in the average man (60%).
