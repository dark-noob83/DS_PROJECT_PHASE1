1 Suppose that the current spot exchange rate is €1.50/₤ and the one-year forward exchange rate is€1.60/₤. 2  The one-year interest rate is 5.4% in euros and 5.2% in pounds. 3  You can borrow at most€1,000,000 or the equivalent pound amount, i.e., ₤666,667, at the current spot exchange rate.a. 1 Thus the cost of Jaguar as of today is $49,755.You should definitely choose to use “option a”, and save $1,266, which is the difference between $49,755and $48489.3. 2  Currently, the spot exchange rate is $1.50/£ and the three-month forward exchange rate is $1.52/£.
1 Expected ZAR spot rate = [1.10/1.08] (0.158) = $0.1609/rand.c. 2  Expected ZAR under PPP = [(1.07)4/(1.05)4] (0.158) = $0.1704/rand.8. 3  Suppose that the current spot exchange rate is €1.50/₤ and the one-year forward exchange rate is€1.60/₤. 4  The one-year interest rate is 5.4% in euros and 5.2% in pounds. 1 Thus the cost of Jaguar as of today is $49,755.You should definitely choose to use “option a”, and save $1,266, which is the difference between $49,755and $48489.3. 2  Currently, the spot exchange rate is $1.50/£ and the three-month forward exchange rate is $1.52/£.
Currently, the spot exchange rate is $1.45/£ and the three-month forward exchange rate is $1.40/£. In London, the money market interest rate is 2.0% for a three-month investment. There are two alternative ways of paying for your Jaguar. (a) Keep the funds at your bank in the U.S. and buy £35,000 forward. You should definitely choose to use “option a”, and save $1,266, which is the difference between $49,755 and $48489. 3. Currently, the spot exchange rate is $1.50/£ and the three-month forward exchange rate is $1.52/£.
The US interest rate on government securities with one-year maturity is 7% and the expected rate of inflation is 5%. The current spot exchange rate for Korea won is $1 = W1,200. Forecast the spot exchange rate one year from today. Explain the logic of your answer. Drawing on what we know about the Fisher effect, the real interest rate in both the US and South Korea is 2%. (b) According to PPP, the $/£ one year forward exchange rate should be 3.10/4.65, or $0.67/£. (c) Since the dollar is appreciating relative to the pound, and given the relationship of the international Fisher effect, the British must have higher interest rates than the US.
Example V.4: Suppose the current one-month forward rate is .7335 USD/CAD and the forecast for the future spot rate is .7342 USD/CAD. Based on this forecast, Ms. Sternin, a U.S. speculator, decides to buy CAD forward.

The forward exchange rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. For example, to calculate the 6-month forward premium or discount for the euro versus the dollar deliverable in 30 days, given a spot rate quote of 1.2238 $/€ and a 6-month forward rate quote of 1.2260 $/€:
You expect that the one-year inflation rate is 7 percent in the U.K., 5 percent in Switzerland, and 1 percent in the U.S. The one-year interest rate is 6% in the U.K., 2% in Switzerland, and 4% in the U.S. What is your expected spot rate of the Swiss franc in one year with respect to the U.S. dollar?
