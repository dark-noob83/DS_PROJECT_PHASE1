Because it also does not spark, it is used in non-sparking tools. Because it reacts with the alpha particles released by polonium to produce neutrons, it is used in A-bomb initiators. And finally, because it does not react with acid and uranium it is used to make nuclear generators.
It is found rarely in isolation in the earth. It is found in 30 mineral species including: Terlandite, Beryl, Chrsoberge, and Phenacite. It is found in large quantities in old stars. This was discovered in 1992 where scientists found a lot of beryllium in 6 old stars on the edge of the Milky Way.
Polonium is a radioactive element discovered in 1898 by scientists Marie and Pierre Curie and named for Marie’s native country, Poland. One of the Earth’s rarest elements, it’s an odorless, silvery-gray soft metal that can be ground into powder.
Introduction. Marie and Pierre Curie 's pioneering research was again brought to mind when on April 20 1995, their bodies were taken from their place of burial at Sceaux, just outside Paris, and in a solemn ceremony were laid to rest under the mighty dome of the Pantheon. panthéon
Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138.39 days. Polonium's most stable isotope, polonium-209, has a half-life of 102 years. It decays into lead -205 through alpha decay. Polonium-209 is available from Oak Ridge National Laboratory at the cost of about $3200 per microcurie.
Polonium is back in the news as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's wife says Swiss forensic tests show he was poisoned to death by it in 2004. Here are five things to know about the radioactive substance sometimes called the Perfect Poison..
