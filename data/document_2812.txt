The stroma of a plant is the region outside of the thylakoid space. This serves two functions in the both the light-dependent and light-independent (Calvin cycle) reactions.
A stroma is the connective, part of a cell, organ or tissue. The  function of a stroma is to hold the cell, organ, or tissue together  and help it maintain form. Edit. Share to: Answered.
As a result, the H+ ions need to diffuse into the stroma. In order to do this, the ions must travel through an enzyme known as ATP synthase. Once it does, the movement of H+ ions through ATP synthase into the stroma provides energy for ADP to become ATP. The ATP formed is an energy source to power the Calvin cycle. Now, the light-independent (Calvin cycle) reactions occur in
Stroma Function. Photosynthesis, the food making process of plants, uses light energy in order to create sugar or starch from water (H 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2).
I think you mean 'Stroma'. Stroma can refer to two things in Biology. Stroma is the fluid inside chloroplasts, the site of photosynthesis in all plant cells. It is also, however, the framework (like a skeleton) inside any biological tissue, cell or organ.
Stroma Function. Most of the enzymes essential in the process of photosynthesis are normally embedded in the stroma and in the thylakoid membranes. The stroma is the fluid-filled space that is surrounding the grana, and is also involved in the synthesis of organic molecules from water and carbon dioxide. After the thylakoids, the process of producing starch or sugar moves out to the stroma.
