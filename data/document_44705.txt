A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the amount of cost to be recognised as an asset and carried forward until the related revenues are recognised. This Standard provides guidance on the determination of cost and its subsequent recognition as an expense, including any write-down to net realisable value.
1. Expense recognition. Expenses are decreases in assets (e.g., rent expenses) or increases in liabilities (e.g., accrued utility expenses) that result from operating activities undertaken to generate revenue. Expenses are recognized in accordance with the matching principle. This principle mandates that the expense or cost of doing business is recorded in the same period as the revenue that has been generated as the result of incurring that expense or cost.
Generally, costs incurred to develop, maintain, or restore intangible assets are recognized as an expense when incurred. Exceptions include costs associated with computer software intended to be sold, Web site development, and computer software for internal use.
Under cost recovery method revenue is recognized only to the extent of receipts. So in Q1 revenue recognized is $3 million which is matched with cost of $3 million resulting in zero gross profit. In Q2 revenue recognized is $6 million matched with $6 million cost resulting in zero gross profit. In Q3 revenue recognized is $4 million matched with the remaining cost of $1 million ($10 million - $3 million - $6 million) resulting in a gross profit of $3 million. In Q4 no cost is left and the revenue recognized is $7 million so gross profit is $7 million.
IAS 18 Revenue addresses revenue recognition for the sale of goods. When inventories are sold and revenue is recognised, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense (often called cost-of-goods-sold).
