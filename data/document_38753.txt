A codon specifies a certain amino acid that makes up the protein. A codon is a sequence of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that corresponds with a specific amino acid or stop sig … nal during protein synthesis.    Codon is a genetic code. The genetic code is initial nucleotide  from which translation starts.
Of the 64 codons, 61 represent amino acids, and three are stop signals. For example, the codon CAG represents the amino acid glutamine, and TAA is a stop codon.
Each codon corresponds to a single amino acid (or stop signal), and the full set of codons is called the genetic code. The genetic code includes 64 possible permutations, or combinations, of three-letter nucleotide sequences that can be made from the four nucleotides.
codon. A codon is a sequence of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that corresponds with a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis. DNA and RNA molecules are written in a language of four nucleotides; meanwhile, the language of proteins includes 20 amino acids.
