Muffins I usually wind up baking at 350F for about 25-30 min, and cakes or loafs are usually 325F for about an hour. This can be done using the same batter recipe. If you try to bake a cake or loaf at a muffin temperature you can wind up getting crispy or even burned outsides, and raw sticky middles. One recipe of quick bread batter can be baked in pans of many different sizes. If you want to bake smaller loaves or muffins instead of a single larger loaf, use this chart to figure the baking time. Do remember that no matter which pan(s) you use, fill each only two-thirds full. If you have batter remaining, use it to make muffins. 9x5x3-inch loaf pan 1-1 ¼ hr. 8x4x2-inch loaf pan 50-60 min
It all depends on the muffin mix, ingredients, recipe, and size of the muffins. Usually, they will bake (on average) between 10 and 20 minutes, or so. But follow what the recipe says for the best results.

—N.I., South Kingstown, Rhode IslandGenerally, the oven temperature will not need to be adjusted when baking mini or jumbo muffins, but the baking time will most likely need to be altered. Mini muffins will take anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes while jumbo muffins will bake from 20 to 40 minutes. Check jumbo muffins for doneness after 20 minutes, then every 5 to 10 minutes. Keep in mind that the baking time will vary according to the recipe. The variation is due to the oven temperature and the amount of batter in each muffin cup. 
9. Bake for 5 minutes longer than the original recipe calls for (usually around 25-30 minutes), or until the muffins are slightly browned and the tops bounce back when you tap them with a finger. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/0/03/Adjust-a-Muffin-Recipe-for-Jumbo-Size-Muffins-Step-9-preview .... Combine the wet and dry ingredients with the least amount of stirring possible.
