Tagging videos on Facebook not only lets people know that a video of them is on Facebook, but also opens it up to hundreds more people who might not have seen it if you hadn't tagged it. You can tag your own videos, or other people's videos, but you have to be Facebook friends with the person you're tagging.
You can only tag your friends in videos you've uploaded. To tag friends in a video: 1  Click the video to expand it. 2  Click Tag Video. 3  Type the name of the person you want to tag. 4  Click their name when it appears in the list of results. 5  Click Done Editing.
When trying to tag people in a video, I can type in all their names (the name predictor works fine) but when I want to click Finish and save the tags, nothing happens. The button is non-responsive and the only way out is to click cancel - but this of course causes the tags to not be changed.
Tagging a video on Facebook identifies the friends that the video features. Each tagged friend receives a notification, and the video appears on their profile's Photos and Videos section. The video also appears on their timeline and on their friends' news feeds. Tagging a video that your company releases can therefore help promote it to many people on Facebook.
