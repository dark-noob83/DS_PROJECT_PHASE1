Dose. The normal dose of Plaquenil is 1 tablet a day (200mg/day). Some doctors recommend 2 a day (400mg/day) but we find that 1 a day suits most people-the dose can always be increased for a flare. One of the attractions of this medication is its long 'half-life' - it stays in the system for days & weeks. 
To prevent malaria in adults traveling to an area of high risk, the recommended dose of Plaquenil is 400 mg once a week (on the exact same day each week), starting two weeks before the anticipated exposure. If you cannot start the medication in time (two weeks before your travel), it is recommended to start with a loading dose of 400 mg plus another 400 mg six hours apart. For children and infants, the dose is based on weight. Usually, 5 mg per kg of body weight (about 2.3 mg per pound) once weekly is recommended, not to exceed the normal adult dosage. Plaquenil comes only in adult-strength tablets, which taste extremely bitter when crushed or chewed
The usual starting dosage for treating lupus is 400 mg once or twice a day, and the recommended starting dose for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is 400 to 600 mg daily. If you cannot start the medication in time (two weeks before your travel), it is recommended to start with a loading dose of 400 mg plus another 400 mg six hours apart. For children and infants, the dose is based on weight. Usually, 5 mg per kg of body weight (about 2.3 mg per pound) once weekly is recommended, not to exceed the normal adult dosage.

For radical cure of vivax and malariae malaria concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary. One tablet of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 200 mg, is equivalent to 155 mg base. Lupus erythematosus-Initially, the average adult dose is 400 mg (=310 mg base) once or twice daily. This may be continued for several weeks or months, depending on the response of the patient. For prolonged maintenance therapy, a smaller dose, from 200 mg to 400 mg (=155 mg to 310 mg base) daily will frequently suffice. Maintenance dosage-When a good response is obtained (usually in four to twelve weeks), the dosage is reduced by 50 percent and continued at a usual maintenance level of 200 mg to 400 mg (=155 mg to 310 mg base) daily, each dose to be taken with a meal or a glass of milk.
