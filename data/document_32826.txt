According to the Department of Energy today's refrigerators, compared to those of the 1970s, save the the nation about $20 billion per year in energy costs, or $150 per year for the average American family. Even though refrigerators are more efficient, they still need to keep food cool or frozen 24 hours a day. On average, a refrigerator uses 13.7 percent of a home's energy, the largest energy-user behind an air conditioner, which uses 16 percent. Since the normal refrigerator lasts between 15 and 20 years, the energy efficiency decision you make when buying one will likely be with you for years.
A 1986-era 18 c.f. fridge uses 1400 kWh a year, while a modern energy-efficient model uses only 350 kWh — a whopping 75% reduction. At 15 kWh, trading in a pre-1986 fridge for a new efficient one would save about $158 a year in electricity costs. And some older fridges are even worse than the average. One reader estimates her savings to be $238 per year for trading in her 1979 fridge for a 2004 model. 
ENERGY STAR qualified refrigerators are required to use 20 percent less energy than models not labeled with the ENERGY STAR logo. Also look for an EnergyGuide label that tells you in kilowatt-hours (kWh) how much electricity a particular refrigerator model uses in a year. On average, a refrigerator uses 13.7 percent of a home's energy, the largest energy-user behind an air conditioner, which uses 16 percent. Since the normal refrigerator lasts between 15 and 20 years, the energy efficiency decision you make when buying one will likely be with you for years.
(Wattage x eight) ÷ 1000 = kWh per day. Where eight represents our presumed eight hours active time per day. Thus a 600 Watt unit – typical of older, larger refrigerators – would use 4.8 kilowatt hours daily, or 1750 per year; where a more modern 140 watt unit uses about 1.1 kWh daily, or approximately 400 per year. This is how many watts does a refrigerator use. No information is provided by the author
For example, you have a refrigerator manufactured in 1984. Since you don't have a kWh meter, you look in the table below and get 1457 kWh/year for the average refrigerator sold that year in Canada. The new appliance has a label claiming it uses only 410kWh per year. The potential savings are 1457 - 410 = 1047 kWh per year
A fridge will use anywhere from 100 to 400 watts depending on size, an average modern fridge will use 180 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a refrigerator using 180 Watts for 24 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Cost Per Hour: Price (kWh): Enter the cost you are paying on average per a kilowatt hour, average price in North America is 10 cents. If you are using an old fridge we highly recommend you upgrade to a more efficient modern model, advances in the past 15-20 years have reduced the energy use of refrigeration.
In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. 
3. Multiply the annual kilowatt-hours consumed by your refrigerator by your cost per kilowatt-hour. Based on the average consumption of 600 to 800 kilowatt-hours per year, consumers in California can expect to pay $98.40 to $131.20 per year to operate a refrigerator. Find the monthly operating cost by multiplying your daily cost by 30. At the California average electricity price, a 300-watt unit costs $11.70 per month, or $140.40 per year. Refrigerators with a lower wattage rating will require much less energy, and thus cost much less to operate.
The average refrigerator consumes 600 to 800 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, reports the Federal Trade Commission. If you've already removed the sticker, check your owner's manual or refer to the manufacturer's website to find this information. Find the monthly operating cost by multiplying your daily cost by 30. At the California average electricity price, a 300-watt unit costs $11.70 per month, or $140.40 per year.
