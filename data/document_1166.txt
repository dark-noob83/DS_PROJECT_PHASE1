If youâ€™re under age 50 and contributing to your 2012 IRA, the maximum you can contribute to your Traditional and Roth IRAs combined is $5,000. Unlike the past several years, that contribution limit is increasing for 2013 IRAs. In the coming year, taxpayers will see a $500 increase in the maximum contributions.
You may make a Traditional IRA contribution to your spouse's Traditional IRA because you have eligible compensation. There is no income limit for contributing to a Traditional IRA.
Married couples making more than $173,000 can't contribute to a Roth IRA. The rules are different for traditional IRAs. Anyone with sufficient income can contribute the maximum amount to a traditional IRA in any year -- the only question is whether the contribution is tax deductible.
Contribution Limits. Standard Roth IRAs have a contribution maximum of $5,000 per tax year per person. Individuals who earn less than $5,000 per tax year, however, can only contribute up to the amount of income they earned for the tax year. The maximum contribution amount is raised to $6,000 if the taxpayer is 50 years of age or older.
Contribution Limits. The maximum anyone under the age of 50 can contribute to an IRA is $5,000 per year. The maximum limit for couples is $10,000, and it doesn't matter if that comes from one person or both.
Generally, you can contribute up to $5,000 to an IRA in 2011 ($6,000 if you'll be age 50 or older by the end of the year), as long as you have taxable compensation at least equal to the amount of your IRA contribution.
You usually need earned income to contribute to an IRA. But because your wife still works, she can contribute to a spousal IRA on your behalf. You have until April 15, 2014, to contribute to an IRA for 2013 if you or your spouse had earned income in 2013.
Yes, you can contribute to a traditional and/or Roth IRA even if you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan (including a SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan). See the discussion of IRA Contribution Limits.
