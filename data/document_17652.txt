When it comes to recommended daily allowance of potassium for men, they need about 3,300 to 4,700 mg/day. The recommended potassium requirement for athletes is more as they exercise harder. The loss of potassium from the body is greater due to excessive sweating after a hard workout. I am sure you must be wondering, why do we need at least 4,700 mg of potassium per day in our diet. This is because potassium is a macronutrient just like calcium, sodium, magnesium, chloride, sulfur and phosphorous.
The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. Recommended intakes for potassium for children 1 to 3 years of age is 3,000 mg/day, 4 to 8 years of age is 3,800 mg/day, and 9 to 13 years of age is 4,500 mg/day. Potassium should come from food sources.
Recommendations. The adequate intake of potassium as established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine is 4,700 mg per day for males and females over the age of 14. Children between the ages of 9 and 13 need 4,500 mg per day of potassium. The daily intake of pregnant women is also 4,700 mg and breastfeeding mothers need 5,100 mg a day.

Recommended Daily Allowances. Adults over the age of 19, adolescents between 14 and 18 years old and pregnant women should consume 4,700 milligrams of potassium each day, says the Food and Nutrition Board. Nursing women over the age of 14 need more: 5,100 milligrams daily. 
The estimated minimum potassium requirements for women and men are 2000 mg per day. As children get older, they need more potassium and this increase can go up to 3800 – 4800 mg per day. A deficiency may cause muscular cramps, twitching, irregular heartbeat, kidney and lung failure and insomnia too. Daily potassium requirements: Potassium helps to maintain a healthy fluid balance in our body.
The minimum requirement of potassium for adults is 1.6 to 2.0 Gms (40 to 50 mEq) per day. For infants the requirement ranges from 500 to 1000 mg per day and for children the requirements can increase up to 2000 mgs per day. Potassium is readily absorbed from the small intestine. As children get older, they need more potassium and this increase can go up to 3800 – 4800 mg per day. A deficiency may cause muscular cramps, twitching, irregular heartbeat, kidney and lung failure and insomnia too. Daily potassium requirements: Potassium helps to maintain a healthy fluid balance in our body.
Potassium is in many foods, including vegetables, fruits, and milk products. You can figure out how much potassium is in a food by looking at the percent daily value section on the nutrition facts label. The food label assumes the daily value of potassium is 3,500 mg. So if one serving of a food has a daily value of 20% of potassium, that food has 700 mg of potassium in one serving. Normal potassium levels in the body help to keep the heart beating regularly. Potassium may help reduce your risk of kidney stones and also bone loss as you age. Healthy kidneys keep the right amount of potassium in the blood to keep the heart beating at a steady pace.
