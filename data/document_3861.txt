Definition of a Phenotype. An individual's phenotype consists of the traits we can observe. These can include features of appearance, behavior, metabolism, or anything else we can detect. On the other hand, an individual's genotype is what we call the genes that help to create that phenotype. There may be one gene at work, or more than one.
Definition: Phenotype is defined as an organism's expressed physical traits. Phenotype is determined by an individual's genotype and expressed genes, random genetic variation, and environmental influences. Examples: Examples of an organism's phenotype include traits such as color, height, size, shape, and behavior.
The phenotype of an organism is the class to which that organism belongs as determined by the description of the physical and behavioral characteristics of the organism, for example its size and shape, its metabolic activities and its pattern of movement.

A phenotype is an individual's observable traits, such as height, eye color, and blood type. The genetic contribution to the phenotype is called the genotype. Some traits are largely determined by the genotype, while other traits are largely determined by environmental factors.
