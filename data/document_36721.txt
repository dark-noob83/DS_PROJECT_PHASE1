Soups and Stews. For soaked black-eyed peas, cook from 1 hour to 90 minutes in a soup or stew. Cook unsoaked beans for 2 to 4 hours, testing every half hour. If vegetables are to be added to the soup or stew, add them approximately 30 minutes before the beans are completely softened because they will overcook if added earlier.
