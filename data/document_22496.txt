There are a few differences between the nucleus and nucleolus. To better differentiate the two parts of the cell, we should consider the functions, structures, and other features of these cellular organelles. Basically, the nucleolus is just a part of the nucleus. The nucleus is the main part of the cell while the nucleolus is part of the nucleus itself. The nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that is found in multi-celled organisms or eukaryotes. This membrane that encloses the nucleus has two parts. The parts of the membrane are the inner and outer cellular membrane. 2.The nucleus is membrane bound while the nucleolus is non-membrane bound. 3.The nucleus contains DNA while the nucleolus contains RNA. 4.The nucleus has the chromosomes and cellular membranes while the RNA has the fibrillar centers, dense fibrillar centers, and the granular component.
There is a whole other world inside the Nucleus. The Nucleus is what is usually around the center of the cell that contains the Nucleolus and is surrounded by the Nuclear Membrane or the Nuclear Envelope. The Nucleus is the brain of the cell. Its function is that it tells the cell what to do and how to do that
The nucleolus directs the assembly of proteins within the cell nucleus. The nucleolus is the part of the nucleus containing most of the genes that code for the synthesis of ri … bosomal RNA (rRNA: the RNA molecules found in ribosomes). So rRNA is synthesized within the nucleolus. While still within the nucleolus, these rRNA molecules are assembled, together with many protein molecules. into two subunits of future ribosomes. The subunits leave the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane, and enter the cytoplasm.
An organelle is any discrete functionally distinct structure within a cell. The nucleus is one example of an organelle-it is bound by the nuclear membrane and performs the s … pecific function of storing and regulating the transcription of the genetic material of the cell. 
Best Answer: The nucleus houses the cell's DNA. The nucleus is only found in eukaryotic cells. The nucleolus is an organelle inside the nucleus that houses proteins and RNA. Also found in eukaryotic cells. The nucleoid is an irregularly shaped region that houses genetic material. This is only found in prokaryotes. 
The nucleolus (plural nucleoli) is a non-membrane bound structure and is the centre of the cell. It is composed of proteins and nucleic acids found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Its function is to transcribe ribosomal RNA(r RNA) and assemble it within the cell. So rRNA is synthesized within the nucleolus. While still within the nucleolus, these rRNA molecules are assembled, together with many protein molecules. into two subunits of future ribosomes. The subunits leave the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane, and enter the cytoplasm.
The nucleolus is the central portion of the cell nucleus and is composed of ribosomal RNA, proteins and DNA. It also contains ribosomes in various stages of synthesis. The nucleolus accomplishes the manufacture of the ribosomes. The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus with a double membrane with multiple pores. The pores regulate the passage of macromolecules like proteins and RNA, but permit free passage of water, ions, ATP and other small molecules.

Best Answer: In cell Biology: The nucleolus (also called nucleole) is a non-membrane bound structure found within the nucleus in which ribosomal RNA is transcribed, and is composed of protein and nucleic acids. he nucleus (pl. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression.
Report Abuse. Nucleus is the organelle present mostly at the centre of a cell containing genetic material(DNA) and controls all the activities of the cell including Heredity. Nucleolus is the structure present inside the Nucleus that contains DNA and is involved in synthesis of Ribosomal RNA and ultimately Ribosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression.
