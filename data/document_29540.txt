BURLEY — Converting furrow irrigated fields to sprinkler systems can save crop producers time and money while improving water quality, but those benefits come at a cost. Depending on the system and field conditions, installing a center pivot can cost $80,000 or more. 
You can substantially reduce the investment cost of a center pivot irrigation system by increasing the length of the pivot. Using a half-mile center pivot rather than four quarter-mile systems reduces the gross investment by 40 percent, or $218.00 per acre (from $556.00 to $338.00), as shown in Table 2. Labor costs at $12 per hour using furrow and LEPA center pivot were $28.35 and $11.29 per acre, respectively. By switching to more an efficient irrigation system, growers can reduce labor costs by $17.06 for each acre irrigated annually. Table 10.
40 acre Center Pivot System Example. Estimating Annual Irrigation Operation Costs 3-10. Standard 40 acre system with end gun, installed at a cost of $38,000 with a well and power source cost of $30,000. A standard procedure is outlined on page 7 of MSU Extension Bulletin E2131, “Custom Work Rates in Michigan”. The following would be modification of the DIRTI #5 pricing system.
The cost of Valley ® equipment is widely misunderstood. When compared to other irrigation technologies, such as drip and solid set, the cost of center pivots is usually less, including installation and service. Plus, Valley brand equipment can last 25-35 years, depending upon care and water quality. How long does it take a crew to install a center pivot? It can vary. For example, a standard 1/4 mile, 130-acre center pivot can be unloaded and set up* in two days by a four-man crew. Pivot pad and wiring will add some time, but, in many cases, are done at the same time as the initial installation by other workers.
DESCRIPTION: 60 Acre Center Pivot The 60-acre stationary center pivot system described here is considered a typical size unit in Alabama. When the pivot point is located at the center of a 68 acre block of land, this system will irrigate approximately 60 acres. (In order to irrigate 60 acres, an end gun must be used to extend coverage beyond the pivot pipe. A breakdown of component costs is shown below for the irrigation system illustrated on page 1
