The eggs hatch in the order they were laid. Eaglets break through the shell by using their egg tooth, a pointed bump on the top of the beak. It can take from twelve to forty-eight hours to hatch after making the first break in the shell (pipping). As a result, the height of the nest in the tree matches that of the deck, with 40 - 50 yards between. I asked permission from the homeowners to photograph the eagles. Having nested there for 10+ years, the eagles are very used to people on the deck; they go about their nesting duties and do not pay any attention.
Bald Eagle Fledging Time. It is the time of year when bald eagles in Virginia are fledging their young. Last week, this week and the next two weeks the vast majority of new bald eagles will take to the air for the first time â€“ called fledging. 
Eggs are laid a few days apart and consequently hatch in the order they were laid. Female eaglets tend to be larger than their male counterparts. Like most birds of prey, the female adult is also larger than the male. Adult eagles range from 33-35 inches long for males and 35-37 inches for females. See photos 3-5. Before baby eaglets hatch, there is always one parent in the nest to incubate the eggs and protect them from predators. The parents share incubation obligations for about 35 days.
1 It took the Decorah Eagles 37 days in 2009 and 2011, and 36 days in 2010. 2  35 to 37 days is a safe bet. 3  From pip to hatch: Pipping occurs when the baby eagle's egg tooth first breaks through the eggshell. 4  It can take as long as a day for the chick to fully hatch. 1 35 to 37 days is a safe bet. 2  From pip to hatch: Pipping occurs when the baby eagle's egg tooth first breaks through the eggshell. 3  It can take as long as a day for the chick to fully hatch. 4  79% of clutches have two eggs.
EGGS A bald eagle egg is slightly smaller than a domestic goose egg. The chick will measure 4 to 5 inches at hatching and weigh only a matter of ounces. Bald eagles incubate their eggs for about 35 days. They begin incubation as soon as the first egg is laid. The second egg usually appears within 36 to 72 hours after the first. Occasionally a clutch of 3 eggs will be produced
Bald eagles build their nests in large trees near rivers or coasts. A typical nest is around 5 feet in diameter. Eagles often use the same nest year after year. Over the years, some nests become enormous, as much as 9 feet in diameter, weighing two tons. As a result, the height of the nest in the tree matches that of the deck, with 40 - 50 yards between. I asked permission from the homeowners to photograph the eagles. Having nested there for 10+ years, the eagles are very used to people on the deck; they go about their nesting duties and do not pay any attention.

Q. About how long does it take for the bald eagle's eggs to hatch and how long until it can fly? A. It takes 35 days to hatch, then young in nest 10-12 weeks more unti lthey fledge (fly from nest). Q. How old are they before young eagles can fly? A. At 10-12 weeks, when they leave their nest. Q. When do eagles learn to fly and how? A. At between 10-12 weeks as they first leave the nest (fledge), and then with more and more practice to and from the nest and surrounding trees over the next month or two. Another study estimated that only 11 % of eagles were alive after 3 years of life. In general, we believe that only about 1 in 10 eagles survive to adulthood (5 yrs of age). Ecology Q. How many pounds of food does a Bald Eagle eat in a day? A. Approximately .5 - 1.5 per day.
There are an estimated 7,066 nesting pairs of bald eagles, due to the efforts of federal agencies, tribes, state and local governments, conservation groups, universities, corporations, and thousands of individuals.

Having nested there for 10+ years, the eagles are very used to people on the deck; they go about their nesting duties and do not pay any attention.
Q. How long are the laying and hatching intervals for bald eagles? A. The interval between eggs is usually two to four days, depending upon how many eggs are laid. In 2009, Mom Hornby laid her second egg three days after the first. Q. How big are bald eagle eggs? A. On average, the eggs are 7.0 to 7.6 centimetres (2.8 to 3 inches) long and 5.3 to 5.6 centimetres (2.1 to 2.2 inches) wide. Reported weights range from 110 grams to as much as 130 grams (3.9 to 4.6 ounces), with Alaskan birds producing the largest and heaviest eggs.
