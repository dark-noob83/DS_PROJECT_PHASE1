Employer Rates. Employers are also required to pay FICA and Medicare taxes on wages paid to employees. In 2011, unlike the employee's rate, which decreased from the previous year, the employer's FICA rate remained unchanged from 2010 at 6.2 percent of taxable wages to $106,800 for the year.
The 2014 FICA tax rate is 6.2% for social security taxes and 1.45% for Medicare taxes. This is the employee’s contribution. The employer gives that much again for a total of 12.4% and 2.9% respectively that goes to the IRS on behalf of each employee. This reflects no change from 2013 (most of tax year 2012).
Different rates apply for these taxes. The current tax rate for Social Security is 6.2% for the employer and 6.2% for the employee, or 12.4% total. The current rate for Medicare is 1.45% for the employer and 1.45% for the employee, or 2.9% total. Refer to Publication 15, (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide, for more information; or Publication 51, (Circular A), Agricultural Employer’s Tax Guide, for agricultural employers.
