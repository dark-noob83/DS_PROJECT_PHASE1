The blessing may be given by the wedding officiate or by a friend or family member of the same faith. The blessing is usually in the form of a dinner prayer at a wedding reception, so finding a traditional one should be fairly easy.
Who Gives the Prayer. Who gives the prayer is really up to the couple. Often the clergy who performed the ceremony gives the dinner prayer. If you want to have your priest or clergyman give the blessing before the dinner, be sure to mention this in planning sessions before the wedding date.
Traditional wedding blessings are used during two separate parts of a wedding: within the ceremony and at the reception.
Sometimes, blessings are simply well-wishes of other who approve of something, such as a marriage. Wedding traditions are typically passed down through families or through faith practices. Therefore, a traditional blessing at a wedding is usually one that has been used time and time again.
Some couples prefer that the toast take place after dessert and before they cut their wedding cake. If you are going to do it this way create a one-page order of events that can be placed on the tables. It is usually on the serving dish at each guestâ€™s place.
