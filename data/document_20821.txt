52 weeks x 31 hours = 1612 required billable hours by most companies in one year. But the reality is you’re probably not working on many holidays. You probably take off two weeks per year for vacation and you probably lose another week’s time with Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, Christmas, etc. 49 weeks x 31 hours = 1519 hours you’re probably required to bill clients in a year.
To work out how many days holiday you can take a year, you need to multiply 5.6 by the number of days you work in a week. For example: 1  if you work a five-day week, you are entitled to 28 days' paid holiday a year (5.6 X 5). 2  if you work 2.5 days a week, you are entitled to 14 days' paid holiday a year (5.6 X 2.5). 
Two weeks makes 10 business days, for a total of 260 working days, not accounting for vacation time that y … ou take. In the US people commonly say there are 260 weekdays/work days in a year or 2080 work hours in a year based on 52 weeks per year. (260 = 5wkdys/wk*52wks) (2080=40hrs/wk*52wks/yr) The number can vary by year. For example, 2012 had 261 weekdays and 366 total days. We define a holiday as a day which, in the absence of its designation as a nonworking holiday, would be a work-day.248.7143. This is the average number of work-days in a year, based on a year of 365 days and 52.14286 weeks, with 12 legal, nonworking holidays.
2080 is full time, 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. 2000 considers the 10 national holidays. 1980 is the figure that is being used in the acquisition which I am supporting. I questioned the rationale of using 49.5 weeks (1980/40) as a Person Year because it not only breaks a week in half, it breaks a day in half. What number of hours would you use, as a general matter. If you start with 2,080 hours in a year, you first deduct Holidays. If you go with the ten Federal recognized ones, you are already down to 2,000. Then there's paid time off. That seems to be what many companies refer to and combine annual leave with sick leave (federal terms).
________________ (The calculations below are for the United States. The numbers may vary significantly for other countries.) A normal work week for most jobs is 8 hours a day for 5 days. There are 52 weeks in a year but most workers get a two week vacation. So, 8 X 5 X 50 = 2000 hours worked in a year. Many companies also give 10 holidays, which brings it down to 8 x 5 x 48 = 1920. Many companies also give 5 days of sick/personal time per year, which brings it down to 8 x 5 x 47 = 1880. 
Working 5 days a week. Most workers who work a 5-day week must receive 28 days’ paid annual leave per year. This is calculated by multiplying a normal week (5 days) by the annual entitlement of 5.6 weeks. 
Basic calculation For a basic calculation of your leave allowance multiply the number of days you work a week by 5.6. For example, if you work a five day week you would be entitled to 28 day' annual leave a year: 5 days x 5.6 weeks = 28 days If your on a full time contract. The employer can include Bank Holidays in that if they want to. 
The work time in Brazil is 44 hours per week, usually 8 hours per day and 4 hours on Saturday or 8.8 hours per day. On duty/no meal break jobs are 6 hours per day. Public servants work 40 hours a week. The overtime limits are: 15 hours a week, 27 hours over two weeks, 43 hours over four weeks, 45 hours a month, 81 hours over two months and 120 hours over three months; however, some workers get around these restrictions by working several hours a day without 'clocking in' whether physically or metaphorically.
Base Hours (2080) minus Vacation Hours, Holiday Hours, Sick/Emergency Leave Hours = # of productive hours for the year. Now, like you said, the 2080hrs is based on a 40hr work week. Keep in mind that contractors can choose how they manage their workforce to meet any particular requirement. If you start with 2,080 hours in a year, you first deduct Holidays. If you go with the ten Federal recognized ones, you are already down to 2,000. Then there's paid time off. That seems to be what many companies refer to and combine annual leave with sick leave (federal terms).
As a simple baseline calculation, let's say you take 2 weeks off each year as unpaid vacation time. Then you would be working 50 weeks of the year, and if you work a typical 40 hours a week, you have a total of 2,000 hours of work each year. In this case, you can quickly compute the hourly wage by dividing the annual salary by 2000. Your yearly salary of $72,000 is then equivalent to an average hourly wage of.
