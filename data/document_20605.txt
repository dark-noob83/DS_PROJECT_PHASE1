Marriage. Once you are married and decide to take on the name of your new spouse it is your duty to notify the Social Security Administration. You must obtain a new Social Security Card stating your new name. The SSA will find out you are married when you file form SS-5 along with a certified copy of your marriage certificate. The SSA then notifies the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of your name change.
If you get Social Security disability or retirement benefits and you marry, your benefit will stay the same. Here’s how marriage may affect other benefits: Supplemental Security Income (SSI). 1  If you marry, your spouse's income and resources may change your SSI benefit; or. 2  If you and your spouse both get SSI, your benefit amount will change from an individual rate to a couple’s rate.

If you're on Social Security and are married, or thinking about getting married, knowing the rules that govern your benefits is crucial.
Social Security, Marriage, and Divorce. A married person can collect retirement benefits based on his or her own earnings from work, or an amount equal to 50 percent of the other spouse's retired worker benefit—whichever is the higher amount.
Divorce. Divorcing your spouse is something the SSA only needs to know if you change your name back to your maiden name. The process of notifying the SSA of your divorce is identical to the process used to notify the SSA of your marital name change after your wedding.
You only need to let them know if you plan to change your name. If you WANT to change your name you need to take your marriage certificate to the DMV and Social Security Administration. You may also have to send a copy of the certificate to all your credit card companies.
