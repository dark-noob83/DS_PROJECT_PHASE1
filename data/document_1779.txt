Bake for 20 to 30 minutes: The chicken is done when opaque all the way through and the meat registers at least 165°F in the thickest part. Broil for extra-crispy skin: If you'd like the skin to be a bit more crispy and golden, turn on the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes. Cooking time is generally 20 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken registers 165°F in the thickest part. Amazingly, all the chicken pieces wind up cooking at about the same rate — dark meat pieces cook a bit slower than white meat, but the thickness of the breast meat means everything finishes around the same time.
Optional: Prior to baking, place a few garlic cloves (outer skins removed) under the skin of the chicken. Alternatively, place a 1/2 tablespoon of butter and some freshly chopped herbs under the skin. Make sure the chicken skin is repositioned snugly over the garlic cloves or butter and herbs. Season the chicken with salt and pepper — don’t be stingy on the salt, as you want the chicken skin to be evenly seasoned. Bake for 45 - 55 minutes until skin is crispy and golden.

•Roast whole (thawed) chickens for 20 minutes per pound, plus an additional 15 minutes. High heat method (this creates a crispy, darker skin): •Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and cook whole (thawed) chicken for 10-15 minutes. •Then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and roast for 20 minutes per pound. --7-7.5lbs=2 hours/45 minutes=2 hours/30 minutes. NOTE: These times are for unstuffed birds. Add 15 minutes to the total cooking time if you're roasting a stuffed chicken. And as with the chicken itself, make sure the stuffing reaches a temperature of at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

You can bake the chicken legs in a 375°F. oven, if desired. Increase the baking time to 45 to 50 minutes. Tip: An accurate way to check chicken doneness is to insert an instant-read thermometer into the thigh, avoiding the bone. It should read 180°F when the chicken is done.

Bake the chicken. Put the chicken in the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. Check the chicken after 30 minutes. It should be ready when the skin is crispy and golden brown, or when the internal temperature has reached 180 degrees. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature. 7.
