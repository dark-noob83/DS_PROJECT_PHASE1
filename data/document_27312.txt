This means that it is correct to talk about the energy of an X-ray or the wavelength of a microwave or the frequency of a radio wave. In fact, X-rays and gamma-rays are usually described in terms of energy, optical and infrared light in terms of wavelength, and radio in terms of frequency.
So using the standard equation: E = hf, we can find the relationship between light intensity and wavelength as follows: c = lambda x f Therefore, f = c/lambda substitute this in the standard equation to get: E = (h c)/lambda Where h = planks constant, and c = speed of light.
The wavelength of light, and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, is related to the frequency by a relatively simple equation: where c is the speed of light (measured in meters per second), n is the frequency of the light in hertz (Hz), and l is the wavelength of the light measured in meters.

Relevance. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Intensity is the number of photons, wavelength is the colour. The Energy of each photon is given by E=hv where E = Energy, h = Planck constant and v is the frequency. The relationship between frequency (v and wavelength l) is given by c = vl where c = speed of light.

Wavelength is usually measured in meters (m). Frequency is the number of cycles of a wave to pass some point in a second. The units of frequency are thus cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz).
Electromagnetic waves can be described by their wavelengths, energy, and frequency. All three of these things describe a different property of light, yet they are related to each other mathematically.
light intensity is the sum of each photon's energy arriving in a particular area in a particular time period. the energy of each photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. If you are talking about luminous intensity then you need to weight the sum-see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_in...
