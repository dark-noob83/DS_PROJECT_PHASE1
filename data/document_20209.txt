Meronyms (substance of iron ore): atomic number 26; Fe; iron (a heavy ductile magnetic metallic element; is silver-white in pure form but readily rusts; used in construction and tools and armament; plays a role in the transport of oxygen by the blood).
The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items.
Iron ore. Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite, hematite, goethite, limonite or siderite. Ores carrying very high quantities of hematite or magnetite are known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
Noun. 1. iron ore-an ore from which iron can be extracted. atomic number 26, Fe, iron-a heavy ductile magnetic metallic element; is silver-white in pure form but readily rusts; used in construction and tools and armament; plays a role in the transport of oxygen by the blood.
chamosite (a greenish grey or black silicate of iron and aluminum). taconite (a variety of chert containing magnetite and hematite; mined as a low-grade iron ore). haematite; hematite (the principal form of iron ore; consists of ferric oxide in crystalline form; occurs in a red earthy form).
