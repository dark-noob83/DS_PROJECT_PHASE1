Retail USPS Tracking: USPS sells retail tracking at its post offices. Just fill out PS Form 152, which is a bright green label that is available at the customer desk. You can check the status of your item by entering a code online at USPS’s Track and Confirm page or by calling a number on the form.
USPS Tracking is a way for you to make sure that your most important packages make it to their final destinations. The US Postal Service can tell you the date, time and zip code where your item was delivered, giving you peace of mind.
On the individual package, for any First Class, Priority Mail or Priority Express Mail package, the cost of tracking is very low. It is only $1.05 directly at the post office counter, or you can add it to your online purchase for $0.23. The tracking must be added at the time of shipping.
USPS Tracking is free when purchased at the Post Office. USPS Tracking can be combined with other services, including Return Receipt, Return Receipt for Merchandise, Collect on Delivery (COD), Domestic Insurance, Registered Mail, Restricted Delivery and Special Handling.
USPS Tracking service is represented by a bar code that is either printed on your shipping label or attached to your letter or package with a sticker. In addition to information about the item’s final destination, the bar code allows the USPS to track how your item moves from city to city.
Those are all different options that you can choose for your shipment. All tracking does is tell you when a package has left its origination point and has been received by USPS, and when USPS has delivered the package to the address of record.
