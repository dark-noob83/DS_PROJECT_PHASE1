Renal glycosuria, also known as renal glucosuria, is a rare condition in which the simple sugar glucose is excreted in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. 
Kidney disease can also lead to glycosuria, and often the progression of kidney disease can be measured by the amount of sugar in urine, with increases in the presence being indicative of a worsening in the conditions. Glycosuria or glucosuria is the presence of glucose in the urine. At times, people may commonly refer to this as sugar in urine. Ordinarily, glucose is absorbed by tubes in the renal system before urine is passed to the kidneys, which means that the presence of glucose in urine is a sign of a medical problem.

Glycosuria Glycosuria or glucosuria is a condition of osmotic diuresis typical in those suffering from diabetes mellitus. It leads to excretion of glucose in the urine. Due to a lack of the hormone insulin, plasma glucose levels are above normal.
This information shows the various causes of Glycosuria, and how common these diseases or conditions are in the general population. This is not a direct indication as to how commonly these diseases are the actual cause of Glycosuria, but gives a relative idea as to how frequent these diseases are seen overall. 1  1 disease that is very common. 2  1 disease that is common. 3  1 disease that is uncommon. Causes of Glycosuria that are uncommon. The following causes of Glycosuria are diseases or conditions that affect more than 200,000 people, but less than 1 million people in the USA: 1  Liver disease. 2  more causes...Â».
Emotions causing glycosuria: Emotional glycosuria is a condition in which emotions like fear, anger, anxiety etc can cause to release the hormone adrenaline. This hormone promotes breaking down of sugars to produce energy for flight or fight reaction. Kidney disorders including infections may result in glycosuria. Symptoms of glycosuria in such cases include pain in the kidney area, fever and difficulty in passing urine. Urine tests may reveal excretion of glucose along with a large number of white blood cells, proteins, etc.
Sugars A high level of glucose and other sugars in the urine (glycosuria) is often a symptom of diabetes mellitus. Glycosuria can also be caused by advanced kidney disease, Cushing's syndrome, impaired tubular reabsorption, shock, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland (pheochromocytoma), or cancer of the pancreas. Glycosuria Glycosuria or glucosuria is a condition of osmotic diuresis typical in those suffering from diabetes mellitus. It leads to excretion of glucose in the urine. Due to a lack of the hormone insulin, plasma glucose levels are above normal.
Ad. Another cause for glucose in the urine is a condition known as renal glycosuria. In renal glycosuria, the renal tubules of the kidneys are unable to reabsorb glucose, which is instead expelled in the urine even when the blood sugar levels are normal or even low. 
Renal glycosuria, also known as renal glucosuria, is a rare condition in which the simple sugar glucose is excreted in the urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood.
Signs & Symptoms. In individuals with renal glycosuria, glucose is excreted in the urine in the presence of normal or low concentrations of blood glucose. With normal renal function, as blood flows through the kidneys, glucose and other substances are filtered from the fluid portion of the blood. 
Causes of Glycosuria. Diabetes mellitus: The lack of insulin in the blood elevates the glucose levels. When there is too much glucose in the blood, the kidneys are not able to reabsorb the sugar back into the bloodstream, allowing some of it to be excreted in the urine. Kidney disorders including infections may result in glycosuria. Symptoms of glycosuria in such cases include pain in the kidney area, fever and difficulty in passing urine. Urine tests may reveal excretion of glucose along with a large number of white blood cells, proteins, etc.
