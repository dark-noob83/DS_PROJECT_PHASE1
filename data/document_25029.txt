The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most important of four strong ligaments connecting the bones of the knee joint. It is often injured. Ligaments are strong, dense structures made of connective tissue that stabilize a joint. They connect bone to bone across the joint.
The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the four main ligaments of the knee, and the ACL provides 85% of the restraining force to anterior tibial displacement at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion.
Stands for Access Control List.. An ACL is a list of user permissions for a file, folder, or other object. It defines what users and groups can access the object and what operations they can perform. These operations typically include read, write, and execute.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. An access control list (ACL), with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation.

ACL. Short for Access Control List, an ACL is a list containing one or more ACE which are used by an operating system or other network device to appropriately restrict the rights users have. For example, an ACL may specify if a user or the users group have access to a file or folder on that computer or network.
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of a pair of cruciate ligaments (the other being the posterior cruciate ligament) in the human knee. They are also called cruciform ligaments as they are arranged in a crossed formation.
