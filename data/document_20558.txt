On average a human bone can sustain 40 times the amount of force as can concrete. On average concrete can sustain a force of 3,000 psi. So 40 x 3000=120,000 psi. Of course that is an average taken and it is not specific to the scapula or the age of a person.
How many pounds of pressure does it take to break a human collar bone. It only requires about 10ft-lbs of force to fracture a collarbone, that's about the same as snapping a plastic spoon. report this answer. Updated on Thursday, February 02 2012 at 01:31PM EST. Source: mountain.bike198.com/...
3. Throat – Crushing the human throat takes roughly that same amount of pressure as crushing an empty soda can. 4. Collar bone – Approximately 8 lbs of force to snap this bone. 5. Elbow joint – Breaking the elbow joint take between 5-8 lbs of force.
The collarbone is a long, thin bone between your breastbone (sternum) and your shoulder. It is also called the clavicle. You have 2 collarbones, 1 on each side of your breastbone. They help to keep your shoulders in line.
That depends on the bone. It is very easy to fracture a small bone, especially if the pressure is applied across the weakest point. I'm not sure exactly how much pressure is needed, but I can tell you that as little as 25 pounds of pressure applied to one of your small bones will cause a fracture.
A broken collarbone, or fractured clavicle, is a common injury. It usually happens after a fall or a blow to the shoulder. It takes about six to eight weeks to heal in adults, and three to six weeks in children. The collarbone, or clavicle, is a long slender bone that runs from the breastbone to each of the shoulders.
