The bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of acute bacterial sinusitis. This type of bacteria can be resistant to the most common types of antibiotics at standard dosages, although there are other antibiotics that can be used to treat the condition.
Sinusitis is the inflammation of the sinus that is caused by either a viral or bacterial infection. Sinusitis typically occurs when excess mucus develops or there is a blockage to the sinuses.
Causes. Acute sinusitis can be caused by viral, bacterial, or fungal infections. Allergans and environmental irritants are other possible causes. In most cases, acute sinusitis is caused by an upper respiratory tract viral infection, such as the common cold, and usually resolves on its own.
Acute Sinusitis. Acute sinusitis is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The common cold, which is caused by a virus, may lead to swelling of the sinuses, trapping air and mucus behind the narrowed sinus openings. Both the nasal and the sinus symptoms usually go away within two weeks.
Inflammation of the sinus cavity that lasts for more than three months is chronic sinusitis. Although bacteria often colonize obstructed sinuses, bacterial infections are not the only cause of chronic sinusitis. Anatomy, allergies, polyps, immune deficiencies, and dental diseases may also cause chronic sinus problems.
Most often, acute sinusitis is caused by a virus (known as acute viral sinusitis) or bacteria (acute bacterial sinusitis). This is why the terms sinusitis and  sinus infection  are used interchangeably. About 98 percent of acute sinusitis cases are caused by a virus. When viruses enter the sinuses, they can:
