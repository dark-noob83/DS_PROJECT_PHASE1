The climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Stream, which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. The Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. As of 21 October 2015, it runs 66°33′45.9″ north of the Equator.
