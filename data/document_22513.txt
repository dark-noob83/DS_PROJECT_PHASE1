Mycobacterium smegmatis is a common microorganism which, for a number of reasons, has become one of the most important bacteria for biological study. It is easy to culture and reproduces rapidly. It is non-pathogenic to humans and other animals.
M. smegmatis is commonly used in work on the mycobacterium species due to its being a fast grower and non-pathogenic. M. smegmatis is a simple model that is easy to work with, i.e., with a fast doubling time and only requires a biosafety level 1 laboratory.
Mycobacterium smegmatis is an acid-fast bacterial species in the phylum Actinobacteria and the genus Mycobacterium.
Mycobacteria are unicellular, aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria, taxonomically related to the antibiotic-producing streptomycetes. They are unusual among bacteria in that they have an enormously thick, hydrophobic cell wall that prevents desiccation.
