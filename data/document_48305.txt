But there are still many issues to be resolved, including what is required of operators to meet FAA equipage deadlines, what the costs will be and what services operators can expect to receive for having installed ADS-B and other NextGen technologies (for aircraft and air traffic control). Steve Brown, NBAA’s chief operating officer, has a unique perspective on NextGen, having previously served as the FAA’s vice president of operations planning and associate administrator for air traffic services.
To implement this, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will undertake a wide-ranging transformation of the entire United States air transportation system. This transformation has the aim of reducing gridlock, both in the sky and at the airports. It also estimates that by 2018, NextGen will reduce aviation fuel consumption by 1.4 billion gallons, reduce emissions by 14 million tons and save $23 billion in costs. Each mile in the air costs an airline about $0.10-$0.15 per seat in operating expenses like flight crew and fuel.
youngc1@gao.gov. To address challenges to the aviation industry's economic health and safety, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is collaborating with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other federal partners to plan and implement the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). As requested, this report discusses the extent to which FAA's and NASA's human factors research (1) is coordinated and (2) supports NextGen. To address these issues, GAO reviewed coordination mechanisms and planning documents and synthesized the views of nine aviation human factors experts.
The FAA, in collaboration with industry, is deploying NextGen procedures and technology on the ground, in the air, at air traffic control facilities and in the cockpit. So, too, is the agency writing and enacting the policies that govern these advances. From the beginning of NextGen, the FAA has placed a high priority on collaborating with other government agencies and international organizations in the development and implementation of air traffic management (ATM) advances worldwide.
4 An FAA Definition. NextGen is an umbrella term for the ongoing, wide-ranging transformation of the United States’ national airspace system (NAS). This evolution is vital to meeting future demand, and avoid. to gridlock in the sky and at our nation’s airports. http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/nextgen/defined/what/
ERAU NextGen Programs. ERAU NextGen Programs are conducted in Florida at one of the three FAA facilities around the country that are responsible for the testing, development, and integration of new NextGen technologies into the national air transportation system. 
2010. Courtesy FAA. NextGen is an umbrella term for the ongoing, wide-ranging transformation of the United States national airspace system (NAS). At its most basic level, NextGen represents an evolution from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management
The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is a new National Airspace System due for implementation across the United States in stages between 2012 and 2025. It also estimates that by 2018, NextGen will reduce aviation fuel consumption by 1.4 billion gallons, reduce emissions by 14 million tons and save $23 billion in costs. Each mile in the air costs an airline about $0.10-$0.15 per seat in operating expenses like flight crew and fuel.
