The Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard are two types of poisonous (venomous) lizards found in North America. These large, thick-bodied lizards have short, stubby limbs. They live in desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.
Geckos do not have any venomous glands in their body. They also have no method of transmitting the venom to a prey item, there are no fangs, or shooting glands.
Geckos are Not Poisonous. None of the various types of geckos are considered poisonous. Geckos do not produce any type of poison or venom on their skin or inside their mouths. Because geckos are not poisonous, the chances of your dog being seriously sickened due to coming into contact with one are relatively low.
Geckos are not poisonous at all, neither for humans nor for their prey. Only very few lizard species have a venom and of those, only the Gila monster and the Komodo dragon are â€¦ dangerous to humans (although with an attacking Komodo, venom is the least of your worries). + 53 others found this useful.

Gecko Bites. Geckos are not poisonous but their mouths do contain bacteria and they can deliver a fairly nasty bite. If your dog is bitten by a gecko and it breaks the skin, you'll need to take your dog to a veterinarian. The wound will need to be cleaned thoroughly and your dog may be prescribed an antibiotic.
