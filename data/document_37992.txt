Strategies for avoiding change and cancellation fees. If you’re canceling an award flight with a carrier that charges hefty redeposit fees, you should never pay them until you have to. That’s because several things can happen before the day of departure that can entitle you to cancel your award without penalty. Finally, you might not want to bother canceling an award at all sometimes. If the change fee is $200, and you have a one-way award that only cost 12,500 miles, then you might rather just forfeit the miles rather than buy them back at 1.6 cents each.

There is a simple method to avoid the $75 “close in ticketing fee” on United awards that is triggered when you try to book a ticket within 21 days of departure.
