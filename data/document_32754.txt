Temperatures in the Arctic Tundra can go down to almost -60°F. The hottest time of the year can average to between 50°F-32°F. An average temperature that goes any higher than 32 degrees Fahrenheit exists for only as few as 55 days an year. 
The arctic is known for its cold, desert-like conditions. The growing season ranges from 50 to 60 days. The average winter temperature is -34 C (-30 F), but the average summer temperature is 3-12 C (37-54 F) which enables this biome to sustain life. Rainfall may vary in different regions of the arctic. Yearly precipitation, including melting snow, is 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches). Soil is formed slowly
The Arctic tundra, where the average temperature is 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-12 to -6 degrees Celsius), supports a variety of animal species, including Arctic foxes, polar bears, gray wolves, caribou, snow geese and musk-oxen. 
At the lowest altitude that the Alpine tundra can appearat (about 10,000feet) the average summer temperature is-12 to 10 degreesCelsius. During the winter, the average temperature is about temperature -57 to -7 degrees Celsius. 
There are several weeks where the sun never rises. This causes the temperatures to drop to extremely cold levels. The average temperature of the tundra is around -28°C while extremes can dip to -70°C. Precipitation levels in the tundra are from 6 to 10 inches a year. Most of this falls as snow. 
Spring and fall are only short periods between winter and summer. The tundra is the world's coldest and driest biomes. The average annual temperature is -18° F (-28° C). Nights can last for weeks when the sun barely rises during some months in the winter, and the temperature can drop to -94° F (-70° C). Temperatures can get up to 54° F (12° C), but it can get as cold as 37° F (3° C). Average summer temperatures range from 37° to 60°F (3° to 16°C). The Arctic tundra is also a windy place and winds can blow between 30 to 60 miles (48 to 97 kilometers) per hour.
Tundra’s average annual temperature is -28 degrees Celsius making it very difficult for organisms to survive. During the winter, temperatures averages at -34 degrees Celsius where nights can last for weeks and daylight can barely last a few hours. Average Monthly Precipitation in Tundra. Tundra’s precipitation varies, depending on the temperature, rainfall and region. However, early precipitation (rain and snow) ranges from 15-25 cm.
Conditions are not right for a true tundra to form. Average annual temperatures are -70°F (-56°C). Tundra comes from the Finnish word tunturia, which means a barren land. The ground is permanently frozen 10 inches to 3 feet (25 to 100 cm) down so that trees can't grow there. Temperatures can get up to 54° F (12° C), but it can get as cold as 37° F (3° C). Average summer temperatures range from 37° to 60°F (3° to 16°C). The Arctic tundra is also a windy place and winds can blow between 30 to 60 miles (48 to 97 kilometers) per hour.
Average Annual Tempurature. Tundra winters are long, dark, and cold, with mean temperatures below 0°C for six to 10 months of the year. The temperatures are so cold that there is a layer of permanently frozen ground below the surface, called permafrost. This is a graph showing the Average Annual.
The average temperature per year is 16 degrees°F. The highest temperature can get to 45° F and the coldest temperature can get to 10° F below 0. That makes it one of the coldest regions on earth. This biome feels freezing most of the year. The average precipitation per year is more than 18 inches, and most of it falls as the snow. Average precipitation per season is 4.5 inches. The type of precipitation that falls in this climate is mostly snow in the winter, and in the summer it is rain, with occasional snow.
