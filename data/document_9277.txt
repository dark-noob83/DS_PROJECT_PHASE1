Pituitary Gland. The pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is about the size of a pea and sits in the small, bony cavity (sella turcica) at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland is divided into two sections: the anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) and the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis). The posterior pituitary is, in effect, a projection of the hypothalamus.
, the anterior lobe ( adenohypophysis ) and the posterior lobe ( neurohypophysis ). As their names suggest, the anterior lobe is located in front of, i.e. anterior to the posterior lobe. Some more detailed descriptions of the pituitary gland state that it consists of. :
neurohypophysis. [-hīpof′isis]. Etymology: Gk, neuron + hypo, under, phyein, to grow. the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland that is the release point of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin. Nervous stimulation from the hypothalamus controls the release of the substances into the blood.
Medical Definition of NEUROHYPOPHYSIS. : the portion of the pituitary gland that is derived from the embryonic brain, is composed of the infundibulum and neural lobe, and is concerned with the secretion of various hormones—called also posterior pituitary gland; compare adenohypophysis.
The posterior pituitary is often termed the neurohypophysis because the hormones of this part of the pituitary are released directly from the axonal endings of their source neurons into the circulation (Figure 2.1).
Oxytocin produces powerful contractions of the pregnant uterus and causes milk to flow from lactating breasts. Stimulation of the nipples of the breast by a nursing infant triggers the release of this hormone. Also called posterior pituitary gland. Compare adenohypophysis.
Structurally, the pituitary gland consists of two lobes: anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). The anterior lobe produces six hormones (GH, prolactin, TSH, ACTH, FSH and LH).
