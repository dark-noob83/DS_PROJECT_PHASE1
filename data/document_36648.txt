Since the Earth and Jupiter are both revolving around the sun, the distance between them is always changing. The average distance between the Earth and Jupiter is 483 million miles. If you could travel at the speed of light, it would only take you 43 minutes to get to Jupiter. 
About a second. The circumference of Earth is about 40,075 km. Light travels at about 299,792 km/s. So to find how long it takes to go around 7.5 times, we multiply the circumference of the Earth by 7.5. Then take that answer and divide it by the speed of light, which equals 1.0026 seconds.
Report Abuse. Since it takes about 8 minutes for light to reach the Earth from the Sun, that distance is the radius. Therefore the diameter of the Earth's orbit would be twice that, thus it would take about 16 minutes for light to travel the distance. cyswxman · 8 years ago. Thumbs up. With a few calculations, I got a time of 997.186 seconds = 16 minutes, 37.186 seconds. That's the time for light to travel from where the Earth is now, to where it will be in half a year from now.
Sunlight travels at the speed of light. Photons emitted from the surface of the Sun need to travel across the vacuum of space to reach our eyes. The short answer is that it takes sunlight an average of 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. If the Sun suddenly disappeared from the Universe (not that this could actually happen, don't panic), it would take a little more than 8 minutes before you realized it was time to put on a sweater. 
But, if you want to know how long it takes to travel an equivalent distance to the circumference of the earth, simply divide 25,000 miles (the circumference of the earth) by the speed of light (in miles per sec) as given by the previous respondent. apolitical · 10 years ago. Thumbs up. 3. 
He concluded that light took ten to eleven minutes to travel from the sun to Earth, an overestimate since it in fact takes 8 minutes and 19 seconds. But at last scientists had a number to work with — his calculation presented a speed of 125,000 miles per second (200,000 km/s). View full size image. The speed of light in a vacuum is 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second), and in theory nothing can travel faster than light. In miles per hour, light speed is, well, a lot: about 670,616,629 mph. If you could travel at the speed of light, you could go around the Earth 7.5 times in one second
The speed of light. Light travels at approximately 186,282 miles per second (299,792 km per second). Therefore, a light shining from the surface of Mars would take the following amount of time to reach Earth (or vice versa): 1  Closest approach: 182 seconds, or just over 3 minutes. 2  Farthest approach: 1,342 seconds, or just over 22 minutes
We orbit the Sun at a distance of about 150 million km. Light moves at 300,000 kilometers/second. Divide these and you get 500 seconds, or 8 minutes and 20 seconds. This is an average number. Remember, the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, ranging from 147 million to 152 million km.
