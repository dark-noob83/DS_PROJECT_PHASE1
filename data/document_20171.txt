for example the yellow emission from sodium is much brighter than the red emission from the same amount of lithium impurities or contaminants affect the test results sodium in particular is present in most compounds and will color the flame sometimes a blue glass is used to filter out the yellow of sodium the test cannot differentiate between all elements several metals produce the same flame color test the cleanliness of the loop by inserting it into a gas flame if a burst of color is produced the loop is not sufficiently clean the loop must be cleaned between tests the clean loop is dipped in either a powder or solution of an ionic metal salt
a side effect of these chemical reactions is a lot of heat the fact that the chemical reactions in a fire generate a lot of new heat is what sustains the fire many fuels burn in one step gasoline is a good example heat vaporizes gasoline and it all burns as a volatile gas flame color varies depending on what you re burning and how hot it is color variation within in a flame is caused by uneven temperature typically the hottest part of a flame the base glows blue and the cooler parts at the top glow orange or yellow
flame test introduction the flame test is used to visually determine the identity of an unknown metal or metalloid ion based on the characteristic color the salt turns the flame of a bunsen burner the heat of the flame excites the electrons of the metals ions causing them to emit visible light test the cleanliness of the loop by inserting it into a gas flame if a burst of color is produced the loop is not sufficiently clean the loop must be cleaned between tests the clean loop is dipped in either a powder or solution of an ionic metal salt
color and temperature of a flame are dependent on the type of fuel involved in the combustion as for example when a lighter is held to a candle the applied heat causes the fuel molecules in the candle wax to vaporize 
a flame is a chemical reaction between two or more chemicals that produces heat and light and other chemicals products of combustion for a constant flame to be maintained then there must be a method of renewing the supply of the two or more chemicals usually convection a typical example of a flame is a candle this is usually a rod of wax with a central wick the wick is ignited heat from the flame at the wick melts the wax the now liquid wax is absorbed by the wick and through capillary action the wax fuel is a fed to the flame the rod has a small potential on it and when the flame touches it a small current flows from the rod through the flame to ground this current is detected and uses to prove the flame a flame acts as a diode but i don t recall the direction of electron flow and that effect isn t used in this application
of course wood and gasoline don t spontaneously catch on fire just because they re surrounded by oxygen for the combustion reaction to happen you have to heat the fuel to its ignition temperature here s the sequence of events in a typical wood fire something heats the wood to a very high temperature flame color varies depending on what you re burning and how hot it is color variation within in a flame is caused by uneven temperature typically the hottest part of a flame the base glows blue and the cooler parts at the top glow orange or yellow
flame tests this page describes how to do a flame test for a range of metal ions and briefly describes how the flame colour arises flame tests are used to identify the presence of a relatively small number of metal ions in a compound not all metal ions give flame colours for group 1 compounds flame tests are usually by far the easiest way of identifying which metal you have got for other metals there are usually other easy methods which are more reliable but the flame test can give a useful hint as to where to look
a candle is a tool for slowly vaporizing and burning wax as they heat up the rising carbon atoms as well as atoms of other material emit light this heat produces light effect is called incandescence and it is the same kind of thing that creates light in a light bulb it is what causes the visible flame flame color varies depending on what you re burning and how hot it is color variation within in a flame is caused by uneven temperature typically the hottest part of a flame the base glows blue and the cooler parts at the top glow orange or yellow
the flame test the flame test is a qualitative test used in chemistry to help determine the identity or possible identity of a metal or metalloid ion found in an ionic compound if the compound is placed in the flame of a gas burner there may be a characteristic color given off that is visible to the naked eye safety always use good safety techniques wear chemical splash approved goggles wear a chemical apron practice the flame test under the supervision of a chemistry teacher test the loop by placing it into a gas burner flame if there is a burst of color then you did not clean it sufficiently if there is no distinct color then it is ready for use if you have more loops use a different loop for each test the clean loop is dipped in either a powder or solution of an ionic metal salt
