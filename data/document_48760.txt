Both the gastrocnemius and the soleus run the entire length of the lower leg, connecting behind the knee and at the heel. A third muscle, the plantaris muscle, extends two-to-four inches down from the knee and lies between the gastrocnemius and the soleus.
The soleus is also part of the skeletal-muscle pump, which is a collection of muscles that help the heart circulate blood. Veins within the muscles become compressed and decompressed as the muscles surrounding them contract and relax. This aids in venous return of blood to the heart.
Your soleus muscle makes up a large portion of the back of your lower leg, calves. It lies underneath the gastrocnemius, which is the muscle most people associate with the calves because its muscular shape is easier to see.
Search. Located in superficial posterior compartment of the leg Soleus is a powerfull lower limb muscle which along with gastronemius and plantaris forms the calf muscle or triceps surae. It runs from back of knee to the ankle and is multipennate.
Gastrocnemius. The gastrocnemius muscle is a muscle located on the back portion of the lower leg, being one of the two major muscles that make up the calf. The other major calf muscle, the soleus muscle, is a flat muscle that lies underneath the g
Soleus. The soleus is the plantar flexor muscle of the ankle. It is capable of exerting powerful forces onto the ankle joint. It is located on the back of the lower leg and originates at the posterior (rear) aspect of the fibular head and the medial border of the tibial shaft. The soleus muscle forms the Achilles tendon when it inserts into the gastrocnemius aponeurosis.
