Although sintering does occur in loose powders, it is greatly enhanced by compacting the powder, and most commercial sintering is done on compacts. Compacting is generally done at room temperature, and the resulting compact is subsequently sintered at elevated temperature without application of pressure. Making ceramic, plastic and metal objects by heating a powder. Sintering by laser is one of the additive fabrication methods used in rapid prototyping and manufacturing. See laser sintering and 3D printing.
Because the sintering temperature does not have to reach the melting point of the material, sintering is often chosen as the shaping process for materials with extremely high melting points such as tungsten and molybdenum. Sintering is part of the firing process used in the manufacture of pottery and other ceramic objects. These objects are made from substances such as glass, alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia, lime, beryllium oxide, and ferric oxide.
Examples of pressure-driven sintering are the compacting of snowfall to a glacier, or the forming of a hard snowball by pressing loose snow together. The word sinter comes from the Middle High German sinter, a cognate of English  cinder . Sintering is part of the firing process used in the manufacture of pottery and other ceramic objects. These objects are made from substances such as glass, alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia, lime, beryllium oxide, and ferric oxide.
An example of sintering can be observed when ice cubes in a glass of water adhere to each other, which is driven by the temperature difference between the water and the ice. Sintering is part of the firing process used in the manufacture of pottery and other ceramic objects. These objects are made from substances such as glass, alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia, lime, beryllium oxide, and ferric oxide.

What is sintering. T his is the fusing together under heat and pressure of metallic particles and in the case of brakes it blends various other elements to enhance friction properties and wear life.
It is a cheaper base to make and is cheaer to repair than a sintered base. The extruded base is the low maintenance base that will be best for a more inexperienced rider who is more likely to pick up knocks and gashes on the bottom of their board. A Sintered base will be found on more top end boards and boards for advanced riders. It is a more expensive base to make but the result is a base that will hold wax a lot better than cheaper bases and therefore be faster for longer.
Sintering is the process of compacting and forming a solid mass of material by heat and/or pressure without melting it to the point of liquefaction. Sintering happens naturally in mineral deposits or as a manufacturing process used with metals, ceramics, plastics, and other materials. Sintering is part of the firing process used in the manufacture of pottery and other ceramic objects. These objects are made from substances such as glass, alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia, lime, beryllium oxide, and ferric oxide.
