Cloning. In biology, the activity of cloning creates a copy of some biological entity such as a gene, a cell, or perhaps an entire organism. This article discusses the biological, historical, and moral aspects of cloning mammals
Cloning is the process of creating genetically identical copies of biological matter. This may include genes, cells, tissues or entire organisms. When we speak of cloning, we typically think of organism cloning, but there are actually three different types of cloning. Cloning techniques are laboratory processes used to produce offspring that are genetically identical to the donor parent. Clones of adult animals are created by a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer.
Cloning in biotechnology refers to processes used to create copies of DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cells (cell cloning), or organisms. The term also refers to the production of multiple copies of a product such as digital media or software. Cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for more than 50 thousand years. It is the reproduction method used by plants, fungi, and bacteria, and is also the way that clonal colonies reproduce themselves.
Cloning. A clone is a genetically identical copy of an organism, and it may be naturally occurring or created in the lab. Through the process of asexual reproduction, organisms such as bacteria (and some plants) create offspring that are genetically identical to the parent. Here we focus on reproductive cloning of organisms. Reproductive cloning is the process by which a whole organism is cloned. First, a cell is taken from the organism that is being cloned. The DNA from this donor cell is then transferred to an egg cell whose DNA has been removed. The egg cell is “activated” and begins dividing as if it was fertilized
In biology, cloning is the process of producing similar populations of genetically identical individuals that occurs in nature when organisms such as bacteria, insects or plants reproduce asexually. Cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for more than 50 thousand years. It is the reproduction method used by plants, fungi, and bacteria, and is also the way that clonal colonies reproduce themselves.
1 Organism cloning involves making an identical copy of an entire organism. 2  This type of cloning is also called reproductive cloning. 3  Therapeutic Cloning. 4  Therapeutic cloning involves the cloning of human embryos for the production of stem cells. Cloning techniques are laboratory processes used to produce offspring that are genetically identical to the donor parent. Clones of adult animals are created by a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer.
Cloning. Definition. noun. The process of creating an exact copy of a biological unit (e.g. a DNA sequence, cell, or organism) from which it was derived, especially by way of biotechnological methods. Supplement. Cloning can be natural or artificial. Examples of cloning that occur naturally are as follows: 1 cellular cloning, where single-celled organisms with the exact genetic content of the original cell are produced in cell cultures.
The word clone has several different meanings in biology. As a noun, a clone is an identical genetic copy of either a piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a cell, or a whole organism. Identical twins are clones, as are two daughter cells produced by mitosis. Cloning DNA. DNA cloning is usually performed for one of two reasons: either to produce a lot of identical DNA for further study, or to use the DNA in an intact organism to produce useful proteins.
