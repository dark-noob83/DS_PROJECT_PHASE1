Next. The heat of combustion of liquid toluene (C7H8) is -3910.3 kJ/mol at 1 atm and 298 K. 1) What is the energy of combustion at 1 atm and 298 K? 2) What is the heat of formation of toluene? How do I do this? The heat of combustion of liquid toluene (C7H8) is -3910.3 kJ/mol at 1 atm and 298 K. What is the energy...?
The standard enthalpy of combustion of toluene is - 3910 kJ/mol. this is the value for the substance quoted in data tables which are nothing to do with this question. The /mol refer to toluene. This is the amount of heat you could expect to be released when 1 mole of toluene is burned in oxygen. It is nothing to do with the calorimeter. The heat released by the (1.55/92.134) mole of toluene will be 65.779 kJ. In your calculation 1.55g = 142.81g is incorrect-I think you have mistaken 1.55 as a number of moles and multiplied it by the mass of 1 mol (1.55 x 92.134 = 142.81g.
Here it is verbatim: The combustion of toluene has a total energy of -3.91*10 to the third power kJ/mol. When 1.55g toluene (C7H8) undergoes combustion in a bomb calorimeter, temperature rises from 23.12 to 37.57 degrees celsius. Find the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter. It is nothing to do with the calorimeter. The heat released by the (1.55/92.134) mole of toluene will be 65.779 kJ. In your calculation 1.55g = 142.81g is incorrect-I think you have mistaken 1.55 as a number of moles and multiplied it by the mass of 1 mol (1.55 x 92.134 = 142.81g.
Thus, the heat of combustion of pentane is –782 kcal/mole, but that of its 2,2-dimethylpropane (neopentane) isomer is –777 kcal/mole. Differences such as this reflect subtle structural variations, including the greater bond energy of 1º-C–H versus 2º-C–H bonds and steric crowding of neighboring groups. 
The heat of combustion (δH c 0) is the energy released as heat when a compound undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions. The chemical reaction is typically a hydrocarbon reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, water and heat. 1 This is the same as the thermodynamic heat of combustion since the enthalpy change for the reaction assumes a common temperature of the compounds before and after combustion, in which case the water produced by combustion is liquid.
Discussion: We often compare the heat capacity of a calorimeter to that of a definite amount of water. The heat capacity of 75.2 J/K for the calorimeter is equivalent to the heat capacity of 1 mole (18 g) of water (18 g mol -1 *1 cal (g K) -1 *4.184 J cal -1 = 75.3 J (K mol) -1. 
The heat of combustion is the energy released as heat when a compound undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions. The chemical reaction is typically a hydrocarbon reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, water and heat. It may be expressed with the quantities: 1  energy/ mole of fuel (kJ/mol). The higher heating value takes into account the latent heat of vaporization of water in the combustion products, and is useful in calculating heating values for fuels where condensation of the reaction products is practical (e.g., in a gas-fired boiler used for space heat).
This is designated in the problem as delta E rxn. 1.55g toluene then undergoes combustion in the bomb calorimeter and temp rises 14.45 degrees Celsius. From these figures, I need to calculate the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter. I know that 1mol toluene = 92.134g and 1.55g = 142.81g. It is nothing to do with the calorimeter. The heat released by the (1.55/92.134) mole of toluene will be 65.779 kJ. In your calculation 1.55g = 142.81g is incorrect-I think you have mistaken 1.55 as a number of moles and multiplied it by the mass of 1 mol (1.55 x 92.134 = 142.81g.
