Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a painful condition of the elbow caused by overuse. Not surprisingly, playing tennis or other racquet sports can cause this condition. However, several other sports and activities can also put you at risk.
Tennis elbow pain is a symptom of tendon injury. Overuse or stress can cause microtears in the tendon. This usually occurs because of repetitive motions of the arm or wrist. The longer you use an injured tendon, the more damaged it becomes. The most common symptom of tennis elbow is pain on the outside of the elbow. Given enough rest, the tendon can mend on its own.
Tendinitis can occur in almost any area of the body where a tendon connects a bone to a muscle. The most common places are: 1  Base of the thumb. 2  Elbow. 3  Shoulder. 4  Hip. 5  Knee. 6  Achilles tendon.
Bursitis and tendinitis are both common conditions that cause swelling around muscles and bones. They occur most often in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, or ankle. A bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that acts as a cushion between a bone and other moving body parts such as muscles, tendons, or skin. Bursae are found throughout the body. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes swollen.
