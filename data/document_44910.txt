Answer: Carry nutrient-rich, oxygenated blood from thearteries and arterioles to the body cells. Delicate, microscipic. Thin walls allow passage of oxygen and nutrients out of the bloodstream and into cells.
Systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, through the arteries, to the capillaries in the tissues of the body. From the tissue capillaries, the deoxygenated blood returns through a system of veins to the right atrium of the heart.
All arteries carry oxygenated blood with the exception of the pulmonary artery from the right side of the heart to the lungs, which does not. Yes. Most arterial blood is oxyg … enated. There are two exceptions to that rule. One is the pulmonary artery which carries deoxygenated blood.
Capillaries, the smallest and most numerous of the blood vessels, form the connection between the vessels that carry blood away from the heart (arteries) and the vessels that return blood to the heart (veins). The primary function of capillaries is the exchange of materials between the blood and tissue cells.
Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. They’re tough on the outside but they contain a smooth interior layer of epithelial cells that allows blood to flow easily. Arteries also contain a strong, muscular middle layer that helps pump blood through the body. Capillaries connect the arteries to veins. The arteries deliver the oxygen-rich blood to the capillaries, where the actual exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs. The capillaries then deliver the waste-rich blood to the veins for transport back to the lungs and heart. Veins carry the blood back to
