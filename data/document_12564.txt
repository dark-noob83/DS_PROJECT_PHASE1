Discovery of Rutherfordium. Rutherfordium was the first transactinide or super-heavy element to be discovered. Rutherfordium may first have been synthesized in 1964 when a team of scientists at Dubna, Russia, led by Georgy Flerov, bombarded a plutonium target with neon ions. The researchers calculated that isotope 259 had been created.
Hafnium is a good absorber of neutrons and is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Hafnium is also used in vacuum tubes as a getter, a material that combines with and removes trace gases from vacuum tubes. Hafnium has been used as an alloying agent in iron, titanium, niobium and other metals.
The American group proposed for the new element the name Rutherfordium (symbol Rf), in honour of Ernest R. Rutherford, the New Zealand physicist.
Rutherfordium is a chemical element with symbol Rf and atomic number 104, named in honor of physicist Ernest Rutherford.
The American group also indicated that they were unable to reproduce the earlier Russian synthesis from1964. The American group proposed for the new element the name Rutherfordium (symbol Rf), in honour of Ernest R. Rutherford, the New Zealand physicist. Rutherfordium is now the preferred IUPAC name.
Rutherfordium was discovered by Workers at the Nuclear Institute at Dubna, and the University of California, Berkeley, USA. in 1964 at USSR, United States. Origin of name: the origin of the Amercian Chemical Society preferred name is Lord  Rutherford , the physicist and chemist from New Zealand..
