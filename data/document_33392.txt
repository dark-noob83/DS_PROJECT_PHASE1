after completing this tutorial you should be able to identify a term coefficient constant term and polynomial tell the difference between a monomial binomial and trinomial find the degree of a term and polynomial combine like terms add and subtract polynomials
degree of a term the degree of a single term is the sum of the exponents of any variables in the term start with the term now look at the term to find the degree of a term with more than one variable add the exponents of each of the variables the sum is the degree of the term
for the general form of a polynomial see problem 6 below 6 the degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of all the variables in that term in functions of a single variable such as x the degree of a term is simply
degree of a term the degree of a term is the greatest exponent of a term the highest exponent should have a non zero coefficient in a polynomial articulated as a sum or difference of terms which is commonly known as canonical form the sum of the powers of all variables in the term is the degree of the term
the degree of a term is the exponent of the term for example the term has a degree of 2 if the term has more than one variable it is the sum of the exponents for example has a degree of 6 4 2
2 add the degree of variables in each term just add up the degrees of the variables in each of the terms it does not matter that they are different variables remember that the degree of a variable without a written degree such as x or y is just one
