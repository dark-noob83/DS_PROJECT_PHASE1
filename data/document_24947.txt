Although potatoes lose moisture through respiration, low humidity is the main cause of shriveling in storage. Under good storage conditions, potatoes will keep for up to six months. Even when storing potatoes under the best conditions, they will lose some quality the longer they are stored.
1 Only perfect potatoes are suitable for long-term storage. 2  Place the potatoes in a cardboard box, paper bag or mesh bag to ensure good ventilation. 3  Store in a cool, humid and dark place (45-50° is the ideal temperature range). 4  Check on your potatoes regularly, and remove any that are soft, shriveled or sprouted.
Here's How: 1  Inspect all potatoes for soft spots, sprouts and mold. 2  Only perfect potatoes are suitable for long-term storage. 3  Place the potatoes in a cardboard box, paper bag or mesh bag to ensure good ventilation. 4  Store in a cool, humid and dark place (45-50° is the ideal temperature range).
The skins on mature potatoes will remain firmly attached to the tubers when rubbed. Before final storage cure potatoes at a temperature of 45-60 F (7-16) and high relative humidity (85 to 95 percent) for about two weeks. Final healing of minor cuts and bruises and thickening of the skin occurs during the curing process.
The tubers can last for six to eight months when stored in cool temperatures. When storing garden potatoes in temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, they will only last three or four months. The spuds will also shrivel and may sprout. Save a few of these for sowing in April or May.
In general, the optimum, long-term storage temperature for processing potatoes is approximately 45° F. For fresh market potatoes, a temperature of 40° F. is recommended. Seed potatoes may be stored at slightly lower temperatures (38° to 40° F.) for better weight loss and sprout control.
