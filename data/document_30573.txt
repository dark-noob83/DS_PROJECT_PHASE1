RE: fabricated steel per ton. I was an estimator for a northern-midwest steel fabricator 5 years ago. At that time, fabricated and delivered, pre-bid price per ton was $1200 to $1500 per ton for structural. $1500 to $2500 for miscellaneous steel.
Structural steel price per ton. 1), Comply with GB, ASTM,....ISO9000; 2), Exquisite surface; 3), Steady structure; 4), Low cost, high benefit. 5), Excellent design team. 6), Strict quality control. 7), Manufacture according to the international standard.
RE: Cost of structural steel. Currently the price for structural steel is approx $0.75/lb CND or $0.63/lb USD. Last year the prices were: $0.50/lb CND or $0.41/lb USD. The best bet is to call a supplier and get the price.
Specifications. structural steel price per ton. Allows are the pictures of construction process, production process, parts of building, certificate, our produce workshop and introduction of our design, production, package, loading and installment.
Metal Fabrication Costs. As a good rule of thumb the cost of metal fabrication is about three times the cost of the steel itself. One ton of steel costs about $400. To have this fabricated and one coat of primer applied it would cost approximately $1,200-$1,500 per ton of structural steel. If you are looking for other metals, or perhaps sheet metal fabrication of various designs, prices can go up as high as $2,500 per ton. The above figures are just a rough guide.
RE: fabricated steel per ton. in the Oklahoma area, structural steel costs between $3000 and $4000 per ton erected for a low rise building depending on the complexity of course.
