People with untreated classic PKU have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems. Mutations in the PAH gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition, such as variant PKU or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.
Phenylketonuria (pronounced fen-l-kee-toh-NOOR-ee-uh), often called PKU, is an inherited disorder that that can cause intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) if not treated. In PKU, the body can't process a portion of a protein called phenylalanine, which is in all foods containing protein.
Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. A genetic mutation causes phenylketonuria. In a person with PKU, this defective gene causes a lack of or deficiency of the enzyme that's needed to process an amino acid called phenylalanine. A dangerous buildup of phenylalanine can develop when a person with PKU eats foods that are high in protein, such as milk, cheese, nuts or meat.
Genetic mutation. PKU is caused by a genetic mutation (change to the DNA) in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. There are many different types of mutations that can affect the PAH gene, all of which result in the body not producing a functioning PAH enzyme.
The PAH gene produces an enzyme that breaks down the amino acid phenylalanine. Mutations in the PAH gene can cause phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder that can change cells in the brain. The faulty protein allows dangerously high levels of phenylalanine to accumulate in the brain, poisoning the cells. If a person with PKU consumes too much phenylalanine, the build-up can cause mental retardation.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic condition in which the body cannot break down the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein.
