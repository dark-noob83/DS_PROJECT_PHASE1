The Air Max 90 also included ribbed plastic panels and multiple lacing options to create the perfect fit. Color was another key ingredient. The shoe’s radiant shade of red, which later became known as “infrared,” highlighted the visible air. The hard-to-miss shade remains as synonymous with the Air Max 90 as its shape.
SHARES. [img via]. The Air Max 90 has become quite the icon since it’s debut in, er, 1990. It was the second running shoe created by architect-turned-trainer-designer (sure) Tinker Hatfield, displaying it’s air bags for all and sundry to see (a bit like the Le Blow gals on a night out).
Innovation isn’t always visible — but when it is, its impact can be immeasurable. In 1987, Nike introduced the Nike Air Max 1, the first shoe to put innovation on full display. Created as a cushioning system, Nike Air suddenly became a window of opportunity for self-expression, style, and crucially, pure performance.
The shoe’s visible air was quickly recognizable around the world. Much like Nike introduced the Air Max 1 with a memorable commercial, the Air Max 180 was supported by advertisements created with legendary cartoonists, special effects masters and movie directors.
It was trademarked by Nike as the Air sole.   Bill Bowerman was the inventor of the 1st sole which was created using his wife's waffle iron: hewas born in Portland, Oregon on February 19, 1911.
Crafted especially for women, the Air Max 95 Ultra strips down the original Air Max 95 with a seamless Hyperfuse upper and predominantly foam outsole with Air cushioning in only the heel. The result is a simplified, less bulky, and therefore more feminine take on the timeless running shoe.
The first Nike Air Max running shoe, the Air Max 1, was designed by Tinker Hatfield. 2 people found this useful. Edit. Share to: 1  5 Classic Sneaker Models That Never Go out of Style Sneakers have been around for a long time and have gone through many changes.
