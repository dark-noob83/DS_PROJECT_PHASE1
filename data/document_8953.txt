A simple varicella titer test can provide this information. This test may also be known as a chickenpox test, an immune to chickenpox test, or VZV. The varicella titer test (chickenpox) looks for the antibodies that indicate immunity as a result of clinical recovery or vaccination. This test requires a blood sample and typically sees results in 1-3 business days. The varicella IgG test is available by itself or as part of our Immunity Panel which also contains immunity tests for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, and rubella.

Immunity to a disease is achieved through the presence of antibodies to that disease in a person’s system. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body to neutralize or destroy toxins or disease-carrying organisms. Antibodies are disease-specific. Exposure to the disease organism can occur through infection with the actual disease (resulting in natural immunity), or introduction of a killed or weakened form of the disease organism through vaccination (vaccine-induced immunity).

Passive immunity is provided when a person is given antibodies to a disease rather than producing them through his or her own immune system. A newborn baby acquires passive immunity from its mother through the placenta. Exposure to the disease organism can occur through infection with the actual disease (resulting in natural immunity), or introduction of a killed or weakened form of the disease organism through vaccination (vaccine-induced immunity).
