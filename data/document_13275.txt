[view]. most productive region of the benthic zone is the area over the continental margin, which is unaffected by the tides. Many groups and varieties of animals live here, a few are worms, sea pens, crustaceans, stars, and protozoa. [view]. benthic zone also feed on detritus.
Benthos: Inhabitants of the Benthic Zone. The organisms that live in the benthic zone are collectively called benthos.. They include crustaceans, mollusks, worms, fish, and any other type of organism that makes its home on or in the seabed.
The Benthic Zone. The benthic zone begins at the edge of the sea at the intertidal zone, extends out along the continental shelf, and continues down the continental slope to the abyssal plain, thousands of meters below sea level.
Benthos in the intertidal zone include sea stars, barnacles, mussels, sea anemones, sea urchins, snails, and other creatures that attach themselves to the rocky substrate or burrow in the sand. Benthos in deeper zones include fish, crustaceans and tube worms.
There are four major oceanic zones where plants and animals live in the ocean. The four major zones are intertidal zone, neritic zone, open ocean zone and benthic zone. These zones contain the largest ecosystem on Earth.
The benthic zone is one of the ecological regions of a body of water. It comprises the bottom—such as the ocean floor or the bottom of a lake—the sediment surface, and some sub-surface layers. [view]. The benthic zone is the name given to the bottom of the sea or ocean, and sometmes also a lake bottom. It represents the interface of water and substrate. Organisms that live here are known as benthos or benthic organisms.
