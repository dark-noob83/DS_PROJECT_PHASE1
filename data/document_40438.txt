Environmental causes. You can redeem your Aeroplan Miles to offset your carbon footprint when you fly with Air Canada. Aeroplan will match the miles you redeem, plus an additional 20%, by transferring the total amount toward carbon offsets from Offsetters. 
Award Ticket Changes. Aeroplan classic one way awards require just 50% of the award miles instead of 67%. The good news is that one-way Classic Flight Rewards will only cost 50% of the miles that a roundtrip costs. Last year, it was 67%. Another positive change is that Aeroplan miles will no longer expire. As the changes to Air Canada’s Aeroplan Rewards program took effect earlier this year, I wanted to highlight some of the main award chart changes, so you can be aware of how many miles you will currently need for some specific award ticket redemptions going forward and some strategies for maximizing Aeroplan miles.

So you can redeem for the rewards you really want-right away, or whenever you're ready. 75,000 miles per ticket = 150,000 miles total, plus the taxes which came to $500 each x 2 = $1,000 total. The same flights at the times we want to go, would have easily cost $1800 -$2000 each. So overall I got anywhere from a $2500-$3000 value with my 150,000 aeroplan points.
You can then earn miles on a variety of purchases. For example, you can earn a mile or more for every dollar you spend buying groceries, gas or essentials at your local pharmacy (this feature applies on your first $80,000 in total annual account spending on your account, at these merchants or elsewhere). There, you can book travel, buy merchandise or transfer your miles. For as little as 15,000 miles, you can get airline tickets. The more miles you have, the farther you can go.
Basically they don't have enough Aeroplan miles for a booking, so I'm trying to see if they can use some of my miles to complete the redemption without having to pay this extortionate fee for me to transfer them to their account. Thanks. I would like to give my sister 100,000 aeroplan miles. Her husband keeps getting air-evacuated for heart treatments and she keeps having to drive 10 hr to go pick him up. Aeroplan charges $.02 per mile to transfer
You can also earn miles by shopping with participating vendors in the Aeroplan Miles program. When you re ready to redeem your rewards, you can visit the official Aeroplan Miles site. There, you can book travel, buy merchandise or transfer your miles. For as little as 15,000 miles, you can get airline tickets. The more miles you have, the farther you can go.
Not only do you earn Aeroplan Miles when booking Air Canada flights, you also earn when you are high in the sky. On most flights you can earn anywhere between 25% of miles flown on flights within Canada and the Continental U.S.A all the way up to 150% of miles flown to other worldwide destinations. When we directly divide the market purchase price of the cologne by the number of Aeroplan Miles, we get 0.69 cents per mile (CPM). $80 Retail / 11,500 Miles = $0.0069 or 0.69 CPM. According to our benchmark figure, this is absolute merda.
Warning: Before banking on using your Aeroplan Miles for an upgrade, make sure that there is an upgrade available. By reading the fine print, you can get a mini global vacation using just 125,000 miles for Business class or 175,000 miles for First.
