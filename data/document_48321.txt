Within the bone marrow, all blood cells originate from a single type of unspecialized cell called a stem cell. When a stem cell divides, it first becomes an immature red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet-producing cell.

Lymphopoiesis is specifically the formation of Lymphoid cells (types of white blood cells). Myelopoiesis is specifically the formation of myelocytes (immature form
This short life span necessitates the process erythropoiesis, which is the formation of red blood cells. All blood cells are formed in the bone marrow. This is the erythrocyte factory, which is soft, highly cellar tissue that fills the internal cavities of bones.

Blood cell formation is the process in which stem cells differentiate into the red or white blood cells. The primary organ for blood cell formation is the bone marrow.

When the oxygen content of body tissues is low or the number of red blood cells decreases, the kidneys produce and release erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The bone marrow produces and releases more white blood cells in response to infections.
