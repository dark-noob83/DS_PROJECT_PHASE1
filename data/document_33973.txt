The cost to change a flight depends greatly on the airline that you have purchased your ticket from. Airlines have “penalty fees” that can range from $0 to $400.00 (yowza!) to make a change to your ticket. For domestic flights, most airlines charge around $200. But the penalty is not the whole story. At the time you make the change, the great $250 fare is gone and flights on the new dates are selling for $375. To switch to that flight, Delta would charge a $200 change fee, plus another $125 for the fare difference ($375 minus $250). So the change you want to make would cost $325 total.

When the credit is used to pay for new flights, the change fee will be assessed. For example, say you bought non-refundable Delta domestic flight tickets for $650, but your plans changed. When you are ready to purchase new flights, the fare has increased to $700. Your credit is $650 – $200 change fee = $450, so your out-of-pocket cost to buy the new ticket is $700 – $450 = $250. Make sure to inform Delta before departure that you will not be on the flight and request the travel credit.
