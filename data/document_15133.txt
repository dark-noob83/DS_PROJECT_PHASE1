Nickel silver first became popular as a base metal for silver-plated cutlery and other silverware, notably the electroplated wares called EPNS (electro-plated nickel silver). Nickel silver is named for its silvery appearance, but it contains no elemental silver unless plated. The name German silver refers to its development by 19th-century German metalworkers in imitation of the Chinese alloy known as paktong (cupronickel).
Making the world better, one answer at a time. EPNS stands for Electro Plated Nickel Silver. Nickel Silver (sometimes stainless steel) is the base metal onto which silver is plated. Despite its name, nickel silver contains no silver at all, but is an alloy of nickel, zinc & copper. A layer of pure silver is deposited electrolytically on the base metal to give a silver finish. EPNS A1 is the highest grade of silver plating that the manufacturer provides. EPNS = Electroplated Nickel Silver A1 = the thickness of the silver plating which is usually … 30 - 35 Microns. Highest Grade of Silver plating. The higher the grade, the longer the cutlery will last.

Nickel silver, Mailechort, German silver, Argentan, new silver, nickel brass, albata, alpacca, or electrum is a copper alloy with nickel and often zinc. The usual formulation is 60% copper, 20% nickel and 20% zinc. Nickel silver is named for its silvery appearance, but it contains no elemental silver unless plated. The name German silver refers to its development by 19th-century German metalworkers in imitation of the Chinese alloy known as paktong (cupronickel).

Old Sheffield Plate had the silver deposited on copper. EPNS, as the others have said, has the silver deposited on a layer of nickel. So to say that EPNS 'contains no silver' is not correct. ChuckFickens. in EPNS the bass metal is Nickel Silver which is then electroplated with Silver. This I know stands for electro plated nickel silver and I know that it contains no silver whilst silver plated items are coated with a thin layer of actual silver. Depending on the thickness of this coating depends the quality or put another way the thicker the coating the better the quality.

The most common is EPNS (Electro Plated Nickel Silver) but many other symbols are used: 1  EPBM (Electro Plated Britannia Metal). 2  EPCA (Electro Plated Copper Alloy). 3  ESM (Electro Plated Silver Mounts). 4  PGS (Plated German Silver). 5  EPGS (Electro Plated German Silver). 6  BP (Britannia Plate). 7  MP (Magnetic/Magneto Plating).
EPNS = Electroplated Nickel Silver. A1 = the thickness of the silver plating which is usually 30 - 35 Microns. Highest Grade of Silver plating. The higher the grade, the longer the cutlery will last. 35 Microns of EPNS will last approximately 40years, but this depends on usage, storage and care.
