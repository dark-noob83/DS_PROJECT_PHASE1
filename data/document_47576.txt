1997 Balanced Budget and Taxpayer Relief Act. SUMMARY: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (a spending bill) and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (a tax bill) legislated the elimination of the annual budget deficit by 2002. In the end, tax revenues were increasing at such a rate that the federal budget went into surplus several years ahead of schedule in FY 1998 and continued in surplus in 1999, 2000, and 2001. FURTHER INFORMATION: Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. Law No.: 105-33).
Balanced-budget provisions have been added to the constitutions of most U.S. states, the Basic Law of Germany, the Hong Kong Basic Law, Spain, Italy and the Swiss Constitution. It is often proposed that a balanced-budget rule be added to the national United States Constitution. After years of rising deficits and debt in the 1990s, Switzerland's citizens adopted the debt brake as a constitutional amendment in 2001. The rule was implemented starting in 2003. It states that each year, the budget must be in balance, adjusted for economic conditions.
Now for the bad news for GOP partisans. The federal budget has not been balanced by any Republican spending reductions. Uncle Sam now spends $150 billion more than in 1995. Over the past 10 years, the defense budget, adjusted for inflation, has been cut $100 billion, but domestic spending has risen by $300 billion. We have a balanced budget today that is mostly a result of 1) an exceptionally strong economy that is creating gobs of new tax revenues and 2) a shrinking military budget. Part of the explanation for the balanced budget is that Republicans in Congress had the common sense to reject the most reckless features of Clintonomics. Just this year, Bill Clinton’s budget proposed more than $100 billion in new social spending — proposals that were mostly tossed overboard.
Signed into law by President Clinton on August 5, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (H.R. 2015) was heralded for its bipartisan commitment to balance the federal budget by the year 2002.

No state is required to provide a mental health benefit in the new childrens health insurance program.

1 Spending was reduced more than the increase in the debt limit. 2  No tax increases or other forms of increases in revenue above current law were included in the bill. 3  The bill directly specified $917 billion of cuts over 10 years in exchange for the initial debt limit increase of $900 billion. The Budget Control Act immediately raised the debt limit to 14.694 trillion. In October 2011, the president requested the $500 billion increase, to 15.194 trillion.
