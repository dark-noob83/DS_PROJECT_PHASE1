The most common causes of hand or finger cramps or spasms are muscle spasm, diabetes, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Other possible causes, such as multiple sclerosis, are more rare.
The inflammation in joints causes spasms in the muscles adjacent to the joints, which is probably why people have hand cramps, explained Richard Brasington, MD, a rheumatologist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University in St. Louis. Plus, any dysfunction in joints is going to affect the adjacent muscles.
Cramps or spasms in the muscles often have no clear cause. Possible causes of hand or foot spasms include: 1  Abnormal levels of electrolytes or minerals in the body. 2  Brain disorders, such as Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, dystonia, and Huntington disease. 3  Chronic kidney disease and dialysis.
Cramps in your hand can arise from a number of different causes. Hand cramps develop as a result of conditions affecting muscles and nerves in your hand. Trauma or injury to a nerve in your hand can also cause hand cramps. Even breathing too fast (hyperventilation) can result in hand cramps, as carbon dioxide levels in the blood become too low. Everyday, simple reasons, such as fatigue from overuse, can lead to temporary, acute cramps in the hand.

A: What you describe sounds like carpal spasm. Spasms, or cramps, are involuntary muscle contractions. The most common causes of spasms are overused muscles (in the hands that might be due to writing or typing) and dehydration. Other causes of muscle cramping include low levels of calcium and magnesium.
