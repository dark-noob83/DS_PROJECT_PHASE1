It turns out that, for the proton Earth and electron Moon in Noah's scenario, the planetary model is even more wrong than usual. ). If you put two electrons together, they try to fly apart. Electrons are positively charged, and the force of repulsion from this charge is about 20 orders of magnitude stronger than the force of gravity pulling them together. If you put 10 52 electrons together—to build a Moon—they push each other apart really hard.
