There are two tests for elevated C-reactive protein. One can show a non-specific elevation of CRP that occurs with general inflammatory changes in the body; the other test is hs-CRP-highly sensitive CRP-which is a measure of inflammation in blood vessels.
Best Answer: Well its not a very specific test. Raised inflammatory markers basically just means that you have inflammation or infection somewhere in your body. It goes up with a lot of different problems-a bacterial infection or arthritis or possibly heart problems etc etc.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a substance produced by the liver that increases in the presence of inflammation in the body. An elevated C-reactive protein level is identified with blood tests and is considered a non-specific marker for disease.
You should—because this simple blood test might just save your life. C-reactive protein, or CRP, has long been used as a marker of inflammation in the body. 1 High CRP levels are found in practically every known inflammatory state.
Because inflammation levels can be quite high in people with autoimmune diseases, the hs-CRP test simply isn't useful for assessing their cardiovascular risk. But the inflammation that underlies rheumatoid arthritis does appear to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: High levels of CRP in the blood mean that there is inflammation somewhere in the body. Other tests are needed to determine the cause and location of the inflammation. CRP is the only inflammatory marker that has been found to be an indicator of heart health.
Currently there is no definitive test for inflammation — the best that conventional medicine can do is measure blood levels of C-reactive protein (a pro-inflammatory marker) and the irritating amino acid called homocysteine. I use the high-sensitivity CRP test now available at most labs.
