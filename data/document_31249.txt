How to construct a line parallel to a given line that passes through a given point with compass and straightedge or ruler. It is called the 'translated triangle method' because it works by translating a triangle along one of its sides. The third vertex traces out a line parallel to that side. A Euclidean construction.
How to construct (draw) the incircle of a triangle with compass and straightedge or ruler. The three angle bisectors of any triangle always pass through its incenter. In this construction, we only use two, as this is sufficient to define the point where they intersect.
To draw a shape, line or angle accurately using a compass and straightedge (ruler). Sometimes you are also allowed to use a protractor and triangle.
Constructions. Geometric Constructions ... Animated! Construction in Geometry means to draw shapes, angles or lines accurately. These constructions use only compass, straightedge (i.e. ruler) and a pencil.
This construction shows how to draw the perpendicular bisector of a given line segment with compass and straightedge or ruler. This both bisects the segment (divides it into two equal parts), and is perpendicular to it. Finds the midpoint of a line segmrnt.

This page shows how to construct (draw) the incenter of a triangle with compass and straightedge or ruler. The incenter of a triangle is the point where all three angle bisectors always intersect, and is the center of the triangle's incircle. A Euclidean construction.
