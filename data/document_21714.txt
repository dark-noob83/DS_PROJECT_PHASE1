Farina is a milled cereal grain, usually made from wheat germ and the inner parts of wheat kernels called the endosperm. Sometimes, rice or potatoes can be milled and given this name too, but typically it’s considered wheat cereal.
Farina is a cereal food, frequently described as mild-tasting, usually served warm, made from cereal grains (usually semolina). In contemporary American English use, it is usually referred to as Cream of Wheat or Malt-O-Meal, which are brands of farina as stated on their packaging.
Farina is made from the germ and endosperm of the grain, which is milled to a fine granular consistency and then sifted. Because the bran and most of the germ are removed, this cereal is sometimes enriched with Vitamin B and iron.
It is also known as farina and is made from the coarsely ground whole-wheat kernel, removing the bran, leaving the inner core and some of the wheat germ. Served with nonfat milk, Cream of Wheat is a healthy breakfast for all ages.
Cream of Wheat® cereal is based on Farina, though it is not quite the same thing. The farina used for Cream of Wheat is ground a little finer than farina generally is, and a small proportion of other ingredients is also added to the Cream of Wheat cereal. The two, however, can be substituted for each other.
