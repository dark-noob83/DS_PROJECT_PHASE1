An equiangular triangle is a kind of acute triangle, and is always equilateral. In a right triangle, one of the angles is a right angle—an angle of 90 degrees. A right triangle may be isosceles or scalene. In an obtuse triangle, one angle is greater than a right angle—it is more than
A Right triangle contains a 90 degree angle. This can be any of the three angles that make up the triangle. An Acute triangle has an angle that is greater than 0 degrees and less than 90 degrees. An Obtuse triangle is an triangle that contains an angle that is greater than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees.
Place the protractor on the line and select a point that is less than 90 degrees from the first line. Mark the point on the paper and draw a line at the angle you have chosen. Use a ruler to ensure a straight line. Draw a third line to connect the two lines, creating a triangle. Use a ruler to make the line straight.
In any triangle, two of the interior angles are always acute (less than 90 degrees) , so there are three possibilities for the third angle: 1  Less than 90° - all three angles are acute and so the triangle is acute. 2  Exactly 90° - it is a right triangle. 3  Greater than 90° (obtuse): the triangle is an obtuse triangle.
How to Construct an Acute Triangle. To construct an acute triangle, simple first construct an angle that is less than 90 degrees and greater than 0 degrees. This will create two sides of your triangle. Then cnstruct a third line intersecting your first two, and you have an acute triangle. That's it!
Acute Triangles. An acute triangle is a triangle whose angles are all acute (i.e. less than 90 °). In the acute triangle shown below, a, b and c are all acute angles. An equilateral triangle is always an acute triangle since all its angles are 60° which are
