The Plasma (Cytoplasmic) Membrane. Like the prokaryotic plasma membrane, the eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer containing proteins. Eukaryotic plasma membranes contain carbohydrates attached to the proteins and sterols not found in prokaryotic cells (except Mycoplasma bacteria).
Only prokaryotes are having cell wall. Cell wall is absent in case of eukaryotes, it is surrounded only by cell membrane. Peptidoglycan cell wall is present as thick layer in â€¦ gram positive bacteria and it is present as a thin layer in gram negative.
Answer by Stevekim012. Confidence votes 16.0K. Actually, cell walls are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In plants (eukaryotic) the cell walls are composed of cellulose whereas in prokaryotes, the cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan.
Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not. Differences in cellular structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes include the presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the cell wall, and the structure of chromosomal DNA.
For example, the prokaryotic cell has a cell wall, and this animal cell does not. However, many kinds of eukaryotic cells do have cell walls. Despite all of these similarities, the differences are also clear.
1 The cell walls of prokaryotes are generally formed of a different molecule (peptidoglycan) to those of eukaryotes (many eukaryotes do not have a cell wall at all). 2  Prokaryotes are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells.
