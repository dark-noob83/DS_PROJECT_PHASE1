1. An organism, cell, virus, or gene resulting from genetic mutation. 2. Slang One that is suggestive of a genetic mutant, as in bizarre appearance or inaptitude. adj. 1. Resulting from genetic mutation: a mutant strain of bacteria.
noun The normal condition of a whole organism (wild-type strain) or a particular mutation at a locus or site, which is indicated by a plus sign. The allele of a particular gene that confers the phenotype considered to be the normal type commonly found in natural populations.
The allele that encodes the phenotype most common in a particular natural population is known as the wild type allele. It is often designated, in genetic shorthand, as +. Any form of that allele other than the wild type is known as a mutant form of that allele. Here are a few examples... Wild type penguins wear tuxedos. Albino mutants look nekkid. Wild type tigers have orange fur and black stripes. One mutation prevents the deposition of the orange/brown pigment, and the result is a white tiger that still has dark stripes.
Loss of function mutations are typically recessive. When a heterozygote consists of the wild-type allele and the loss-of-function allele, the level of expression of the wild type allele is often sufficient to produce the wild type phenotype. Genetically this would define the loss-of-function mutation as
(Organisms selected as reference strains are called wild type, and their progeny with mutations are called mutants). Changes in the sequence of template DNA (mutations) can drastically affect the type of protein end product produced [4,7].
