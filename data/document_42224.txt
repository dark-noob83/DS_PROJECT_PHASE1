Raw Materials. Most modern chalkboards are made of porcelain enamel. In this particular manufacturing process, a tough and durable material such as steel is used as the base. There are several thicknesses of steel used in the manufacture of chalkboards, but the most common is 22-gauge.
Although traditionally composed of natural chalk, modern blackboard chalk is generally made from the mineral gypsum (calcium sulfate), often supplied in sticks of compressed powder about 10 cm (4 in) long. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. The most common forms are CaCO 3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing.
Base. A base, usually composed of steel, forms the interior of the chalkboard. This steel is checked thoroughly for defects and flaws that might impact the writing surface, and then is washed clean in a chemical bath. Surface. A writing surface made of porcelain clay and glass glaze is applied to the steel. Workers coat one side of the steel with a porcelain slip, which is just a loose clay mixture. The porcelain-coated steel is then fired in a high-temperature chamber. The slip and the steel fuse together from the high heat.
Background. The chalkboard is a flat, vertical writing surface on which anything can be inscribed by means of a piece of chalk. The device is generally used for educational purposes, but it can also be found in the workplace, the home, and restaurants. While chalkboards can be manufactured from a variety of materials, porcelain enamel is the most common material used in today's chalkboard. Most modern chalkboards are made of porcelain enamel. In this particular manufacturing process, a tough and durable material such as steel is used as the base.

(April 2008). A quadruple blackboard at the Helsinki University of Technology. A blackboard (UK English) or chalkboard (US English; also blackboard) is a reusable writing surface on which text or drawings are made with sticks of calcium sulfate or calcium carbonate, known, when used for this purpose, as chalk. Sticks of processed chalk are produced especially for use with blackboards in white and also in various colours. These are often made not from chalk rock but from calcium sulfate in its dihydrate form, CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O (gypsum). Chalk sticks containing calcium carbonate typically contain 40-60% of CaCO 3 (calcite).
They weren't referred to as chalkboards until the late 1930s. Sticks of chalk are actually sticks of calcium sulphate or gypsum. One of the manufacturer's recommendations is that you completely cover the chalkboard using the side of a stick of chalk and brush it back off before using it the first time. This evidently prepares the chalkboard making it easier to erase. What is a Chalkboard Made Of A chalkboard can be made of many different things. To begin with, a chalk board can be made of black or grey stone slate. However, these are very basic chalkboards that are not really used
Chalk /ˈtʃɔːk/ is a soft, white, porous sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is calcium carbonate or CaCO 3. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. The most common forms are CaCO 3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing.

Slate had the double advantage of being easily split into fine sheets, and having a surface just rough enough for chalk to adhere to.
