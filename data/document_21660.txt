Banister Lighting. Banister lighting turns your staircase into a focal design element of your space. Small recessed lights installed on the underside of your rail in between each provide ample illumination for the walking area without cluttering the walls, ceiling or stairs with fixtures.
Here are a few examples of stairway lighting for modern and contemporary interiors. View in gallery. One option would be to have some lights built into the wall adjacent to the staircase. Depending on the size of your staircase, 3 or 4 lights should be enough. In this case, the rectangular shape of the lights matches the design of the staircase and integrates seamlessly into the whole decor. d√©cor
Recessed lights are a less intrusive and less direct way to illuminate the stairs in your home. Recessed lights reside in the wall along each stair. Thus instead of extending light from the top of each stair and downwards, the recessed lighting emits a soft glow from one end of each stair extending to the other.
If hall or foyer fixtures do not illuminate the entire stairway, install a fixture near the top step of the stairs. Hall and staircase lighting can be done with ceiling fixtures, wall fixtures, or recessed fixtures, however you may want to avoid using wall fixtures in narrow hallways.
Cut light openings into the stair risers or wall mount the lights. Place lights about every two steps and cut them in the center of each stair riser. Wall lights work well if you have a wall on both sides of the staircase. Wall lights should also be centered. Drill 1/4 inch pilot holes into the riser or wall.
