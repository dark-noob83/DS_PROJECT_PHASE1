Increases in the temperature of a system results from increases in the kinetic energy of the system. This has several effects on the rates of reactions. 1) More energetic collisions. When molecules collide, the kinetic energy of the molecules can be converted into chemical potential energy of the molecules. If the chemical potential energy of the molecules become great enough, the activation energy of a exergonic reaction can be achieved and a change in chemical state will result. As the temperature of a system is increased it is possible that more molecules per unit time will reach the activation energy. Thus the rate of the reaction may increase. 2) The number of collisions per unit time will increase.
Temperature. As the temperature rises, reacting molecules have more and more kinetic energy. This increases the chances of a successful collision and so the rate increases. There is a certain temperature at which an enzyme's catalytic activity is at its greatest (see graph). This optimal temperature is usually around human body temperature (37.5 o C) for the enzymes in human cells. (See graph) Provided that the substrate concentration is high and that temperature and pH are kept constant, the rate of reaction is proportional to the enzyme concentration. (See graph) Inhibition of enzyme activity Some substances reduce or even stop the catalytic activity of enzymes in biochemical reactions.
Effect of temperature on enzyme activity. The temperture of a system is to some extent a measure of the kinetic energy of the molecules in the system. Thus the lower the kinetic energy, the lower the temperature of the system and, likewise, the higher the kinetic energy, the greater the temperature of the system. As the temperature of a system is increased it is possible that more molecules per unit time will reach the activation energy. Thus the rate of the reaction may increase. 2) The number of collisions per unit time will increase.

Temperature Effects. Like most chemical reactions, the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases as the temperature is raised. A ten degree Centigrade rise in temperature will increase the activity of most enzymes by 50 to 100%. Variations in reaction temperature as small as 1 or 2 degrees may introduce changes of 10 to 20% in the results.
Temperature And Enzyme Activity: Increasing temperature means the molecules gain more kinetic energy and move faster resulting in more chances of successful collisions of en … zymes and substrates forming enzyme-substrate molecules. As the enzyme concentration increases the rate of enzyme activity increases up to a level where it becomes constant. This is because the more the enzymes are available, the m … ore substrates are broken in less time.
Increasing temperature increases the rate of enzyme activity up to a point when it become too hot, when the enzyme is denatured and so activity stops. Increasing temperature increases the rate because the substrate has more kinetic energy, so is more likely to collide with the enzyme for the reaction to take place. Too much heat causes the bonds which hold the enzyme in its very specific shape to break, meaning it can no longer function (is denatured). As the enzyme concentration increases the rate of enzyme activity increases up to a level where it becomes constant. This is because the more the enzymes are available, the m … ore substrates are broken in less time.
Best Answer: An increase in temperature results in more kinetic energy of the enzyme and the substrate. More kinetic energy results in more collisions between the enzyme and the substrate. In turn, the number of successful collisions increases and more enzyme-substrate complexes form. Therefore an increase in temperature increases the rate at which enzyme substrate complexes form. However, all enzymes have an optimum temperature at which it will work best and favour the activity. Eg. pepsin, an enzyme which works in the stomach has an optimum temperature of between 30-40oC, which is around the human body temperature. So, the rate of enzyme activity decreases once temperature is above its optimum temperature. There is a general rule that every 10oC increase makes the rate double, until the optimum temperature of course. This is called the Q10 effect.
Thus the greater the kinetic energy of the molecules in a system, the greater is the resulting chemical potential energy when two molecules collide. As the temperature of a system is increased it is possible that more molecules per unit time will reach the activation energy. Thus the rate of the reaction may increase. 2) The number of collisions per unit time will increase.
Temperature vs. Enzyme Reactivity. Collisions between all molecules increase as temperature increases. This is due to the increase in velocity and kinetic energy that follows temperature increases. With faster velocities, there will be less time between collisions.
