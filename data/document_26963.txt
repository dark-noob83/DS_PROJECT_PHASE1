Under the assets test, the pension is reduced by $3 a fortnight for every $1,000 of assets over specified limits, which vary between single people and couples, and home-owners and non-home-owners. For home-owners, the value of the family home is excluded from the calculation of assets.
When assessing income under the income test, the total value of all financial assets was added together. A rate of return of five per cent was deemed to have been received on the first $30 000 ($50 000 for a couple) worth of assets and a rate of seven per cent was deemed for asset holdings above these levels.
An income test assesses income from employment, business income and income from assets, reducing a personâ€™s payment by 50 cents for every dollar above the income test free area (currently $4,056 per year for singles and $7,176 per year for couples combined).
The age pension is currently payable to men at age 65 years and women at age 61 years. Traditionally, women became eligible for the age pension at 60, but the pensionable age for women is being slowly increased to 65 over the next 16 years.
The initial national Age Pension in 1909 was equivalent to $1 per week (21.6% of average wage) for both single and married persons. There was a means test for full pension based on assets and property value including own home of $620 (2.6 times average annual wage) and income of $104 pa (43% of average annual wage). HOW PENSIONS ARE PAID Age pensions are paid fortnightly from money collected in taxes by the federal government.
The means test was replaced by an income test in 1976. In 1978 the rate of the free-of-income-test age pension for those aged 70 years and over was frozen. In 1983 this frozen rate became subject to a special income test which will eventually be overtaken by the normal income test.
