ras protein. n. A protein that typically promotes cell division when a growth factor is present on the cell surface. Abnormal ras proteins, caused by genetic mutations, stimulate cell division and proliferation in the absence of a growth factor and facilitate the development of various cancers. 1  Facebook.
The ras protein belongs to a large super-family of proteins known as low-molecular weight G-proteins. These proteins are called G-proteins because they bind guanine nucleotides (GTP and GDP).
Ras is the prototypical member of the Ras superfamily of proteins, which are all related in 3D structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours. When Ras is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival. As a result, mutations in ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins.
The Ras protein is a monomeric globular protein of 189 amino acids (21 kDa molecular mass) which is associated with the plasma membrane and which binds either GDP or GTP. Ras acts as a molecular switch. When Ras contains bound GDP it is in the resting or off position and is inactive.
Ras is a family of related proteins which is ubiquitously expressed in all cell lineages and organs.
