Yet another type of immunotherapy uses proteins that normally help regulate, or modulate, immune system activity to enhance the bodyâ€™s immune response against cancer. These proteins include cytokines and certain growth factors. Two types of cytokines are used to treat patients with cancer: interleukins and interferons. 
Proteins are also part of antibodies, interferon and complement proteins that support immune system cells or attack viruses, bacteria or other foreign substances in your body. Every adult should consume at minimum the recommended dietary allowance for protein, which is 71 grams per day for pregnant and lactating women, 46 grams for other women and 56 grams for men, according to the Institute of Medicine. Athletes often need extra protein.
Of all the immune system proteins, IgG antibodies are the best known in the general population. These are antibodies that circulate in your bloodstream and provide the bulk of your defense against invading bacteria and viruses. They do this in more than one way, explains physiologist Lauralee Sherwood, Ph.D. These are proteins that your cells make and express onto their cell surface. They allow your immune system to monitor what's going on inside the cell and provide an early detection system in case of an invasion by a pathogen.
The HLA gene family provides instructions for making a group of related proteins known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. HLA is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species.
Antigens are substances (usually proteins) on the surface of cells, viruses, fungi, or bacteria. Nonliving substances such as toxins, chemicals, drugs, and foreign particles (such as a splinter) can also be antigens. The immune system recognizes and destroys substances that contain antigens. Your body's cells have. that are antigens. These include a group of antigens called. Your immune system learns to see these antigens as normal and usually does not react against them. 1  proteins. 1 B lymphocytes become cells that produce antibodies. 2  Antibodies attach to a specific antigen and make it easier for the immune cells to destroy the antigen. 3  T lymphocytes attack antigens directly and help control the immune response.
The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections.
Your immune system consists of a vast array of proteins, cells and organs that work together to help keep your body safe from invasion by pathogens. Pathogens are simply disease-causing organisms, such as infectious bacteria and viruses. There are a number of proteins that the immune system depends upon in order to maintain normal function. These are proteins that your cells make and express onto their cell surface. They allow your immune system to monitor what's going on inside the cell and provide an early detection system in case of an invasion by a pathogen.
What the immune system does. The immune system protects the body against illness and infection caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. It is really a collection of reactions and responses that the body makes to damaged cells or infection. So it is sometimes called the immune response. The bone marrow makes blood cells that help to fight infection. Weakening of the immune system happens most often in leukaemia or lymphoma. But it can happen with other cancers too. The cancer in the bone marrow stops the bone marrow making so many blood cells.
