Visceral pleura Definition. It is a thin serous membrane tissue layer that sticks to the lung surface. It is the innermost of the two pleural membrane layers investing the lungs. It is also known by the name Pulmonary pleura. It refers to a swelling of the pleural layers. The visceral pleura, which is the inmost of the two layers, becomes inflamed due to cold weather and certain infections. This can give rise to an acute burning pain which can be experienced while breathing deeply.
It is that part of the parietal pleura that lines the Intercostales and the inner rib 1  […]. Visceral pleura-Definition, Functions and Pictures-July 19, 2012 […] runs continuous with the parietal pleura, which is located at the lung base and covers the diaphragm as well as lines the inner chest walls. The costal segment of the parietal pleura acts as a lining for the inner slope of the ribs and intercostal muscles located within them. It is the endothoracic fascia that separates it from these structures. The intercostal nerves innervated this section.
Parietal pleura Function. It covers the diaphragm and lines the inner walls of the chest. This structure is a serous membrane and produces a type of serous fluid referred to as Pleural fluid. The costal segment of the parietal pleura acts as a lining for the inner slope of the ribs and intercostal muscles located within them. It is the endothoracic fascia that separates it from these structures. The intercostal nerves innervated this section.
Answer by Greg Rice. Confidence votes 29. The pleura is a slick, wet, shiny membrane. It is the outer most layer of tissue surrounding the lungs and also the inner most layer of tissue coating the chest wall. The pleura provide well lubricated surfaces of the chest wall and lungs to contact each other with minimal friction during respiration. The respiratory system is made up of lungs and related parts in your body that allow you to breathe; meaning to take in oxygen and to release the carbon dioxide to out side. Edit.
The main functions of this structure are: 1  The Visceral pleura follow the underlying lung surface very closely. 2  It covers the lungs closely and adheres to all the surfaces of the organ, except at the hilum and along the spot where it attaches to the pulmonary ligament. It refers to a swelling of the pleural layers. The visceral pleura, which is the inmost of the two layers, becomes inflamed due to cold weather and certain infections. This can give rise to an acute burning pain which can be experienced while breathing deeply.
The main functions of this structure are: 1  The Visceral pleura follow the underlying lung surface very closely. 2  It moves down into the fissures and covers the lobes. 3  It gives a smooth, slippery surface to the lungs and allows it to move freely in the parietal pleura.

• The respiratory system consists of the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. • The visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs. The parietal pleura covers the mediastinum and the diaphragm, and lines. the thoracic wall. • The lungs contain the bronchial tree, the branching airways from the primary bronchi through the terminal bronchioles.
The pulmonary pleurae are the two pleurae of the invaginated sac surrounding each lung and attaching to the thoracic cavity. The visceral pleura is the delicate serous membrane that covers the surface of each lung and dips into the fissures between the lobes. The parietal pleura is the outer membrane which is attached to the inner surface of the thoracic cavity. It also separates the pleural cavity from the mediastinum. Structure [edit]. The visceral pleura is a delicate serous membrane that closely covers the surfaces of the lungs and dips into the fissures that separate
In human anatomy, the pleural cavity is the thin fluid-filled space between the two pulmonary pleurae (visceral and parietal) of each lung. A pleura is a serous membrane which folds back onto itself to form a two-layered membranous pleural sac. The outer pleura (parietal pleura) is attached to the chest wall, but is separated from it by the endothoracic fascia. The inner pleura (visceral pleura) covers the lungs and adjoining structures, including blood vessels, bronchi and nerves.
Parietal pleura Definition. It is the outermost of the pleural membranes, which are two in number, and forms a lining for the chest cavity that contains the lungs. In Latin, this organ is known as “Pleura Parietalis”. The costal segment of the parietal pleura acts as a lining for the inner slope of the ribs and intercostal muscles located within them. It is the endothoracic fascia that separates it from these structures. The intercostal nerves innervated this section.
