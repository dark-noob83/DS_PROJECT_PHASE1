Epithelium (epi- + thele + -ium) is one of the four basic types of animal tissue. The other three types are connective tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. Epithelial tissues line the cavities and surfaces of blood vessels and organs throughout the body. There are three principal shapes of epithelial cells: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal. These can be arranged in a single layer of cells as simple epithelium, either squamous, columnar or cuboidal, or in layers of two or more cells deep as stratified (layered), either squamous, columnar or cuboidal
It also serves as a type of insulation for the body. g. _______________________ is a semi-solid connective tissue that is used as both a protective and supportive structure within the body. This particular type of connective tissue can be found in the nose, ears, ribs, and vertebral disks. This tissue is found in the spleen and the marrow. d. _______________________ is a type of connective tissue with one of the hardest extracellular matrixes that forms a protective structure used for muscle attachment.
Tissue Layers of the Digestive Tract. Last Updated: Tuesday, February 7, 2012. Most of the tissue in the digestive tract itself has four layers. These layers are called the mucosa, the submucosa, muscularis externa, and the serosa. The layer in the innermost part of the digestive tract is called the mucosa. In some places, such as the small intestine, the submucosa also contains cells that secrete mucus onto the surface of the tract. After the submucosa is a layer called the muscularis externa. Except for the upper portion of the esophagus, this layer consists of smooth muscle.
The type of muscle in the digestive system is smooth muscle, one of  the types of involuntary muscles. Smooth muscle found in the  urinary bladder, gallbladder, arteries, ve … ins, and the digestive  tract. 21 people found this useful. Alexander Rowan. 
Types of Tissue. Edit 0 5 …. Types of Tissue. The digestive system contains all four major tissue types, Epithelial, Connective, Muscle and Nervous. Epithelial tissue lines the entire length the digestive tract. It is made up of many different types of cells, including goblet cells that secrete mucus. There are layers of smooth muscle that line the walls of the tract, and contract to move food through. Nervous tissue is located in the tract, and transports electrical stimulus to the brain.
