Jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter. It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar System and hence its largest planet. It has a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator. The density of Jupiter, 1.326 g/cm 3, is the second highest of the giant planets, but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun. Jupiter's average distance from the sun is 5.2 astronomical units, or AU. This distance is a little more than five times the distance from Earth to the sun. When viewed from Earth, it is usually the second brightest planet in the sky, after Venus. Jupiter is known for its stripes and large red spot.

Weather.gov Sioux Falls, SD. Jupiter is the fifth closest planet to our Sun and is the first planet beyond the relatively small, inner four, rocky planets. It is the first of the four gas giant planets in proximity to the Sun. Jupiter has 300 times the mass of Earth, but is less dense. It is by far the largest planet in our solar system and has 2 1/2 times the mass of all the solar system's planets put together. Jupiter has 63 known satellites and like Saturn, there is a large number of very small satellites orbiting Jupiter from about seven million to 13 million miles away
The temperature in Jupiter's upper atmosphere is around -145C (-230F). Deeper below the clouds the temperate reaches 21C (70F). Near the planet's center the temperature is around six times hotter than the surface of the Sun! Jupiter has 62 moons, 16 of which have a diameter of at least 6 miles. The four main moons of Jupiter are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all discovered in 1610 by Galileo and referred to as the Galilean Moons. 1 The gas giant is the largest planet in the solar system with a diameter of around 89,000 miles (143,000 km). 2  Jupiter is 11 times larger than Earth in diameter and around 10% as large as the sun. 3  Over 1,000 Earth's could fit inside the volume of Jupiter
(distance is from Jupiter's center to the ring's inner edge). Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and by far the largest. Jupiter is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined (the mass of Jupiter is 318 times that of Earth).
1 Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun. 2  Its average distance from the sun is around 484 million miles (779 million km), more than five times Earth's distance. 3  The gas giant is the largest planet in the solar system with a diameter of around 89,000 miles (143,000 km). 1 The gas giant is the largest planet in the solar system with a diameter of around 89,000 miles (143,000 km). 2  Jupiter is 11 times larger than Earth in diameter and around 10% as large as the sun. 3  Over 1,000 Earth's could fit inside the volume of Jupiter
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn (Uranus and Neptune are ice giants). It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar System and hence its largest planet. It has a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator. The density of Jupiter, 1.326 g/cm 3, is the second highest of the giant planets, but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.
With an average temperature of minus 234 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 145 degrees Celsius), Jupiter is frigid even in its warmest weather. Unlike Earth, whose temperature varies as one moves closer to or farther from the equator, Jupiter's temperature depends more on height above the surface. This is because heat is driven not by the sun but by the interior of the planet. A comparison of the visible, near infrared, and thermal infrared views of Jupiter. In the next layer, the temperature increases with altitude, returning to up to minus 150 F again. At the top of the atmosphere, temperatures can reach as high as 1,340 F (725 C), over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) above the planet's surface.
Temperature on Jupiter. Jupiter was the king of the gods in Roman mythology, so it is appropriate that this was the name given to the largest planet in our Solar System. Jupiter’s mass is two and a half times all of the other planets combined. Jupiter sees a wide range of temperatures, from close to absolute zero at the outermost cloud layer to 36,000° Kelvin at the core. The high temperatures at the core are attributed to the extreme pressure of the planet bearing down at the center.
