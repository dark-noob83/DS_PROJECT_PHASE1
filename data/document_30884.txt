Lactose intolerance is when someone has difficulty absorbing and digesting lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. It is a condition that can be associated with coeliac disease. Symptoms of lactose intolerance are similar to that of coeliac disease and include: 1  nausea. 2  bloating. 3  stomach pain and/or cramps. 4  diarrhoea.
Lactose intolerance: The inability to digest lactose, a component of milk and some other dairy products. The basis for lactose intolerance is the lack of an enzyme called lactase in the small intestine. The most common symptoms of lactose intolerance are diarrhea, bloating, and gas.
If you have lactose intolerance, you may love milk, but your body doesn't -- and it lets you know that when you have too much. You might have symptoms like cramps after a bowl of cereal or gas after an ice cream treat. Lactose is the main sugar in milk and other dairy products. If you have lactose intolerance, you can't digest it well. Lactose intolerance is not curable, but there are many ways to cut your symptoms and feel better.
Lactose intolerance means the body cannot easily digest lactose, a type of natural sugar found in milk and dairy products. This is not the same thing as a food allergy to milk.
Lactose is the form of sugar present in milk. The enzyme lactase, which is normally produced by cells lining the small intestine, breaks down lactose into substances that can be absorbed into the bloodstream.
Your body needs lactase to break down, or digest, lactose. Lactose intolerance most commonly runs in families, and symptoms usually develop during the teen or adult years. Most people with this type of lactose intolerance can eat some milk or dairy products without problems.
1 If you are lactose intolerant, try lactose-free milk or dairy products lower in lactose, such as yogurt and cheese. 2  You may be able to consume dairy products in small amounts without symptoms. 3  Consume milk or other dairy products with other foods.
