Microvilli (singular: microvillus) are microscopic cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area of cells. They are involved in a wide variety of functions, in … cluding absorption, secretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction. 1 person found this useful. The presence of microvilli typically indicates absorption and or  secretion. Microvilli are cellular membrane protrusions that are  microscopic in size.
Microvilli, in the most simplistic terms, are tiny little projections that exist in, on, and around cells. They can exist on their own or in conjunction with villi. In the linings of some mucous membranes, most specifically of the small intestine, there exist tiny folds that project out like numerous fingers. Where Are They Found. Microvilli are most often found in the small intestine, on the surface of egg cells, as well as on white blood cells. In the intestine, they work in conjunction with villi to absorb more nutrients and more material because they expand the surface area of the intestine.
Microvilli are the finger like projections present on the outer surface of the cell. Their function is to increase the surface area of the cells through which the diffusion of … materials both into and out of the cell occur. The presence of microvilli typically indicates absorption and or  secretion. Microvilli are cellular membrane protrusions that are  microscopic in size.
Thousands of microvilli form a structure called the brush border that is found on the apical surface of some epithelial cells, such as the small intestines. Each microvillus has a dense bundle of cross-linked actin filaments, which serves as its structural core. 20 to 30 tightly bundled actin filaments are cross-linked by bundling proteins fimbrin (or plastin-1), villin and espin to form the core of the microvilli.
Microvilli on a cell increase the overall surface area exposed on the cell which leads to better absorbsion of substances. Microvillus are tiny cellular membranes that through microscopic  protrusions increase the surface area of cells and are involved in  many cellular processes, such as absorp … tion, secretion, and  adhesion.

Microvilli (singular: microvillus) are microscopic cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area of cells and minimize any increase in volume, and are involved in a wide variety of functions, including absorption, secretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction.

Microvilli. Cells may have slender extensions of the cell membrane to form cilia or the smaller extensions called microvilli. The microscopic microvilli effectively increase the surface area of the cell and are useful for absorption and secretion functions. A dramatic example is the human small intestine. The tissue has small fingerlike extensions called villi which are collections of cells, and those cells have many microvilli to even further increase the available surface area for the digestion process. According to Audesirk & Audesirk, this can give an effective surface area of about 250 square meters for absorption.
Microscopic hairlike projections above the surface of specialised epithelial cells, which are composed of complex plasma membrane folds surrounding an actin microfilament core. Microvilli greatly increase total cell surface, and therefore also the absorptive capacity of cell.
