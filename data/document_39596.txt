Salary Outlook. According to the BLS, in 2013, elementary school teachers earned a median average salary of $53,590. The best-paid earned about $83,600, while the lowest-paid made approximately $35,760.
For example, you might be paid $20 per class up to ten students, and for every student beyond ten, you get an additional $3. So if you have fifteen students in class, that’s $20+($3 x 5) = $35.

Teachers in a lot of school systems are paid very well. I know in mass they are making around $60-$70 and hour and have 3 months off every year. I would gladly work 6 hour days for only 180 days a year and still make a comparable salary to people working full time.
We can get that for less than minimum wage. That’s right. Let’s give them $3.00 an hour and only the hours they worked; not any of that silly planning time, or any time they spend before or after school. That would be $19.50 a day (7:45 to 3:00 PM with 45 min. off for lunch and plan– that equals 6 1/2 hours).
Half of all teacher assistants reported annual earnings of between $19,160 and $29,790 per year. The highest-paid 10 percent of teacher assistants earned $36,560 or more per year, while the lowest paid 10 percent throughout the U.S. reported annual earnings of $17,090 or less.
Those teaching elementary school earned annual median salaries of $51,660 or $24.84 per hour. Middle school teachers earned median salaries of $51,960 annually or $24.98 per hour. And secondary or high school teachers earned $53,230 per year or approximately $25.59 per hour.
Employment of kindergarten and elementary school teachers is projected to grow 12 percent from 2012 to 2022, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Growth is expected due to projected increases in enrollment as well as declines in student–teacher ratios.
