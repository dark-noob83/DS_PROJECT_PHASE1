Dog Kennel Cost. 1  A basic dog boarding facility -- which usually has indoor kennels with cement floors attached to outdoor runs enclosed by chain-link fencing -- usually costs $12 to $26 per day. 1 Many boarding facilities charge by weight or size -- as much as 50 percent more for a dog that weighs more than 80 pounds or requires a large suite.
The prices really vary around the country and I think where I live is at the high end. To board at the vets costs approx $20 per cat per day ($10-20 more if they need any meds etc) and petsitters cost approx $20 for the 1st cat and $5 per additional cat (including any meds). The petsitting prices are for 2 visits a day and its cheaper for 1 visit which would work fine if you have healthy cats.

Anything from 10 to 25 a night per dog in a kennel. I pay 15 per night at the kennel I use but by putting three into one large kennel I get a reduction. So you are looking at 100+ per week and the cost of kennel cough vaccine three weeks before admission and they will need proof of vaccinations being up to date.
