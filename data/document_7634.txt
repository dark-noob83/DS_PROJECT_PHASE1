1. Determine what type of yeast you have. Dried yeast comes in two basic varieties: instant and active dry. If you have instant yeast, there is no need to activate the yeast: Just mix it in with your dry ingredients. If you have active dry yeast, it helps to activate the yeast first.
Water that is hotter than 120Â°F will kill the yeast and cooler water will not be able to activate the yeast. 2) Stir in a yeast packet (or 2-1/4 tsp of dry yeast) until dissolved. 3) Wait-in a minute, it should become activated and after 10 minutes should rise to the 1 cup mark.
I've put a handmade loaf in the oven with Yeast that technically expired 2 months after I opened the tin (Allisons active dried yeast-granules)... it foamed up beautifully; 1 level tbsp (measuring spoon) in 150ml warm water (1 part boiling 2 parts room temp).
With the thought that dry yeast is basically freeze-dried and should have a decent shelf life, I proofed one envelope in warm water with some sugar to see if it really expires. It foamed right up, so it seems like the answer is, at least for one year after the marked date, no.
I've sucessfully used dry active yeast that is over five years old, keep it in the frige. When it's really old, I put a skosh of sugar in the proofing cup, to give the old fellers a bit of a leg up, and just wait till it's really foaming, then use it like usual, don't increase the quantities.
I added a 1 tsp. sugar and the dry yeast packet (from 2009) and stirred together. The mixture should begin to foam after 3-4 minutes and after 10 minutes it should double to the 1 cup mark. My yeast mixture came to about 3/4 cup after 10 minutes.
