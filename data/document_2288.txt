What should be included: 1  The hourly rate charged by graphic designers ranges from $20-$350, but averages $65-$75 an hour nationwide, according to a survey by HOW magazine. 2  The hourly rate is generally based on prevailing local costs as well as the designer's training, experience and reputation.
When you do get a client that will allow you to work on an hourly basis, consider purchasing a timekeeping application. Some freelance graphic designers charge more than $300 an hour (although $75 to $150 an hour is much more common, and there are those, at the low end, that charge $25 to $50 an hour).
They also need to cover business costs like electricity/equipment costs, paper, ink, insurance, etc. Freelance designers usually charge between $40 and $140 per hour, depending on experience, and quality of work. It also depends on location, type of work, type of client, and convenience of the project. A typical calculation for a freelancer with 3-4 years of experience, working from home might include:
In a studio, an entry-level designer can expect to be paid $15-$18/hr, however a graduate with competence and a worthy portfolio can expect to start off with a salary of $45k-$65k per year, which would seem like $25/hr to $36/hr, but in reality designers making decent money usually work more than 40 hrs/week.
According to NJ Creatives Network, the lowest rate for hourly design rates is $40, and the highest is $75 (although I know freelance web designers that charge $100 an hour), with an average of $59 an hour.
