Iron is one of 16 essential elements for plant growth and reproduction (some scientists also consider nickel to be essential, making 17 in total). Iron (Fe) is one of the most abundant elements on the planet. In 1844, Eusebe Gris showed that certain chlorosis in plants could be reversed by treating roots and leaves with iron solutions. Iron is a micronutrient and is required by plants in small amounts. Iron uptake by the plant is not as simple as with other essential elements. Iron is taken up by plant roots in greatest amounts in the zone of the root between cell elongation and maturation, about 1 to 4 cm behind the root tip.
Iron deficiency symptoms for monocot and dicot plants are shown in Figures 2–5. In all plant species, the main symptom of Fe deficiency is chlorosis in young leaves. Plants have two means, called “strategies,” for dealing with Fe deficiency. Iron uptake by the plant is not as simple as with other essential elements. Iron is taken up by plant roots in greatest amounts in the zone of the root between cell elongation and maturation, about 1 to 4 cm behind the root tip.
Symptoms including interveinal chlorosis on the newer leaves have traditionally been associated with micronutrient (manganese or iron) deficiency. The metal micronutrients are immobile in plants suggesting that the symptoms should be most visible on the newest leaves. Another essential element, magnesium, also produces interveinal chlorosis, although magnesium is mobile in the plant so that symptoms appear on the older leaves rather than the newer leaves.
Fe’s involvement in chlorophyll synthesis is the reason for the chlorosis (yellowing) associated with Fe deficiency. Iron is found in the iron-containing (heme) proteins in plants, examples of which are the cytochromes. Iron uptake by the plant is not as simple as with other essential elements. Iron is taken up by plant roots in greatest amounts in the zone of the root between cell elongation and maturation, about 1 to 4 cm behind the root tip.
Potassium deficiency symptoms first appear on the recently matured leaves of the plant (not on the young, immature leaves at the growing point). In some plants, the first sign of potassium deficiency is a white specking or freckling of the leaf blades. 
For the form of anemia, see Hypochromic anemia. A corn plant with severe chlorosis (left) beside a normal plant (right). In botany, chlorosis is a condition in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll. As chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of leaves, chlorotic leaves are pale, yellow, or yellow-white. In viticulture, the most common symptom of poor nutrition in grapevines is the yellowing of grape leaves caused by chlorosis and the subsequent loss of
Iron is necessary for the formation of chlorophyll, which is responsible for the green color in plants and is the source of plant food and energy. When the amount of iron available to plants is inadequate for normal growth, leaves become pale green, yellow or white and eventually brown, particularly between the veins. Iron chlorosis may occur as a result of one or a combination of causes. The condition is often due to high pH, which makes it possible for other elements to interfere with the absorption of iron, rather than to a lack of iron in the soil.

Chlorosis is derived from the word Chloris or from the Greek khloros meaning 'greenish-yellow', 'pale green', 'pale', 'pallid', or 'fresh'. In viticulture, the most common symptom of poor nutrition in grapevines is the yellowing of grape leaves caused by chlorosis and the subsequent loss of chlorophyll.
Plants only need a tiny amount of iron to be healthy, but that small amount is crucial. First of all, iron is involved when a plant produces chlorophyll, which gives the plant oxygen as well as its healthy green color. This is why plants with an iron deficiency, or chlorosis, show a sickly yellow color to their leaves. Iron is also necessary for some enzyme functions in many plants.
