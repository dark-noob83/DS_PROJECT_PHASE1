Other rabbits such as ermine, squirrel, chocolate chinchilla and lilac ermine also have the c chd gene as the dominant color gene. The next gene is the sable gene represented by c chl, which stands for “chinchilla-light.” Smoke pearl and sable point are examples of rabbits with the chl
Here's how dominant/recessive inheritance in rabbits works relative to rabbit coat color genetics. 1  Inside every cell in the rabbit is DNA-the blueprint that dictates how the animal looks, acts and functions. 2  Genes contain the DNA. 3  They come in pairs. 4  The genes always contain two copies for fur color.
1 c - (albino) - red-eyed white. 2  A red-eyed-white (REW) rabbit has no color at all. 3  BUT: don’t forget that under the white coat, the rabbit still carries plenty of coding for color. 4  The two copies of the ‘c’ gene simply eliminates the expression of those genes.
(Remember-only two colors: black and yellow.). Here's an example of rabbit coat color genes turning off the expression of the color black (or chocolate) in a Netherland Dwarf rabbit. Amazingly, this orange rabbit is an agouti, with the black (or chocolate) pigment removed.
Let’s start by thinking about which types of colors are produced when the different color genes are expressed. The dominant color gene is the “Full Color” gene represented by the capital “C.” Some full color rabbits are black, orange, chestnut, black tortoiseshell, lilac, and blue. The next gene, in order of dominance, is the chinchilla gene, which is represented by the letters chd (or sometimes Cchd or c chd).
A genotype refers to the full set of underlying rabbit coat color genetic codes-the full set of paired letters describing the rabbit's genes. The genotype in the example above is AABBCCDDEE. Heterozygous (hetero = different) refers to a rabbit who carries two different gene copies at a particular locus.
