A Seattle University study examining the costs of the death penalty in Washington found that each death penalty case cost an average of $1 million more than a similar case where the death penalty was not sought ($3.07 million, versus $2.01 million). The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000.

The recommended dose of Cosentyx is to administer 300 mg by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks. Each 300 mg dose is given as 2 injections of 150 mg.

It is also available in a single-use vial containing 150 mg powder for injection.

If Cosentyx is approved, I am assuming it will be covered at the same cost of the other newer medications (Stelara and Otezla) so the cost to the insurance company will be about $7000 and then you will need to pay your copay responsibility after that. Got a call from Novartis the other day since I had signed up to start on Cosentyx. First time with a biological. I had already read the package inserts so knew what was in them.
