The three types of thyroid blood tests are the total thyroxine test, the free thyroxine test and the triiodothyronine test. Each of these tests can determine whether the thyroid is releasing the appropriate number of hormones in the body.
If the blood tests determine high hormone levels in the thyroid, it can be an indication of a goiter, abnormal growths or nodules on the thyroid, Graves’ disease or thyroiditis. Low levels of thyroid hormones can indicate pituitary disease, thyroiditis or damage to the thyroid from surgery.
