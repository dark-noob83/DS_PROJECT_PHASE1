While PTH acts to increase the concentration of ionic calcium (Ca 2+) in the blood, calcitonin, a hormone produced by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland, acts to decrease ionic calcium concentration. PTH reduces the reabsorption of phosphate from the proximal tubule of the kidney, which means more phosphate is excreted through the urine. However, PTH enhances the uptake of phosphate from the intestine and bones into the blood. In the bone, slightly more calcium than phosphate is released from the breakdown of bone.
Low levels of the hormone are secreted even when blood calcium levels are high. The figure to the right depicts parathyroid hormone release from cells cultured in vitro in differing concentrations of calcium. 1 This effect is mediated by stimulating tubular reabsorption of calcium. 2  Another effect of parathyroid hormone on the kidney is to stimulate loss of phosphate ions in urine.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Calcitonin (also known as thyrocalcitonin) is a 32-amino acid linear polypeptide hormone that is produced in humans primarily by the parafollicular cells (also known as C-cells) of the thyroid, and in many other animals in the ultimobranchial body. It acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca 2+), opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Calcitonin has been found in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
Parathyroid Hormone. Parathyroid hormone is the most important endocrine regulator of calcium and phosphorus concentration in extracellular fluid. This hormone is secreted from cells of the parathyroid glands and finds its major target cells in bone and kidney. Another hormone, parathyroid hormone-related protein, binds to the same receptor as parathyroid hormone and has major effects on development. 1 This effect is mediated by stimulating tubular reabsorption of calcium. 2  Another effect of parathyroid hormone on the kidney is to stimulate loss of phosphate ions in urine.
The parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes increases in the serum calcium levels (through acting in the gut, kidneys, bone and Vit.D) and the calcitonin hormone antagonizes the action of PTH. Excess of PTH causes hyperparathyroidism, and the deficit causes hypoparathyroidism.
