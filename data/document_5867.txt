(1)Department of Medicine and Geriatrics, Kochi Medical School. To estimate normal ranges of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) levels in the aged, we measured BUN and Cr levels in 332 cases of apparent-healthy elderly subjects (male, 152; female, 180) aged 70 years or more.
In children, the normal range of creatinine is 0.2 to 1.0mg/dl but will increase with age as there is better and better physical constitute and muscle buildup. Two units are often used to measure creatinine level, this is, mg/dl and umol/l. 1 mg/dl equals to 88.4umol/l.
Normal range of serum creatinine level will differ with age, gender and physical constitute. In adult men, normal range of serum creatinine is 0.9-1.3mg/dl; while in adult women, normal range of creatinine is 0.6 to 1.1mg/dl.
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measures the amount of urea nitrogen in bloodstream. Urea is formed in liver as the end product of protein metabolism and digestion. Urea is transported to the kidneys for excretion. A normal range for blood urea nitrogen is generally 8 to 24 mg/dl for adult males and 6 to 21 mg/dl for females. Generally, a high blood urea nitrogen level means that the kidneys are not performing well, particularly if the result is above 50mg/dl.
Creatinine levels tend to be higher in men and people with large muscles. Measuring creatinine is only the first step to finding your level of kidney function. The normal serum creatinine range for men is 0.5-1.5 mg/dL.
Normal findings (in mg/dL) are 10 to 20 for adults, 5 to 18 for children and infants, 3 to 12 for newborns, and 21 to 40 for cord blood. In the elderly, the blood urea nitrogen may be slightly higher than the normal adult range. while a maximum limite of a normal range can reach 25 mg/100 ml.
