For the medical journal, see Clinical Chemistry (journal) . Clinical chemistry (also known as chemical pathology, clinical biochemistry or medical biochemistry) is the area of clinical pathology that is generally concerned with analysis of bodily fluids.
Clinical chemistry uses chemical processes to measure levels of chemical components in body fluids. The most common specimens tested in clinical chemistry are blood and urine. Many different tests exist to test for almost any type of chemical component in blood or urine. Components may include blood glucose, electrolytes, enzymes, hormones, lipids (fats), other metabolic substances, and proteins.
Clinical Chemistry Instruments. Clinical chemistry is used to analyze samples from patients to gather information about their health and tailor a treatment protocol for them. Clinical chemistry is used in medical labs, research labs, pharmaceutical companies, and academic labs.
