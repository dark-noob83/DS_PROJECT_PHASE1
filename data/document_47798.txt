Anyway, here is what those check marks on messages sent via WhatsApp really mean: Single check mark – this means your message was successfully delivered to the WhatsApp server. Double check mark – this means your message was successfully delivered to the phone of your chat partner. WhatsApp does not indicate that the message you sent was read; just that it was delivered.
Check marks will appear next to each message you send. Here is what each one indicates: 1  message successfully sent. 2  message successfully delivered to the recipient's phone. 3  the recipient has read your message.
In a group chat, the second check marks will appear when all participants in the group have received your message. The two blue check marks will appear when all participants in the group have read your message. The Message Info screen shows you who has seen your message and when.
- (one check) message successfully delivered to the server. - (two checks) message successfully delivered to the phone of your chat partner. Note: this does not indicate that the message was read, just that it was delivered.
Instead of a D and R, WhatsApp uses checkmarks to represent message status. Based on the precedent set by BBM and WhatsApp, I think a LOT of WhatsApp users out there mistakenly take this to mean that one checkmark means the message has reached the phone while the second checkmark means the message has been read.
Let’s understand what these ticks (check marks) and clock icon mean in WhatsApp. Meaning of Single Tick (Check mark). When you send someone a message through WhatsApp, in the first leg of journey, the message travels from your mobile phone to the WhatsApp server.
The WhatsApp blue check marks are optional in newer versions of the app. Interestingly, in our WhatsApp blue ticks survey, the vast majority of respondents actually liked the ''message read'' notification, so perhaps disabling them is not even important to you. Still, it's good to know in any case.
You see the little WhatsApp check marks showing up in WhatsApp but no one is responding. Relax, before you go all Dexter and write yourself a kill list, let us unravel the mystery of what the WhatsApp tick marks mean, including the blue ticks (or blue check marks) that have everyone so confused.
