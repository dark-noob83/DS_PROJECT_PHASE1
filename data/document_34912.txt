That's a good thing because $80 was the price you wanted to acquire it, and $10 cheaper than where it had been trading. Not only that, but someone paid you $750 extra per option just for your time and effort to buy your stock at your price. Since options trade in 100 multiples, the option is quoted as $7.50. When it's time to collect the money, you will receive $750 (100 shares x $7.50).
Evidently, the higher the price of the bond, the lower the rate of interest, and vice versa. Someone paying $105 today for a promise of $110 a year from now is paying an interest rate of 4.8% (=[$110-$105]/$105), a lower interest rate than the 10% interest paid by someone who pays $100 for that same bond.
Interest rates and bond prices. The price of a bond is what someone pays today for the promise of future payment. If one person offers to pay $110 a year from now, and someone else buys that bond for $100 today, the price of the bond is $100. (That is, in economic terms, the bond price and the principal refer to the same thing.).
Money that is paid for the use of money is called interest. When you keep your money in a bank savings account, the bank credits your account with interest.

This is called the speculative motive. Suppose that interest rates fluctuate. At a two percent rate of interest, you would get $1,020 in a year's time in exchange for $1,000 in cash now (i.e. by buying now for $1,000 a bond that pays $1,020 in a year, which is the same thing as lending $1,000 at two percent interest).
