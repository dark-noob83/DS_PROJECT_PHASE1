LeukoScan is an antibody fragment which is linked to a radioactive substance called technetium. LeukoScan is used in patients with suspected infection of the bone called osteomyelitis. An antibody is a natural substance made by the body which binds to foreign substances to help remove them from your body. You produce many different kinds of antibodies. LeukoScan (sulesomab) is a special kind of antibody which binds to the surface of certain kinds of blood cells called leukocytes. It is produced in mice and purified so that it can be used in human
Abstract. Antigranulocyte scintigraphy with the use of monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments (leukoscan) is a promising diagnostic tool that has been used widely during the recent years for the establishment of prosthesis infection after total hip or knee arthroplasty. Antigranulocyte scintigraphy with the use of monoclonal antibody fragment sulesomab (leukoscan) had good but not perfect diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of prosthesis infection in patients with
The active substance in LeukoScan, sulesomab, is a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is an antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure (called an antigen) that is found in certain cells in the body. An antibody is a natural substance made by the body which binds to foreign substances to help remove them from your body. You produce many different kinds of antibodies. LeukoScan (sulesomab) is a special kind of antibody which binds to the surface of certain kinds of blood cells called leukocytes. It is produced in mice and purified so that it can be used in humans
LeukoScan (0.31 mg, sulesomab) is presented as a non-pyrogenic lyophilized powder for intravenous use after reconstitution with pertechnetate [ 99m Tc] in 0.5 mL isotonic sodium chloride. The recommended adult dose of LeukoScan is 0.25 mg of sulesomab labelled with 900 200 Mbq of pertechnetate (approximately 1.2 mL). LeukoScan is a Fab' fragment of the IgG1 monoclonal antibody IMMU-MN3, formulated for direct labelling with technetium [ 99m Tc]. LeukoScan is provided in 3cc flint, type 1 glass vials sealed with aluminum bridge seals, and capped with 13 mm Lyo stoppers.
Products. LeukoScan® (sulesomab) is a murine monoclonal IgG antibody Fab’ fragment labeled with the isotope technetium-99m. The fragment targets NCA-90, found on the cell membrane of granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). Using a gamma camera, LeukoScan® can be used to detect osteomyelitis (a bone infection). 
LeukoScan is not used on its own, but must be radiolabelled before use. Radiolabelling is a technique where a substance is tagged (labelled) with a radioactive compound. LeukoScan is radiolabelled by mixing it with a solution of radioactive technetium (99m Tc). This radiolabelled medicine is for diagnostic use. Scintigraphy is a scanning method that uses a special camera (gamma camera) that can detect radioactivity. Because LeukoScan has not been studied in patients aged 21 years or younger, doctors should carefully weigh the benefits and the risks of its use before administering it to a patient in this age group.
LeukoScan is used to find the site and extent of infection or inflammation in patients with suspected osteomyelitis (bone infection), including patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. Scintigraphy is a scanning method that uses a special camera (gamma camera) that can detect radioactivity. Because LeukoScan has not been studied in patients aged 21 years or younger, doctors should carefully weigh the benefits and the risks of its use before administering it to a patient in this age group.
