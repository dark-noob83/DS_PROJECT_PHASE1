Width 9 – 12 feet. Width for two cars – minimum 18 feet. Driveway is 12 feet wide. I like the look of more narrow driveways so opt for 9 to 10 feet if it makes sense for your vehicles and design. I rarely design driveways to be wide enough to fit two cars at the street entry.
Single car driveways can be as narrow as 9 feet, or as wide as 12 feet. A 9 foot driveway is quite tight and may have difficulty accommodating larger vehicles such as delivery or trash trucks. Additionally, 9 feet may mean that guests are stepping in grass or dirt as they exit their vehicles.
The cost to pave an average concrete driveway varies by location, shape, size, concrete reinforcement material, labor rates, and decorative quality of the finish. A typical two-car driveway is 16 feet wide and 38 feet long without curves or slope, for a total surface area of 610 square feet. It will typically cost $4.99 per square foot to be professionally supplied and paved with concrete. The DIY Material Cost is around $2.59 per square foot.
When it comes to parking pads: We figure on 10 feet width per car. And 20 feet in length per car. If you desire for your cars to be parked side by side, a double wide parking pad measuring 20 feet wide is appropriate. However, paying attention to the length of the driveway or parking area is important too.
When if comes to commercial parking lot paving, code dictates 10 feet wide per parking spot. So if you are starting with a parking lot and trying to determine how many parking spots you can get on your driveway 10 feet wide is the rule of thumb.
The standard driveway width for residential homes ranges from 9 feet to 24 feet. The width of your driveway will vary based on whether you want a single car drive or double car drive. Additionally, the width may change to accommodate parking or a turn-around, these added features will change the cost of your driveway.
