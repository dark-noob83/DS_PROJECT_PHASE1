At the anterior articulation between the frontal crest and the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone is a small foramen called the foramen caecum, which usually transmits an emissary vein from the roof of the nasal cavity to the superior sagittal sinus. Frontal bone, inferior and posterior aspects.
The ethmoid bone is located in front of the sphenoid bone. It consists of two masses, one on each side of the nasal cavity, which is joined horizontally by thin cribriform plates.
The orbit is the bony cavity that contains the eyeball, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels, as well as the structures that produce and drain tears. Each orbit is a pear-shaped structure that is formed by several bones.
The eye is a paired organ, the organ of vision. The eye is made up of various components, which enable it to receive light stimuli from the environment, and deliver this stimuli to the brain in the form of an electrical signal. Vision involves all components of the eye.
The eye is contained within the bony orbit of the head. The bony orbit is a cavity, comprising parts of the lacrimal bone (includes fossa for nasolacrimal duct) and the maxilla (includes caudal foramen of infraorbital canal). It is continuous with the temporal bone and the pterygopalatine fossa caudally.
Eyeball: 1  The orbit houses and protects the eyeball which is formed by the. 2  maxilla bone; 3  zygomatic bone; 4  frontal bone; 5  sphenoid bone; 6  ethmoid bone. 7  Six extrinsic muscles attach the eye to the bony socket: 8  inferior rectus; 9  medial rectus; 10  superior rectus; 11  lateral rectus; 12  inferior oblique; 13  superior oblique.
1 There is a thin membrane lining called the conjunctiva, which folds over the white of the eye. 2  Inflammation of the area is called conjunctivitis. 3  Lacrimal glands, located at the upper outer corner of the eyeball, produce tears. 4  Tears contain an enzyme called lysozyme that inhibits the growth of most bacteria.
