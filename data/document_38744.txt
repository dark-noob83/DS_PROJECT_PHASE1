1 Sugar is the simplest form of carbohydrates. 2  Sugar occurs naturally in some foods, including fruits, vegetables, milk and milk products. 3  Sugars include fruit sugar (fructose), table sugar (sucrose) and milk sugar (lactose). Food manufacturers also add carbohydrates to processed foods in the form of starch or added sugar. Common sources of naturally occurring carbohydrates include: 1  Fruits. 2  Vegetables. 3  Milk. 4  Nuts. 5  Grains. 6  Seeds. 7  Legumes.
Answer   Your body gets carbohydrates from the foods we eat. Excellent sources of carbohydrates include bread, cereal, rice, grains, potatoes and other fruits and … vegetables. Your body can get carbohydrates from other foods as well but they may be mixed with the other two large nutrients -- fat and protein. The function of carbohydrates is to give energy to all the cells in our body and they fuel the basal. metabolic rate (the rate at which we use energy at rest) and activity levels. Carbohydrates are split into four groups each have their own role in the body.
In food science and in many informal contexts, the term carbohydrate often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate starch (such as cereals, bread and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, jams, and desserts). Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be hydrolyzed to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups. The general chemical formula of an unmodified monosaccharide is (C•H 2 O) n, literally a carbon hydrate..
Understanding Carbohydrates. How much and what type of carbohydrate foods are important for managing diabetes. The balance between how much insulin is in your body and the carbohydrate you eat makes a difference in your blood glucose levels.

Simple Carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates, or “carbs,” are also called simple sugars and include monosaccharides and disaccharides. Simple sugars are found in refined sugars, such as table sugar, brown sugar and molasses. Virtually all candies, chocolates and cakes are rich sources of simple sugars, but so are fruits. The main type of complex carbohydrate most people consume is starch. Starch is found in many grain products, such as bread, crackers, pasta and rice. Especially starchy vegetables include potatoes, corn, beans, parsnips and sweet potatoes.
Bread is a rich source of carbohydrates. The term carbohydrate is synonymous with saccharide, which is a chemical group consisting of simple and complex sugars. Carbohydrates are commonly found in many foods, especially breads, pastas, dairy products, fruits and vegetables. The main type of complex carbohydrate most people consume is starch. Starch is found in many grain products, such as bread, crackers, pasta and rice. Especially starchy vegetables include potatoes, corn, beans, parsnips and sweet potatoes.
Carbohydrates are a type of macronutrient found in many foods and beverages. Most carbohydrates are naturally occurring in plant-based foods, such as grains. Food manufacturers also add carbohydrates to processed foods in the form of starch or added sugar. Common sources of naturally occurring carbohydrates include: 1  Fruits. 2  Vegetables. 3  Milk. 4  Nuts. 5  Grains. 6  Seeds. 7  Legumes.
The main purpose of the carbohydrate is to provide fuel for your body to function. Carbohydrates are types of sugars. They perform several functions. The most important func … tion is as the primary source of energy for the body. But there are many types of carbohydrates that perform a myriad of functions in the body. The function of carbohydrates is to give energy to all the cells in our body and they fuel the basal. metabolic rate (the rate at which we use energy at rest) and activity levels.
