Description. Generally, the age of viability of a fetus is considered to be between 22 and 26 weeks after conception. Survival of a child born prior to the full gestational age (40 weeks) improves greatly during the third trimester. The survival rates at different times during the age of variability are as follows: 23 weeks; survival rate is 10–35%. 24 weeks; survival rate is 40–70%. 25 weeks; survival rate is 50–80%. 26 weeks; survival rate is 80–90%. 27 weeks; survival rate is 90% or more. Neonates born during the age of viability usually need assistance to survive and share some common, but often temporary, disorders.
Fetal viability depends largely on the fetal organ maturity, and environmental conditions. Another definition for viability, as used in the medical phrase limit of viability, is the expectation that a fetus has an equal chance of surviving and not surviving outside his or her mother's womb. As of 2006, the two youngest children to survive premature birth are thought to be James Elgin Gill (born on 20 May 1987 in Ottawa, Canada, at 21 weeks and 5 days gestational age), and Amillia Taylor (born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestational age).
Viability exists as a function of biomedical and technological capacities, which are different in different parts of the world. As a consequence, there is, at the present time, no worldwide, uniform gestational age that defines viability. As of 2006, the two youngest children to survive premature birth are thought to be James Elgin Gill (born on 20 May 1987 in Ottawa, Canada, at 21 weeks and 5 days gestational age), and Amillia Taylor (born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestational age).
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics specifically defines the borderline of viability as an infant born at or before the gestational age of 25 weeks. More commonly, the limit of viability has been defined as the age of fetal maturity that ensures a reasonable chance of extrauterine survival given technological support. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics recommends that resuscitation and intensive care should not be provided to infants at a gestational age of less than or equal to 22 weeks unless the informed parent requests it and clinicians agree it is likely in the best interest of the infant.
at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy (generally understood as 26 weeks after the last menstrual period, or 24 weeks after fertilization, although it is not defined in the court decision), and holds that any restrictions must allow exceptions to preserve the life and health of the woman. The ability of a fetus to survive outside of the womb. Historically, a fetus was considered to be capable of living at the end of gestational week 20 when the mother had felt fetal movement (quickening) and the fetal heart tones could be auscultated with a fetoscope.
As the word is used in United States constitutional law since Roe v. Wade, viability is the potential of the fetus to survive outside the uterus after birth, natural or induced, when supported by up-to-date medicine. As of 2006, the two youngest children to survive premature birth are thought to be James Elgin Gill (born on 20 May 1987 in Ottawa, Canada, at 21 weeks and 5 days gestational age), and Amillia Taylor (born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestational age).
Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 case legalizing abortion, made fetal viability an important legal concept. The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot put the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the fetus is viable.. Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the 23 rd week--a week earlier than was thought 24 years ago. Most hospitals will only perform abortions through the 22 nd week of pregnancy.
