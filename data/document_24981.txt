Uber driver pay varies depending on where you live and how many hours you drive. I make between $20 and $25 an hour in Los Angeles. Studies across the nation show that Uber drivers make over $19 an hour on average. In New York City, the average Uber driver makes over $30 an hour.

Which — if I save 10% for taxes and spend 10% on gas and vehicle costs– is about $19.53 an hour. As I already explained, how much money an Uber driver makes depends on numerous factors. As a practical example, let’s assume you make $20 an hour after taxes and expenses, and you work 40 hours a week, like a regular full-time job: $19 x 40 hours/week= $760 a week.
