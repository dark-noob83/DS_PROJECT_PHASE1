Mean frequency (MNF) and median frequency (MDF) are the most useful and popular frequency-domain features (Phinyomark et al., 2009) and frequently used for the assessment of muscle fatigue in surface EMG signals (Cifrek et al., 2009).
The noisy character of surface EMG records makes statistical signal analysis the most appropri-ate technique to obtain a quantitative description of the signal. In the frequency domain, power spectral density function (power spectrum) is often used, one of its more explored parameters being the median frequency (MF).

Other spectral variables that have been applied in the analysis of EMG signal are total power (TTP), mean power (MNP), peak frequency (PKF), the spectral moments (SM), frequency ratio (FR), power spectrum ratio (PSR), and variance of central frequency (VCF) (Phinyomark et al., 2012a).
I am trying to use Matlab to find the median frequency of an EMG signal. The code I am using is below, and s is my signal. X is the frequency value I am trying to find so Z=P.
The definition of mean and median frequencies. MNF is an average frequency which is calculated as the sum of product of the EMG power spectrum and the frequency divided by the total sum of the power spectrum (e.g. Oskoei & Hu, 2008; Phinyomark et al., 2012a).
Arendt-Nielsen L, Mills KR. Models of the behaviour of the surface EMG signal during fatigue have assumed that there is a linear relationship between the mean power frequency of the EMG spectrum and muscle fibre conduction velocity. They attribute the fall in mean power frequency during fatigue to a proportionate fall in fibre velocity.
