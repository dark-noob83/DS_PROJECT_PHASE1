VDR / S-VDR DEBEG 4300Voyage Data Recorder As a leading system integrator SAMElectronics decided to combine theadvantages of an Integrated NavigationSystem with the VDR. The result is theVDR DEBEG 4300. It was especiallydesigned for the system integrationinto the Radarpilot 1000/1100 family orthe NACOS xx-5.
A varistor is a voltage dependent resistor (VDR). The resistance of a varistor is variable and depends on the voltage applied. The word is composed of parts of the words “ var iable res istor ”. Their resistance decreases when the voltage increases.
2 VDR 4350 Voyage Data Recorder As a leading systems integrator, SAM Electronics is constantly striving for improvements to the safety of navigation. The new VDR 4350 empha-sises such expertise through integration of an Integrated Navigation System with VDR.
A varistor or metal oxide varistor (MOV) is a special resistor that is used to protect circuits against high transient (short term) voltage. These surges and spikes attacks the equipment by the power line and will destroy the power supply of the equipment.
A varistor is able to short these surges and spikes and keep them away from the following application. A varistor is also known as Voltage Dependent Resistor or VDR. A power surge or a spike is an increase in voltage significantly above the standard voltage of 230 volts.
