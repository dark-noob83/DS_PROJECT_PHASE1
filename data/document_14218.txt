Radius, diameter and circumference. Jupiter has a mean radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), about a tenth that of the sun. However, its rapid rotation — it spins once every 9.8 hours — causes it to bulge at the equator, where the diameter is 88,846 miles (142,984 km). In contrast, the diameter at the poles is only 83,082 miles (133,708 km).
Hubble Jupiter. In terms of size, Jupiter is 142,984 km (88,846 miles) in diameter across its equator. If you just compare that to Earth, it’s 11.2 times the diameter of Earth. But then, it’s only 10% the diameter of the Sun. The volume of Jupiter is 1.43128×10 15 km 3. That’s enough to fit inside 1321 planets the size of Earth, and still have room left over. The surface area of Jupiter is 6.21796×10 10 km 2. And just for comparison, that’s 122 times more surface area than Earth.
The largest planet in the solar system, the gas giant Jupiter is approximately 318 times as massive as Earth. If the mass of all of the other planets in the solar system were combined into one super planet, Jupiter would still be two and a half times as large. Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.
Jupiter has an equatorial diameter of 141,700 km compared to Earth's 12,800 km. This means that Jupiter is 11 times the diameter of the Earth, and 1,300 times its volume. This is about like comparing a basketball to a ping pong ball. Compared to the Sun, Jupiter is about 0.001 its mass, and is about 1/50 its diameter.
Jupiter has a diameter of about 88,695 miles (142,800 kilometers) which is more than 11 times the diameter of Earth. It's volume is over 1,300 times the volume of Earth. This means that Jupiter is so big that over 1,300 Earths could fit inside of it.
1 Jupiter is the giant of the Solar System, with a mass more than 300 times the mass of the Earth and is called after the ancient Roman sky-god, Jupiter, known to the Greeks as Zeus. 2  Jupiter has a diameter of 88,700 miles, or 142,750 kilometres.
