You can calculate you cost basis per share in two ways: First, you can take the original investment amount ($10,000) and divide it by the new amount of shares you hold (2,000 shares) to arrive at the new per share cost basis ($5 $10,000/2,000). A: The cost basis of any investment is the original value of an asset adjusted for stock splits, dividends and capital distributions. It is used to calculate the capital gain or loss on an investment for tax purposes.
Imagine that you invested $10,000 in ABC Inc., which gave you 1,000 shares in the company. The cost basis of the investment is $10,000, but it is more often expressed in terms of a per share basis, so for this investment it would be $10 ($10,000/1,000). After a year has passed, the value of the investment has risen to $15 per share, and you decide to sell. A: The cost basis of any investment is the original value of an asset adjusted for stock splits, dividends and capital distributions. It is used to calculate the capital gain or loss on an investment for tax purposes.
In this case, you will need to know your cost basis to calculate the tax amount for which you are liable. Your investment has risen to $15,000 from $10,000, so you face capital gains tax on the $5,000 ($15 - $10 x 1,000 shares). A: The cost basis of any investment is the original value of an asset adjusted for stock splits, dividends and capital distributions. It is used to calculate the capital gain or loss on an investment for tax purposes.
The average cost basis just takes into account the average price of the purchases, which in this case would be 20 shares x [($100*10 + $120*30 + $150*15)]/55 = $2490. The method chosen should be the most beneficial to the investor's tax situation. If the investor does not choose a method, FIFO is the default. For example if an investor bought 10 shares of ABC company for $1000 plus $10 trading fee and received dividends of $200 in year one and $400 in year two, cost basis would be $1610. If he or she then sold the stock in year three for $2000, the taxable gain would be $390.
Let's say the investor sold 20 shares. With FIFO, the cost basis will be recorded as (10 shares x $100/share) + (10 shares x $120/share) = $2200. With LIFO, the cost basis for 20 shares will be translated as (15 shares x $150/share) + (5 shares x $120/share) = $2850. For example if an investor bought 10 shares of ABC company for $1000 plus $10 trading fee and received dividends of $200 in year one and $400 in year two, cost basis would be $1610. If he or she then sold the stock in year three for $2000, the taxable gain would be $390.
1. The original value of an asset for tax purposes (usually the purchase price), adjusted for stock splits, dividends and return of capital distributions. This value is used to determine the capital gain, which is equal to the difference between the asset's cost basis and the current market value. Since tax law considers these reinvested earnings as paid to you even though you didn't actually have the cash in hand, your adjusted cost basis when the stock is sold should be recorded at $1,300 instead of the original purchase price of $1,000.
The total merger consideration is $93.3767 per DirecTV share. This is $28.50 in cash and $64.8767 in AT&T shares. Calculate the total value received for your DirecTV shares by multiplying 93.3767 by the total shares of DirecTV owned. This must be done on a block by block basis. Total Proceeds = [93.3767 x (# of DirecTV shares owned in each block)]. (Do this calculation for each block of shares.). Write down the total proceeds amount on paper or spreadsheet for each block of DirecTV shares owned. From the total proceeds subtract the cost basis of that particular block.
