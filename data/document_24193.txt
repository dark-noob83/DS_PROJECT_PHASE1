However, my ERS colleagues and I also wanted to know how much time, and where and when, people were eating and drinking while doing something else. Looking at the survey responses, we found that on an average day (2006-08), Americans age 15 or older spent 67 minutes in primary eating and drinking. An additional 23.5 minutes were spent eating while doing something else considered primary, and 63 minutes were spent drinking beverages while doing something else. Responses from time use surveys reveal that on an average day, Americans age 15 or older spent 23.5 minutes eating while engaging in another activity considered “primary.” A common example: eating while on the job.

According to a study done by the Harvard Health Watch, an average American spends 101 minutes per day driving. That means that in a lifetime, an average Joe spends a whopping 37,935 hours driving a car (assuming that s/he starts driving at 17 and drives until 78.7 years old). Let’s say that average Joe works 40 hours a week, from the age of 20-65 and gets two weeks of vacation every year. In that time, average Joe will have worked a total of 90,360 hours of his life working for the man.
Given that an average a person sleeps for 8 hours in a day, that means that an average person will sleep for 229,961 hours in their lifetime or basically one third of their life. That’s precious time which could have been spent watching Die Hard 105,325 times. Let’s say that average Joe works 40 hours a week, from the age of 20-65 and gets two weeks of vacation every year. In that time, average Joe will have worked a total of 90,360 hours of his life working for the man.
Eating is a necessary part of life that we must do in order to survive. A study done in the US said that an average American spends 67 minutes per day eating and drinking beverages. Summed up together, the average Joe spends a staggering 32,098 hours eating and drinking beverages in their lifetime. Let’s say that average Joe works 40 hours a week, from the age of 20-65 and gets two weeks of vacation every year. In that time, average Joe will have worked a total of 90,360 hours of his life working for the man.
In the UK the average life expectancy is 79.5 years old; this is equivalent to 954 months, or 29037 days, or 696882 hours. I’m going to break down how long the average person spends doing stuff in their lifetimes so that you can make sure you’ve got enough time to do everything that you want to! This means that the average person spends 15 years in education, doing a standard eight hours per day; excluding weekends – this brings the total to 1305 days, which is 43 months. This gives you 593 months left to live.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. it was in the London times that the average person spends 6 years and ten months eating in his or her 70 year life time. How much hair does an average human eat in a lifetime? The average human swallows about 40 lbs. of hair over their entire lifetime, completely unbeknownst to them (i.e., they are unaware of it).
Let’s say as an average, people spend 20 minutes a day on the toilet, it may not seem much, but over the course of 80 years it sums up to roughly 13 months and 1 week. This gives you 451 months 3 weeks left to live. This means that the average person spends 15 years in education, doing a standard eight hours per day; excluding weekends – this brings the total to 1305 days, which is 43 months. This gives you 593 month
That doesn’t sound like much, especially when you compare it with the amount of time the average American spends watching TV every weekday: 2 hours and 36 minutes, which itself is dwarfed by the 3 hours and 21 minutes we spend, on average, watching it on weekends and holidays. On the other hand, the amount of time women spent doing housework also decreased — from 58 minutes in 2003 to 49 minutes in 2014. No word on whether we women now spend the 9 minutes we used to spend on housework complaining about how much more housework we’re still doing, on average, than men.
The average person eats 5 meals per day, plus whatever munchies they eat between these meals, this gives a estimate that you spend six years of your life eating. This gives you 379 months 3 weeks left to live. This means that the average person spends 15 years in education, doing a standard eight hours per day; excluding weekends – this brings the total to 1305 days, which is 43 months. This gives you 593 month
Interestingly, while only 43 percent of men spent any time at all on food preparation or cleanup (compared with 69 percent of women who did) on an average day in 2014, that was a fairly substantial increase over the 35 percent of men who generally participated in food prep and cleanup in 2003. On the other hand, the amount of time women spent doing housework also decreased — from 58 minutes in 2003 to 49 minutes in 2014. No word on whether we women now spend the 9 minutes we used to spend on housework complaining about how much more housework we’re still doing, on average, than men.
