JR in San Jose, California said: I have worked at Wells Fargo for over two years now. This is a horrible job. They ride us every day for more and more sales no matter how many you get they want more. 80% of the people there go to JR. I am a current Wells Fargo employee and could not agree more. I collect MILLIONS OF DOLLARS/MONTH for the crappy company and all they want is more. They pay me less than 1/2 of 1 percent of what I collect for the company, and they have the nads to give me grief every day!
