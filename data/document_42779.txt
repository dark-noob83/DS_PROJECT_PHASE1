The Importance and Limitations of Peer-Review. Peer-review is a critical part of the functioning of the scientific community, of quality control, and the self corrective nature of science. But it is no panacea.
OMICS International, the medical peer review open access publisher, publishes the work of medical researchers in a manner that exemplifies the highest standards in research integrity. Medical journals of this publisher are leading peer-reviewed medical journals in the international medical community.
More detail and supporting information is in the body of this article. 1  Peer review is a quality-control step used by medical journals. 2  External experts-from the same field of work as the researchers submitting the manuscript-are asked to review its suitability for publication.
Peer review is a central part of this medical journal publication process, held as the best available means to help check the quality, relevance and importance of papers being submitted by medical researchers. This in turn helps to ensure that medical treatments are safe and effective for patients.
For medical journals, peer review means asking experts from the same field as the paper's authors-so in the same peer group-to help editors decide on publication or rejection of the manuscript, by providing a critique of the work.
The limitations of Peer-Review. It is important to realize that not all peer-reviewed journals are created equal. Small or obscure journals may follow the rules and gain recognized peer-reviewed status, but be desperate for submissions and have a low bar for acceptance.
A number of highly respected journals have begun experimenting with innovative peer-review models. The British Medical Journal did away with blinding in their peer-review process as early as 1999 (Smith 1999) and many of the BioMed Central journals provide open access to the complete review record.
