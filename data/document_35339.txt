Any picture you draw or trace on to a SHRINKLES plastic sheet S-H-R-I-N-K-S 7 times smaller and 7 times thicker than the original. You'll have hours of fun making badges, key fobs, fridge magnets, figurines, pencil toppers, jewellery and lots, lots more.
1. Preheat the oven to the temperature that your recipe recommends. Most fruit pies bake at a temperature between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Some recipes call for baking the pie in a 450 degree F oven to begin with, then turning down the oven to about 350 degrees F.
Instructions. Put your oven at about 170 degrees and increase the temperature (if no shrinkage is occurring) until it begins to start shrinking. Paint your design with the paint on to the styro. Then cut out the ornament shape to the size you want.
