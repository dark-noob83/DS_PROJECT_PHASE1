Causes of Metabolic Acidosis. Metabolic acidosis has several known causes, including uncontrolled diabetes, severe diarrhea, liver failure, hypoglycemia, heart failure, kidney disease, severe dehydration, aspirin overdose, shock and seizures.
Causes. Metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis: Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA): Develops when acidic substances known as ketone bodies, build up in the body.
If unchecked, metabolic acidosis leads to acidemia, i.e., blood pH is low (less than 7.35) due to increased production of hydrogen ions by the body or the inability of the body to form bicarbonate (HCO 3 âˆ’) in the kidney. Its causes are diverse, and its consequences can be serious, including coma and death.
1 Lactic acidosis occurs when there is too much lactic acid in your body. 2  Many things can cause a buildup of lactic acid. 3  These include chronic alcohol use, heart failure, cancer, seizures, liver failure, prolonged lack of oxygen, and low blood sugar. 4  Even prolonged exercise can lead to lactic acid buildup!
