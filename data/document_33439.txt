Genworth Financial notes that the costs of assisted living has gone up more than nursing homes, adult day care and home care. Many times, residents that would go into a nursing home can use an assisted living facility instead. They argue that the rise in cost is just a bit more than average inflation. The costs of assisted living care depend on the level of service a resident requires. The 2010 CDC National Survey of Residential Care Facilities provides some treasured insights into the costs of assisted living, but also how facilities charge residents.
The Cost Of Assisted Living. The average cost for living in an Assisted Living facility ranges between $60 and $80 per day ($1800 to $2400/month) for the basics. This cost covers room and board, basic utilities (electricity, heat, water, and garbage), basic housekeeping (fresh linens) and some meals
Just as the cost of real estate varies by geographic area, assisted living costs also vary nationwide. In the 2015 Cost of Care Survey conducted by Genworth Financial, assisted living showed an increase of 2.86% compared to the 2014 costs and the national median monthly rate is $3,600.

The average cost for a private one-bedroom apartment in an assisted living residence is over $3,000 per month, according to research compiled by several nonprofit senior living organizations, including the Assisted Living Federation of America. Most assisted living residences charge on a month-to-month lease arrangement, but a few require long-term arrangements. Base rates may fluctuate depending on unit size: for example, studio, one, or two-bedroom apartment.
This is similar to what many seniors would pay in an Independent Living facility but is much less expensive than the $70-$300 per day ($2100 to $9000/month) for a Nursing Home..

Cost: As with assisted living facilities, the cost of personal care homes (aka “care homes”) varies from location to location. On average the cost ranges between $1500 and $3000 per month for room and board. This often includes three meals a day, but each facility designates its own costs. 
What is the Cost for Assisted Living? Although assisted living costs less than nursing home care, it is still fairly expensive. Depending on the kind of assisted living facility and type of services an older person chooses, the price costs can range from less than $25,000 a year to more than $50,000 a year. Back to top.
