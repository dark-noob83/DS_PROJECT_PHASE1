Method 1: Disable the Auto-hide feature of the Taskbar. If the task bar appears on the desktop interface, when you move the mouse pointer towards the bottom of the screen, then the auto-hide option of the taskbar might have enabled on the computer. To disable this option follow these instructions and check the issue:
Right-click the Start button, and then click Properties. 2. On the Taskbar tab, select the Auto-hide the taskbar check box. Note.
Taskbar. A bar located at the bottom of the screen first introduced with Microsoft Windows 95 and found in all the versions of Windows that followed. The Taskbar allows the user to locate and launch programs through the Start button or view any program that is currently open.
a) Right click on the taskbar from the Desktop Interface of Windows 8. b) Select “Properties” to open the “Taskbar Properties” window. c) On the “Taskbar Properties” window and under the “Taskbar” tab, uncheck the second option which says “Auto-hide the Taskbar”. You will also have the option to change the position of the taskbar on the same window. You can change it to top, left or right.
I tried a right mouse ... Personalize... and selected TASKBAR and START MENU to move the taskbar to the left side, but the taskbar is missing. Also now when I do a right mouse on the desktop... then select Personalize... then select TASKBAR and START MENU... the task bar dialog does not appear.
