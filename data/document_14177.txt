The barnacles that you are talking about are the eyes of the potato, (also the seed of it, so as you can plant more) when you see them, rub or break them off as close to the potato as you can and the potato will last that much longer. If the potato feels a like soft it is going bad. You can put them in a bowl with cold water over night and they will be fine the next morning. When a potato has gone bad smell wise....believe me YOU WILL KNOW IT. The smell is ....man there is just not any words for that smell.
Raw potatoes don't take well to freezing. They don't go bad, but their texture and taste are poor after they've been thawed and then cooked. Blanch them first to inactivate enzymes that cause them to degrade to see if the resulting potatoes are acceptable to you. The fresher the potatoes, the better they freeze.
