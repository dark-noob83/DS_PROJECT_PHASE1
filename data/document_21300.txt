The usual age at which schizophrenia is diagnosed depends on whether you are male or female. For reasons not well understood, men tend to show symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thoughts earlier than women do. Generally, the diagnosis for men comes a bit earlier, around age 18, than for women, who are often diagnosed in their mid-twenties. This can be problematic, as signs of schizophrenia often mimic signs of drug use. For this reason, doctors must rule out this cause of symptoms before diagnosing the disorder.
Unlike virtually every other mental illness, schizophrenia is fairly unique in that its first onset is nearly always in young adulthood — not childhood or as a teen, and rarely after one’s 30s. Some believe those with schizophrenia have a hard life ahead of them, and that’s usually true. The DSM-5 suggests that the course of the disorder “appears to be favorable in about 20 percent of those with schizophrenia” — not an optimistic number. However, schizophrenia is not a sentence — it’s simply a diagnosi
Schizophrenia symptoms most commonly manifest themselves between the ages of 16 and 30. It is rare for individuals who cannot drive (under age 16) and those 45 or older to show signs of the disease, though. Generally, the diagnosis for men comes a bit earlier, around age 18, than for women, who are often diagnosed in their mid-twenties. This can be problematic, as signs of schizophrenia often mimic signs of drug use. For this reason, doctors must rule out this cause of symptoms before diagnosing the disorder.
It is unlikely for schizophrenia to be diagnosed in either early or late life. Most schizophrenia diagnoses come in early adulthood. Generally, the diagnosis for men comes a bit earlier, around age 18, than for women, who are often diagnosed in their mid-twenties.

Pediatric schizophrenia (also known as childhood schizophrenia, childhood-onset schizophrenia, and early-onset schizophrenia) is a type of mental disorder that is characterized by degeneration of thinking, motor, and emotional processes, with onset before age 18 (early onset) or before age 13 (very early onset). About 50% of young children diagnosed with schizophrenia experience severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Diagnostic criteria are similar to those of adult schizophrenia. Diagnosis is based on behavior observed by caretakers and, in some cases depending on age, self reports.
About 100,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with schizophrenia this year. [Note: The term 'prevalence' of Schizophrenia usually refers to the estimated population of people who are living with Schizophrenia at any given time. 1 Over 250,000 diagnosed cases in Britain. 2  Rates of schizophrenia are generally similar from country to countryabout .5% to 1 percent of the population (there are variations-but the variance is difficult to track due to differing measuring standards in many countries, etc.).
After a person has been diagnosed with schizophrenia in a family, the chance for a sibling to also be diagnosed with schizophrenia is 7 to 9 percent. If a parent has schizophrenia, the chance for a child to have the disorder is 10 to 15 percent. 1 Over 250,000 diagnosed cases in Britain. 2  Rates of schizophrenia are generally similar from country to countryabout .5% to 1 percent of the population (there are variations-but the variance is difficult to track due to differing measuring standards in many countries, etc.).
1 The average age of onset is 18 in men and 25 in women. 2  Schizophrenia onset is quite rare for people under 10 years of age, or over 40 years of age. 3  The diagram below demonstrates the general age of onset trends for schizophrenia in men and women, from a representative study on the topic. 1 Over 250,000 diagnosed cases in Britain. 2  Rates of schizophrenia are generally similar from country to countryabout .5% to 1 percent of the population (there are variations-but the variance is difficult to track due to differing measuring standards in many countries, etc.).
1 Men tend to get develop schizophrenia slightly earlier than women; whereas most males become ill between 16 and 25 years old, most females develop symptoms several years later, and the incidence in women is noticably higher in women after age 30. 2  The average age of onset is 18 in men and 25 in women. 1 Over 250,000 diagnosed cases in Britain. 2  Rates of schizophrenia are generally similar from country to countryabout .5% to 1 percent of the population (there are variations-but the variance is difficult to track due to differing measuring standards in many countries, etc.).
