Answers. Best Answer: It all depends on the company you go to and the type of stripes. If you want just the basics, not decal, the stripes can cost you anywhere from $400 on up. If you want pearl mix in the white, it goes up. I had crome outline with white translucent blue, and it costed $1000, so it all depend
