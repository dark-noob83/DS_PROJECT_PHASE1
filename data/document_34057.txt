As infants and children grow and age, their normal values for vital signs change. Body temperature does not change with age, and normal body temperature is considered 98.6 F (37 C). Two tables of normal vital signs for the pediatric population are presented below. Heart rates may be slightly slower when asleep. 
90/60. This table gives the values for systolic pressure (the higher one). When the heart or breathing (respiratory) rate is slower or faster than normal, it is often a sign that all is not well. Usually, there will be other signs as well-to read more about signs of illness in babies and toddlers, click here. 1  Heart Rate by Age. 2  Breathing (Respiratory) Rate by Age. 3  Blood Pressure by Age. 
A normal fetal heart rate (FHR) usually ranges from 120 to 160 beats per minute (bpm) in the in utero period. It is measurable sonographically from around 6 weeks and the normal range varies during gestation, increasing to around 170 bpm at 10 weeks and decreasing from then to around 130 bpm at term. 
Aim. There is no consensus about the normal fetal heart rate. Current international guidelines recommend for the normal fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline different ranges of 110 to 150 beats per minute (bpm) or 110 to 160 bpm. We started with a precise definition of normality and performed a retrospective computerized analysis of electronically recorded FHR tracings. Methods
A baby's heart beat is very rapid, much faster than an adult. In fact it starts out near 180 beats per minute (BPM) and around 12 weeks gestation settles into the normal range of 120-160 BPM for the remainder of the pregnancy. At this point, a normal fetal heart rate is about the same heart rate as the mother's-about 80-85 beats per minute (BPM).
Yes | No Thank you! 140 - 160 is the normal range. I just had an appointment today. I am 15 weeks and the heart rate was 150 but anywhere in the range is considered safe and healthy. I think my babies' was a little faster (closer to 160) at 11 weeks but that was still healthy and nothing to be concerned about. Anything between 120 and 180 is considered normal. The heart rate starts slow at 6-7 weeks, accelerates, and then slows back down to the 120-180 range. The OB told me at 12 weeks the average bpm is around 167...
At this point it begins a rapid deceleration to the normal fetal heart rate for the middle of the pregnancy of about 120-180 BPM. There is also a slowing of the normal fetal heart rate in the last ten weeks of pregnancy, though the normal fetal heart rate is still about twice the normal adult's resting heart rate. Your baby's normal fetal heart rate will also vary naturally, just as your heart rate does. At this point, a normal fetal heart rate is about the same heart rate as the mother's-about 80-85 beats per minute (BPM).
At about 5 weeks gestation, your baby's heart begins to beat. At this point, a normal fetal heart rate is about the same heart rate as the mother's-about 80-85 beats per minute (BPM). From this point, it will increase by about 3 beats per minute per day during that first month. At this point, a normal fetal heart rate is about the same heart rate as the mother's-about 80-85 beats per minute (BPM)
A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute.
