Give Jupiter's radius in units of Earth diameters, where the diameter of Earth is 12800 km. The diameter of Jupiter = its speed X its occultation time: Diameter= 13.1 km/s x 3 x 3600 seconds = 141500 km. In terms of Earth diameters: D (jupiter)= 141500 km. x (earth diameter/12800 km) = 11 earth diameters. Suppose Jupiter moves with an average orbital speed of 13.1 km/s
On Jupiter, the tropopause is approximately 50 km above the visible clouds (or 1 bar level), where the pressure and temperature are about 0.1 bar and 110 K. In the stratosphere, the temperatures rise to about 200 K at the transition into the thermosphere, at an altitude and pressure of around 320 km and 1 μbar. 1 ^ The scale height sh is defined as sh = RT/(Mgj) , where R = 8.31 J/mol/K is the gas constant, M ≈ 0.0023 kg/mol is the average molar mass in the Jovian atmosphere, T is temperature and gj ≈ 25 m/s2 is the gravitational acceleration at the surface of Jupiter.
Jupiter: Basic Properties: Jupiter is the largest of the nine planets, more than 10 times the diameter of Earth and more than 300 times its mass. In fact, the mass of Jupiter is almost 2.5 times that of all the other planets combined. Being composed largely of the light elements hydrogen and helium, its mean density is only 1.314 times that of water. The mean density of Earth is 5.245 times that of water.
If it takes Jupiter 3 hours to pass directly in front of a star, what is Jupiter's diameter? The diameter of Jupiter = its speed X its occultation time: Diameter= 13.1 km/s x 3 x 3600 seconds = 141500 km. In terms of Earth diameters: D (jupiter)= 141500 km. x (earth diameter/12800 km) = 11 earth diameters. Suppose Jupiter moves with an average orbital speed of 13.1 km/s.
Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is nearly 20,000 times as powerful as Earth's. Trapped within Jupiter's magnetosphere (the area in which magnetic field lines encircle the planet from pole to pole) are swarms of charged particles. Jovian Giant. The most massive planet in our solar system, with four planet-size moons and many smaller satellites, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about eighty times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.
What is the temperature of Jupiter's moon? Ganymede and Io have an average surface temperature of 110º K (-163.15º C), Europa's is 103 K (-171.15º C), and Callisto's is is 134º K (-139.15º C). Jupiter's temperature ranges from 112K (-161C or -258F) to 165K (-108C or -162F) so it is very very very very much colder than Earth.
It is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and water. Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly measured concentration is very low. 1 ^ The scale height sh is defined as sh = RT/(Mgj) , where R = 8.31 J/mol/K is the gas constant, M ≈ 0.0023 kg/mol is the average molar mass in the Jovian atmosphere, T is temperature and gj ≈ 25 m/s2 is the gravitational acceleration at the surface of Jupiter.
The question has several takes. First, Jupiter is made of 90% hydrogen and 10% helium, which are colorless. How on earth do we get to see a planet made of colorless material at all? It turn out that Jupiter does not have a real surface like that of Earth but has a visual surface. Its size is impressive: 2~3 times the whole Earth and it is there 24-7, year after year. No aircraft of human beings can survive that storm even for a second, let alone getting anywhere inside this gaseous planet. Jupiter 1, humans 0. We couldn’t even pierce a hole on Jupiter.
Besides hydrogen and helium, Jupiter has trace amount of ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide. It is these trace molecules that play with the light and make a visual surface on Jupiter. Under sunlight, ammonium hydrosulfide produces sulfur, which has color. Its size is impressive: 2~3 times the whole Earth and it is there 24-7, year after year. No aircraft of human beings can survive that storm even for a second, let alone getting anywhere inside this gaseous planet. Jupiter 1, humans 0. We couldn’t even pierce a hol
