A zygote is a cell formed by two gametes after fertilization. A zygote is the initial cell formed when two gamete cells are joined by means of sexual reproduction. In multicellular organisms, it is the earliest developmental stage of the embryo. In single-celled organisms, the zygote divides to produce offspring, usually through meiosis.
Zygote is the diploid cell that results from the fertilization between an egg and a sperm. In mammals, the sperm (male gamete) fertilizes the egg (ovum, the female gamete) and the fertilized egg is called a zygote.
Zygote: The cell formed by the union of a male sex cell (a sperm) and a female sex cell (an ovum). The zygote develops into the embryo following the instruction encoded in its genetic material, the DNA. The unification of a sperm and an ovum to form a zygote constitutes fertilization.
zygote. the cell resulting from union of a male and a female gamete; the fertilized ovum (see also reproduction). More precisely, the cell after synapsis at the completion of fertilization until first cleavage. adj., adj zygotÂ´ic. Development of the zygote.
10 most extreme places on Earth. A zygote is a single cell which has formed as the result of the merging of an egg cell and a sperm cell. In other words, it's a fertilized egg, with the potential to develop into a living organism.
A zygote is a fertilized egg/a conceptus. == ==. A zygote is the resulting single cell that is formed from the fertilization of a sperm and an ovum. After several divisions, it implants in the uterus. It keeps dividing, producing more cells and passes through the stages of embryo and fetus.
