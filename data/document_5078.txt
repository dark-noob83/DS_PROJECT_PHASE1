Best Answer: Tifton 44 is the best of several thousand F1 hybrid bermudagrasses screened for winter hardiness at the Georgia Mountain Experiment Station, Blairsville, GA. It is a cross between Coastal bermuda and a bermudagrass collected in Berlin, Germany in 1966. Tifton 44 is the most winter hardy of the Tifton hybrid bermudagrasses, thanks to its Berlin parent that will survive in Michigan. Tifton 44 bermudagrass is a fine stemmed F1 hybrid that must be propagated vegetatively.
Midland bermudagrass is a winter-hardy hybrid (Coastal x a winter-hardy Indiana common) best adapted to the upper Piedmont and Mountain regions. Midland is similar to Coastal in yield, growth habit and forage quality.
Coastal bermuda and bermuda grass are common names frequently used for the same lawn and livestock forage grass species, Cynodon dactylon.
Tifton 85 bermudagrass is the best grass for the Coastal bermudagrass belt. Compared with Tifton 78 in duplicate two-acre pastures fertilized annually with 225 lb/A of N in a 4-1-2 (N-P205-K20) ratio fertilizer split-applied in March, June and August, Tifton 85 produced 47% more LWG/A/yr.
Overview. Coastal Bermuda grass was created in 1943. It is a hybrid grass that is now used around the world as both a forage grass as well as a lawn grass. Coastal Bermuda does not produce viable seeds, so it must be propagated through sprigs or tufts of exiting Bermuda.
Coastal, an F 1 hybrid of Tift common bermuda and a bermudagrass introduced from Asia, was released more than 55 years ago and has been established for hay and grazing on approximately 15 million acres in the southern United States. In Georgia, Coastal is best adapted to the Coastal Plain and lower Piedmont areas.
