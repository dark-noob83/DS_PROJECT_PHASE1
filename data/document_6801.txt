Our 200-pound male at 15% body fat and a BMR of 2073 calories per day uses a total of 3420 calories on an average day. When planning a zig-zag diet program for this client, this would be your starting daily caloric mark, and you would zig-zag up and down from this number. Example: Using the same 200 pound male with a daily BMR of 2073 calories per day, we determine that he is mostly sedentary during the day with the exception of some jogging and about 40 minutes of weight training. This would put him in the activity category of 1.65, or 165% of his BMR.
Still, if you do manage to use your mouse energetically enough, at a rate of 1.4 calories a click you can burn off a Big Mac in 350,000 presses. Get clicking!

Based on a typical index finger having a volume of 10.8 cubic centimeters and weight of 11.7 grams, it it should require 16.7 micromoles of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate, the molecule that transports energy in cells) to move one gram of the body for one second.

Because 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound (0.45 kilogram) of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose 1 pound. So if you cut 500 calories from your diet each day, you'd lose about 1 pound a week (500 calories x 7 days = 3,500 calories). 
Remember that there are 2500 calories in a pound of muscle and 3500 calories in a pound of fat. For a client to gain one pound of muscle per week, you need to make sure that every seven days they have consumed 2500 calories (average of 350 calories per day) more than they expended. Example: Using the same 200 pound male with a daily BMR of 2073 calories per day, we determine that he is mostly sedentary during the day with the exception of some jogging and about 40 minutes of weight training. This would put him in the activity category of 1.65, or 165% of his BMR.
Converting that quantity of ATP into burned calories for the whole finger—there are 7.3 calories in one mole of ATP energy—a single mouse click should, in theory, burn 1.42 calories. Dammit.

Everyone needs a different amount of calories, depending on their height,weight and activity level. Well around 1500-2000. It only depends on how active you are maybe a 13 yea … r old need more then 2000. 6 people found this useful. The typical American male (5'9 1/2, 191 lbs) would need 2430 calories daily to survive or Maintain. To just stay alive, it really becomes a matter of how many calories below these numbers each day and how long the reduced calories are endured.
If an average mouse weighs 20 grams, the lb equivelant is 0.0440924524 lbs. An average 160 lb human male needs 2000 calories per day. So, caloric needs for mouse are more or less a ratio of these two. After the math, mouse ends up needing about 0.55 calories per day, although this value does not take into consideration mouse's higher metabolism and physical activity. It represents an estimate for basic metabolic needs. In reality, a mouse might require 1-5 or even more calories per day. This is just a raw estimate.
