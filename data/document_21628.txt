Main article: Brass. A brass is an alloy of copper with zinc. Brasses are usually yellow in color. The zinc content can vary between few % to about 40%; as long as it is kept under 15%, it does not markedly decrease corrosion resistance of copper. A bronze is an alloy of copper and other metals, most often tin, but also aluminium and silicon. 1  Aluminium bronzes are alloys of copper and aluminium. 2  Bell metal. 3  Phosphor bronze. 4  Nickel bronzes, e.g. nickel silver and cupronickel. 5  Speculum metal. 6  UNS C69100.
Many common metals are alloyed with copper to produce the various copper alloys. The most common alloying elements are aluminum, nickel, silicon, tin, and zinc. Other elements and metals are alloyed in small quantities to improve certain material characteristics, such as corrosion resistance or machinability. Gas-metal arc welding is used to join of the coppers and copper alloys for thickness less than 3 mm, while GMAW is preferred for section thickness above 3 mm and for the joining of aluminum bronzes, silicon bronzes and copper-nickel alloys. Plasma Arc Welding.
The various types of copper alloys are identified and guidance is given on processes and techniques which can be used in fabricating copper alloy components with a view to maintaining their corrosion or mechanical properties whilst avoiding the introduction of defects into the welds. There are essentially two types of aluminium bronzes; single phase alloys containing between 5 to 10% aluminium, with a small amount of iron or nickel, and more complex, two phase alloys containing up to 12% aluminium and about 5%of iron with specific alloys also containing nickel, manganese and silicon.
Share. Brass is any alloy consisting primarily of copper, usually with zinc. In some cases, copper with tin is considered a type of brass, although this metal historically has been called bronze. This is a list of common brass alloys, their chemical compositions and the uses of the different types of brass. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.
1 Bronze is an alloy of copper and usually tin as the main additive that is much harder and more brittle than brass. 2  The term “bronze” is sometimes used interchangeably for different types of copper alloys, but the most common typically refers to a mix of about 90% copper and 10% tin in its “pure” form. Copper, brass, and bronze alloys are non-ferrous metals with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity as well as good corrosion resistance, ductility, and strength. 1  Copper is a reddish orange, soft, and malleable (low hardness) metal that is a good conductor of heat and electricity

Brass is the generic term for a range of copper-zinc alloys with differing combinations of properties, including strength, machinability, ductility, wear-resistance, hardness, colour, antimicrobial, electrical and thermal conductivity, and corrosion-resistance.

Gunmetals are alloys of copper with tin, zinc and lead and have been used for at least 2000 years due to their ease of casting and good strength and corrosion resistance. Read more.
