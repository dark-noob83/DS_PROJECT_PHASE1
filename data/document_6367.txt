Speaking roughly, normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are in the range of 0.4 to 4.0 mIU/L. However, each laboratory and test manufacturer identifies its own normal TSH range. This is based on the test, the equipment being used, and the patients being tested. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has proposed a range of 0.3 to 3.0 for normal TSH levels.
Results. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems. The normal values listed here-called a reference range-are just a guide. These ranges vary from lab to lab, and your lab may have a different range for what's normal.
Normal values range from 0.4 - 4.0 milli-international units per liter (mIU/L). Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.
I hadn’t known that, while they are “normal lab values” for blood tests, there are also “FUNCTIONAL” or “OPTIMAL” values which actually tell you far more about your thyroid. My TSH, T3, T4 and other basic thyroid levels have ALWAYS been in the “normal” range.
The range for normal values is 100 to 200 nanograms per deciliter, according to Medline Plus. Greater-than-normal values may be due to hyperthyroidism, thyroid cancer or high levels of a protein that carries T3 in the blood. Lower-than-normal values may indicate hypothyroidism, starvation or a long illness.
