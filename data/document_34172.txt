Glycolysis. Cells use oxygen to assist in cellular respiration. This type of respiration, called aerobic cellular respiration, converts stored energy into a usable form. The first stage of aerobic cellular respiration, glycolysis, can be performed without oxygen.
Aerobic Respiration Equation. Respiration is the process through which the cells of our body produce the energy that is required for performing many important tasks. Each cell of our body utilizes the food we eat by respiration to break down the glucose present in the food into usable energy.
Cellular respiration. Molecular oxygen, O2, is essential for cellular respiration in all aerobic organisms. Oxygen is used as an electron acceptor in mitochondria to generate chemical energy.

Respiration is a series of reactions in which energy is released from glucose glucose: A simple sugar made by the body from food, which is used by cells to make energy in respiration. Aerobic respiration is the form of respiration which uses oxygen. It can be summarised by this equation:
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells get their energy in the form of ATP. There are two types of cellular respiration, aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic respiration is more efficient and can be utilized in the presence of oxygen, while anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen.
Respiration releases energy for cells from glucose. This can be aerobic respiration, which needs oxygen, or anaerobic respiration, which does not. During exercise, the breathing rate and heart rate increase.
