The analog stick will be set into place. Use your thumb to test the directional movement. Place the circuit board face-down into the front panel of the controller and make sure each analog stick is in its appropriate slot. Use a Philips-head screw driver to reattach the circuit board to the front panel. Insert the battery into the plastic battery casing on the top of the circuit board.
Place your thumb between the two analog sticks on the bottom of the controller and put your index finger on the opposite end. Gently push in between the back and front panel and use light pressure to lift and remove the back panel. Remove the battery from the circuit board and place it to the side of the controller.
This is also happening to a PS2 controller too. ---. This is a signature. Try turning the controller off and turning it on again, when you do make sure that the analog isn't being pushed in any direction (I understand that it messes with the calibration of the controller or something). If that doesn't work, it may be signs of the controller dying.
