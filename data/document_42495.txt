RCV stands for Replacement Cost Value. RCV is the current retail cost to replace your damaged items. ACV is the Actual Cost Value. For example, assume a roof in year 10 of an expected 20 year life is totaled by hail. The cost to replace the roof is $10,000 Then RCV would be 10,000 and the ACV would be $5,000 (10/20th of $10,000). The difference between the two, $5,000, is the depreciation which is additional funds you will receive. Generally depreciation is paid after you submit a final invoice. 
With ACV, your insurer pays to repair or replace your roof, less your deductible and depreciation for the age and type of roof. With RCV, however, the insurer pays all costs to make your roof whole again without factoring in depreciation, once you've met your deductible.

If the roof is 10 years old at the time of your loss and it requires replacement, we would subtract 40% depreciation (10 years x 4% a year) from your replacement cost estimate to determine the ACV of your roof. Please keep in mind that the condition of an item may also factor into the depreciation calculation. If you purchase a replacement laptop for $900 and submit a request for the recoverable depreciation, Travelers will reimburse you $300 – the difference between the ACV of your previous laptop ($600) and the cost of your new one ($900).
If a storm destroys it and you have actual cash value roof coverage that depreciates the roof's value by $1,000 per year, your out-of-pocket share of the cost for a new roof would be $11,000 (comprised of the $1,000 deductible plus $10,000 for the depreciation). If you look at a company like Allstate, they have all these homeowners who have gotten three $20,000 roof replacements in three years. That's not a sustainable business model when they're charging you $1,100 a year for home insurance, he says.
