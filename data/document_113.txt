I did a quick search and it appears that your strut replacement would be very similar to the two replacements I did on our Subarus at home. Here's a very rough estimate of how I would expect the parts to break down: 1  Struts (rears only): about $180 to $200. 2  Tops and bumpstops: between $0 and $100 (if you bought an all-in-one strut, you don't need these).
Our recommendation: It is a good idea to replace the strut assemblies every 35,000 miles. You can easily find out if you need new struts by doing a bounce test. Go to the front corner of your car and push down on the front of the car. If your car bounces up and down a few times, it is time to change the strut assembly. 1 Struts are replaced in pairs (front or rear). 2  You may need to take the car to a shop for wheel alignment after this service. 3  A mobile mechanic does not have the machine to align the wheels.
1 Shock absorbers or struts can cost $25-$350 or more each, depending on the make and model of vehicle and the quality of the part. 2  Although it could cost as much as $1,400 for a set of four, most do-it-yourselfers spend an average of $150-$250 to replace four shocks/struts. Bought rear shocks OEM from Toyota cost $112 but the bushings nuts bolts rubber spacers cost another $100 in parts almost more than the shocks. The install was done by my friend at his house for $180 so the total job cost almost $400.
Parts: $155 - $304. The average cost for a strut/shock absorber replacement-front is between $315 to $507. Labor costs are estimated between $160 to $203 while parts are priced between $155 to $304. Get a personalized estimate based on your location and specific car
I can help a little here. The Autozone website shows that the struts cost $50 each for the front, $51 for the rear. If you want to replace the springs, they're $50 each. That â€¦ gives you at least some idea of parts cost. Labor, if you have the job done at the shop, will be another story. 
1 CostHelper readers report paying $250-$850 to have a repair shop replace four shocks, at an average cost of $561; or $700-$1,100 for four struts, at an average cost of $849. Bought rear shocks OEM from Toyota cost $112 but the bushings nuts bolts rubber spacers cost another $100 in parts almost more than the shocks. The install was done by my friend at his house for $180 so the total job cost almost $400.

The strut assembly, an essential part of your car's suspension system, is attached to the front wheels and is used to absorb road shock, providing a smooth ride. Most cars made after 1995 have shock absorbers in the rear and strut assemblies in the front suspension. 1 Struts are replaced in pairs (front or rear). 2  You may need to take the car to a shop for wheel alignment after this service. 3  A mobile mechanic does not have the machine to align the wheels.
