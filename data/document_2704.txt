E. coli is a subgroup of the fecal coliform group. Most E. coli bacteria are harmless and exist in the intestines of people and warm-blooded animals. However, some strains can cause illness. The presence of E. coli in a drinking water sample usually indicates recent fecal contamination. 
A fecal coliform (British: faecal coliform) is a facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, gram-negative, non-sporulating bacterium. Coliform bacteria generally originate in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. Fecal coliforms are capable of growth in the presence of bile salts or similar surface agents, are oxidase negative, and produce acid and gas from lactose within 48 hours at 44 ± 0.5°C.
Coliform is a rod-shaped bacteria which are always present in the digestive tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Coliforms are found in human and animal waste, and are also found in water, plants and soil. Fecal coliforms are the coliform that is found in the digestive tract of animals and humans, and is an indicator of fecal contamination. A high count of fecal coliforms is considered an accurate indicator of animal or human waste. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a major species of the fecal coliforms
Total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli. Total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli are all indicators of drinking water quality. The total coliform group is a large collection of different kinds of bacteria. Fecal coliforms are types of total coliform that mostly exist in feces. E. coli is a sub-group of fecal coliform
Fecal coliform bacteria are a sub-group of total coliform bacteria. They appear in great quantities in the intestines and feces of people and animals. The presence of these bacteria indicates that your well water is contaminated with feces or sewage, and it has the potential to cause disease. Escherichia coli is a sub-group of the fecal coliform group. These kinds of bacteria are found in great quantities in the intestines of people and warm-blooded animals. Some strains, however, can cause illness. Escherichia coli is a sub-group of the fecal coliform. group. These kinds of bacteria are found in great. quantities in the intestines of people and warm-. blooded animals. Some strains, however, can cause. illness. The presence of this organism indicates. fecal contamination of your well and a high risk for.
Coliforms are a broad class of bacteria found in our environment, including the feces of man and other warm-blooded animals. The presence of coliform bacteria in drinking water may indicate a possible presence of harmful, disease-causing organisms. Why use coliforms to indicate water quality? 
Coliform Bacteria are a group of microorganisms commonly found in soil, surface water, and on plants. They are also present in the intestines of animals and humans. Coliform bacteria that are washed into the ground by rain are usually filtered out as the water goes through the soil and into groundwater systems. Escherichia coli is a sub-group of the fecal coliform. group. These kinds of bacteria are found in great. quantities in the intestines of people and warm-. blooded animals. Some strains, however, can cause. illness. The presence of this organism indicates. fecal contamination of your well and a high risk for.
Coliform bacteria are often referred to as “indicator organisms” because they indicate the potential presence of disease-causing bacteria in water. The presence of coliform bacteria in water does not guarantee that drinking the water will cause an illness. Rather, their presence indicates that a contamination pathway exists between a source of bacteria (surface water, septic system, animal waste, etc.) and the water supply.
Coliform bacteria are a commonly used bacterial indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water. They are defined as rod-shaped Gram-negative non-spore forming and motile or non-motile bacteria which can ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas when incubated at 35–37°C. Escherichia coli (E. coli) , a rod-shaped member of the coliform group, can be distinguished from most other coliforms by its ability to ferment lactose at 44°C in the fecal coliform test, and by its growth and color reaction on certain types of culture media.
