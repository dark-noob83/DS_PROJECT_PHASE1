CTH is a software system under development at Sandia National Laboratories Albuquerque to model multidimensional, multi-material, large deformation, strong shock wave physics. Special emphasis will be placed on the features that are novel to CTH or are not direct generalizations of two-dimensional models. Another paper by Trucano and McGlaun (1989) describes several hypervelocity impact calculations using CTH.

CTH Release Information. CTH is undergoing continual development at Sandia, but a new release version is distributed externally about once every year. New or upgrade requests during our development cycle will receive the current distribution code, not the most current internal version. Our current release of CTH is Version 11.1. CTH is influenced greatly by its predecessor codes, CHARTD, a one-dimensional hydrocode written by Sam Thompson in 1972 and CSQ, written by Sam in 1975. Development on CTH started in the late 1980's and continues to the present day.
CTH has been carefully designed to minimize the dispersion present in Eulerian codes. It has a high-resolution interface tracker that prevents breakup and distortion of material interfaces. Special emphasis will be placed on the features that are novel to CTH or are not direct generalizations of two-dimensional models. Another paper by Trucano and McGlaun (1989) describes several hypervelocity impact calculations using CTH.

CTH Shock Physics. CTH is a multi-material, large deformation, strong shock wave, solid mechanics code developed at Sandia National Laboratories. It has models for multi-phase, elastic, viscoplastic, porous and explosive materials. Please see Licensing for more information.
