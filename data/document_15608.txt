Qualifying Child. A dependent must be either a qualifying child or qualifying relative.. Only qualifying children have an age test. A qualifying child must be under 19 at the end of the year. If your child is a full-time student, you can claim an exemption until she's 24 years old. If she becomes permanently and totally disabled, you can potentially claim her as a dependent at any age.
As long as your child's income doesn't exceed the amount you spent on support, and meets the other tests, you can claim the child as a dependent, says Terry Durkin, an enrolled agent in Burlington, Mass. For example, suppose your daughter graduated from college in May, found a job in September and earned $20,000.
In addition to meeting the qualifying child or qualifying relative test, you may claim a dependency exemption for your child as long as all of the following tests are met: 1  Dependent taxpayer test. 2  Citizen or resident test, and. 3  Joint return test.
When you claim a Qualifying Child (or a Qualifying Relative) as a dependent, you can claim a special kind of tax deduction called an exemption. An exemption is like a tax deduction, but an exemption is subtracted from your adjusted gross income before your taxable income is calculated.
As long as the amount you spent on her support exceeded $20,000, you can claim her as a dependent, Durkin says. However, if you claim your child as a dependent, she can't claim a personal exemption on her own tax return.
