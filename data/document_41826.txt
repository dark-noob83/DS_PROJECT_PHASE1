As with oceanic-continental convergence, when two oceanic plates converge, one is usually subducted under the other, and in the process a trench is formed. The Marianas Trench (paralleling the Mariana Islands), for example, marks where the fast-moving Pacific Plate converges against the slower moving Philippine Plate.
The continental plate is less dense that the oceanic plate and so sinks underneath the oceanic plate. The oceanic plate holds water and so when the continental plate sinks und â€¦ erneath it, the water from the oceanic plate covers the continental plate.
In a contest between a dense oceanic plate and a less dense, buoyant continental plate, you know that its the dense oceanic plate that sinks.
Where two tectonic plates meet at a subduction zone, one bends and slides underneath the other, curving down into the mantle. (The mantle is the hotter layer under the crust.). Tectonic plates can transport both continental crust and oceanic crust, or they may be made of only one kind of crust. Oceanic crust is denser than continental crust. At a subduction zone, the oceanic crust usually sinks into the mantle beneath lighter
Subduction zone volcanism occurs where two plates are converging on one another. One plate containing oceanic lithosphere descends beneath the adjacent plate, thus consuming the oceanic lithosphere into the earth's mantle. This on-going process is called subduction.
Answer by Amiewhitlock. Confidence votes 315. When an oceanic plate and a continental plate collide, the oceanic plate is always subducted. Oceanic plates are denser than continental plates, and they have a higher iron content. Since they are denser, oceanic plates always sink below the continental plate in the event of a collision.
The Oceanic plate is subducted under the Continental plate because oceanic crust is much more dense than continental crust. The average density of the oceanic crust is 3g/cm^3 while the average density of continental crust is 2.7g/cm^3.
