Salmon aquaculture, or salmon farming as it’s often called, involves raising salmon from “egg to market”. The salmon are born and nurtured in freshwater hatcheries for one year and then sent to saltwater farm sites to continue growing. A farm is made up of a series of steel cages with nets that contain the fish.

Salmon consumption worldwide is three times higher than it was in 1980. What was once a luxury food is among the most popular fish species in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Salmon aquaculture is the fastest growing food production system in the world—accounting for 70 percent (2.4 million metric tons) of the market.
Salmon farming is a type of aquaculture where the fish are grown in net cages, typically located in sheltered bays and fjords along the coast. Salmon are hatched in brood hatcheries and grown in freshwater until they are large enough to transfer to marine pens.
