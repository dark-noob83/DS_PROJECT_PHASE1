saudi billionaire businessman prince alwaleed bin talal told me we will not see $ 100 a barrel oil again the plunge in oil prices has been one of the biggest stories of the year and while cheap gasoline is good for consumers the negative impact of a 50 % decline in oil has been wide and deep especially for major oil producers such as saudi arabia and russia a if supply stays where it is and demand remains weak you better believe it is gonna go down more but if some supply is taken off the market and there s some growth in demand prices may go up but i m sure we re never going to see $ 100 anymore i said a year ago the price of oil above $ 100 is artificial
from 2010 until mid 2014 world oil prices had been fairly stable at around $ 110 a barrel but since june prices have more than halved brent crude oil has now dipped below $ 50 a barrel for the first time since may 2009 and us crude is down to below $ 48 a barrel the reasons for this change are twofold weak demand in many countries due to insipid economic growth coupled with surging us production
oil is cheap but it could still be cheaper everybody s talking about how oil prices have crashed from more than $ 100 a barrel to less than $ 50 a barrel in just a few months this has been great for american drivers pushing gasoline prices down to less than $ 2 a gallon around the country but some perspective is in order $ 50 a barrel for oil is still kind of high compared to what it has cost in the past especially when you adjust for inflation as the washington post s steven mufson pointed out oil still costs a lot more than its average price from 1986 to 2004
from the mid 1980s to september 2003 the inflation adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on nymex was generally under $ 25 barrel then during 2004 the price rose above $ 40 and then $ 50 this article is a chronology of events affecting the oil market for a discussion of the energy crisis of the same period see 2000s energy crisis and effects of 2000s energy crisis for current fuel prices see gasoline usage and pricing
unless the price of oil tops $ 73 a barrel producers in divide county can t break even for years that s hardly been a problem with oil consistently trading for more than $ 100 a barrel as of mid january however us crude is below $ 50 a barrel 
the oil price has fallen by more than 40 % since june when it was $ 115 a barrel it is now below $ 70 this comes after nearly five years of stability saudi arabia can tolerate lower oil prices quite easily it has $ 900 billion in reserves its own oil costs very little around $ 5 6 per barrel to get out of the ground the main effect of this is on the riskiest and most vulnerable bits of the oil industry

corrections in an earlier version of this article we said that the oil price has fallen from $ 115 a barrel in mid july we should have said mid june this was corrected on october 23rd 2014 we also said that a $ 20 drop in the world oil price reduces american producers profits by 20 % china is the world s second largest net importer of oil based on 2013 figures every $ 1 drop in the oil price saves it an annual $ 2 1 billion the recent fall if sustained lowers its import bill by $ 60 billion or 3 % most of its exports are manufactured goods whose prices have not fallen
