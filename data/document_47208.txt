Scansion of Latin Poetry. Latin, like may other classical languages, uses quantitative meter for its verse. This means that unlike English, where the accent of a given syllable determines its value in verse, a Latin syllable's value is determined by the length of time it takes to say it.
Scansion is the process of marking the stresses in a poem, and working out the metre from the distribution of stresses. The verb is to scan. 'Mark' can be taken to mean both 'notice' and 'annotate', the latter often done with a u for an unstressed syllable and a slash, / , for a stressed one.
Feet, Meter, and Scansion. We describe a line of poetry with a two-word naming system, kind of like we use for cars and other objects. corn bread. make model what it s what it type of number of. made from is feet feet.

Rhythm, Meter, and Scansion Made Easy. I created this page as a quick reference for my students when studying rhythm. The sources I cited below were very helpful, especially X.J. Kennedy's book. rhythm: the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line. meter: the number of feet in a line. scansion: Describing the rhythms of poetry by dividing the lines into feet, marking the locations of stressed and unstressed syllables, and counting the syllables.
Poetry has a unique music that sets it apart from other kinds of writing. It's fairly easy to hear this music when a poem rhymes, but the sounds of poetry don't depend on rhyme alone. Traditionally, a poem has what is called meter, a certain pattern of weak and strong syllables.
A system of scansion is a way to mark the metrical patterns of a line of poetry. In classical poetry, these patterns are based on the different lengths of each vowel sound, and in English poetry, they are based on the different stresses placed on each syllable. In both cases, the meter often has a regular foot.
