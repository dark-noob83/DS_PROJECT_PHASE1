Such a feat would leave in the dust the world's fastest runner, Usain Bolt, who has clocked nearly 28 mph in the 100-meter sprint. The new findings come after researchers took a new look at the factors that limit human speed.

Use a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to run a mile. Once you have an exact time-whether it's 8 minutes or 16 minutes-you can work on improving it! 1  This is where running on a track comes in handy, as each 400M lap of the track is equal to 1/4 of a mile, so four laps of the track is equal to one mile.

Below, I have taken several men's and women's world records and calculated the runners' average speed. Usain Bolt has averaged over 23 miles per hour in both the 100 and 200 meter events. It's interesting to note that the 60 meter race has a slower average speed for both men and women than the 100 meter race.
Small decrease, but in competitive track and field, it’s a big difference. And just for anyone still unimpressed, that time would translate to 10.6 meters per second, or an average of 23.7 miles per hour. The one thing even more interesting about Bolt isn’t how much energy he produces, but how much he wastes. Noone at this time can run the 100 meter dash as fast as Bolt.I heard he can hit 30m.p.h. in sprints.Anything under 10 seconds in the 100 meter is incredibly fast.

Men at the gym typically have their treadmill set to about 7 miles per hour, or 8:30 minutes per mile. They can probably run faster if they try, maybe 8.5 miles per hour if they pushed it. Very few gymrats can run 9 miles per hour, 10 miles per hour is much harder. The gymrats are usually in better shape than average couch potato: the average man probably can't run a mile at all, or possibly an 11-12 minute mile. 30% of the US is obese (30+ pounds overweight) . 200,000+ people a year are so overweight that they have surgery to shrink their stomachs.
