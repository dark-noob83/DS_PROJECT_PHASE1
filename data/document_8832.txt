These systems have a conversion efficiency of 15 to 35 percent depending on system size and operating parameters. A steam CHP system can reach system efficiency of up to 85 percent. Installed costs range from $1,700 to $3,500 per kW and typ-ically produce energy at a cost of $0.06 to $0.20 per kWh.
Example 2. Calculate the annual cost savings and payback period for a CHP unit to be installed in a Nursing home. Compare energy savings with using an oil-fired heating system. CHP heating output = 44 kW. CHP electrical output = 20 kW.
For a 250,000 kWe global installed capacity in one year, 25-kWe SOFC systems are 39% of the cost of 5-kWe systems ($828/kWe vs. $2,142/kWe). This analysis implicitly assumes that the FCS electricity and heat will be used with 100% utilization in the buildings that they serve, regardless of system size.
For example, for a 10,000 kWe global installed capacity in one year, 100-kWe SOFC systems are 13% of the cost of 1-kWe systems ($836/kWe vs. $6,157/kWe). For a 50,000 kWe global installed capacity in one year, 5-kWe SOFC systems are 41% of the cost of 1-kWe systems ($2,312/kWe vs. $5,651/kWe).
If a domestic CHP system is to be installed in a new house, calculate the annual cost savings and payback period for the equipment. Compare energy savings with using an oil-fired heating system. CHP heating output = 12 kW. CHP electrical output = 5.5 kW.
Microturbine capital costs range from $700-$1,100/kW. These costs include all hardware, associated manuals, software, and initial training. Adding heat recovery increases the cost by $75-$350/kW. Installation costs vary significantly by location but generally add 30-50% to the total installed cost.
2 MW CHP operating at 10k Btu/kWh for 8,322 hrs/yr with 5 MMBtu/hr recoverable, capital cost of $2,000/kW, O&M cost of $0.011/kWh, and given U.S. average gas prices of $9.78/MMBtu and electricity prices of 10.12 cents/kWh.
The installed capital cost of a gas turbine cogeneration system varies between $800-$1,800/kWh. This is due to large variations in turbine size from a few kW to many hundred of MW. The O&M costs range from $0.3c-$1.0 c/kWh.
(See graph at right.)4. Given average system of 2 MW with $1,500â€“$2,000/kW installed cost, and national U.S. energy prices. (See graph at right.) Shown here are natural gas and electricity prices needed to achieve three-, five-, and 10-year simple paybacks for a 2 MW CHP system.
