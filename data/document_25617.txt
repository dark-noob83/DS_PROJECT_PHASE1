Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price.

If your contractor has a 1.50 markup (which is reasonable for a remodeling contractor), that means that if the estimated cost for a job is $10,000, they'll multiply the $10,000 x 1.50 and arrive at a $15,000 sales price. The typical remodeling contractor will have overhead expenses ranging from 25% to 54% of their revenue â€“ that means every $15,000 job could have overhead expenses of $3,750 to $8,100.
