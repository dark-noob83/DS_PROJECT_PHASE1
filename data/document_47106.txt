King cobra. King cobras are the longest of all the venomous snakes. Lengths of up to five metres are not unheard of, although, a mere three metres is more realistic. Preying on other reptiles-particularly other snakes-king cobras have a rapid, deadly strike. The venom isn't as strong as some snakes, but enough is produced in a single bite to kill a fully grown elephant. When threatened, a hypnotic display sees the king cobra raise itself up, growl and extend its hood.
