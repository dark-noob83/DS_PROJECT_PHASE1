Copper is soft and easily bent and so is a good conductor of electricity, which makes it useful for wiring. Copper is also a good conductor of heat and it does not react with water. This makes it useful for plumbing, and making pipes and tanks.

Copper itself is a conductor, and copper wire is the same thing, just in a wire form. Copper wire is used as an electric conductor, because it can conduct electricity easily b … eing copper, and it's properties. Copper is often used in wiring, such as different appliances that require being plugged in.
It is due to the availablity of free electrons. All metals such as Copper can be considered as atomic nuclei surrounded by a sea of electrons which are free to move around … with little resistance, which makes all metals good conductors of electricity (and heat, incidentally).

Thermal conductor. Copper is a good conductor of heat. This means that if you heat one end of a piece of copper, the other end will quickly reach the same temperature. Most metals are pretty good conductors; however, apart from silver, copper is the best.
Copper (II) sulfate solution is a good conductor of electricity as the copper (II) ions and the sulfate ions are free moving in the solvent. So, there are free moving ions to … carry the charge from one end to another.
