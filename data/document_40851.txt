The Procedures allow the surveillance of Americans by failing to ensure that the NSA's surveillance targets are in fact foreigners outside the United States. The Act is predicated on the theory that foreigners abroad have no right to privacy—or, at any rate, no right that the United States should respect.
They don't give us our rights. Our rights are ours. Anyone who would take away our freedoms and liberties is committing treason to the Constitution and is an enemy of the people and an enemy of our nation. The people are the fourth branch of government and superior to all other branches.
In a June statement to Congress regarding U.S. surveillance programs, Keith B. Alexander, head of the NSA as well as U.S. Cyber Command, stated the utilization of both PRISM and the NSA’s upstream data collection systems were crucial to thwarting over 50 potential terrorist threats across the world since 9/11.
One step at a time. I believe that the government is slowly taking away our rights. Human rights and constitutional rights. They are becoming more and more strict about guns (second amendment), they have put restrictions on the first amendment (freedom of speech. Etc..), and they are becoming more and more controlling.
The media is morphing the truth. It's not like the government would just take away our rights for fun. They are trying to protect US citizens and I am ok with them doing whatever. If you actually look at the facts, 0 people have been arrested for what the NSA has illegally seen.
Critics of the law feared the NSA would use the law to conduct broad surveillance of Americans' international communications and, in the process, capture an unknown quantity of purely domestic communications.
