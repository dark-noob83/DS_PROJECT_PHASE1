Energy efficiency – doing more with less energy – benefits you, your country, and the world. The benefits of energy efficiency are numerous. But the top five reasons that people, companies and governments choose to use energy more efficiently are: 1  Energy efficiency saves you money. 2  Energy efficiency improves the economy. 3  Energy efficiency is good for the environment. 4  Energy efficiency improves national security. 5  Energy efficiency enhances quality of life.
All of that energy adds up, and much of it is wasted by using too much or not using it wisely. Energy isn't free. The grown-ups in your house pay for the all the electricity you use. So wasting energy is the same as wasting money-and we know that's not a good idea! Wasting energy isn't good for the environment either.
Energy efficiency also means using less energy-but this term means using products that don't waste energy. For example, the ordinary light bulbs you might use at home waste almost all of the energy they use-most of the electricity turns into heat.
