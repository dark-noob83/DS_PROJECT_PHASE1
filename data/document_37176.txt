Serotonin syndrome is the most common presentation of serotonin toxicity. It is caused by the abnormal increase in serotonin transmission following an overdose of a serotonin drugs or the combination of multiple drugs that act on the serotonin pathway.
1 A. The serotonin syndrome is a disorder that can be caused by use of drugs or combinations of drugs which increase serotonin availability. 2  It most often occurs when two or more drugs which increase serotonin availability by different mechanisms are used simultaneously.
Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur when you first start or increase the medicine. Older antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can also cause serotonin syndrome with the medicines described above, as well as meperidine (Demerol, a painkiller) or dextromethorphan (cough medicine).
Serotonin syndrome is a potentially lethal condition caused by too much serotonin in the body. The cause of serotonin syndrome is typically a drug combination. When taken alone, each drug may raise serotonin by a small amount, but when taken together a medication cocktail can cause serotonin syndrome.
Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life threatening drug reaction that causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by nerve cells.

Serotonin syndrome most often occurs when two drugs that affect the body's level of serotonin are taken together at the same time. The drugs cause too much serotonin to be released or to remain in the brain area.
Serotonin syndrome is a potentially serious drug interaction that occurs when too much serotonin builds up in your body. Serotonin is a chemical normally produced by the nerve cells and helps regulate digestion, blood flow, body temperature, and breathing.
Serotonin syndrome can occur if you are taking medications, particularly antidepressants, that affect the body's level of serotonin. The greatest risk of serotonin syndrome occurs if you are taking two or more drugs and/or supplements together that influence serotonin. The condition is more likely to occur when you first start a medicine or increase the dose.
