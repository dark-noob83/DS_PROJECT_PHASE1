A relatively new discipline, biomedical engineering involves research and development that combine medical and biological sciences for the advancement of all healthcare disciplines. It is a growing and evolving career field and according to CNNMoney.com, is the #1 Best Job for 2012 in America. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the average annual salary earned by a biomedical engineer was $81,450. PayScale.com lists the median pay at $79,500, while the top of the salary range is at $124,000. Median pay is for 5-7 years experience in the field. Top pay comes with the 90th percentile.
The high school classes that a person can take to become a  biomedical engineer are science and mathematics courses. These are  courses that will prepare you for the undergr â€¦ aduate degree in this  field. Classes that you may need to take for a bachelor's in  biomedical engineering are advanced mathematics, chemistry,  biochemistry, molecular biology, and mechanics.
Because the career range of biomedical engineers varies, the time it takes to become one also will vary, but generally you'll need a minimum of four years to complete the basic requirements for becoming a biomedical engineer. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of May 2009 the median annual salary of a biomedical engineer in the United States was $78,860. The lowest 10 percent had an annual salary of $49,480, and the highest 10 percent had an annual salary of $123,270.

Best Answer: A bachelors degree in engineering can take between four and six years for an average student, depending on the school and how many courses the student takes per semester or quarter. Most engineers only have a bachelors degree, though some go on to graduate school which is an addition two years for most. 
Answers. Best Answer: If you're talking about the entire college path, then it would be something like this: B.S. degree: 4-5 years. Most people take more than 4 yrs to get any engineering degree M.S. degree: 2 years Ph.D. degree: 1-3 years. This varies due to the nature of PhD research and thesis. It depends how long it takes for you to select a project and of course how long it takes to complete the project you select
