Causes of Gas Gangrene. Gas gangrene is caused by bacteria called Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) . In some cases, it can be caused by Group A Streptococcus. Gas gangrene generally occurs at a recent surgical or injury site. Rarely, it happens spontaneously, without apparent cause.
Gas gangrene is most often caused by a bacterium called Clostridium perfringens. It also can be caused by group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio vulnificus.
Gas gangrene is commonly caused by infection with the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, which develops in an injury or surgical wound that's depleted of blood supply. The bacterial infection produces toxins that release gas — hence the name gas gangrene — and cause tissue death.
Causes. Gas gangrene is most often caused by a bacterium called Clostridium perfringens. It also can be caused by group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio vulnificus. Clostridium is found nearly everywhere.
A. Gangrene is a condition that occurs when body tissue dies. It is caused by a loss of blood supply due to an underlying illness, injury, and/or infection. Fingers, toes, and limbs are most often affected, but gangrene can also occur inside the body, damaging organs and muscles.
Causes. Gas gangrene is most often caused by a bacterium called Clostridium perfringens. It also can be caused by group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio vulnificus. Clostridium is found nearly everywhere. As the bacteria grow inside the body, it makes gas and harmful substances (toxins) that can damage body tissues, cells, and blood vessels. Gas gangrene develops suddenly. It usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent surgical wound.
