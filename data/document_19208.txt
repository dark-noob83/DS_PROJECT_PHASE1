S. epidermidis is a very hardy microorganism, consisting of nonmotile, Gram-positive cocci, arranged in grape-like clusters. It forms white, raised, cohesive colonies about 1–2 mm in diameter after overnight incubation, and is not hemolytic on blood agar.
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a Gram-positive coccus, nonpigmented, bacterium. This organism, usually 0.5 to 1.5 mm in diameter, is a normal inhabitant of the human skin that grows in clusters. Research studies reveal that S. epidermidis lives in close association with S. aureus, a very destructive pathogen.
Introduction. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a gram-positive, coagulase-negative cocci that is a part of our normal flora. Consequently, it is a true opportunistic pathogen, as it requires a major breach in the host’s innate defenses.
Description and significance. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a gram-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci (4). It typically lives on the human skin and mucosa and the most common infections on catheters and implants (5).
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a Gram-positive bacterium, and one of over 40 species belonging to the genus Staphylococcus. It is part of the normal human flora, typically the skin flora, and less commonly the mucosal flora.
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a perfectly round bacterium of the genus Staphylococcus and the family Staphylococcaceae that grows in clusters and usually lives on human skin. It was described by Rosenbach in 1884 and was originally named Staphylococcus albus.
