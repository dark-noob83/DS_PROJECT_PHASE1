The sparring already had started as to how the math would be done, given that the plaintiffs would receive time-and-a-half pay for the hours they worked. The starting base pay for Quicken mortgage bankers is $24,000 per year, with commissions on top of that based on how they meet criteria. The number of loans closed is part of the formula, but more complex loans are given a higher value. Customer service is also factored in.
I declined the offer for a much better salary & hours at Wells Fargo. But I get the feeling Quicken would be great place to cut your teeth if you have no degree, license, or experience in the mortgage game and want in.
