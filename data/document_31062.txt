Rice. Rice, the nation's major crop, was grown by about threequarters of all farm households in the early 1980s. Two main types were cultivated: dry, or upland, rice, grown predominantly in the North and Northeast; and wet rice, grown in irrigated fields throughout the central plain and in the South.
Rice Options. How to Grow Rice. There are different types of rice to consider: paddy rice, deep-water rice, rain-fed lowland rice and upland rice. Paddy rice growth is controlled by the farmer, whereas deep-water rice grows near river and other water banks and depends largely on the weather.
Rice comes in long-grain, medium-and short-grain textures. It grows easily in your backyard, in a garden bed or in buckets, given the right amount of soil, water, and other nutrients. Short-grain, medium-grain and long-grain rice thrive in wet conditions, specifically standing puddles of water or swamp-like conditions.
In addition to ecological types of rice, there are varieties that have a long, medium or short grain, and ones with different textures and flavors, including sweet (also called glutinous), aromatic and arborio rices.
Paddy rice grows where the farmer is able to control the water, pumping it in and out as needed over the growing season. Usually levees or berms (mounds of soil) are built around the growing area, which is kept flooded. Deep-water rice. This type grows near rivers and other bodies of water.
