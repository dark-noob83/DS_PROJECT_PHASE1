Intake Recommendations. If you have prediabetes, carbohydrates should comprise about 50 percent to 60 percent of your total daily caloric intake. Carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram. Based on a 2,000 calorie diet, this means you should consume approximately 1,000 to 1,200 calories from carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates are your body’s main source of energy, and should make up the largest percentage of your daily calorie intake. Since carbohydrates provide 4 calories per gram, it’s easy to calculate your carbohydrate needs using carb percentage recommendations.
The daily carb intake for male diabetics recommended by the American Diabetes Association varies between 135 and 180 grams for your three basic meals along with up to 60 to 90 grams of extra carbohydrates at snack time.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day.
