In fact, an alpha particle really is a nucleus-it's the same as the nucleus of a common atom of helium-but it doesn't have any electrons around it, and it's traveling very fast. Alpha particles are a type of ionizing radiation. To describe the production of alpha particles, we have to define radioactive decay.
Alpha radiation is a type of energy released when certain radioactive elements decay or break down. For example, uranium and thorium are two radioactive elements found naturally in the earth’s crust. Over billions of years, these two elements slowly change form and produce “decay products” such as radium and radon.
Alpha Particles. Alpha decay is a radioactive process in which a particle with two neutrons and two protons is ejected from the nucleus of a radioactive atom. The particle is identical to the nucleus of a helium atom. Alpha decay only occurs in very heavy elements such as uranium, thorium and radium.
Alpha radiation is another name for the alpha particles emitted in the type of radioactive decay called alpha decay.
alpha particle. A positively charged particle that consists of two protons and two neutrons bound together. It is emitted by the nucleus of some elements undergoing radioactive decay and is identical to the nucleus of a helium atom. Alpha particles are the slowest and least penetrating forms of nuclear radiation.
The radiation one typically encounters is one of four types: alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, and x radiation. Neutron radiation is also encountered in nuclear power plants and high-altitude flight and emitted from some industrial radioactive sources.
