Example: If you have a wall that is ten feet in length then you need enough carpet to effectively cover 12 feet (10 + 20% = 12) - If your carpet rolls are 8 feet in width, then you will need 1 full roll, and a second cut to a width of 4 feet. You need to purchase 10% more material than needed when using a single roll, and 20% when using multiple rolls, to account for trimming and seaming. Carpet Cost: Average $12 - $20 per sq yard.
