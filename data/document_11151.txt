These 11 viscosity grades are 0W, 5W, 10W, 15W, 20W, 25W, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60, These numbers referring to the 'weight' of a motor oil. For some applications which do not have a wide temperature range, single-grade motor oil is most satisfactory.
VISCOSITY. Most oils on the shelves today are Multigrades, which simply means that the oil falls into 2 viscosity grades (i.e. 10w-40 etc). Multigrades were first developed some 50 years ago to avoid the old routine of using a thinner oil in winter and a thicker oil in summer.

Fully & Semi Synthetic Motor Oils. A single-grade engine oil, as defined by SAE J300, does not use a polymeric Viscosity Index Improver additive. There are eleven viscosity grades, of which six are considered Winter-grades and given a W designation.
Posted on: July 20th, 2012 by sara. Weâ€™ve all seen or heard of 5w-30, 10w-40 and SAE 40 before, but for many of us we have no clue what those Viscosity Grades mean-or even that they are called viscosity grades. Let me act as your decoder ring. In this blog I will give you a little background on grades.
THE BASICS. All oils are intended for an application and in general are not interchangeable. You would not for example put an Automatic Transmission Oil or a Gear Oil in your engine! It's important to know what the oil's intended purpose is.
