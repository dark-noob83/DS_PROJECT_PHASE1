Add beef stock and enough water to yield about 1/2 inch of liquid in the roasting pan. Lower oven to 300 degrees F, cover pan tightly and continue cooking for 3 hours, or until fork-tender. Trim the fat and slice meat thinly across the grain. Top with juice from the pan.
1 If you are cooking the brisket in an oven, you can place the foil-wrapped meat directly on the middle rack or place it in a baking dish to collect any drippings. 2  There are two distinct ends of a beef brisket, the flat cut and the point cut. 3  The cut looks like its name. 4  The flat cut is flat and the point cut is pointed.
Brisket is best if it is cooked at a lower temperature. This takes longer but the result is a tender product. I like to use about a 300 degree oven. A smaller roast (4 or 5 pound) will take 3 to 5 hours.
Bake the Brisket. 1  Place a fat-trimmed 3- to 3-1/2-pound fresh beef brisket in a 13x9x2-inch baking pan. 2  Pour the cooking liquid over the meat. 3  Cover the pan with foil. 4  Bake in a 325 degrees F oven about 3 hours or until tender, turning once halfway through cooking time.

1 Pour the sauce over the brisket. 2  Cover the slow cooker and cook on the low-heat setting for 12 to 14 hours. 3  Or cook on the high-heat setting for 6 to 7 hours. 4  Serve the sliced brisket with the cooking liquid.
Do you have a best guess on how long a 8-10 lbs brisket at 200-225 will take to get done. I was thinking about 1 hour per pound. Is this close. thank you! A: You can usually figure about 1.5 hours per pound at 225 degrees for brisket, pork shoulder and other larger pieces of meat.
At this temperature you can expect the cooking time to be about 1 1/2 hours per pound. Do the math ahead of time so you know how long you will need to keep the fire going. At this temperature range the collagen in the meat will breakdown nicely and make the meat tender and tasty.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make a dry rub by combining chili powder, salt, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, sugar, dry mustard, and bay leaf. Season the raw brisket on both sides with the rub. Place in a roasting pan and roast, uncovered, for 1 hour.
