By Anonymous on 10th July 2015. Rosegal has a website that shows clothes that are nothing like what you get when you order. I am a five foot seven who wears a medium size 10 in a womens and ordered a large size. The dresses I ordered are not only small but could be worn as a shirt not a dress. And to make a return you will pay more for shipping, than your whole order. Then you will be stuck with store credit if you are lucky enough for them to get package ! I opened a dispute w paypal.Rosegal offered me 19 refund on a 100 dollar order ! I took the lose just to not have to deal with these morans.
