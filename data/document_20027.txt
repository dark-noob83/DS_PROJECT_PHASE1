Stumble. Post. Share. Definition: The Kelvin temperature scale is an absolute temperature scale based on the definition that the volume of a gas at constant (low) pressure is directly proportional to temperature and that 100 degrees separates the freezing and boiling points of water.
An example of the Kelvin Scale. Kelvin is the SI unit for temperature. Kelvin is a temperature scale based on molecular motion, where 0K is the temperature where all molecular motion stops. 0K is also known as Absolute Zero and is defined by the third law of thermodynamics.
Symbol: K. Scale Factor: 4. Definition: The kelvin (formerly Kelvin degree), symbolized as K, is the temperature unit of scale created by William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, in 1848, on the basis of the degree Celsius, setting the zero point at absolute zero (-273.15 Â°C) and maintaining the same dimension.
This scale is called Kelvin or absolute scale of temperature. The zero of this scale is the temperature at which the molecular motion ceases and average kinetic energy of molecules becomes zero. This temperature is called absolute zero. It is the lowest attainable
Kelvin is a temperature scale designed so that zero degrees K is defined as absolute zero (at absolute zero, a hypothetical temperature, all molecular movement stops-all actual temperatures are above absolute zero) and the size of one unit is the same as the size of one degree Celsius.
The temperature measured in kelvin is called absolute temperature, and is the temperature scale used in science, especially in physics or chemistry. kelvin is also used in video and film lighting as reference for the color temperature.
