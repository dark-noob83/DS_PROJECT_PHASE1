And there is the Working Tax Credit, which is added to your GST cheques every 3 months. For example: We had 3 kids, and I get $1,086.15 from the CTB and UCC, I get $418.00 for my GST and WTC
How much money will I get from the Canada Child Tax Benefit? The amount you will receive depends on your income and how many children you have, so it is different for every family. For example, if your net family income is less than $37,885 per year and you have one child, you could receive as much as $1,300 per year. The lower your income and the more children you have, the higher the benefit amount you can receive. The government recalculates your benefit each year, which means that if your income changes you may be able to receive more money. The same application is used for both the Canada Child Tax Benefit and the Universal Child Care Benefit, so you can apply for both programs at the same time anyway.

Tax-free family allowance payments varied according to age. For children under age five, these were $5 per month; for six-to-nine-year-olds $6; 10-12 years, $7; and 13-15, $8. The average payment per child was $5.94 — considerably below the Marsh Report's recommended minimum payment of $7.50 per child. It expanded the role of the tax system in child support, which saw a diminished role for family allowances. The government instead established a Refundable Child Tax Credit of $200 per annum for families with incomes of $18,000 or less. As incomes rose above this level, benefits would be taxed away to disappear entirely at $26,000

The Government is proposing to enhance the UCCB by increasing the benefit to $160 per month from $100 per month. Parents would receive up to $1,920 per year for each child under the age of 6. The Government is also proposing a new benefit of $60 per month, or up to $720 per year, for children aged 6 through 17. The enhanced UCCB would replace the existing Child Tax Credit for the 2015 and subsequent taxation years. The Government proposes to increase the dollar limits of the CCED by $1,000—i.e., to $8,000 from $7,000 per child under age 7, to $5,000 from $4,000 for each child aged 7 through 16 (and for infirm dependent children over age 16), and to $11,000 from $10,000 for children who are eligible for the Disability Tax Credit.
