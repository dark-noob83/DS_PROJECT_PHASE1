Other Enzymes Although amylase, protease and lipase are the three main enzymes your body uses to digest food, many other specialized enzymes also help in the process. Cells that line your intestines make enzymes called maltase, sucrase and lactase, each able to convert a specific type of sugar into glucose. After you break food into small pieces by chewing it, specialized enzymes made in different parts of your digestive tract act on it to finalize the process. Amylase Amylase is a digestive enzyme that acts on starch in food, breaking it down into smaller carbohydrate molecules. The enzyme is made in two places.
Any enzyme that breaks down protein into its building blocks, amino acids, is called a protease, which is a general term. Your digestive tract produces a number of these enzymes, but the three main proteases are pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Lipase. Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down dietary fats into smaller molecules called fatty acids and glycerol. A small amount of lipase, called gastric lipase, is made by cells in your stomach. This enzyme specifically digests butter fat in your food
Alpha-Amylase in Saliva. Alpha-amylase is found in saliva. As soon as you eat starch, your saliva glands secrete this enzyme into your mouth. In fact, even the thought or smell of food can cause you to salivate. Alpha-amylase in saliva digests starch into pairs of glucose molecules, which are smaller, sweeter sugars. That's why starchy carbohydrates taste sweeter the longer they are in your mouth.
Also in the mouth, an enzyme called salivary amylase begins to break down long starch molecules into maltose. Once the food is ready to be swallowed it is gathered into a ball called a bolus and sends to the part of the bolus called the pharynx. Digestion is the breakdown of food into simpler molecules that can be absorbed by the body. The digestive system is actually a long hollow tube called the gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract. The digestive system includes the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.
Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. As diastase, amylase was the first enzyme to be discovered and isolated (by Anselme Payen in 1833). Specific amylase proteins are designated by different Greek letters.
Amylase is a specific type of carbohydrate-digesting enzyme. It digests the complex polysaccharide starch into the simpler sugar, maltose. Amylase is secreted by the salivary … glands, as well as in the small intestine.
