Production of the car ended in December 1995, but the popularity of the car is still maintained by a cult of drivers, mainly as a used import. The Starlet GT turbo and its normally aspirated 1.3 Gi were replaced by the Starlet Glanza series, the Glanza V and Glanza S respectively. The Starlet GT Turbo is high performance model of the fourth generation Starlet, first introduced in 1990 as a successor to the 70 series Starlet 1.3 Turbo R. The EP82 GT turbo was powered by a turbocharged version of a Toyota's E Engine, the 4E-FTE with CT9 turbocharger. This engine produced 135 PS (99 kW) at 6400 rpm.

True, but fuel consumption is an important factor, however i fell in love with the glanza from the first day i saw the first imported one from japan. As i said to say they are turbo'ed the fuel consumption is very good compared to some other hatchbacks that are both more modern and also slower. The clio is a completely different type of car to the glanza, cant really compare the two. Reply With Quote. 07-08-2009 04:52 PM #11.
