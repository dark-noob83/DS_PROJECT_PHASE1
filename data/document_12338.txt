Once you have the unauthenticated findings, you can gradually start authenticated testing once you have a good comfort level that it will not impact systems. Note*** In large environments you may need to be wary of old printers and devices that may have old network stacks. 1 Since authenticated testing will often find more, you will spend more time parsing through data and trying to determine which findings are higher risk. 2  Finally, unauthenticated testing alone will not simulate targeted attacks on your application or system, and is therefore unable to find a wide range of possible issues.
There are some situations where unauthenticated access is useful, although in most cases it is not recommended that you deploy unauthenticated access to your organization network. When you enable unauthenticated access, users are allowed access to your network without sending user credentials. With guest authentication, during the authentication process, the user does not provide a user name or password. If unauthenticated access is enabled, by default the Guest account is used as the identity of the caller. To enable Guest account access, you must do the following: 1  Enable unauthenticated access on the network access server. 2  Enable unauthenticated access on the appropriate network policy in NPS
If you permit unauthenticated access on your network, clients can connect without being authenticated if the authentication protocols configured on the access client do not match the authentication protocols that are configured on the network access server (NAS). With guest authentication, during the authentication process, the user does not provide a user name or password. If unauthenticated access is enabled, by default the Guest account is used as the identity of the caller. To enable Guest account access, you must do the following: 1  Enable unauthenticated access on the network access server. 2  Enable unauthenticated access on the appropriate network policy in NPS

These pros and cons of unauthenticated and authenticated testing highlight the need to define -- with clarity -- what it is you're trying to accomplish with your security testing. Do you only need to find out what an outsider can do? If so, then unauthenticated testing may be the way to go. Testing security as a trusted user. Given its benefits, authenticated testing is not so simple. Here are some of the downsides to authenticated testing that most people have to learn the hard way: 1  It's more difficult and often requires more advanced manual analysis and hacking techniques.
Unauthenticated scans can be performed remotely without requiring much in the way of costs and specialized knowledge. They require less internal cooperation and are less intrusive to the environment than authenticated security scans, which access system resources that are available to trusted uses. Unauthenticated vulnerability scans inspect the security of a target system from an outside perspective. These scans allow visibility into what a malicious hacker could access without acquiring login credentials to pose as a trusted user.
If you're getting This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated sources error, it's because Chrome is trying to protect you from a site that's not secure to make sure your information on the page doesn't fall into the wrong hands. If this happens, in the address bar you'll see a shield. 
An unauthenticated security scan, sometimes called a logged-out scan, is the process of exploring a network or networked system for vulnerabilities that are accessible without logging in as an authorized user. Unauthenticated vulnerability scans inspect the security of a target system from an outside perspective. These scans allow visibility into what a malicious hacker could access without acquiring login credentials to pose as a trusted user.
Tips to solve it. In order to solve the problem with an unauthenticated network connection you need to disconnect from the domain and you need to reset a secure channel and then rejoin the domain. You need to enable firewall protection on the network connection in order to prevent unauthenticated network access. With the help of a network connection you can easily surf the Internet. There is both wired and wireless network connections. For setting up a network connection on a Windows Operating System you need to have the proper requirements which include DSL or cable modem, wireless network card and a wireless adapter.
