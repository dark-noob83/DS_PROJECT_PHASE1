Google Books, or Amazon Kindle. That's the question du jour. Google this week released its online bookstore -- Google Books, or eBooks. It's not a new premise, you go online and buy books, and then read them on your laptop or PC, or on a mobile device. And you have plenty of options in the mobile space.
Reading Google eBooks on a Kindle Fire entails sideloading the Indiebound Reader App (which also works for the Nook, Android, iPhone, and iPad -- you can find the app in your device's app store). Please note: IndieBound Reader was not specifically developed to run on the Kindle Fire.
Reading on the desktop. Don't take this for granted. There are plenty of times where you might want to read a book on a desktop. And both Google Books and Amazon Kindle will let you do that. Google Books can be read in the browser, Amazon Kindle is a standalone application.
Kindle Cloud Reader is not currently available on this browser. You can read on your phone or tablet by downloading a free Kindle app now.
These books can be read on eReader devices that support the Adobe eBook platform, like the Nook. If you transfer your book to an eReader, bookmarks, highlights, notes, and other annotations you’ve already made won’t sync to the new device.
Convert and transfer Google Books to Kindle. Now you have get the DRM free Google Play ePub books, but you still cannot read it on Kindle Fire (HD) as Amazon devices don't accept ePub files. You need to convert them to mobi format.
