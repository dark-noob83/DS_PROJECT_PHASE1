Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). A class of medications used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. DMARDs do more than ease the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis like some other treatments. They often slow or stop the course of the disease to help prevent joint damage.
Introduction. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease in which various joints in the body are inflamed, leading to swelling, pain, stiffness, and the possible loss of function. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks joints and other tissues.
Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is aimed at reducing inflammation to the joints, relieving pain, minimizing any disability caused by pain, joint damage or deformity, and either slowing down or preventing damage to the joints.
There are different drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Some are used primarily to ease the symptoms of RA; others are used to slow or stop the course of the disease and to inhibit structural damage.
Other types of treatment that may help you control some of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include: 1  Physical therapy, to improve joint function. 2  Occupational therapy. 3  Assistive devices such as household aids or mobility aids. 4  Behavioral modification techniques to reduce pain and stress. 5  Counseling.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious autoimmune disease that attacks the joints and other body parts. But RA can be tough to diagnose. Symptoms can mimic other illnesses, or they may flare, then fade, only to flare again somewhere else.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a health condition that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints. Conventional medical treatments are highly effective for RA; however, researchers are also studying complementary health approaches as possible additions to RA treatments.
