There is no set number of bails per month that a horse will eat. Each bail of hay varies in the number of flakes it has in it (between 12 and 15 flakes) and an average sized … horse (1,000 lbs) generally consumes 3-4 flakes per day if they are not also on pasture or other sources of feed. In a good growing season, around 50 to 100 bales. However this all depends on your location, moisture content, time of harvest, climate, forage quality, etc. that determines h … ow many bales per acre you will get. Another caveat to this answer: A lot depends on the stand of hay.
The bottom price line is easier to predict for hay. Michigan State University Extension budgets for 2013 predict that the average Michigan producer with hay yields around 4 ton per acre of dry hay will realize a cost of production in the range of $105 – 115 per ton at 16 percent moisture hay. In big and small square bale packages this same type of hay is bringing $135 - $245 per ton. The high-quality alfalfa hays are still in very short supply and are bringing $200 - $320 per ton with not much price difference between the round and square bales.
Should also measure quality of the hay, not just quantity. Average Pasture. Here's an example calculation for a lower productivity field that is typical in western Oregon: 1  Production of 2 Tons/acre and the bales weigh 65 lb. 2  4,000 lb./65 lb. per bale = 62 bales/ac. 
Each year, 500 acres of corn silage, 500 acres of first cut hay, and 500 acres of latter cuttings are harvesting. Per hour corn silage harvesting costs vary between the two machines. The pull-type harvester is estimated to harvest 1.9 acres per hour while the self-propelled unit harvests 4.5 acres per hour. 
HAY. Michigan's hay production was estimated at 5.8 million tons in 1993, up 25% from 1992. Alfalfa and alfalfa mixtures accounted for 87% of all hay produced. Harvested acres increased 100,000 acres from the previous year, to 1.5 million. The average all hay yield was 3.86 tons per acre, up 0.55 tons from 1992. Value of the hay crop was $388.3 million, up 8% from a year earlier, while the average price per ton decreased to $68.00 from $77.50 in 1992. Hay, which includes dried forage crops like alfalfa, clover and other legumes and grasses, is an important part of the dairy cow's diet.
But prices have moderated slightly on the lower quality first cut alfalfa/grass mixed hays. Those hays in round bale packages are bringing $120 - $180 per ton. In big and small square bale packages this same type of hay is bringing $135 - $245 per ton. The high-quality alfalfa hays are still in very short supply and are bringing $200 - $320 per ton with not much price difference between the round and square bales.
In the 2-4 years, after the hay has been established, the first cutting is the largest and can produce anywhere from 75-100 bales of hay per acre. The second cutting usually yields 50-75 bales, and it continues to decrease from there. In a good growing season, around 50 to 100 bales. However this all depends on your location, moisture content, time of harvest, climate, forage quality, etc. that determines h … ow many bales per acre you will get. Another caveat to this answer: A lot depends on the stand of hay.
The amount of Hay Bales that you yield from one acre is dependant on many variables. This includes the rate per acre it was seeded at, the ratio of grass to alfalfa used, and the size of the bale. It is also dependant on how many cuttings are available in one year. Usually land seeded for hay is planted at 20-30lbs per acre. In a good growing season, around 50 to 100 bales. However this all depends on your location, moisture content, time of harvest, climate, forage quality, etc. that determines h … ow many bales per acre you will get. Another caveat to this answer: A lot depends on the stand of hay.
The Michigan hay markets are beginning to show signs of price relief for buyers from the drought-driven high prices of 2012-2013. Rainfall has returned across much of Michigan and hay yields have rebounded on the first cutting harvest. Even so, prices have not fallen to pre-2012 levels. In big and small square bale packages this same type of hay is bringing $135 - $245 per ton. The high-quality alfalfa hays are still in very short supply and are bringing $200 - $320 per ton with not much price difference between the round and square bales.
