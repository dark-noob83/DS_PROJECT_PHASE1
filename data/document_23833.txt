Speed limits on Ontario freeways were lowered from 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) during the 1970s energy crisis and remained at the nearest equivalent (100 km/h) upon conversion to metric measurements in 1977. Posted speed limits may differ from the statutory speed limit as indicated by speed limit signs. In most provinces and territories, statutory speed limits are 50 km/h in urban areas, 80 km/h in rural areas.
The two branches converge at Ottawa, 244 km (152 mi) east of Peterborough and 123 km (76 mi) east of Pembroke. In Southern Ontario, the speed limit is generally 80 km/h (50 mph) on the Trans-Canada, while in Northern Ontario it is 90 km/h (56 mph). Sections routed along provincial freeways feature a higher limit of 100 km/h (62 mph). Throughout the prairie provinces, the speed limit varies from 90 km/h (56 mph) to 110 km/h (68 mph). As is the case with all highways passing through national parks in Canada, the speed limit is 90 km/h (55 mph) through Banff National Park. East of Banff, most of Highway 1 through Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba is 110 km/h (68 mph), but is 100 km/h east of Winnipeg
40 – 50 kph. 25 - 30 mph. School zones. 30 - 50 kph. 20 - 30 mph. Speed limits in Canada are measured in kilometers per hour (km / h) and usually marked by signs on the side of the road. When the speed limit is not marked, drivers should keep to the provincially set speed limits which fall within the limits as outlined in the Speed Limits in Canada Table (above). Check at the Canada border or rental car office for local speed limits and other road regulations. Also read our Driving in Canada Guide
They apply on roads which do not have posted speed limits. Posted speed limits may differ from the statutory speed limit as indicated by speed limit signs. In most provinces and territories, statutory speed limits are 50 km/h in urban areas, 80 km/h in rural areas.
In B.C., the speed limits are rising on about 1,300 kilometres of highway this summer — in a few cases up to 120 km/h. Quebec is exploring the idea of variable speed limits — as high as 120 but only when the weather's good — as part of a pilot project on two highways this fall. In Ontario, the limit for multi-lane, 400-series highways is 100 km/h, a speed one online campaign wants to see rise to 130 in rural areas, and 120 in many areas around some of the big cities.
Speed Limits in Canada. If you are an American and see a speed limit of “100” while travelling in Canada, that doesn’t mean you can go 100 miles/hour. This means 100 kilometres/hour and translates to just a bit more than 60 mph. In general, you can convert from kph to mph by dividing the speed in kph by 1.6. 40 kph = 25 mph. 50 kph = 31 mph. 100 kph = 62 mph. 120 kilometers per hour is the fastest you can go on a Canadian highway. The province of Ontario is especially strict, with maximum speed of 100 kph. If you are caught driving 50 kilometers per hour over the posted limit in Ontario your car will be impounded.
Canadian speed limits have been posted in kilometres per hour (km/h) since 1977. Before then, when Canada used Imperial units, speed limits were in miles per hour (mph). Posted speed limits may differ from the statutory speed limit as indicated by speed limit signs. In most provinces and territories, statutory speed limits are 50 km/h in urban areas, 80 km/h in rural areas.
