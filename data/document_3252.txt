In the U.S. we still use the separated name Black Currant as well as Red Currant or White Currant and often, just Currant which causes some confusion with the misnamed raisins. Zante currants have become part of the English vernacular and have come to be accepted to identify the Greek raisins.
The botanical family of Currants is Saxifragaceae, Genus Ribes while the Botanical family of grapes is Vitaceae, Genus Vitis. The two are as close as bananas and apples but more importantly, the raisins have little or none of the Black Currant antioxidants studied in the Alzheimer’s research.
Bella Viva's organic Zante Currants are dried from the highest quality Black Corinth Grape. They are first known to be cultivated in ancient Greece on the Ionian Island of Zakynthos or Zante, the English translation.
So called Zante Currants, Zante Raisins or worse Currants without the Zante prefix (those little raisiny things) are in fact dried grapes and have nothing to do with real currants. Grapes, of course, grow on vines and are sweet.
Raisins, sultanas, and Zante currants are all sweet dried fruits that stem from different varieties of vine-grown grapes, while currants really are a fresh bush-grown berry that is tart rather than sweet. Currants are also sold dried, but they're not as readily available as sultanas and raisins.

Currants, Black Currants, Blackcurrants, Zante currants, there's much confusion about what to call our favorite little berry here in the U.S. and around the world. So many questions.
