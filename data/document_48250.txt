Coronary Arteries. Because the heart is composed primarily of cardiac muscle tissue that continuously contracts and relaxes, it must have a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients. The coronary arteries are the network of blood vessels that carry oxygen-and nutrient-rich blood to the cardiac muscle tissue.
The heart is supplied with blood from the superior vena cava (the large vein that flows to the right atrium). This vein carries blood from the systemic circuit (from the body) … to the heart so that blood may be oxygenated and recirculated.
The pulmonary artery is the vessel transporting de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. A common misconception is that all arteries carry oxygen-rich blood. It is more appropriate to classify arteries as vessels carrying blood away from the heart.
1 The pulmonary artery carries blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs to pick up a fresh supply of oxygen. 2  The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left side of the heart to the body. 3  The coronary arteries are the other important arteries attached to the heart.
Veins are the blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart. They may contain valves which stop blood flowing away from the heart. The heart works by following a sequence of electrical signals that cause the muscles in each chamber to contract in a certain order.
The pulmonary vein is the vessel transporting oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium. A common misconception is that all veins carry de-oxygenated blood. It is more appropriate to classify veins as vessels carrying blood to the heart.
· just now. Report Abuse. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood towards the heart. The vena cava brings deoxygenated blood from the body towards the heart. However, the coronary artery carries oxygenated blood to the myogenic heart muscle. Source(s): Biology Student.
