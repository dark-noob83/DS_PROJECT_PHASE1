Important Nerves = Femoral-Serves the lower abdomen, buttocks, anterior thighs. Obturator-Serves adductor muscles of medial thigh and small hip muscles.
Three nerves run through the region of the anterior and medial thigh: Femoral nerve (L2–L4): This nerve runs from the lumbar plexus along the psoas major past the inguinal ligament to enter the femoral triangle.
The femoral nerve begins as the largest nerve to extend from the lumbar plexus in the lower back as a combination of fibers from the L2, L3, and L4 spinal nerves.... Click to read more below. The femoral nerve is the major nerve that serves the tissues of the thigh and leg, including the muscles and skin. While the much larger sciatic nerve also passes through the thigh on its way to the lower leg and foot, only the femoral nerve innervates the tissues of the thigh.
Sensory: cutaneous branches to the anteromedial thigh (anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve) and a terminal cutaneous branch supplies the medial side of the leg and foot (saphenous nerve). © 2015 TeachMeAnatomy.com [CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0].
The branches of the femoral nerve serve the quadriceps muscles and skin of the anterior and medial thigh, while its largest branch, the saphenous nerve, extends to the skin of the medial leg and foot.
The femoral nerve supplies some of the muscles of the anterior thigh. Hip Flexors. 1  Pectineus – adducts and flexes the thigh, assists with medial rotation of the thigh. 2  Iliacus – acts with psoas major and psoas minor (forming iliopsoas) to flex the thigh at the hip joint and stabilise the hip joint.
The muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh are innervated by the femoral nerve (L2-L4), and as a general rule, act to extend the leg at the knee joint. There are three major muscles in the anterior thigh – the pectineus, sartorius and quadriceps femoris.
