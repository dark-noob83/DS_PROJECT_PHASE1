LOS ANGELES â€“ Prosecutors said Monday that the woman who gave birth to octuplets and earned the nickname Octomom has been charged with welfare fraud, allegedly receiving nearly $30,000 from video and personal appearances while on public assistance.
Nadya Suleman is a mother of 14, including a set of octuplets born in January 2009. All the children were born subsequent to her separation from her (now) ex-husband, and all were conceived through in vitro fertilization from a donor who is not her ex-husband. LATEST STORIES.
Nadya Suleman, the Octomom, just plead no contest on Monday to a single count of misdemeanor welfare fraud. Suleman collected over $26,000 in public assistance funds for her 14 kids. The problem was that she never disclosed income she was getting from videos and personal appearances.
The IRS has learned a thing or 2 about self-pleasure from Octomom ... because the agency is now pleasuring itself by going after her unpaid taxes on her masturbation video. Uncle Sam and his buddies believe Nadya Suleman raked in at least $116,000 in 2012, largely from the tape.
