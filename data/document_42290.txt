Contact dermatitis is caused by an allergic reaction. Why some individuals develop certain allergies is not known. The cause of atopic dermatitis is not clear, but it does appear to have a genetic factor. People with atopic dermatitis often have a family history of allergies or asthma.
Causes. Contact dermatitis is caused by a substance you're exposed to that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. The substance could be one of thousands of known allergens and irritants. Some of these substances may cause both irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis.
Dermatitis is a common skin condition caused by inflammation of the skin. There are several different forms of dermatitis but all are caused by the skin reacting to allergens or irritants. Dermatitis is usually characterized by red, itchy skin that can become blistered and weepy.
Contact dermatitis typically causes a pink or red itchy rash. Pinpointing the exact cause of contact dermatitis can be difficult. Allergic contact dermatitis is a skin allergy to something that touches the skin, even if only briefly. An example of allergic contact dermatitis is poison ivy.
Two other forms of dermatitis are contact dermatitis (an inflammatory reaction to a specific substance) and seborrheic dermatitis (caused by overproduction of sebum or oils by the sebaceous glands). Seborrheic dermatitis, commonly called dandruff, is the most common form of dermatitis in adults.
