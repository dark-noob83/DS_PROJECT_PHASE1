1 Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan. 2  Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 40 minutes. 3  Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). 4  In a small bowl, mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup.
1 Coat the loaf with ketchup or bacon (optional): Spread 1/4 cup of the ketchup mixture over the meatloaf (reserve the other 1/4 cup for later). 2  Alternatively, drape the loaf with bacon slices. 3  Bake for 45 minutes: Bake the meatloaf for 45 minutes, then spread with the remaining 1/4 cup of ketchup, if using.

Cover the meatloaf mixture with the rest of the ketchup. 5 Bake for 1 hour at 350째F, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meatloaf reads 155째F. Remove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes. Then use a metal spatula to gently lift the meatloaf out of the loaf pan to a serving plate. Make thick slices to serve.
Bake for another 10 to 15 minutes: Bake the loaf for another 10 to 15 minutes (about 1 hour total), until the middle of the loaf registers at least 155째F on an instant-read thermometer. Cool 15 minutes before serving: Let the loaf cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
(If using a loaf pan, just pat the meatloaf mixture into the pan.) Coat the loaf with ketchup or bacon (optional): Spread 1/4 cup of the ketchup mixture over the meatloaf (reserve the other 1/4 cup for later).
