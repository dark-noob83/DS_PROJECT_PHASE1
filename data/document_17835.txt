Most condos have one parking space per unit. The space is either included in the sale price or the owner has to buy one at additional cost.
The number of off-street parking spaces in the city was 102,000 in 2010, or about 20 percent less than in 1978, when there were 127,000 spots, according to the Department of City Planning. While scarcity is a factor in the price of parking, $1 million for a parking spot may still be a reach.
According to Miller Samuel, the average parking space costs $165,019, or $1,100 per square foot, close to the average apartment price of $1,107 per square foot. Those are averages, of course. A $200,000 parking space is about $1,333 per square foot. If parking at the Onyx Chelsea, a new 52-unit condo at 28th Street and Eighth Avenue, is any indication, there is plenty of demand. The first two spots sold for $165,000, the third for $175,000 and the last two for $195,000.
Spaces are in such demand that there are waiting lists of buyers. Eight people are hoping for the chance to buy one of five private parking spaces for $225,000 in the basement of 246 West 17th Street, a 34-unit condo development scheduled for completion next January.
At $250,000 a tire, the parking spaces in the underground garage cost more than four times the national median sales price for a home, which is $217,800, according to Zillow.
For example, the average cost of constructing anunderground garage in Boston is $95 per square foot, and the average spaceoccupies 330 square feet, so the average cost of a parking space is $31,000($95 Ã— 330).
Buying a deeded parking space is much like buying any real estate in downtown Portland. The building, location and access has a lot to do with its value. Most condo buildings sell at least one deeded space with the unit, however this is not always the case.
