In fact, it is not unusual for an oven to be off by as much as 25 to 50 degrees F. That much of a discrepancy can seriously affect the time needed for baking your prime rib to perfection. It is always a good idea to check your oven temp before cooking something as expensive as a prime rib roast. To do that you will need to get an oven thermometer and place it on the rack in the center of the oven. Heat the oven for at least 15 minutes at 350 degrees F. 
The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit.

1 After 20 minutes of high heat cooking reduce heat to 350°F and continue to roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes OR until the meat thermometer reads 130°F for rare doneness OR 140°F for medium-rare doneness, that is the way a prime rib really should be served, check your roast after 1 hour cooking time. 1 *NOTE* if desired you can cover the roast loosely with foil the first hour and then uncover and cook for the remaining time. --------------------------------------------. 2  APPROXIMATE COOKING TIMES for the prime rib cooked at 350°F after the 20 minute cooking time at 450°F. 3  Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F.
Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.).
