Directions. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Place salmon, skin side down, on a non-stick baking sheet or in a non-stick pan with an oven-proof handle. Bake until salmon is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with the Toasted Almond Parsley Salad and squash, if desired. Mince the shallot and add to a small bowl.
Another thing that determines how long the salmon is baked is oven temperature. Typically, recipes for baking salmon call for an oven temperature of 350 to 450 degrees. The salmon should always be put into a pre-heated oven. Cooking in an oven that hasn't been pre-heated can cause drying of the fish. Here are some general guidelines for baking salmon. 1  A good rule of thumb is that at 350 degrees the salmon will bake about ten minutes per one inch thickness of your fillet. 2  A two-inch thick fillet will bake for 20 minutes. 3  A 1-1/2 filet will take 15 minutes and so on. 4  Check the salmon frequently.
Best Answer: This really depends on the temp of the oven, the thickness of the fish and if you are baking it in an open or closed dish. For an open dish cooking steaks or fillets, I've read you bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 17 minutes per inch of fish. I always bake at 350 in a covered container to keep the fish moist, and for smaller fillets I use about 25 minutes. Fish is a very light flesh and cooks quickly. You can test for doneness by checking it with a fork, when it's done it will be uniforming opaque in the thickest part of the fish and it will flake easily.
The best way to cook the thicker fillets is to use 400° as the set temperature and bake the fish for 18-20 minutes. If a lower heat is desired, season the fillet and wrap it in foil, sealing it tightly and bake at 350° for about 25-30 minutes. When using a foil wrap, the fillet should be baked at 375° for about 15-20 minutes. ● Tail Fillet. The tail tip is the thinnest fillet and often the most tender. When seeking a cut of Salmon other than a steak, this will often be the best choice. Bake the tail at 415° for optimal results.
This cut should be baked for a total of 12-15 minutes. When baking a tail wrapped in foil, use 375° as the heat setting and bake the fish for 20-22 minutes. ● Salmon Steak. Steaks of course are much thicker than a fillet. For each 1″ of thickness, figure on 10 minutes of baking time. When using a foil wrap, the fillet should be baked at 375° for about 15-20 minutes. ● Tail Fillet. The tail tip is the thinnest fillet and often the most tender. When seeking a cut of Salmon other than a steak, this will often be the best choice. Bake the tail at 415° for optimal results.
10 Minutes Per Inch. Bake salmon in a preheated, 425 degree Fahrenheit oven for 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Many salmon fillets are around an inch thick, so plan on baking it for around 10 minutes. Turn the filet halfway through, cooking 5 minutes per inch on each side. 
Roast for 4 to 6 minutes per half-inch thickness of salmon: Roasting time depends on the thickness of your salmon, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon fillet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes — 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it. Salmon is done when easily flaked: You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready
Bake Until Opaque and Flaky. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for fillets or 350 degrees F for a dressed fish. You can bake the fillets at a lower temperature, if desired, but remember to increase the cooking time. Bake salmon fillets or steaks, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness. For a dressed salmon, bake for 6 to 9 minutes per 8 ounces of fish. To test for doneness, insert a fork into the salmon and gently twist. The salmon is done as soon as it begins to flake. Be sure to test at the minimum ba
