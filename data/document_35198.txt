Other catecholamines are norepinephrine (also called noradrenaline or levoarterenol) and dopamine. The general function of norepinephrine seems to be the maintenance of normal blood circulation. It is also the chemical agent that is responsible for transmission of nerve impulses in the sympathetic nervous system.
epinephrine. a hormone produced by the medulla of the adrenal glands; called also adrenaline. Its function is to aid in the regulation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.
Epinephrine, or adrenaline, is a hormone released by the adrenal glands as part of a “fight or flight” response. Its function is to prepare the body to flee or fight back. As such, it must affect a wide range of bodily tissues, including the muscles, circulatory system, and lungs.
epinephrine. a hormone produced by the adrenal medulla; called also adrenaline (British). Its function is to aid in the regulation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.
Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone secreted by the medulla (inner part) of the adrenal glands, located on the kidneys. The adrenal glands are one of the body's endocrine glands (glands producing substances that are distributed by way of the bloodstream).
Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine-two amino acid-based hormones are secreted by the inner portion of the adrenal glands. These hormones are released in emergency situation; whenever the sympathetic nervous system is activated.
