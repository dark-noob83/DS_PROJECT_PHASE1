The testing standards for the measurement of the defoaming properties of antacid simethicone tablets as outlined in the U.S. Pharmacopeia XXIII were assessed. Three standards have been designed for three different formulations of antacid simethicone tablets. These results raise the question as to why specific tests were devised for specific antacid simethicone tablets. A single test should be used for all preparations, thus allowing a direct comparison of their in vitro activity. Key words: simethicone, antacid, defoaming, standards.
Americans spend close to one billion dollars a year on nonprescription digestive remedies mostly for hundreds of antacids, including syrupy liquids, fizzing powders, and chewable tablets. All these products attempt to do the same thing: neutralize stomach acid. Products that contain saccharin must display a warning on the label. Sorbitol is also used as a sweetener in many antacids, as well as in some sugar-free products such as candy, gum, and dietetic foods. In large amounts-5 or 10 grams sorbitol can cause intestinal problems, primarily diarrhea.
Gelusil ® is the brand of antacid used most often to relieve breakthrough heartburn symptoms in PPI acid reducer clinical studies. 1 This is also known as breakthrough heartburn because symptoms reappear — or break through — before it's time for another dose.

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is one of the substances found in gastric juices secreted by the lining of the stomach. HCl is needed by the enzyme pepsin to catalyze the digestion of proteins in the food we eat. Heartburn is a symptom that results when the stomach produces too much acid (hyperacidity). Antacids are bases used to neutralize the acid that causes heartburn.
