1 For example: When water (H 2 O) changes from solid ice to liquid water, that is a physical change. 2  The chemical makeup (hydrogen and oxygen) is not altered. 3  When salt and sugar dissolve in water it is a physical change. 4  The chemical makeup of the salt and sugar are not changed. 
Burning or oxidization is always a chemical change. The process takes in Oxygen and Sugar and outputs different compounds including water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and â€¦ other carbon residue. Explanation 2: Chemical changes are changes in what things are made out of. Physical changes are like ice melting ice and liquid water are still water one is a solid but the other is liquid. steam is a gas but is still water. these changes do not change what water is.
Answer: Table sugar consists of a sugar known as sucrose. The chemical or molecular formula for sucrose is C 12 H 22 O 11, which means each molecule of sugar contains 12 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms and 11 oxygen atoms. Related Articles.
Glucose. Glucose is a carbohydrate, and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism. Glucose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates. Glucose is also sometimes called dextrose. Corn syrup is primarily glucose. 
The white stuff we know as sugar is sucrose, a molecule composed of 12 atoms of carbon, 22 atoms of hydrogen, and 11 atoms of oxygen (C12H22O11). Like all compounds made from these three elements, sugar is a carbohydrate. Its found naturally in most plants, but especially in sugarcane and sugar beetshence their names.

A molecule of sucrose. Glucose and fructose are monosaccharide sugars. A monosaccharide is the smallest unit of sugar, mono meaning 1. Sucrose is commonly called table sugar and is a disaccharide. A disaccharide is a sugar that is made up of two sugar units, di meaning 2. Sucrose is produced as glucose and fructose are joined together by a condensation reaction. In the process a water molecule is eliminated. See the following equation. These sugar molecules include glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, maltose, lactose and galactose. Sugar molecules are classified as monosaccharides or disaccharides. The following table lists the common sugar molecules are their chemical formula. Name.
Here monomer units are bonded together with glycosidic linkage with a condensation reaction. Glucose is a simplest sugar which shows unique physical and chemical properties. It involves in the formation of glycosides in which a sugar molecule is attached with a non-sugar moiety. Here sugar part is known as glycone and the non-sugar part is called as aglycone. 
Answer: Dissolving sugar in water is an example of a physical change. Here's why: A chemical change produces new chemical products. In order for sugar in water to be a chemical change, something new would need to result. A chemical reaction would have to occur. However, mixing sugar and water simply produces... sugar in water! The substances may change form, but not identity. That's a physical change.
