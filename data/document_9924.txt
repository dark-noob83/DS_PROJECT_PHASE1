Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. It forms naturally from the decay (breaking down) of radioactive elements, such as uranium, which are found in different amounts in soil and rock throughout the world.
Natural gas is odorless in its natural form. Before it arrives at your home, an odorant called mercaptan is added to it, so you can smell the gas immediately if a leak occurs. Mercaptan makes the gas smell like sulfur or rotten eggs. Everyone in your family should learn to recognize this smell.
Natural Gas is colorless, shapeless, and odorless in its pure form. Unlike other fossil fuels, natural gas is clean burning and emits lower levels of potentially harmful byproducts into the air. It is therefore called Clean Gas'.
What to do about radon. Radon is a naturally-occurring radioactive odorless gas generated by the natural breakdown (radioactive decay), radon-222 of uranium-238 radioactive decay, radon-220 of thorium-232. Usually present in igneous rock and soil, the odorless gas also may be at significant levels in groundwater solution.
