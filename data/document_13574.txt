Economic impacts are those impacts of drought that cost people (or businesses) money. Here are just a few different examples of economic impacts: 1  Farmers may lose money if a drought destroys their crops. 2  If a farmer's water supply is too low, the farmer may have to spend more money on irrigation or to drill new wells.
Drought ranks second in terms of national weather-related economic impacts, with annual losses nearing $9 billion per year in the U.S. [ 1 ] Beyond direct economic impacts, drought can threaten drinking water supplies and ecosystems, and can even contribute to increased food prices.
Drought affects all parts of our environment and our communities. The many different drought impacts are often grouped as “economic,” “environmental,” and “social” impacts. All of these impacts must be considered in planning for and responding to drought conditions. Let's take a closer look at all kinds of drought impacts.
Agricultural Drought. Agricultural drought links various characteristics of meteorological (or hydrological) drought to agricultural impacts, focusing on precipitation shortages, differences between actual and potential evapotranspiration, soil water deficits, reduced groundwater or reservoir levels, and so forth.
Some of the most interesting facts about drought are the different types, the causes, and the overall impact on social, environmental, and economical levels.
The types of drought impacts are described below. Economic Impacts Many economic impacts occur in agriculture and related sectors, because of the reliance of these sectors on surface and groundwater supplies.
Hydrological drought is associated with the effects of periods of precipitation (including snowfall) shortfalls on surface or subsurface water supply (i.e., streamflow, reservoir and lake levels, groundwater).
