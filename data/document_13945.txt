Fungi. Fungi can be single celled or very complex multicellular organisms. They are found in just about any habitat but most live on the land, mainly in soil or on plant material rather than in sea or fresh water.
Tags: Fungi can be found in rising bread, moldy bread, and old food in the refrigerator, and on forest floors. Most decompose non-living things, but some damage crops and plants. A few cause problems in people, such as Candida, which causes yeast infections.
Fungi belong to a group called a Kingdom. Fungi have similar characteristics to plants and are sometimes mistakenly put in the Plant Kingdom. Plants have chlorophyll that helps them make their own food and makes them green. Fungi have no chlorophyll. Fungi decay dead organic matter or grow on other organisms to get nutrients for growth. Animals belong to their own Kingdom as do bacteria.
