A 14 to 18 lb. turkey, will be done in four to four and a quarter hours, an 18 to 20 lb. turkey will take four and a quarter to four and three-quarter hours and a 20 to 24 lb. stuffed turkey takes four and three-quarters to five and a quarter hours.
Cooking time depends on weight. When roasting at 325 degrees Fahrenheit, an unstuffed turkey takes 20 to 23 minutes per pound. Stuffed turkeys can take up to 30 minutes per pound. So a 6-pound unstuffed turkey needs about 2 hours and 15 minutes to cook, while a stuffed bird needs a 3-hour cooking time.
According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, turkey meat becomes safe to eat at 165 degrees. To reach this temperature, roast a stuffed turkey at 325 degrees. Cook an 8 to 12 lb. turkey for three to three and a half hours; cook a 12 to 14 lb. turkey for three and a half to four hours.
But generally, you will want to cook an unstuffed turkey for about 15 minutes per pound, at 325 degrees. For an 18-pounder, about four and a half hours would do the trick. Roasting a stuffed bird will lengthen the cooking time.
4. Cover turkey loosely with a tent of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Cooking time takes longer for a stuffed turkey. For example, a 20 pound stuffed turkey will take 4 1/4 to 5 1/4 hours to cook. (See timetable below). 5. Remove the foil cover after about 1 to 1 1/2 hours of cooking to brown the skin. Brush with vegetable oil to enhance browning, if desired.
For a stuffed turkey, allow 3 to 3 1/2 hours for an 8- to 12-pound turkey; 3 1/2 to 4 hours for a 12- to 14-pounder; 4 to 4 1/4 hours for a 14- to 18-pounder; 4 1/4 to 4 3/4 hours for an 18- to 20-pounder; and 4 3/4 to 5 1/4 hours for a 20- to 24-pounder.
20 to 24 pounds. Unstuffed: 4 1/2 to 5 hours. Stuffed: 4 3/4 to 5 1/4 hours. How to know when a turkey is done: While the time estimates above offer a general idea of how long a turkey will take to cook, the absolute safest way to know if your turkey is done is to use meat thermometer.
