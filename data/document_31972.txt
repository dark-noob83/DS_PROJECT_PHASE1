The Council on Industrial Relations (CIR) exists to provide a forum for the peaceful resolution of labor disputes in the electrical contracting industry and by the mutual agreement and sponsorship of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA).
Industrial relations does not focus exclusively on the individual level, however, for very good reasons. Employment for the great majority of employees is a collective activity. Employees work in groups, with many belonging to trade unions and professional organisations.
Industrial Relations (IR) is the study of the laws, conventions and institutions that regulate 'the workplace'. It is a fundamentally important aspect of our way of life, our culture and our society. Industrial relations means different things to different people. The following illustration depicts how IR shapes our working life, our society and the national economy.
Level of analysis. The most appropriate description of industrial relations' approach to the level of analysis of the employment relationship is multi-level. 'The employment relationship is by definition a relationship between an employee and an employer' (Edwards, 2003: 9). The individual level is therefore fundamentally important.
International Factors The establishment of a sound or harmonious industrial relations system is a central theme for governments, employers, workers and their representatives, in their endeavours to achieve economic and social development.
Career Prospects in Labor Relations. Union membership is declining in most industries other than the public sector, so industrial relations staff members are working more with employees who are not members of a labor union.
