1 They are made from structures called cells.. 2  They reproduce by genetic material called  DNA 3  .. They respond to stimuli from the environment. 4  They synthesize an energy substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the environment, and they live and grow using that energy.
Cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. The human body is composed of trillions of cells. They provide structure for the body, take in nutrients from food, convert those nutrients into energy, and carry out specialized functions.
One nucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA – genetic material – is found in all cells. It carries information that directs each cell’s activities. Another nucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, or RNA is needed to make enzymes and other proteins.
All living things are made up of cells. The structures of different types of cells are related to their functions. Animal cells and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes.
genetic material is DNA, which is made up of nucleotides. a nucleotide is a subunit in a nucleic acid chain that consists of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base.
Genetic material. Definition. noun. The genetic material of a cell or an organism refers to those materials found in the nucleus, mitochondria and cytoplasm, which play a fundamental role in determining the structure and nature of cell substances, and capable of self-propagating and variation.
Shirin is talking rubbish. Prions and viruses are not living, so his point is irrelevant. All living substances use DNA. The only reason the term genetic material is usd, is because we use mRNA to carry the DNA message, and viruses also use mRNA as their genetic material.
