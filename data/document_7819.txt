Breed your rabbits at the proper age. You want to start breeding does (female rabbits) when they are reaching maturity. For small-medium breeds, they can be bred at 5-6 months old. Larger breeds can be bred at 8-9 months. Bucks (male rabbits) are usually ready around 6 months old if a small breed, 7 months if medium, and 9 months for a large breed.
Rabbits can breed as early as just a few months of age. 3 for males and 4-5 months for females. Although if you are breeding them intentionally you should wait until the female is at least one year of age. Rabbits can breed as young as 12 weeks however this is really not good for them. If you absolutely have to breed your rabbit it is best to wait until they have reached at least 1 year old first
The ideal age for a Harlequin doe to start breeding is 5 to 6 months old. There are two varieties of Harlequins: Japanese are golden orange with colored markings and the Magpie is white with colored markings.
A rabbit may normally start breeding at the age of 6 months for the small to medium size breeds and 8 to 9 months for the heavy breeds. The gestation period (time between breeding and kindling) is 31 days. After the doe has kindled, I normally re-breed her at 6 weeks and wean the litter at 5-7 weeks.
The age a rabbit can be bred varies with the size of the rabbit. A small breed doe is normally ready to mate when she is 5 months old, and a buck is ready at 6 months.
The ideal age for the female Harlequin rabbit to start breeding is between 5 to 6 months of age. The first litter must be born before the female is one year old. The reason for this is that after this age the pelvic bones fuse and she would not be able to give birth naturally.
