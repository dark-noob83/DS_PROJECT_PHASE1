The fuselage is the principal structure of an aircraft and the part to which all other units attach. It supplies room for the crew, passengers, freight, accessories and other important equipment. Aerodynamics mostly dictate the size and layout of the various compartments in fuselages of conventional aircraft.
A fuselage is the body of an aircraft, which houses passengers, cargo, and usually the pilots of the craft as well. Fuselages vary widely in shape, size, and style, depending on the purpose of the aircraft that they are attached to.
The fuselage and the wing are major structural components of an aircraft. The fuselage is the mounting structure for the horizontal and tail surfaces that provides stability as well as the means of introducing pitch and yaw control to the aircraft.
