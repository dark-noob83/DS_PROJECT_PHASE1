Genomic dna. Genomic dna. (Science: molecular biology) The dna which is found in the organisms genome and is passed on to offspring as information necessary for survival. The phrase is used to distinguish between other types of dna, such as found within plasmids.
All the DNA contained in your cells makes up your genome. In most cells, the genome is packaged into two sets of chromosomes: one set from your mother and one set from your father. These chromosomes are composed of six billion individual DNA letters. In the English alphabet there are 26 letters: A through Z.
genomic DNA. the DNA constituting the genome of a cell or organism, as distinguished from extrachromosomal DNAs, such as plasmids.
genomic_ DNA ~ includes all nuclear, mitochondria l and plastid DNA. ~ stocks from the ABRC are derived from an individual line. A library composed of fragments of ~ . (See Library .) Genotype. The structure of DNA that determines the expression of a trait.
Definition of GENOMICS. : a branch of biotechnology concerned with applying the techniques of genetics and molecular biology to the genetic mapping and DNA sequencing of sets of genes or the complete genomes of selected organisms, with organizing the results in databases, and with applications of the data (as in medicine or biology) — compare ....
the complete set of genes in the chromosomes of each cell of a specific organism. genomic, adj. Genetic structure Genetics All the genetic information in an organism's chromosomes and mitochondria; its size is given in base pairs.
A genome is an organism’s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build and maintain that organism.
