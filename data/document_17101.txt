Says there’s 400,000 anchor babies born in the United States a year, which are individuals coming to our country and having their children so their children can be U.S. citizens.. — Corey Lewandowski on Sunday, August 23rd, 2015 in an interview on CNN's State of the Union. To put this in perspective, that’s equivalent of the population of Tulsa, Okla.. We wondered whether there really were 400,000 anchor babies born in the United States every year (and yes, that is the population size of Tulsa).
If the $8,000 cost is used for 2007 births, and all 380,000 babies born to illegal immigrants in the U.S. all had normal deliveries, this would cost hospitals around the country approximately $3 billion. But if there are 726,000 anchor babies born in the U.S. each year, the cost skyrockets to nearly $6 billion. And if there are any complications with the pregnancy, or if the child is born prematurely and needs to be admitted into a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the cost rises by tens of thousands of dollars. When using the higher estimate of 20 million illegal immigrants and FAIR’s 33 births per 1,000, this would roughly double FAIR’s estimate to approximately 574,000 to 726,000 anchor babies born in the U.S. each year. Having a child born in the U.S. does not prevent the illegal alien mother or father from being deported.
Lewandowski said that 400,000 anchor babies are born in the U.S. every year. The claim is not as straight-forward as it seems. First, the figure is outdated — a more accurate number for the amount of births to undocumented immigrants is 300,000. To put this in perspective, that’s equivalent of the population of Tulsa, Okla.. We wondered whether there really were 400,000 anchor babies born in the United States every year (and yes, that is the population size of Tulsa).
study released this week. The number of children born to illegal immigrants in the U.S. jumped to 4 million from 2.7 million in a six-year period and the children of illegal aliens accounted for 340,000 out of the 4.3 million babies born in 2008, the latest year for which figures were available. U.S. taxpayers already dish out around $52 billion to educate the children of illegal aliens with local governments taking the biggest hit (nearly $50 billion) and the feds contributing about $2 billion.
Current estimates indicate there may be over 300,000 anchor babies born each year in the U.S., thus causing illegal alien mothers to add more to the U.S. population each year than immigration from all sources in an average year before 1965. Babies born to illegal alien mothers within U.S. borders are called anchor babies because under the 1965 immigration Act, they act as an anchor that pulls the illegal alien mother and eventually a host of other relatives into permanent U.S. residency. (Jackpot babies is another term).
According to Marjorie Greenfield, MD, on the Dr. Spock website, in 2001 the average cost of having a baby in the U.S. ranged from $6,000 to $8,000 for a normal vaginal delivery and $10,000 to $12,000 for a cesarean birth. When using the higher estimate of 20 million illegal immigrants and FAIR’s 33 births per 1,000, this would roughly double FAIR’s estimate to approximately 574,000 to 726,000 anchor babies born in the U.S. each year. Having a child born in the U.S. does not prevent the illegal alien mother or father from being deported.
The cost of K-12 public school alone for a U.S.-born child of illegal migrants is, at a minimum, around $160,000 (using the average cost $12,300 per pupil per year). Additionally, under universities’ system of racial preferences, anchor babies will get bonus SAT and GPA points when they apply to college. Additionally, U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are entitled to American public schools, health care, and more, even though illegal-alien households rarely pay taxes. This means that one anchor baby is delivered every 93 seconds, based on the 2008 census data analyzed by the Pew.
Report Abuse. Anchor Babies are a problem. Over 300,000 Anchor Babies are born EACH year. Delivering babies costs hospitals THOUSANDS of dollars and these bills are left to be paid by the hospitals and the tax payers. Hospitals like McAllen Texas Medical Center have uncompensated care of over $200 million a year! K-12 education at average rate of $9,644.00 per year per child. Breakfast/lunch provided to anchor babies at $5.00 per meal. English as second language at $1,000
