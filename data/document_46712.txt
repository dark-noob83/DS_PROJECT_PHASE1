All habitable rooms (i.e. rooms for living, sleeping, eating or cooking) shall be provided with natural light by means of exterior glazed openings with an area not less than 1/10 of the floor area of such rooms with a minimum of 10 square feet.
At least one habitable room in the dwelling must have a floor area of at least 120 square feet. The minimum required floor area for a habitable room is 70 square feet, except that kitchens shall have not less than 50 square feet of gross floor area.
The 8% number is not about egress at all, only about natural light. The 8% glazing to floor area ratio is a requirement of the IRC 2009 section 303.1 which reads: R303.1 Habitable rooms. All habitable rooms shall have an aggregate glazing area of not less than 8 percent of the floor area of such rooms.
All habitable rooms shall be provided with natural ventilation by means of openable exterior openings with an area not less than 1/20 of the floor area of such rooms with a minimum of 5 square feet.
The Building Code of Australia has a minimum requirement for natural light to a habitable room. It is calculated based on the floor area of a habitable room. A window opening is required that has an area 10% of the floor area of the room. Light may also be borrowed from the adjoining room.
For example: For a 20m2 room the minimum area required for natural light is 10%. If a rooflight is installed only 0.6m2 would be required. If the roof light was only 0.3m2, then a window or equivalent borrowed light would be necessary. This would need to be an additional 1.0m2.
