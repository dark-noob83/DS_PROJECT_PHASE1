The ‘Ruru’ Morepork is New Zealand’s most widespread owl species. A bird of the bush and the night, it is also an important species in Maori mythology. The Morepork is the only remaining native owl species found in New Zealand apart from the Barn Owl, which has only very recently colonised New Zealand from Australia. It is also the only species of owl in New Zealand that inhabits forests.
The Ruru is a powerful figure in Maori mythology and tradition. Being said to originate from the underworld, the Morepork (Ruru) is strongly associated with the spirit world in Maori mythology.
For example, it is believed that if a Morepork sits conspicuously nearby or enters a house there will be a death in the family and in times gone by these strong beliefs led to some Taranaki Maori eating Morepork, believing that it would prolong their lives.

The call of the Morepork is iconic in New Zealand, like the Kookaburra is to Australia and the Fish Eagle is to Africa – as such it has deep spiritual and cultural meaning to the New Zealand Maori. Morepork are most well known for their “More-Pork” call but they also make a repetitive “cree” sound.
Possibly about 1000 years ago Polynesians left the land of “Hawaiki” and migrated to New Zealand, although it’s impossible to find Hawaiki on a map, because it is a part of Maori myths and legends, we can say for sure that they came from an island or group of islands in Polynesia, the South Pacific Ocean.
The melancholy call of the morepork is a familiar night-time soundtrack in New Zealand. The morepork is named for the sound of its call, and for the same reason is also known as the ruru to Maori, and in Norfolk Island is called the boo-book (say each of those names out loud to understand why).
