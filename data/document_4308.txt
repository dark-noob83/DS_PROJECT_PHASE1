Best Answer: 900 mg is typically the dose used for anxiety although Gabapentin is not approved for treating anxiety and there is almost no evidence it is effective so the best dose is more of a guess. In some cases people may take 1,200 mg/day. The reason it is sometimes used it that is not a substance of abuse and certain anti-anxiety drugs, benzodiazepines, have a small potential for abuse. The rate of titration your doctor is using sounds perfectly normal, if your prescription days to take 300 mg three times daily in two days then do.
NEURONTIN is given orally with or without food. Patients should be informed that, should they break the scored 600 mg or 800 mg tablet in order to administer a half-tablet, they should take the unused half-tablet as the next dose. Half-tablets not used within 28 days of breaking the scored tablet should be discarded. The effective dose of NEURONTIN in patients 5 to 11 years of age is 25 mg/kg/day to 35 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. NEURONTIN may be administered as the oral solution, capsule, or tablet, or using combinations of these formulations.
The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The effective dose of NEURONTIN is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. The effective dose of NEURONTIN in patients 5 to 11 years of age is 25 mg/kg/day to 35 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. NEURONTIN may be administered as the oral solution, capsule, or tablet, or using combinations of these formulations.
Gabapentin is a medication that needs to be gradually increased. The usual recommendation for pain from shingles is; day 1; one 300 mg pill. day 2: one 300 mg pill twice daily. day 3: one 300 mg pill three times a day. and thereafter working up to 600 mg three times a day.
Oral Bioavailability. Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. In a single (400 mg) and multiple dose (400 mg three times a day) study of NEURONTIN in epileptic patients (N=8) maintained on phenytoin monotherapy for at least 2 months, gabapentin had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenytoin had no effect on gabapentin pharmacokinetics.

Your gabapentin dosage depends on several of factors that include your age and weight, the medical condition being treated, other medications currently taken, and other underlying medical conditions. The following information provides only the average dosage as indicated by the manufacturer. The usual maintenance dose is 900 mg per day given in 3 divided doses. If necessary, the maintenance dose may be increased up to the maximum daily dose of 1,800 mg, until the condition is under control. Children (aged 3 to 12 years old) should be given individualized dosage of gabapentin based on childâ€™s body weight. The recommended initial dose ranges from 10-15 mg/kg/day given in three divided doses, then titrated until the effective dose is reached
The starting dose range is 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The effective dose of NEURONTIN in patients 3 to 4 years of age is 40 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The effective dose of NEURONTIN in patients 5 to 11 years of age is 25 mg/kg/day to 35 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. NEURONTIN may be administered as the oral solution, capsule, or tablet, or using combinations of these formulations.
Gabapentin can be initiated at doses of 100 to 300 mg at bedtime or 100 to 300 mg three times daily. The dose should be titrated by 100 to 300 mg every 3 to 7 days as tolerated to a maximum dose of 3600 mg per day. The usual effective dose is 1800 mg to 3600 mg per day, which may take several weeks to achieve.
