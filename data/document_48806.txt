In 2015, a taxpayer can give up to $14,000 per person per year without being taxed on the gift. For example, this year you could give Friend A $14,000, Friend B $14,000, and your sister $14,000 and not be taxed on your gifts. Also, another way for parents to avoid the gift tax is to remember that each parent is entitled to their own individual $14,000 exclusion. This means that your mother and father could each give you $14,000 this year — for a total of $28,000 — without being taxed on that gift.
If you give people a lot of money, you might have to pay a federal gift tax. But the IRS also allows you to give up to $14,000 in 2014 to any number of people without facing any gift taxes, and without the recipient owing any income tax on the gifts. If you have 1,000 friends on whom you wish to bestow $14,000 each, you can give away $14 million a year without even having to fill out a federal gift-tax form. That $14 million would be out of your estate for good.
For deaths in 2015, everyone has a lifetime gift and estate tax exemption of $5.43 million, which means you can leave or give away up to $5.43 million without owing any federal tax. This amount goes up every year to adjust for inflation. For instance, if you give your daughter $20,000 on December 17, $6,000 of it is taxable. You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax.
In any given year, you can give up to $13,000 per child, without incurring any kind of reporting requirement, and without any gift tax liability. If you are married, you and your spouse can each give this amount, or $26,000 total. You can give more than this amount, but if you do, you must file an IRS Form 709. The short answer to the question is as much as you like.. The IRS sets no cap on the total amount of money you can give your child each year. However, there are tax consequences for gifts over a certain amount, and the IRS imposes a lifetime $5.12 million gift tax exemption as well.
But most gifts are not subject to the gift tax. For instance, you can give up to the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 in 2014) to any number of people every year, without facing any gift taxes. Recipients generally never owe income tax on the gifts. If you have 1,000 friends on whom you wish to bestow $14,000 each, you can give away $14 million a year without even having to fill out a federal gift-tax form. That $14 million would be out of your estate for good.
Gifts. According to the IRS, certain gifts are not taxable. These include gifts that are less than the annual exclusion amount. As of 2012, a married couple can give up to $26,000 tax-free, referred to as gift splitting.. If you pay tuition or medical expenses for someone, you don't have to pay tax on the money. Gifts to your spouse are also tax-free

Beyond the $5.34 million level, you would actually have to pay the gift tax. If you have 1,000 friends on whom you wish to bestow $14,000 each, you can give away $14 million a year without even having to fill out a federal gift-tax form.

In 2011, for example, tax-free gifts were capped at $13,000. You may give money to your spouse that exceeds the cap without incurring the gift tax. In addition, if you gave away $13,000 in cash in 2011, you might have had to pay the gift tax if you also passed some of your real estate property to another. Based on 2011 figures, the most you pay in gift taxes is equal to 35 percent of the taxable cash you give away. The top rate applies when the taxable amount of your gift is over $500,000. On the lowest end of the gift-tax table, you owe the IRS 18 percent on taxable figures under $10,000.
