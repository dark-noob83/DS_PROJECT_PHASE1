Hens lay approximately 5 eggs per 7 day week. Sperm from a rooster is stored in the hen's oviduct for up to 10 days, so after just a single successful mating many fertilized e â€¦ ggs can be laid. Depending on when the hen's last egg was laid, the next egg laid after the hen was mated will most likely be fertile.
Most hens will start laying between 5-7 months of age. They will lay best at 1 to 2 years of age. All pullets (female chicken under 1 year of age) lay small eggs at first and after a while will lay larger eggs. Younger hens will lay 1 egg every 3-4 days. A hen 30 weeks old can lay 2 eggs every 3 days. Some have been known to lay an egg a day.
Chickens usually don't simply stop laying eggs when they get to a certain age, but they will lay fewer as they get older. That said, most laying breeds will lay more or less productively in backyard terms for five or seven years.
Fertilized eggs will hatch 21 days after the hen begins incubating (sitting on) the nest. Caution is advised with some broody hens; they may keep laying or collect eggs into a giant nest that they are unable to properly incubate.
For backyard/pet chickens, the peak laying time is the first 3 to 4 years of age. Again, this can vary greatly between individual birds and breeds. Hens don't have a definite end to egg-laying, but eggs become fewer and at greater intervals as they age.
A rooster is necessary to have fertilized eggs, but a hen will lay eggs even if no rooster is present. Incubation time for fertilized eggs is 21 days. Days 1-18 require an internal temperature of 99.5 F and a humidity of 50-60%. Days 18-21 require an internal temp of 99.5 and a humidity of 70-80%.
