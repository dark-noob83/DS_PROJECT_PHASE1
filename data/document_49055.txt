A wet cell battery is an electrochemical cell that uses a liquid electrolyte, or medium of exchanging electrons, instead of a pasty electrolyte used in dry cell batteries. A basic wet cell battery could consist of a copper plate and a zinc plate partially immersed in lemon juice.
There are two types of batteries: wet cell and dry cell. A wet cell battery operates by means of a liquid electrolyte solution, while in a dry cell battery the solution is in the form of a paste. Some wet cells can be recharged, while others are only good for a shorter period of time.
A wet cell is a galvanic electrochemical cell with a liquid electrolyte. A dry cell, on the other hand, is a cell with a pasty electrolyte. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry.
A wet-cell battery is the original type of rechargeable battery. It is commonly found in aviation, electric utilities, energy storage and cellphone towers. The battery contains a liquid electrolyte such as sulfuric acid, a dangerous corrosive liquid that damages what it comes into contact with.
A wet cell is a cell that contains a liquid electrolyte. Most batteries have a paste electrolyte. Car batteries have a liquid electrolyte. They are inconvenient because the electrolyte can be spilled. Most early batteries had liquid electrolytes. People still use wet cells where they need high power, such as in in cars.
wet cell. An electric cell in which the chemicals producing the current are in the form of a liquid rather than in the form of a paste (as in a dry cell). Car batteries consist of a series of wet cells.
