A TENS Unit is one of several kinds of electrotherapy devices that use very small doses of electric current to promote natural pain relief. The word TENS, sometimes abbreviated as T.E.N.S., stands for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator.
A. TENS, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, is a back pain treatment that uses low voltage electric current to relieve pain. TENS is typically done with a TENS unit, a small battery-operated device. The device can be hooked to a belt and is connected to two electrodes.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a therapy that uses low-voltage electrical current for pain relief. You do TENS with a small, battery-powered machine about the size of a pocket radio. Usually, you connect two electrodes (wires that conduct electrical current) from the machine to your skin.
Sections. A TENS unit, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit, sends electric currents to the nerves in the back to help relieve back pain. The pulsation is usually at a lower voltage, though patients can choose to increase the intensity of the electric pulse if needed.
A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit is a device that sends small electrical currents to targeted body parts. These currents are used to relieve pain. Some TENS units are designed for use in a hospital or healthcare facility.
