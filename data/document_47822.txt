In the deep jungle mango trees, fighting for light, commonly reach 40m (120 feet) high, in plantations about 15m (45 feet).
Mango trees can be grown from seed, but like many fruit trees a seedling will not reliably yield a fruit exactly like its parent tree (unless it is from a polembryonic seedling, see propagation section below). For this reason, to guarantee the type of fruit you are getting you need to buy a grafted mango tree.
Mango trees are large plants that can grow to towering heights of 100 feet. Their round canopy can spread up to 125 feet wide as they age -- and these trees can survive for 300 years while still producing fruit. If the soil is deep, their roots can descend 20 feet.
Though yield depends on the variety of mango trees you have, you can expect up to 200 or 300 fruits once a mango tree is 10 to 20 years old.
Water your mango tree. Mango trees donâ€™t like a ton of water, but the first week watering should be slightly above average. Give the plant a few tablespoons of water every other day for the first week, and then water them only once or twice a week for the first year.
The mango is a very attractive, evergreen tree with glossy, dense foliage. The new shoots are reddish, the mature leaves a dark green. Depending on the variety mango trees can grow huge (to 35 m and 15 m across for seedling trees of older varieties). But you can keep a mango tree small by pruning it regularly. A mango tree in full flower is a sight to behold. The large pink panicles are at the ends of the branches and cover the whole tree.
