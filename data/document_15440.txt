re broadcast domains and collision domains each vlan is a separate broadcast domain vlan broadcast domain each port on a switch is a separate collision domain hense a 24 port switch has potentially 24 collision domains fyi a hub has a single collision domain regardless of the number of ports re broadcast domains and collision domains a collision domain is a physical network segment where data packets can collide with one another for being sent on a shared medium in particular in the ethernet networking protocol this is an ethernet term used to describe a network scenario wherein one particular device
collision domain a collision domain is a section of a network where data packets can collide with one another when being sent on a shared medium or through repeaters particularly when using early versions of ethernet a network collision occurs when more than one device attempts to send a packet on a network segment at the same time 
collision domain first what is a collision maybe the question you have is what is the difference between a layer 2 and layer 3 broadcast collisions are considered part of the physical layer in the iso model the physical layer is the cables an example would be copper also referred to as transmission media or medium
a collision domain is a logical area in a computer network where data packets can collide with one another the term is used mainly with regard to ethernet which is by far the most commonly used type of local area network lan thus a collision domain could also be defined as being all the network segments between a pair of bridges or other layer two devices the optimal size of a collision domain depends on a number of factors among them is the number of collisions as a higher number of them results in a lower efficiency of
a collision domain is an area on the network where two devices may attempt to transmit at the same time a hub has 1 collision domain overall a switch has 1 collision domain per interface the fewer devices in 1 collision domain the better 
a collision domain is a section of a network connected by a shared medium or through repeaters where data packets can collide with one another when being sent particularly when using early versions of ethernet only one device in the collision domain may transmit at any one time and the other devices in the domain listen to the network in order to avoid data collisions because only one device may be transmitting at any one time total network bandwidth is shared among all devices
a computer network can be segmented physically and logically a collision domain is one of the logical network segments in which the data packets can collide with each other one of the most common protocols used when referring to a collision domain is the ethernet protocol collision domains are often referred to as ethernet segments the term collision domain is also used when describing the circumstances in which a single network device sends packets throughout a network segment and forces every other device in that network segment to pay attention to those packets
primarily in switched networks every port on the switch is considered a separate collision domain bridges and routers are another method for isolating collision domains collisions occur at the osi open systems interconnect layer 1 or physical layer maybe the question you have is what is the difference between a layer 2 and layer 3 broadcast collisions are considered part of the physical layer in the iso model the physical layer is the cables an example would be copper also referred to as transmission media or medium
a collision domain is as the name implies a part of a network where packet collisions can occur a collision occurs when two devices send a packet at the same time on the shared network segment the packets collide and both devices must send the packets again which reduces network efficiency collisions are often in a hub environment because each port on a hub is in the same collision domain by contrast each port on a bridge a switch or a router is in a separate collision domain the following example illustrates collision domains as you can see we have 6 collision domains tip remember each port on a hub is in the same collision domain
