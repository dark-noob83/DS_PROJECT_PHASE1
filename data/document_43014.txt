Xylem vessels xylem vessel: Vein-like tissue which transports water and minerals up a plant are involved in the movement of water through a plant from its roots to its leaves. Water: 1  Is absorbed from the soil through root hair cells. Phloem. Phloem vessels phloem vessel: Vein-like structures through which food is transported round a plant are involved in translocation translocation: The transport of dissolved material within a plant. . This is the movement of food substances from the stems to growing tissues and storage tissues.
Xylem and phloem are the two types of vascular tissues found in plants. Xylem tissues transport water from the roots throughout the plant, while phloem transports food (suga … rs) from photosysnthesis throughout the plant. Xylem: tubes that brings water and minerals from the roots into the leaf. The xylem are larger and have lignified walls. This increases their strength and allows the xylem to transport water under pressure. The phloem on the other hand are smaller a … nd are responsible for carrying organic nutrients, especially sucrose, through the plant. Hope this helps.
Phloem on the other hand is composed of living cells and is reserved for the flow of photosynthate (i.e. the sugars produced via photosynthesis). The photosynthate is also carried as a water based solution, however it moves via positive hydrostatic pressure (as opposed to that of the xylem which is negative). That said, the xylem will continue will grow as new dead cell layers accumulate over the years, while the phloem will not appear that much larger being that is composed of living tissue only. .

Xylem: tubes that brings water and minerals from the roots into the leaf. There is a layer of living Phloem and there is a layer of living xylem. Both these layer produce dead tissue, the Phloem produces bark (dead protective outer layer), the … xylem produces wood (dead supportive inner layer). Both the wood and the bark are dead.
Xylem. Xylem vessels xylem vessel: Vein-like tissue which transports water and minerals up a plant are involved in the movement of water through a plant from its roots to its leaves. Water: 1  Is absorbed from the soil through root hair cells. 2  Is transported through the xylem vessels up the stem to the leaves. Phloem. Phloem vessels phloem vessel: Vein-like structures through which food is transported round a plant are involved in translocation translocation: The transport of dissolved material within a plant. . This is the movement of food substances from the stems to growing tissues and storage tissues.
Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that perform transportation of food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles. They work together as a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, minerals and water. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plants to storage organs like roots, tubers or bulbs. This video explains the biological makeup of xylem and phloem and their role in plant transport.
In biology, structure of things is related to function. Xylem serves to transport water from the roots up through the shoots and the rest of the plant. Since water is more imp … ortant to living things than food is, it makes sense that its structure is a larger diameter. There is a layer of living Phloem and there is a layer of living xylem. Both these layer produce dead tissue, the Phloem produces bark (dead protective outer layer), the … xylem produces wood (dead supportive inner layer). Both the wood and the bark are dead.
Xylem and phloem, the two conducting tissues of the plant vascular system, are of tremendous fundamental interest and economic importance. Xylem is the water-conducting tissue, and secondary xylem provides the raw material for the forest products industry. The growth of secondary xylem and phloem depends on the division of cells in the vascular cambium and results in an increase in the diameter of the root and stem.
Plants have two different types of transport tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots. Plants have adaptations to reduce excessive water loss. Phloem. Phloem vessels phloem vessel: Vein-like structures through which food is transported round a plant are involved in translocation translocation: The transport of dissolved material within a plant. . This is the movement of food substances from the stems to growing tissues and storage tissues.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: The xylem carries water and soluble nutrients and is powered by transpirational pull and/or root pressure. Being that water is necessary for all biochemical reactions to occur, it is paramount that the entire organism (i.e. all cells) receive ample amounts of water. That said, the xylem will continue will grow as new dead cell layers accumulate over the years, while the phloem will not appear that much larger being that is composed of living tissue only. .
