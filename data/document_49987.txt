What is the income tax on a salary of Rs.12 lakhs per annum? I recently got a job opportunity at a private company in Pune where they are offering me a salary of Rs 12 lakhs per annum. I have investments totaling Rs 1 lakh annually. Someone told me that since I have investments of Rs 1 lakhs, I would have to pay an income tax of 33% on 50,000 Rs, which is Rs.16,500 per month. Is that true? As I would be relocating to Pune from Mumbai, I would have other expenditures like rent and food.
