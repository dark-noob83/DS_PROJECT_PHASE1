Depending on the temperature of the oven and the size of the cod, it should take about fifteen minutes to bake code. Instead of relying on timing, you should learn how to judge when your fish is done. Cod, like most fish, can be checked for doneness by using a fork or knife to gently prod the fish.
For safety, meat (any kind) should never be allowed to rise above the temperature of your fridge, about 1 or 2 degrees Celsius, or 34 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit. Meat should go … from your fridge, to the counter for preparation (if any), then either back in the fridge to await cooking or onto your cooking surface.
The internal temperature for a done fish should be 145 degrees. At this temperature the fish should be opaque throughout and flake easily when tested with a fork. Like you, I prefer my Salmon to be medium, so the internal temperature will not be 145. As far as the internal temperature for other fish.
Cooking time will vary greatly depending not only on the cut of fish but also the cooking method. In general, your cod will be done when it reaches an internal temperature of 54°C (130°F), regardless of cooking method. Here are some times/temperatures that work for me: 1  Sous Vide: 10 minutes or more at 56°C, followed by a quick broiling/grilling/blow torch. 2  Baking (thick fillets): 15–20 minutes at 218°C (425°F).
Cod should be baked at about 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes. This is more than sufficient cooking time since cod is a delicate fish and is easily overcooked. When in doubt, if the fish flakes easily with a fork it is finished cooking and ready to eat.
The desirable temperature while cooking pork seems to be around 163°C-191°C (325-375 °F). Many cookbooks suggest that they be cooked at that temperature for approximately 4-5 hours. Also, the inner temperature of the pork should be around 71 °C (160 °F) before it is safe to be eaten.
