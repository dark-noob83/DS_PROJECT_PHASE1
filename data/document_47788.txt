No, you won't need your old modem with AT&T U-verse High Speed Internet service. 1  If you are an existing AT&T DSL customer who orders AT&T U-verse TV and AT&T U-verse High Speed Internet, service includes professional installation of a wireless gateway supporting wireless home networking.
FREE HD Receiver upgrades (non DVRs): DISH versus AT&T U-verse DISH offers up to three non-DVR, HD receiver upgrades free (more on DVR offers below). The HD free for 24 months promotion with DISH does not require that you order an HD-DVR. AT&T U-verse does not offer a non-DVR, HD receiver.

No. U-verse replaces both Cable TV and Satellite TV, so you do not need to buy an extra service. This does not necessarily mean U-verse will be less expensive for you, but it does make your service options much more simple. The format is called IPTV, or Internet Protocol Television.
AT&T U-verse is a combo service consisting of U-verse Internet, TV, and voice (VoIP based phone) services. Services can be ordered in bundle or separately. Not all combinations are available in all areas of AT&T's service.
If both Uverse and Dish Network are available to you and monthly cost is not a concern then I would recommend AT&T Uverse. Uverse does not require installation of a satellite dish on the roof, is not affected by weather, and offers bundle packages that interlink web, phone and internet. However, if monthly cost is a factor for you, then the Dish Network may be the better choice. Currently I have the Uverse U200 package.
In any event, I'm not sure if the 1 year free DISH Network service is being offered nationwide, but if you're interested in FREE DISH Network service, it can hurt to head over to your local Best Buy and see if an AT&T U-verse rep is there. Or you can call 877-MY-UVERSE.
