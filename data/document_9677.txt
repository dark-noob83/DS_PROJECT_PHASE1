Other health problems can cause symptoms like those of an ACL injury. They include a bone break or injuries to the knee cushions (menisci) or to other ligaments in the knee. For more information on knee injuries, see: 1  Knee Problems and Injuries. 2  Patellar Tracking Disorder.
An ACL knee injury can occur either when there is direct contact with the knee or from an awkward movement, usually when the foot is fixed to the ground e.g. when wearing studs/cleats. Non-Contact Injuries: These account for 80% of all anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a ligament that connects the tibia to the femur. It serves to prevent the tibia (leg) from moving forward relative to the femur (thigh). The ACL is in the center of the knee. It crosses the PCL, hence the name, cruciate.

Topic Overview. An anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, injury is a tear in one of the knee ligaments that joins the upper leg bone with the lower leg bone. The ACL keeps the knee stable. Injuries range from mild, such as a small tear, to severe, such as when the ligament tears completely or when the ligament and part of the bone separate from the rest of the bone. Without treatment, the injured ACL is less able to control knee movement, and the bones are more likely to rub against each other.
