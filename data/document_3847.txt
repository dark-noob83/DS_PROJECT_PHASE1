So what happens if you take in more or fewer calories than your body burns? You either gain or lose fat, respectively. An accumulation of 3,500 extra calories is stored by your body as 1 pound of fat -- fat is the body's way of saving energy for a rainy day.
If your calorie intake is low that day, your cells can convert excess amino acids to molecules that can burn as fuel. On the other hand, if you consume plenty of calories, your body has no choice but to convert the extra protein to fatty acids and store them in your adipose tissue.
Eating too much protein can add excess calories to your diet. Your body does not maintain a store of excess amino acids, the building blocks of protein, and you must therefore include high-quality protein in your daily diet. This nutrient contributes to muscle growth, circulatory health, tissue repair, enzyme and hormone synthesis and the development of a robust immune system.
Excess calories are turned into fat, and it takes 3500 extra calories to add one pound of body weight. So if you consume 500 more calories a day than what your body burns, then you will gain one pound of body weight per week.
Fat Storage. Once your glycogen stores are full, your body stores excess calories from carbohydrate as fat. Excess calories from fat and protein intake get stored as fat in the body as well. Adipose cells, or fat cells, store the extra calories in the form of triglycerides, a type of fatty acid.
Your body stores excess calories as fat. If you eat excess calories, your body stores the energy as glycogen or fat to use at a later time. These compounds get stored in your liver, muscles and fat cells. Overtime, continually eating excess calories causes your body fat stores to expand, resulting in weight gain.
