Humoral vs Cell Mediated Immunity. Immunity is the ability of an organism to defend against pathogens and toxins and to avoid infections and diseases. This is basically provided by the immune system, which is composed primarily of individual cells spread throughout the body, rather than forming into organs.
humoral immunity. n. The component of the immune response involving the transformation of B cells into plasma cells that produce and secrete antibodies to a specific antigen.
B cell activation and Humoral Immunity Humoral immunity is mediated by secreted antibodies and its physiological function is defense against extracellular microbes (including viruses) and microbial exotoxins.
antigen specific immunity attributable to the production of antibody and of specific immune T lymphocytes (responsible for cell-mediated immunity), following exposure to an antigen, or passive transfer of antibody or immune lymphoid cells (adoptive immunity).
The Immune System: Humoral Immunity 1. Antibodies can be found on the plasma membrane of ________________ (where they act as antigen receptors) or free in the extracellular fluid, here they are known as ______________________________. 2.
• Humoral immunity is mediated by B-cells while cell-mediated immunity is mediated by T-cells. • In the humoral immunity, the B-cells secrete antibodies whereas in the cell-mediated immunity, the T-cells do not secrete receptors. T-cell receptors are bound to the T-cells and the cells themselves bind with antigens.
Humoral Immunity. Antibodies in the body's humors (blood, lymph) provide defense Antibodies target bacteria & free viruses and mark them for destruction by phagocytes or complement of nonspecific/innate immune system.
