TESTS. Blood tests to measure TSH, T4, T3 and Free T4 are readily available and widely used. Tests to evaluate thyroid function include the following: TSH TESTS The best way to initially test thyroid function is to measure the TSH level in a blood sample. A high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is failing because of a problem that is directly affecting the thyroid (primary hypothyroidism).
Thyroid function tests are blood tests which help to check the function of the thyroid gland. They are mainly used to detect hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). Note: the information below is a general guide only.
Thyroid hormone tests are blood tests that check how well the thyroid gland is working. The thyroid gland makes hormones that regulate the way the body uses energy. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland that lies in front of your windpipe (trachea), just below your voice box (larynx).
Thyroid function tests are used to tell whether your thyroid is working normally. The most common thyroid function tests are: 1  Total, or free T4 (the main thyroid hormone in your blood). 2  TSH (the hormone from the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid to produce T4). 3  T3 (also included sometimes).
Thyroid function test. A blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether there's a problem. The test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) in the blood.
