Self-Referral is referral by a physician to an entity with which the physician or a member of the physician's family has a financial relationship. The relationship is such that the physician would earn a financial return based on the success of, for example, a speech and hearing clinic in which the physician invested.

(February 2010). Physician self-referral is a term describing the practice of a physician ordering tests on a patient and that are performed by either the referring physician himself or a fellow faculty member from whom he receives financial compensation in return for the referral. The incentive for this practice is largely the result of rapidly declining reimbursements for what has been termed cognitive physician care, i.e. the time spent talking to a patient and determining what course of diagnostic testing or treatment would be best.
