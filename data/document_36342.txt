Let’s say the extra cost of double glazing is $ 5,000, and you’re taking out a 25 year principal and interest mortgage, and paying 4.84% interest. The EXTRA $ 5,000 will cost you an extra $ 28.19 per month to repay. That’s only $ 338 a year. Depending on your building envelope double glazing can reduce your heating and cooling costs by up to 50%. In most scenarios, the savings per year are greater than the extra cost of fitting double glazing
