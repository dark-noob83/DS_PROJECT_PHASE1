If a temporal artery biopsy shows no signs of inflammation but your symptoms strongly suggest giant cell arteritis, you and your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of treatment and of no treatment. You and your doctor will decide whether or not you will proceed with treatment. If you are taking high-dose corticosteroids, the biopsy result may not be accurate. In this case, any biopsy testing must be performed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 to 5 days. Biopsies done more than about a week after the start of high-dose corticosteroids may be falsely normal (false-negative).
Temporal artery biopsy. A temporal artery biopsy is most commonly used to test for giant cell arteritis. During the procedure, the skin on the side of your head is numbed with a local anaesthetic. An incision is made close to the hairline in front of your ear, and a small sample of your temporal artery is removed. Blood tests. If your GP suspects you may have giant cell arteritis, they'll refer you for blood tests to help assess the levels of inflammation inside your body. Two blood tests that you may have are erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
An Overview of Temporal Artery Biopsy. A temporal artery biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from your temporal artery and then studied under a microscope to check for signs of inflammation and damage. On the day of the biopsy, you will change into a hospital gown and may be taken to a special room where the procedure will be done. Your healthcare provider will locate your temporal artery. He or she will then use a small needle to deliver medicine that will numb the skin near the biopsy site.
If you have symptoms of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and your doctor believes you may have it, he or she may order a temporal artery biopsy to make sure. If you are taking high-dose corticosteroids, the biopsy result may not be accurate. In this case, any biopsy testing must be performed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 to 5 days. Biopsies done more than about a week after the start of high-dose corticosteroids may be falsely normal (false-negative).

INTRODUCTION. Temporal artery biopsy is the primary modality for establishing a diagnosis of giant cell (temporal) arteritis. Giant cell arteritis is a chronic vasculitis affecting medium and large diameter arteries, predominantly in older individuals [ 1,2 ]. Temporal artery biopsy, which identifies the characteristic histopathology, remains the primary modality to diagnose giant cell (temporal) arteritis [ 6,7 ].
(Giant Cell Arteritis). Temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis, is an inflammatory condition that affects the medium to large arteries in the body. It is a systemic condition, which means that any medium to large artery in any part of the body can be affected. This includes the eye, brain and heart. Temporal artery biopsy: This is performed under local anesthesia and can take up to 40 minutes. It involves shaving hair from your temple and then making a 1 to 2 inch incision. A small piece of your superficial temporal artery is removed and sent to the laboratory for histopathological analysis.
