Tonic fibers: Insertion: the point of attachment of a muscle that moves the most when the muscle shortens, and is the most distal end of limb muscles. For the biceps, the belly lies anterior to the humerus, the origin the coracoid process of the scapula, and the insertion is the radial tuberosity. 
The ________ of a muscle is usually attached to a fixed location. origin. Part C. The __________ of a muscle is usually attached to a movable location. insertion. Part C. When the forearm is extended at the elbow joint, the _______________ muscle acts as the prime mover (agonist).

A muscle insertion is the end of a muscle attached to the free-moving bone of its joint. A muscle origin is the end of the muscle attached to the relatively fixed bone of the joint. 
1  “When a muscle contracts, it knows no direction – it simply shortens.” –Lippert  Muscles are attached to bones and to describe the relative points of attachment, we use the terms origin and insertion. 
Complete the following statements: The _______________________ of a muscle is usually attached to a fixed location. STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION: 
Lesson Summary. In summary, skeletal muscles are attached to bones on each end by tendons. The origin is the fixed attachment, while the insertion moves with contraction. The action, or particular movement of a muscle, can be described relative to the joint or the body part moved. Groups of muscles are involved in most movements and names are used to describe the role of each muscle involved. Skeletal muscles attached to bone are responsible for movement and support. Muscles work in groups to produce a particular movement. This lesson describes how muscle origins and insertions dictate the type of movement that occurs when a muscle contracts.
Muscles: Terminology and Function. Muscles consist of a fleshy belly which is usually attached to bone at each end by a region of dense connective tissue. In most cases this connective tissue forms a cord-like structure called a tendon. In large, flat muscles the tendon is often a flattened sheet called an aponeurosis. Movements. Because a muscle can move the bone to which it is attached in only one direction, muscles are found in opposing pairs; such opposing pairs are called antagonists. In some cases two muscles may perform the same action; two such muscles are called synergists.
A muscle insertion is the end of a muscle attached to the free-moving bone of its joint. A muscle origin is the end of the muscle attached to the relatively fixed bone of the … joint. 4 people found this useful. Answered. The movable end of a muscle is called the insertion. The immobile end is called the origin. Shortening, or contraction, of a muscle causes the origin and insertion to beco … me closer to one another.
