Generally, the correlation of temperature results are as follows: 1  The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
You can take a temperature using the mouth (oral), anus (rectal), armpit (axillary), or ear (tympanic). But the temperature readings vary depending on which one you use, and you need an accurate body temperature to determine if a fever is present. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period.
The normal range for ear temperatures taken with the Braun ThermoScan Instant Thermometer is from 35.8°C (96.4°F) to 38.0°C (100.4°F) for all ages.Normal body temperature also varies with age. We have the highest temperatures when we are younger. About our eleventh year, body temperature begins to decrease gradually. For your reference, the following chart shows normal ear temperature ranges by ages groups for the Braun ThermoScan Instant Thermometer:When consulting your physician about fever, remember to communicate that this is an ear temperature, referrring to the appropriate ear temperature range in the chart above.
1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
That is a fever in your ear. Ear thermometers are really not that accurate. You would be better off getting an oral thermometer and putting it under her arm (pit). I believe that you add 2 degrees to the ear temperature, so that would make your daughters temp 101.6. My doctor told me not to add to the underarm reading if it goes over 101. 
1 The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
1 In this age range you can also use a digital thermometer to take an armpit temperature, a temporal artery thermometer or a digital pacifier thermometer. 2  However, wait until your baby is at least 6 months old to use a digital ear thermometer. 1 Rectal temperature. 2  Turn on the digital thermometer and lubricate the tip of the thermometer with petroleum jelly. 3  Lay your baby or child on his or her back, lift his or her thighs, and insert the lubricated thermometer 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) into the rectum. 4  Stop if you feel any resistance.
1 Ear temperature. 2  Turn on the thermometer. 3  Gently place the thermometer in your child's ear. 4  Follow the directions that come with thermometer to ensure you insert the thermometer the proper distance into the ear canal. 5  Hold the thermometer tightly in place until the thermometer signals that it's done. 1 Rectal temperature. 2  Turn on the digital thermometer and lubricate the tip of the thermometer with petroleum jelly. 3  Lay your baby or child on his or her back, lift his or her thighs, and insert the lubricated thermometer 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) into the rectum. 4  Stop if you feel any resistance.
