1. Phylogeny refers to the evolutionary relationships between organisms. 2. Organisms can be classified into one of three domains based on differences in the sequences of nucleotides in the cell's ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), the cell's membrane lipid structure, and its sensitivity to antibiotics. 3. The three domains are the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya. 4. Prokaryotic organisms belong either to the domain Archaea or the domain Bacteria; organisms with eukaryotic cells belong to the domain Eukarya. 5. Microorganism transfer genes to other microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer-the transfer of DNA to an organism that is not its offspring.
The five-kingdom system of classifying organisms has given way to a three-domain system that better reflects current evolutionary research. Domain Bacteria and Domain Archaea are offshoots of what was once Kingdom Monera.
Under this system, organisms are classified into three domains and six kingdoms. The domains are Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The kingdoms are Archaebacteria (ancient bacteria), Eubacteria (true bacteria), Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. The Archaea and Bacteria domains contain prokaryotic organisms.
The Domain Eukarya arose from the first prokaryotic organisms more than 1.7 billion years ago. It includes all of the organisms with eukaryotic cells--that is, those with membranous organelles (including mitochondria and chloroplasts).
The domain Archaea has one kingdom: Archaea. The domain Bacteria has one kingdom: Bacteria. The domain Eukarya has four kingdo â€¦ ms: Protists, Fungi, Plants, and Animals. There are a total of 3 domains and 6 kingdoms.
Eubacteria are classified under the Bacteria domain and archaebacteria are classified as Archaeans. The Eukarya domain includes eukaryotes, or organisms that have a membrane bound nucleus. This domain is further subdivided into the kingdoms Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.
