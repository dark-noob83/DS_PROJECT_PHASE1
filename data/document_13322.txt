In the most broad definition of redox reactions: Oxidation is the loss of electrons Reduction is the gain of electrons. Because electrons are negatively charged, an increase in electrons means a decrease in overall charge (the compound becomes more negatively charged).
DEFINITIONS OF OXIDATION AND REDUCTION (REDOX) This page looks at the various definitions of oxidation and reduction (redox) in terms of the transfer of oxygen, hydrogen and electrons. It also explains the terms oxidising agent and reducing agent.
By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Oxidation Definition: Oxidation is the loss of electrons during a reaction by a molecule, atom or ion. Oxidation occurs when the oxidation state of a molecule, atom or ion is increased. An older meaning of oxidation was when oxygen was added to a compound. Example: Iron combines with oxygen to form iron oxide or rust.
oxidation-reduction-a reversible chemical reaction in which one reaction is an oxidation and the reverse is a reduction. oxidoreduction, redox. chemical reaction, reaction - (chemistry) a process in which one or more substances are changed into others; there was a chemical reaction of the lime with the ground water.
Oxidation is the opposite of reduction. A reduction reaction always comes together with an oxidation reaction. Oxidation and reduction together are called redox (reduction and oxidation). Oxygen does not have to be present in a reaction, for it to be a redox reaction.
