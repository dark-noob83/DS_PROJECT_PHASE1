2014 reporting requirements are available at http://www.entnet.org/pqrs How to Avoid the 2016 Penalty To avoid the 2016 penalty physicians must report quality measure data to CMS for PQRS during the 2014 reporting period. To avoid the 2016 penalty you can: 1. Earn a 2014 PQRS incentive payment (as outlined above) 2. PQRS is a CMS reporting program that uses a combination of incentive payments and penalties (payment adjustments) to promote reporting of quality information by physicians and other health professionals. Prior to 2010 the program was known as the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI)
1 PQRS is not a substitute for local quality improvement efforts. 2  Penalties in 2015 and beyond for those who did not successfully report two years earlier (e.g., -1.5% in 2015 if no successful reporting in 2013; -2.0% in 2016 and 2017 if no successful reporting in 2014 and 2015, respectively). Quality measures reporting is easy with PQRS Wizard, a simple and cost-effective online tool that collects and reports quality measures data under the CMS PQRS program.
