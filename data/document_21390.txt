Light itself takes 4.6 hours to travel from the Earth to Pluto. If you wanted to send a signal to Pluto, it would take 4.6 hours for your transmission to reach Pluto, and then an additional 4.6 hours for their message to return to us. Let’s talk spacecraft. 
View full size image. New Horizons is a NASA spacecraft on its way to the dwarf planet Pluto. It scooted by Jupiter in 2007, and will pass by Pluto in July 2015 before possibly heading farther into the Kuiper Belt — a massive zone of icy bodies beyond Neptune. 
The space shuttle gets up to a speed of about 4 miles per second maximum which … is enough to then coast in earth orbit for many days but not enough to get more than a few hundred miles up. Confidence votes 174K. There are three kinds of answers: ones that are mostly right, ones that are mostly wrong, and those that once were right but now are wrong. At the Shuttle's maximum speed of about 30,000 km/hr, it would take more than 16 years to reach Pluto. The New Horizons spacecraft was launched by NASA in 2006 and reached a new record velocity for spacecraft, more than 58,000 km/hr. It was further accelerated by a gravity assist from Jupiter in 2007
New Horizons launched on January 19, 2006, and it'll reach Pluto on July 14, 2015. Do a little math and you'll find that it has taken 9 years, 5 months and 25 days. The Voyager spacecraft did the distance between Earth and Pluto in about 12.5 years, although, neither spacecraft actually flew past Pluto. Pluto travels on a highly elliptical orbit around the sun. At its closest point, known as perihelion, Pluto is only 4.4 billion kilometers out. That's nearly 30 AU, or 30 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. Pluto last reached this point on September 5th, 1989
Having completed its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons will be maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object 2014 MU69. New Horizons is expected to encounter 2014 MU69 on January 1, 2019, when it is 43.4 AU from the Sun. On January 15, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto. On July 14, 2015 11:49 UTC (07:49 EDT), it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet.
Fastest spacecraft so far. The fastest spacecraft launched from Earth was NASA's New Horizons mission, which is en route to Pluto. In January 2006, the probe left Earth at 36,000 mph (58,000 kph). The time it would take such a probe to get to Mars would be: To determine how long it will take to reach Mars, we must first know the distance between the two planets. Mars is the fourth planet from the sun, and the second closest to Earth (Venus is the closest). But the distance between the two planets is constantly changing as they travel around the sun.
2 votes Vote for this answer. The distance from Earth to Pluto is not constant, but averages to 3.57 billion miles. The Space Shuttle orbits at 17,500 miles per hour. Therefore 205,000 hours or 8,500 days or 23 years 105 days. [Apr 08 04 6:13 PM] griffinj writes: With a solar sail, said craft would reach Pluto in less than five years.
