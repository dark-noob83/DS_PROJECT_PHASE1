Bearish Harami is a bearish reversal pattern. It is characterized by a large white candle, followed by a small black candle. The black candle is contained completely within the previous white candle. The pattern appears in an uptrend.
The bearish engulfing pattern consists of two candlesticks: the first is white and the second black. The size of the white candlestick is not that important, but should not be a doji, which would be relatively easy to engulf. The second should be a long black candlestick.

No matter what the color of the first candlestick, the smaller the body of the second candlestick is, the more likely the reversal. If the small candlestick is a doji, the chances of a reversal increase.
