Plasma was first discovered by IrvingLangmuir in 1928. It is not rare; actually, quite the opposite is true. More than 99% of the visible matter in the universe is in the plasma state. It can be seen in its natural form on earth as lightning or as polar light in the Arctic and Antarctic, for example.
A bag of blood plasma. During a blood plasma donation, blood is taken from the donor and the plasma is then separated from the rest of the blood. Red and white blood cells, platelets, and other components of blood flow in plasma inside a blood vessel. Red blood cells exist in blood along with
Human blood plasma is the pale yellow liquid portion of blood that is devoid of cellular components such as red and white blood cells.
Plasma technology is based on a simple physical principle. Matter changes its state when energy is supplied to it: solids becomes liquid, and liquids becomes gaseous. If even more energy is supplied to a gas, it is ionized and goes into the energy-rich plasma state, the fourth state of matter.
Blood plasma is the liquid component of blood, consisting of around half of the total blood volume. Plasma itself is around 90% water, with the 10% remainder including proteins, minerals, waste products, clotting factors, hormones, and immunoglobins.
Plasma is a form of matter in which many of the electron s wander around freely among the nuclei of the atom s. Plasma has been called the fourth state of matter, the other three being solid, liquid, and gas. Normally, the electrons in a solid, liquid, or gaseous sample of matter stay with the same atomic nucleus.
