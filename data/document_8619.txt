Cultivation. With some exceptions, all citrus plants are sensitive to frost and are unable to tolerate temperatures that are more than a few degrees below zero. They are cultivated in temperate and sub-tropical regions, including areas of the USA, South America, South Africa, Australia and the Mediterranean countries. The aim of this survey is to identify which research needs should be prioritised, thereby contributing to the commissioning of research on the health, environment and economic impacts of GMOs. The survey will close on 15th July 2015.
According to molecular studies, the mandarin, the citron, the pomelo, and the papeda were the ancestors of most other commercial citrus varieties, through breeding or natural hybridization; mandarins are therefore all the more important as the only sweet fruit among the parental species. 1 Tangors, or temple oranges, are crosses between the mandarin orange and the common sweet orange; their thick rind is easy to peel and its bright orange pulp is sour-sweet and full-flavored.

Across California's citrus belt, farmers are ripping out orange, lemon and grapefruit trees to switch to mandarins. 
The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects, animals or even humans. We believe consumers have the right to know if they are consuming genetically modified crops. Many genetic modified crops have been altered and engineered to produce their own pesticides.

The mandarin (Citrus reticulata), also known as the mandarine, is a small citrus tree with fruit resembling other oranges. Mandarin are usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. Specifically reddish-orange mandarin cultivars can be marketed as tangerines, but this is not a botanical classification. 1 Tangors, or temple oranges, are crosses between the mandarin orange and the common sweet orange; their thick rind is easy to peel and its bright orange pulp is sour-sweet and full-flavored.
7 Intriguing Genetically Modified Fruits & Veggies. Genetically modified food is one of great controversies of our time. Supporters point to wonderful possibilities of nutrient-packed food and solving world hunger, while critics fear unknown effects on human health. But whatever one’s opinion the matter, one thing is clear: some genetically modified fruits and vegetables are awfully intriguing!
Stakeholder input wanted: survey on research needs for assessing GMO impacts. Shaping the Future of GMO Research. Stakeholder with interests in the risk and/or benefit assessment of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO s) are invited to take part in an online survey. The aim of this survey is to identify which research needs should be prioritised, thereby contributing to the commissioning of research on the health, environment and economic impacts of GMOs. The survey will close on 15th July 2015.
