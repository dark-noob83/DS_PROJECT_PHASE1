Key Concepts: In dicotyledonous leaves there are two types of mesophyll cells, palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll. Palisade mesophyll cells form a layer beneath the upper epidermis whereas spongy mesophyll cells are internal to the lower epidermis. A major role of leaf mesophyll cells is to contain large populations of chloroplasts, which carry out photosynthetic carbon assimilation facilitating plant growth. Keywords: palisade mesophyll; spongy mesophyll; airspace; bundle sheath; chloroplast. Figure 1.
1 Beneath the palisade layer is the spongy layer. 2  The cells of the spongy layer are more branched and not so tightly packed, so that there are large intercellular air spaces between them for oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse in and out of during respiration and photosynthesis. A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant and is the principal lateral appendage of the stem. The leaves and stem together form the shoot. Foliage is a mass noun that refers to leaves collectively. Typically a leaf is a thin, dorsiventrally flattened organ, borne above ground and specialized for
There are two major types of mesophyll material found within leaves. These types are formed in distinct layers within the leaf. The first of these two layers, which lies on the outside close to the epidermis, is referred to as the palisade layer. The palisade layer of mesophyll is comprised of tightly packed cells containing many chloroplasts. The second subtype, the so-called spongy layer, is a less densely packed material with a great deal of air in-between cells. It also contains far less chloroplasts than the other type of mesophyll
In dicotyledonous leaves there are two types of mesophyll cell; palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll. Palisade mesophyll cells are elongate and form a layer beneath the upper epidermis, whereas spongy mesophyll cells are internal to the lower epidermis. Mesophyll cells in monocotyledonous leaves are often highly lobed. A major role of leaf mesophyll cells is to contain large populations of chloroplasts, which carry out photosynthetic carbon assimilation facilitating plant growth.

The leaf is arranged like a layered cake. It has a spongy layer, a palisade layer that consists of parenchyma cells and is where photosynthesis happens and an outer layer (the epidermis) with little holes (stomata) that could hold birthday candles. This tissue is called the mesophyll, meaning middle leaf, and comes in two flavors: the palisade mesophyll (sometimes called palisade parenchyma) and the spongy mesophyll. Most photosynthesis takes place in the palisade mesophyll, which is conveniently located at the top of the leaf just under the epidermis.
Gas exchange happens in the spongy mesophyll tissue of the leaf. Spongy mesophyll cells are covered by a thin layer of water and loosely packed. When the plant is photosynthesising during the day, these features allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the spongy mesophyll cells, and oxygen to diffuse out of it.
In ferns and most flowering plants, the mesophyll is divided into two layers: 1  An upper palisade layer of vertically elongated cells, one to two cells thick, directly beneath the adaxial epidermis, with intercellular air spaces between them. 2  Beneath the palisade layer is the spongy layer. A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant and is the principal lateral appendage of the stem. The leaves and stem together form the shoot. Foliage is a mass noun that refers to leaves collectively. Typically a leaf is a thin, dorsiventrally flattened organ, borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis.
The inside of the leaf looks like this: Spongy mesophyll cells are not packed so tightly together, which allows carbon dioxide and oxygen to reach the palisade cells where they are needed in photosynthesis. Spongy mesophyll cells and guard cells (see below) also get some photosynthetic action. This tissue is called the mesophyll, meaning middle leaf, and comes in two flavors: the palisade mesophyll (sometimes called palisade parenchyma) and the spongy mesophyll. Most photosynthesis takes place in the palisade mesophyll, which is conveniently located at the top of the leaf just under the epidermis.
The veins are the vascular tissue of the leaf and are located in the spongy layer of the mesophyll. The pattern of the veins is called venation. In angiosperms the venation is typically parallel in monocotyledons and forms an interconnecting network in broad-leaved plants. A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant and is the principal lateral appendage of the stem. The leaves and stem together form the shoot. Foliage is a mass noun that refers to leaves collectively. Typically a leaf is a thin, dorsiventrally flattened organ, borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis.
This layer is formed by the bundle sheath cells, which contain the chloroplasts in which the Calvin cycle occurs. Note, too, that the mesophyll cells are not separated into well-defined palisade and spongy mesophyll layers, such as you observed in the Ligustrum leaf. 2.
