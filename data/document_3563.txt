plasma renin assay (PRA), a blood test that measures the rate of generation of angiotensin. The most commonly used renin assay, it is a screening procedure for detecting essential, renal, or renovascular hypertension, and it is also performed to diagnose and separate primary from secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Typical PRA is a disease caused by a mutation in the rod photoreceptors (rods are responsible for night vision/ vision in dim light) leading to their death. Cones are responsible for daytime vision/ vision in bright light, and also for color vision (dogs do see color, but not as well as humans do). What to do if you suspect your dog has PRA: Don’t give up! PRA is no longer a hopeless disease. Have your dog examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist to determine if PRA is indeed present.

Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) is a systematic and comprehensive methodology used to evaluate risks associated with complex engineered systems and facilities. In a PRA, risk is characterized by two quantities: 1  the magnitude (severity) of the possible adverse consequence(s), and. 
PRA is a blinding disease in most affected dogs, but in the opinion of many veterinary ophthalmologists, including Dr. McCalla, PRA is no longer a hopeless disease. New insight into the mechanisms of retinal damage from oxidative stress has resulted in much more hope for prolonging the vision of affected dogs. What to do if you suspect your dog has PRA: Don’t give up! PRA is no longer a hopeless disease. Have your dog examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist to determine if PRA is indeed present.

The OptiGen prcd-PRA Test. The OptiGen prcd-PRA test is a DNA-based test that helps you avoid one form of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA). PRA refers to a group of diseases that cause the retina of the eye to degenerate slowly over time. The result is declining vision and eventual blindness. The OptiGen prcd test is done on a small sample of blood from the dog. The test analyzes the specific DNA mutation causing prcd-PRA. The OptiGen test detects the mutant, abnormal gene copy and the normal gene copy.
