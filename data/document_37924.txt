Within the body of physical geography, the Earth is often split into several spheres or environments, the main spheres being the atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and pedosphere. 1 Coastal geography is the study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography of the coast.

Confidence votes 348. Physical characteristics in geography are natural features such as mountains and rivers.

Physical geography (also known as geosystems or physiography) is one of the two major sub-fields of geography. 1 Coastal geography is the study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography of the coast.
Human and Physical Geography is the study of the environment, people, and the resources they use. Geography determines the way in which humans live, the adaptations they have developed to survive, and the alterations to the environment they have made to better their existence. Climate. Climate is a very important part in the study of human and physical geography. Climate is the usual weather patterns that occur in an area over a long period of time. There are four major climate zones, tropical, dry, mid-latitude, and high latitude.
Physical Geography is a sub-discipline of two much larger fields of study-Geography and Earth Sciences. The main purpose of Physical Geography is to explain the spatial characteristics of the various natural phenomena associated with the Earth's hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and lithosphere. Geography Chapters. 
GEOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS Each place has distinctive characteristics that distinguishes it from otherplaces. Geographic characteristics are divided into two categories: physicalcharacteristics and human characteristics. Physical characteristics describe the natural environment of the place. Theyinclude: • physical features-are landforms and bodies of water. • weather and climate weather-is how hot or cold and how wet or dry a place is. climate-is the kind of weather a place has over a long period time. 
Physical geography is that branch of natural science which deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, as opposed to the cultural or built environment, the domain of human geography. 1 Coastal geography is the study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography of the coast.
Physical and Cultural Geography. The study of geography is divided into two branches, physical geography and cultural geography. Physical geography examines the natural features and conditions of the world. Another way of stating this is that physical geography handles everything that isn't created or attributed to people and culture.
