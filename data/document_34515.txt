The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’ because the Bloodhound will be going faster than the speed of sound. The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both a jet and rocket. It is designed to go over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour. 
The Bloodhound SSC won’t hit the test track until early 2016, when Richard Noble and his team will be conducting runway trials of up to 200 mph on a 12-mile track in South Africa. There’s no word as to when the SSC will attempt to set a new land speed record, but expect that to happen by the end of 2016. Well, the British supersonic car aims to set a new world land speed record at 1,000 mph sometime in 2016 and break the first supersonic benchmark established by the Thrust SSC back in 1997.
Bloodhound SSC is a British supersonic land vehicle currently in development. Its goal is to match or exceed 1,000 miles per hour (1,609 km/h) achieving a new world land speed record. The pencil-shaped car, powered by a jet engine and a rocket engine is designed to reach 1,050 miles per hour (1,690 km/h). Runway testing of up to 200 miles per hour (320 km/h) is scheduled to take place in early 2016. Bloodhound SSC will then be tested on the Hakskeen Pan in the Mier area of the Northern Cape, South Africa where a track 12 miles (19 km) long, 2 miles (3.2 km) wide has been cleared.
Thrust SSC holds the World Land Speed Record, set on 15 October 1997, when it achieved a speed of 1,228 km/h (763 mph) and became the first car to officially break the sound barrier. ThrustSSC, Thrust SSC, or Thrust supersonic car, is a British jet-propelled car developed by Richard Noble, Glynne Bowsher, Ron Ayers and Jeremy Bliss.

How fast does thrust ssc go? Thrust SSC achieved the World Land Speed Record, on 15 October  1997. It became the first car to officially break the sound barrier  when it reached a speed of 1,228 km/h (7 … 63 mph). Answered
The budget for Bloodhound is already significantly higher than the £2.8m cost of Thrust SSC-the supersonic car that set the current world land speed record in 1997, when it achieved a speed of 763mph. 
How fast does thrust ssc go? Thrust SSC achieved the World Land Speed Record, on 15 October  1997. It became the first car to officially break the sound barrier  when it reached a speed of 1,228 km/h (7 … 63 mph). Basically thrust has to be powerful enough to get the plane to take-off speed, or it'll stay on the ground. And then you'll want a b … it more than that to get a decent climbing rate out of it. Exactly how much it'll need in numbers is impossible to say, as it'll depend on the aircraft.
54 feet long and 12 feet wide, the Thrust SSC was longer and wider than the Bloodhound SSC and tipped the scales at 10.5 tonnes (23,149 pounds). It burned about 4.8 gallons of fuel per second, which would translate into a fuel economy of 0.04 mpg. Well, the British supersonic car aims to set a new world land speed record at 1,000 mph sometime in 2016 and break the first supersonic benchmark established by the Thrust SSC back in 1997.
