It takes the planet 164.8 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Our planet orbits the Sun almost 165 times before Neptune orbits it once, and we have not even seen an entire orbit since the planet was discovered. Universe Today has articles on how long a year on Pluto is and orbits of the planets. Earth’s year is actually 365.25 days long, not the 365 days that we round it to. Because an Earth year is not exactly 365 days, we have a leap year – a year with 366 days – every four years.

One journey of our solar system around the center of the Milky Way galaxy is sometimes called a cosmic year. That’s approximately 225-250 million years. The planets in our solar system orbit around the sun. One orbit of the Earth takes one year. Meanwhile, our entire solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Our sun and solar system move at about 800 thousand kilometers an hour – that’s about 500 thousand miles an hour – in this huge orbit. 
Each planet orbits the Sun in what is referred to as their year. Because they are moving a different speeds and are at different distances, the length of time will vary. The E … arth makes one revolution in what we call a year (365.25 days). For the planet Uranus to travel around the Sun, it takes 84.02  Earth years (sidereal years). If you lived on Uranus, you would  call this one year.   This is 30,687.15 … Earth days or about 42,732 Uranus days
Mercury, the first planet in our solar system can completely orbit around the sun in a mere 88 Earth Days, but nearly takes 60 days to complete a turn of its axis. Venus, which is the closet planet to Earth, takes 224 days to orbit around the sun. Oddly enough Venus takes longer to complete a rotation of its axis, 243 days, than it does to completely orbit the sun. Mars, one of the closest planets to Earth in size takes around 686.97 days to orbit around the earth and has a nearly identical day of 24.3 hours. The last four planets of the sun, demonstrate the immense effect of distance on the time it takes for a planet to rotate around the sun. Jupiter, the solar system s largest planet, takes 4,331.572 days to orbit around the sun, but the fast turning planet only takes 9.8 hours to completely rotate on its axis.

Uranus and Neptune are the two farthest planets from the sun and the time it takes for them to orbit around the sun reflects this. Uranus takes 30,7999.09 days to orbit around the sun, which is impressive but cannot compare to the 60,190 days it takes Neptune to complete the same task. The last four planets of the sun, demonstrate the immense effect of distance on the time it takes for a planet to rotate around the sun. Jupiter, the solar system s largest planet, takes 4,331.572 days to orbit around the sun, but the fast turning planet only takes 9.8 hours to completely rotate on its axis.
New Years in the Solar System or how long Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and all planets take to orbit the sun, their orbital period. The more precise orbital periods are: Mercury: 87.929 days. Venus: 224.7 days. Earth: 365.25 days. Mars: 686.97 days. Jupiter: 4332.59 days. Saturn: 10,759.22 days.
