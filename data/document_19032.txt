Hi Melinda, 43,560 square feet = an acre. If the land is a square (length=width), it is 208.71 ft by 208.71 ft since 208,71 208.71 = 43,560. If the land is rectangular, you would need to know the length of one of the sides in order to figure out the length of the other side. Melanie.

1 For example, an area that has a width of 500 feet, and a length of 700 feet would be calculated by multiplying 500 by 700. 2  In this case the area is 350,000 square feet. 3  Once you have the total size in square feet, meters or yards you need to convert this into acres.
5280 feet per mile, squared, divided by 640 equals 43,560 square feet per acre. The square root of 43,560 is 208. 71 plus a hair. So an acre, if it's perfectly square, is 208 feet, 8. 5 inches (plus a hair) in length and width.
There are exactly 43,560 square feet, or 4840 square yards, in an acre.   The area of a football field, between the goal lines, is a little larger than an acre   A rectangular area of land that measured exactly 1 foot wide by 43,560 feet (or 8.25 miles) long would contain exactly one acre.
One acre is about 4,046.873 square meters. A square plot of ground 208.7 feet on a side will cover an acre. An American football field, 360 feet by 160 feet, is about 1.3 acres; 12 high school basketball courts are a little more than 1 acre. Here's a way for city dwellers to use a Google map of their neighborhood to get a feel for how big an acre is.
