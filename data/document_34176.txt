Sulfur: the essentials. Sulphur (sulfur) is a pale yellow, odourless, brittle solid, which is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulphide. Sulphur is essential to life. It is a minor constituent of fats, body fluids, and skeletal minerals. The spelling of sulphur is sulfur in the USA while sulphur is common elsewhere.
The different volcanic gases effect the earth, people and animals in different ways. Water vapor is beneficial, adding to the earth's water supply. Sulfur dioxide can form aerosols that reflect the sun's rays and cause cooling of the earth's surface, or cause harm by forming acid rains. Fluorine gases and their acid aerosols can be lethal to animals.

This is an example of a reduced sulfur.
