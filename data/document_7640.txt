In general the basic protocol for RSO is to slowly get yourself to one gram a day injested. One gram is pretty much the same as one ml. Start will .01 of a gram or ml (as on the syringe) and work your way up over about 20 to 30 days. You can also take the oil as a suppository.
Blood levels of vitamin C remain steady at approximately 200 mg per day. Although vitamin C can be well tolerated at doses well above the RDA recommendations, adverse effects can occur at doses above 3 grams per day though overload is unlikely. The common 'threshold' side effect of megadoses is diarrhea. The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 45 milligrams (mg)/day of vitamin C for healthy adults, and 25–30 mg/day in infants. Vitamin C is necessary for production of collagen and other biomolecules, and for the prevention of scurvy.
Iron is best absorbed if taken with vitamin C but not at the same time as Vitamin E. Vitamin C Begin with 1,000 mg a meal for a total of 3,000 mg per day. Your goal is bowel tolerance, which may be anywhere between 20,000 to 100,000 mg per day or even higher. It would be ideal to take some vitamin C every half hour you are awake, which is a real nuisance. 
For adults (including women who are pregnant or breastfeeding) and for children age 1 or older, the safe upper limit of calcium intake is 2.5 grams (or 2500 mg) per day (1). Too much calcium in the diet and from dietary supplements can lead to unwanted side effects. Individuals who had a calcium intake of more than 700 mg per day had a 35 percent to 45 percent reduced risk of cancer of the distal (lower) part of the colon than those who had a calcium intake of 500 mg or less per day.
When you reach the maximum dosage of vitamin B17, you need to maintain that dosage for 21-30 days. After the initial 21-30 days, a maintenance dose of 1 - 3 tablets of B17 per day for the following three months is the proper protocol. There are many different foods and herbs that have healing properties. The same as one would if one drank too much salt water at one time. If this is the case, take less amounts of the vitamin B17 tablets at one time but more often throughout the day. If you presently have cancer, you can have ten of the 500 mg tablets per day for the first month.
The key is determining how much protein you need. Too much protein may tax the kidneys and too little protein may lead to malnutrition. Most healthy adults need between 45 and 60 grams of complete protein per day, which should account for 10 to 15 percent of their daily caloric intake. Adjustments may need to be made for specific disease states. Check with your nutritionist to see what your protein requirements are.
By: Lincoln Horsley1/22/2013For most people it takes about 60 grams/ml of cannabis oil to kill most cancers. For the average person it will take about 90 days to ingest the full 60 gram/ml treatment of cannabis oil. It is important to remember that the 60 gram/ml 90 day treatment protocol is just a recommendation and starting point. It can take some people a longer time to finish their treatment.
A healthy person can take anywhere from 4-15 grams (4,000-15,000 mg) of Vitamin C in a 24 hour period without getting the runs, but a sick person can tolerate anywhere from 10-20 times more. I’m talking even as much as 100-200 grams per day by mouth. The simple way to find your tolerance is to take 2-3 grams of Vitamin C powder or crystals (ascorbic acid) every two hours mixed in 8 oz of water. That will give you about 12-18 grams the first day. Make sure you keep track of your doses.
An intake of 200 to 300 mg of vitamin C per day is required to raise the average smoker's vitamin C level to that of a non-smoker. An intake of around 50 mg per cigarette probably affords maximum protection. Albert Szent Gyorgi, who isolated vitamin C in 1928, recommends 1 gram daily. 
The dose should be doubled every four days until 1 gram/ml per day is ingested. Most people to get to the point where they can ingest 1 gram/ml per day in about 30-35 days. Once ingesting one gram/ml of oil per day is achieved, dosage should continue at that rate until the cancer is gone. Some people have however increased each of their daily doses to 2grams/ml or more. For the average person it will take about 90 days to ingest the full 60 gram/ml treatment of cannabis oil. It is important to remember that the 60 gram/ml 90 day treatment protocol is just a recommendation and starting point. It can take some people a longer time to finish their treatment.
