In the book Tuck Everlasting, 11-year-old Winnie meets the four members of the Tuck family. She learns that after drinking from a magic spring decades before, they became immortal.
The plot revolves around a 15-year-old girl named Winnie Foster, who is from a restrictive upper-class family. She runs away into the forest one day and meets a boy named Jesse Tuck, drinking from a spring. She is then kidnapped by his elder brother, Miles.
The next day Winnie goes walking in the wood, which is owned by her family. She comes across Jesse Tuck sitting under a large tree and drinking from a spring. When Winnie tries to drink, Jesse stops her. Then Mae and Miles appear. Alarmed at Winnie's discovery of the spring, they kidnap her. Winnie learns that the music she heard comes from Mae's music box. She also learns the Tucks' secret: the water in the spring is magic and has made them ageless.
Well, that's Winnie's situation, and it's put her in kind of a pickle. First, let's recap. Before he prepares to run out of town with his family, Jesse gives Winnie a bottle of immortality juiceâ€”i.e., water from the spring. It's pretty simple: if Winnie drinks it, she'll live forever, just like the Tucks.
