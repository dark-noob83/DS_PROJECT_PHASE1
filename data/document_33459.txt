The jar test is intended to simulate the coagulation and flocculation process in your plant. Consequently, designing a jar test procedure to match conditions in your plant takes a little thought and practice.
We offer many Jar Testing apparatuses equipment for testing water soluble polymers used with conventional waste water treatment processes such as coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation in water, waste water treatment and other industrial applications. Laboratory mixing and stirring equipment.
The jar test is used to determine the proper chemical dosage required for good coagulation and flocculation of water. The test is commonly used in potable water, secondary effluent prior to advanced wastewater treatment, secondary clarifier influent, and sludge conditioning practice.
Jar Test. A laboratory procedure that simulates a water treatment plant's coagulation/flocculation units with differing chemical doses, mix speeds, and settling times to estimate the minimum or ideal coagulant dose required to achieve certain water quality goals.

The jar test is intended to simulate the coagulation/flocculation process in a water treatment plant. The results that it produces are used to help optimize the performance of the plant. 1  Using a 1,000 mL graduated cylinder, add 1,000 mL of raw water to be coagulated to each of the jar test beakers.
What is jar testing? Jar testing is a method of simulating a full-scale water treatment process, providing sys-tem operators a reasonable idea of the way atreatment chemical will behave and operatewith a particular type of raw water.
