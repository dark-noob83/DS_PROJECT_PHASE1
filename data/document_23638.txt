Propolis is a resin-like material from the buds of poplar and cone-bearing trees. Propolis is rarely available in its pure form. It is usually obtained from beehives and contains bee products.

Propolis is a resinous substance collected by bees from leaf buds and exudates of trees and conifers. The bees modify the original resin composition to produce the Propolis and use it as a sealing agent and to keep the growth of microbes in the beehive under control.
What is Propolis Propolis (bee glue) is a dark sticky resinous substance bees collect from leaf buds, twigs and tree bark. The bees carry the propolis back to their hives and mix it with their salivary secretions and wax flakes. Propolis contains 55% resins and balsams, 30% beeswax, 10% etheric oils, and 5% pollen.
Of the fourteen minerals required by the body, propolis contains them all with the exception of sulfur. Propolis is comprised of 50 percent to 70 percent resins and balsams, 30 percent to 50 percent wax, 5 percent to 10 percent bee pollen and 10 percent essential oils.
What is Propolis? Propolis is a sticky resin that seeps from the buds of some trees and oozes from the bark and leaves of other trees. Honeybees gather propolis, a resin, and combine this resin with nectar, creating a mix of wax, pollen and bee bread. She then use this substance to seal her hives, protecting it from outside contaminants.
The comb is made of wax, which the bees produce from their abdomens (much as humans do ear wax). Next the bee chews the wax to soften it and then, totally by feel, creates the perfect cell structure to raise their brood and to store their food/honey.
