An electrochemical cell in which the energy of a reaction between a fuel, such as liquid hydrogen, and an oxidant, such as liquid oxygen, is converted directly and continuously into electrical energy.
An electrochemical cell in which the energy of a reaction between a fuel, such as liquid hydrogen, and an oxidant, such as liquid oxygen, is converted directly and continuously into electrical energy.
Device that converts chemical energy of a fuel (usually hydrogen) directly into electrical energy. In this process hydrogen is continuously passed over a porous nickel or platinum alloy cathode that splits the hydrogen into electrons and protons.
Definition of FUEL CELL. : a device that continuously changes the chemical energy of a fuel (as hydrogen) and an oxidant directly into electrical energy. See fuel cell defined for kids. ADVERTISEMENT.
fuel cell-cell that produces electricity by oxidation of fuel (hydrogen and oxygen or zinc and air); often used in electric cars. electric cell, cell-a device that delivers an electric current as the result of a chemical reaction.
