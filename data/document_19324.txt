tsh range the function of thyroid stimulating hormone or tsh is to regulate the normal levels of thyroid hormones in the body it is a peptide hormone secreted by the thyrotrope cells of anterior pituitary gland the tsh activates the thyroid gland to produce both triiodothyronine t3 and thyroxine t4 hormones normal levels in children the range of normal tsh levels for full term newborns is higher as it can range from between 1 3 and 16 micro units per ml of blood the tsh range gradually reduces to 0 9 to 7 7 micro units per milliliter after 30 days the tsh narrows to 0 6 to 5 5 micro units per milliliter in school going children
the official normal range of tsh followed by many doctors and laboratories until 2002 was from between 0 5 to 5 according to this tsh range a tsh over 5 indicated an under active thyroid or hypothyroidism while a low tsh value below0 5 indicated an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism to be more specific normal tsh can range from between 0 3 to 5 for instance a person with a tsh range of 4 5 is considered normal by one physician where as another physician can diagnose it as hypothyroidism and begin with the treatment
ranges for tsh thyroid stimulating hormone vary depending on the method used but generally 0 3 to 5 0 is normal a tsh value of 0 06 would be considered low tsh no matter what method is used low tsh indicates high thyroid or hyperthyroidism and high tsh represents low thyroid or hypothyroidism 
normal tsh values the normal range of tsh test report can range from between 0 4 4 0 milli international units per liter the tsh value depends on various factors like lab reports related symptoms and treatment for the condition to be more specific normal tsh can range from between 0 3 to 5 for instance a person with a tsh range of 4 5 is considered normal by one physician where as another physician can diagnose it as hypothyroidism and begin with the treatment
the values become more normally distributed when log transformed for reference range calculations it is customary to log transform the tsh results to calculate the 95 % reference interval typical population mean value 1 5 miu l range 0 4 to 4 0 miu l in iodine sufficient populations today i would like to look at the tsh or thyrotropin reference range tsh stands for thyroid stimulating hormone it is secreted by the pituitary gland and it tells your thyroid to produce thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3
if your free t4 levels are too low the normal range for t4 is 5 to 13 5 micrograms per deciliter it s a possible indicator that you have hypothyroidism even if your previous tsh tests came back normal 
an under active thyroid presents with a tsh ranging from 2miu l or more than that a tsh level count ranging between 0 5 and 3miu l confirms thyroid disorder the normal tsh range for newborns ranges from between 1 39 miu l the normal tsh levels for children ranges from between 0 7 6 4 miu l normal levels in children the range of normal tsh levels for full term newborns is higher as it can range from between 1 3 and 16 micro units per ml of blood the tsh range gradually reduces to 0 9 to 7 7 micro units per milliliter after 30 days the tsh narrows to 0 6 to 5 5 micro units per milliliter in school going children
as we can see from the chart tsh levels normal range is 0 4 4 0 miu l yet people without signs of abnormal thyroid showing tsh result 2 0 miu l and normal t4 test results may acquire thyroid problems later such as hypothyroidism the function of thyroid stimulating hormone is to activate the thyroid gland for secretion of thyroid hormones pituitary glands command thyroid glands to produce and secrete t3 triiodothyronine and t4 thyroxine hormones associated with thyroid levels it is very important to maintain
as you know from this article a normal tsh range depending on the lab is around 0 5 to 5 0 which is why your tsh of 4 46 was determined normal however the very fact that your first tsh test showed up 6 49 should be reason to investigate further if you go by tsh normal ranges your score is normal however tsh alone does not give a full picture of thyroid health insist on testing for free t4 free t3 reverse t3 thyroid antibodies ferritin and d3 as the first step
