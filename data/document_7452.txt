Mars Veterinary also offers a blood DNA test that is only available through veterinarians called Wisdom Panel Professional. The cost of this test to the dog owner will vary depending on the veterinary office that draws the blood, but expect to pay about $150. Factors to consider when choosing a test include: the type of test, your budget, and the number of breeds it can identify. Canine genetic testing is still in its infancy. But as an understanding of DNA, the size of the sample databases, and the technology behind the science all gain speed, it’s likely that the tests will one day be able to pinpoint the exact stuff your dog is made of. BioPet Breed ID: Cheek swab. 1  $59.99.

One of the many things no one tells you about pregnancy is how many tests there are -- blood tests, urine tests, tests where you down a weird orange drink (it checks your blood sugar levels). But prenatal testing helps your doctor check on the health of you and your baby-to-be. 
The cost of genetic testing can range from under $100 to more than $2,000, depending on the nature and complexity of the test. The cost increases if more than one test is necessary or if multiple family members must be tested to obtain a meaningful result. For newborn screening, costs vary by state. Some states cover part of the total cost, but most charge a fee of $15 to $60 per infant. From the date that a sample is taken, it may take a few weeks to several months to receive the test results. Results for prenatal testing are usually available more quickly because time is an important consideration in making decisions about a pregnancy

They have full panel blood tests and they have smaller ones that only look for certain things. Most have to be sent out to a lab, only a few can be done right there at the vets where they get an answer in 15 minutes. Phone your vet and ask which test your cat needs and how much will it cost. Their cost to you depends on what the labs charge them to do the work plus the shipping overnight for the blood sample to reach the lab. I know a full blood panel here costs $120, a fructosamine test is $90 and a Elisa test is $50. But each vet varies in price. That's why it's easiest to just call and ask. Best Answer: Each vet in different parts of the country will charge different prices. I just had a full blood work for a cat and it ran $80. Glad I did though, because it identified issues that can be handled and treated, saving me tons of money in vet bills in the future...and my kitty's life.
A blood test usually involves taking a blood sample from a blood vessel in your arm. The arm is a convenient part of the body to use because it can be easily uncovered. The usual place for a sample to be taken from is the inside of the elbow or wrist, where the veins are relatively close to the surface. Blood tests have a wide range of uses and are one of the most common types of medical test.
