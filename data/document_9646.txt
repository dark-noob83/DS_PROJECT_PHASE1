How long does it take the Moon to orbit the Earth? The Moon takes about 27 days (27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 11.6 seconds) to go all the way around the Earth and return to its starting position. The Moon's orbit around the Earth is a slightly squashed circle called an ellipse.
Manned missions do it quicker: 3 days, 3 hours, 49 minutes. Next up, the Apollo missions in comparison were fairly quick to reach the Moon. The Apollo 11 astronauts were launched atop a huge Saturn V multi-stage rocket on July 16th 1969 from Kennedy Space Centre and sent quickly on their way.
It takes about 3 days for a spacecraft to reach the Moon. During that time a spacecraft travels at least 240,000 miles (386,400 kilometers) which is the distance between Earth and the Moon. The specific distance depends on the specific path chosen. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 
It took Apollo 11, that's the spaceship that carried Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin to the moon in 1969, 4 days 6 hours and 45 minutes to get to the moon. They took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 1:32 pm on 7/16/1969, and the lunar module landed on the moon at 8:17 pm on 7/20/1969. A rocket ship, on its way to the moon, can get up to almost 25,000 miles per hour in order to escape the Earths atmosphere. However, it does not go that fast the whole way. Also, the ship cannot fly directly from the Earth straight to the moon surface. When it gets to the moon, the rocket needs to fly around and figure out a good spot to land. The first mission to stop on the moon with astronauts on it, Apollo 11, landed about four days after leaving the Earth surface
Best Answer: 3-4 days each way when you include the orbits needed to slow and make orbit or position for reentry. Now directly they traveled about 15,000 mph and the distance to the moon is 238857 miles. So a straight trip is 16 hours. Apollo astronauts supposedly needed 4 days to go to the moon a 4 back.but now with the ares rocket it will take 5 days cause that rocket has less power that the Saturn 5. lorenzoxpotter · 8 years ago.
The time it takes to get to the moon depends on the speed of the spacecrafts. The Apollo 11 was launched July 16, 1969 from Kennedy Space Centre and landed on the moon on July 19th. It took a total of 3 days, 3 hours and 49 minutes to fly to the Moon and 3 days to return to Earth. Afterwards, on April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 was launched from the Kennedy Space Centre and landed on the Pacific Ocean after traveling around the Moon on April 17th. It took total of 5 days, 22 hours and 54 minutes to fly to the Moon and return back to Earth. The shortest trip to the Moon took place in January 2006 by the NASA Pluto probe New Horizons. With the speed of 58,000 km/hr, it only took 8 hours and 35 minutes to get to the Moon from Earth.
It took them 5 days, 22 hours, 54 minutes to fly to the Moon and back to the Earth. The NASA Pluto probe New Horizons flew from the surface of the Earth to the Moon's orbital path in eight hours and thirty-five minutes in January 2006. They reached the Moon when they performed a Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) manoeuvre July 19th 12:21:50 pm EST. It took them 3 days, 3 hours, 49 minutes to fly to the Moon. The astronauts took almost 3 days to return to earth.
The Apollo 11 astronauts were launched July 16th 1969 at 08:32:00 am EST from Kennedy Space Centre. They reached the Moon when they performed a Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) manoeuvre July 19th 12:21:50 pm EST. It took them 3 days, 3 hours, 49 minutes to fly to the Moon. The astronauts took almost 3 days to return to earth. The Apollo 13 astronauts were launched April 11th 1970 at 2:13:00 pm EST from the Kennedy Space Centre. They flew around the Moon and landed in the Pacific Ocean April 17th 1:07:41 pm EST
