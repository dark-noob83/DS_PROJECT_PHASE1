The Climate In The Desert. To start off with, I would like to say that there are 4 different types of deserts. There are the hot and dry desert, the semiarid desert, the coastal desert, and the cold desert. The Hot Desert. This desert's average temperature ranges from 64 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. The extreme temperature is 110.3 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The sand's average temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit. The winter brings a little rainfall, but the summers are hot and dry. The average rainfall is about one inch of rain. The soil is rocky and shallow. The Semiarid Desert The semiarid desert's average temperature in the summer is 110.3 to 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
Climate and Seasonal Changes. Antarctica, a cold desert biome, is located at the southern pole, which receives less energy and heat from the sun because of earth's tilt and orbit around the it. This results in Antarctica having only two seasons: summer and winter.
Description. Desert biomes are the driest of all the biomes. In fact, the most important characteristic of a desert is that it receives very little rainfall. Most deserts receive less than 300 mm a year compared to rainforests, which receive over 2,000 mm. That means that the desert only gets 10 percent of the rain that a rainforest gets! The temperature in the desert can change drastically from day to night because the air is so dry that heat escapes rapidly at night.

Desert Biome Facts. The desert biome is an ecosystem that forms due to the low level of rainfall it receives each year. Deserts cover about 20% of the Earth. There are four major types of desert in this biome-hot and dry, semiarid, coastal, and cold. They are all able to inhabit plant and animal life that are able to survive there
A cold desert is a desert that has snow in the winter instead of just dropping a few degrees in temperature like they would in a Hot and Dry Desert. It never gets warm enough for plants to grow. Just maybe a few grasses and mosses. The animals in Cold Deserts also have to burrow but in this case to keep warm, not cool. The precipitation in Hot and Dry Deserts and the precipitation in Cold Deserts is different. Hot and Dry Deserts usually have very little rainfall and/or concentrated rainfall in short periods between long rainless periods. This averages out to under 15 cm a year.
LOCATION: Although few animals and plants are adapted to the extremely dry desert life, the desert is a vital biome. The desert is important because it covers about a fifth of the earth's surface! There are both hot and cold deserts. The temperature in the winters is generally 41°F (5&degC) or below. In the summer the weather heats up to between 55 and 75°F (12 and 24&degC). Average rainfall is usually 3 - 5 inches (8 - 13 cm). The Atacama is the Earth's driest desert. In the Atacama 1 millimeter or more of rain falls every 5-20 year
It is a Low Latitude climate. The Bstands for Dry Desert climates. All months have average temperatures over 64° F (18° C). The Wstands for desert climate. Finally, the hstands for dry and hot, with average annual temperatures over 64° F (18° C). I guess they're trying to tell us its hot, hot out there.
