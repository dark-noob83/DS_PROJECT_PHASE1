“Khloe has been in contact with Rob and urged him to seek Bruce Jenner ‘ s help with his problems and not Lamar,” a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY about Khloe’s secret feelings on Rob and Lamar’s friendship.
Khloe Kardashian clearly blames Lamar Odom for contributing to her brother's drug problems -- and says she feels guilty for not being able to protect Rob from L.O.'s influences. As we previously reported, Rob had gotten deep into sizzurp and weed -- and his family was pushing for him to go to rehab.
Despite Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian getting a divorce, Lamar and Khloe’s little brother Rob Kardashian are still extremely close.
Lamar loved what Rob told him. “That was nice for Rob to say and Lamar certainly likes hearing compliments,” our source says. While Rob and Lamar remain close, Rob’s sister Khloe Kardashian doesn’t love their tight-knit relationship.
Rob gave Lamar the ultimate compliment when they talked to each other on June 15. “They’re still speaking, of course, and all is well with Lamar,” a source confirms to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Lamar’s really impressed with Rob and how classy he is.” Wow.
Getting a divorce is hard enough, but it’s especially hard when your brother and ex-husband are still close! Khloe Kardashian is warning younger brother Rob Kardashian to scale back his contact with her ex Lamar Odom, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.
Rob Kardashian 's downhill spiral was triggered by Lamar Odom ... but we've learned it had nothing to do with Lamar's drug use ... it was all about fatherly abandonment. Sources connected with the Kardashian family tell TMZ ... Rob was devastated when his dad -- famed O.J. lawyer Robert Kardashian -- died back in 2003.
Now, Khloe is talking about Rob's issues -- and without specifically mentioning the drugs -- says Rob's problems stem from the time he lived with Lamar Odom, who has serious drug problems of his own.
