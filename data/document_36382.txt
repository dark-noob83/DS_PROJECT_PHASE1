(6) a fluorine resin coated article according to the present invention, wherein the metal substrate is aluminum or an aluminum alloy. (7) A fluorine resin coated article as in the above embodiment (6), wherein tiny asperities are formed on the surface of the metal substrate by electrochemical or chemical etching.
Teflon™ FEP Resin and Film. Resin. Teflon™ FEP is a fluorinated ethylene propylene resin that meets the ASTM Standard Specification for FEP—Fluorocarbon Molding and Extrusion Materials under ASTM Designation D2116-95a. It is available as pellets or as stabilized aqueous dispersions.
9. A fluorine resin coated article as claimed in claim 1, wherein said metal substrate is aluminum or an aluminum alloy. 10. A fluorine resin coated article as claimed in claim 9, wherein tiny asperities are formed on the surface of said metal substrate by electrochemical or chemical etching.
The paint is a combination of pigments that reflect infrared rays and a fluorinated resin coating. When a building’s roof and exterior walls are painted with Bonnflon TM Sunbarrier, the sun’s heat is reflected by special pigments that have a high reflectance rate of infrared rays.
Description: Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) fluorocarbon resin is a melt-processible fluorocarbon resin suitable for extrusion as a primary coating onto most gauge wires (AWG #12 and smaller) for twisted-pair constructions and for limited jacketing applications.
Once the substance is pyrolytically decomposed, raw material of PTFE is made. Fluorocarbon resin has features of heat resistance, chemical resistance, electrical insulation, non-adhesive and low friction. These features make fluorocarbon resin be useful to varieties of fields and environment.
