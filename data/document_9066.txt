According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), lean meat is any serving of meat (3 ounces – about the size of a deck of cards) with less than 10 grams total fat, 4.5 grams saturated fat and 95 milligrams cholesterol.
Lightly season lean meats using herbs such as rosemary, sage and thyme to make them delicious and to keep the fat and carb content low. If it is within your budget, choose lean cuts that are free-range, organic or grass-fed, since most commercial cuts contain antibiotics and hormones.
Foods high in protein such as fish, chicken, meats, soy products, and cheese, are all called “protein foods.” You may also hear them referred to as ‘meats or meat substitutes.”.
Lean meats are meats with a relatively low fat content. Skinless chicken and turkey and red meat, such as pork chops, with the fat trimmed off are examples of lean meat.

Meat is a suitable option because it contains many important nutrients, including iron, zinc and magnesium. When shopping for meats, select cuts with no visible fat and only a few grams of fat per serving.
Chicken is a lean meat. Lean meat is a good source of protein with a lower fat content and therefore a lower calorie content. Lean meat is generally regarded as a safe source of protein there have been some concerns about antibiotic use in poultry farms.
