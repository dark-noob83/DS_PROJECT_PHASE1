Antarctica is the coldest, windiest and driest continent on Earth. The average annual temperature ranges from about −10°C on the Antarctic coast to −60°C at the highest parts of the interior. Near the coast the temperature can exceed +10°C at times in summer and fall to below −40°C in winter. The lowest temperature yet recorded on the Earth's surface was −89.2°C at Vostok station on 21 July 1983. Surrounding Antarctica there is normally a belt of low pressure, the circumpolar trough, containing multiple low centres.
According to the collected data, the coldest quarter of the year in Antarctica is the third quarter. July features an average high temperature of -76 degrees and an average low temperature of about -81 degrees F. Fourth Quarter. While the weather in North America tends to get colder during the fourth quarter of the year, the temperature increases in Antarctica during this part of the year. The average high temperature in October is about -60 degrees and the average low for the month is about -65 degrees.
The lowest reliably measured temperature of a continuously occupied station on Earth of −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) was on 21 July 1983 at Vostok Station. For comparison, this is 10.7 °C (19.3 °F) colder than subliming dry ice (at sea level pressure). The altitude of the location is 3,900 meters (12,800 feet). Nearly all of Antarctica is covered by a sheet of ice that is, on average, a mile thick or more (1.6 km). Antarctica contains 90% of the world's ice and more than 70% of its fresh water.
The lowest recorded temperature of any location on Earth's surface was −93.2 °C (−135.8 °F) at 81°48′S 59°18′E﻿ / ﻿81.8°S 59.3°E﻿ / -81.8; 59.3, which is on an unnamed Antarctic plateau between Dome A and Dome F, on August 10, 2010. Nearly all of Antarctica is covered by a sheet of ice that is, on average, a mile thick or more (1.6 km). Antarctica contains 90% of the world's ice and more than 70% of its fresh water.
The average temperature of Antarctica is about -49 degrees Celsius or about -56.2 Fahrenheit. The annual average temperature is -50°C (-58°F). Winter temperatures drop quickly, then level out. Average temperatures in the Antarctic interior get down to -70 degrees Celsius during the winter months and -35 degrees Celsius in the warmer months.
The coastal temperatures are much warmer with a  range of -15 to -32 Celsius in Winter and -5 to +5 Celsius in  Summer. The highest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica was  14.6°C (58.3°F) on the 5th January, 1974 at Hope Bay and Vanda  Station. Average temperatures in the Antarctic interior get down to -70 degrees Celsius during the winter months and -35 degrees Celsius in the warmer months.
First Quarter. January is the second warmest month of the year in Antarctica, according to data gathered at the American Amundsen-Scott station from 1957 to 1988. The average high temperature in Antarctica in January is -18 degrees F, while the average low temperature in January is similar, at about -21 degrees F. Fourth Quarter. While the weather in North America tends to get colder during the fourth quarter of the year, the temperature increases in Antarctica during this part of the year. The average high temperature in October is about -60 degrees and the average low for the month is about -65 degrees.
Cold. Most of Antarctica is a high, flat plateau of ice covered in snow throughout the year. The snow reflects the sun's solar radiation, and this combined with the altitude (an average of 14,000 feet above sea level) makes the interior of Antarctica the coldest place on Earth. The lowest recorded Antarctic temperature was taken at Vostok Station in July 1983: -89.2°C (-128.6°F). The lowest South Pole temperature is from June 23, 1982: -82.8°C (-117.0°F). 
The average high temperatures in April and May in Antarctica are both about -70 degrees F, while the average low temperatures for the months are around -78 degrees F. The average high temperature in June is around -72 degrees F and the average low temperature is about -78 degrees. Fourth Quarter. While the weather in North America tends to get colder during the fourth quarter of the year, the temperature increases in Antarctica during this part of the year. The average high temperature in October is about -60 degrees and the average low for the month is about -65 degrees.
