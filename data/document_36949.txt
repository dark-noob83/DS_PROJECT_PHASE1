From the time a cold virus enters the nose, it takes 8-12 hours for the viral reproductive cycle to be completed and for new cold virions to be shed (released) in nasal secretions. This time period is called the incubation period. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation periods for a few of the most common causative viruses involved with the common cold are: Rhinovirus: 2-7 days. Coronaviruses: 2-10 days. Adenoviruses: 2-14 days.
There are over 200 viruses responsible for the common cold. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation periods for a few of the most common causative viruses involved with the common cold are: Rhinovirus: 2-7 days. Coronaviruses: 2-10 days. Adenoviruses: 2-14 days.
Incubation Period. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the rhinovirus accounts for 30 percent to 50 percent of all cases of the common cold. It has a typical incubation period of 10 to 12 hours. In contrast, the influenza virus has an incubation period of one day to a week
Common cold accompanied by fever is usually caused by influenza virus. The incubation period of influenza virus depends on the severity of the attack that can be as short as 1 day to a stretched period of 7 days. However, the approximate incubation period is in the range of 1-3 days when caused by influenza virus. Thus, the average incubation period of common cold caused due to Rhinovirus infection in 2-4 days. During this period, the victim will experience runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and congestion in nasal passages.
___________________________________________. IT TAKES 48 HOURS FOR A COLD TO APPEAR. The incubation period for a common cold is usually around two days. Only after this time will symptoms-such as coughing, sneezing and runny nose-start to appear. The virus installs itself in the cells lining the nose and produces a new generation of viruses within just eight hours. 
Confidence votes 40.4K. The incubation period of the common cold is typically 36 to 48 hours, but, in some cases, symptoms can arise within 12 hours, or slightly less, of catching the virus. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation periods for a few of the most common causative viruses involved with the common cold are: Rhinovirus: 2-7 days. Coronaviruses: 2-10 days. Adenoviruses: 2-14 days.
A cold is an upper respiratory infection caused by a virus called rhinovirus. The common cold incubation period varies greatly from one person to the next. Symptoms can appear in just a few hours or as long as 10 days after exposure. The average incubation period is one to three days. I studied this in class this week. The incubation period for a common cold depends on the kind of virus it's caused by. The incubation period is at least two days and up to a week or two weeks depending on the cause. Some people get symptoms within the first day though.
Facts about the Common Cold Incubation Period. By Patsy Hamilton | Cold | Rating: The typical common cold incubation period is from two to five days, but symptoms can appear in as little as ten hours after the virus first enters the nose. The range of the common cold incubation period may be explained by the number of different viruses that can cause common cold symptoms. This makes it hard for scientists to determine an exact common cold incubation period, but in most diseases, there is only a range, not an exact figure. In clinical trials rhinoviruses were introduced directly into the nasal passages of volunteers and 95% of them became infected.
Another explanation for the wide range in the common cold incubation period is that some people never develop symptoms, even though an infection is present. This makes it hard for scientists to determine an exact common cold incubation period, but in most diseases, there is only a range, not an exact figure. In clinical trials rhinoviruses were introduced directly into the nasal passages of volunteers and 95% of them became infected.
@burcidi-- I don't think so. Three weeks is too long as an incubation period for a common cold. The incubation period is usually a few days in most people, but it can be up to a week. If you had said two weeks, then I would have said maybe, but I doubt that you picked up the cold from your friend. I studied this in class this week. The incubation period for a common cold depends on the kind of virus it's caused by. The incubation period is at least two days and up to a week or two weeks depending on the cause.
