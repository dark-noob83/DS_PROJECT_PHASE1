Dwarf Hamsters can live in social groups if they are raised together or introduced at a very young age, but not all dwarf hamsters want company. Many dwarf hamsters prefer to live alone. Social groups should always be monitered to be sure that one hamster isn't bullying another one.
Dwarf hamsters can live in pairs, or sometimes in small groups, but it really depends on how old they are. If you have had your hamster for a while, it may not do well with another hamster.
Syrian hamsters are not as gregarious as some other rodents may be. They are by nature solitary animals. The term solitary refers to living alone rather than in pairs or groups. Syrian hamsters prefer to live alone. No attempt should be made to house them together in the same or opposite sex. The ensuing fight may be so ferocious that it can prove difficult to separate them before serious injury is inflicted on one or the other.
Hamsters, like dogs, come in different breeds that have differing needs. Some subspecies of hamsters prefer living the solitary life, relaxing with their thoughts and spinning their wheels -- literally. Others appreciate a little companionship but can do without it. If your hamster is of a breed that tolerates company, you can experiment with introducing a friend ... but some hamsters, regardless of breeding, just prefer to live alone in their cage.
The Solitary Syrian. If you have a Syrian hamster, that's all you should have -- a single Syrian hamster. When Syrian becomes plural, you have problems. This breed of hamster prefers to live alone. So much so, in fact, that if they are caged together, they'll fight until one of them is once again by himself. If you're set on having more than one hamster, then feel free -- just make sure he lives in his own cage, or else things will get ugly.
