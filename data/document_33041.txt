Litmus Milk Test (WINTER 2014 version) CAUTION: Litmus milk is a complex medium that can produce a variety of results. Because of this, litmus milk can give quite unreliable results (i.e., the results often give negative results when something positive should happen).
litmus paper is widely used to distinguish between acids and bases. So widespread is the use of litmus in testing whether a solution or gas is acidic or basic, that the concept of a litmus test has spread to include any simple but definitive test.
There are two types of litmus papers as blue and red. Red litmus paper is used to test basic solutions. Red litmus papers turn blue when encountered with a basic solution. Whereas blue litmus papers turn red when encounter with an acidic solution. The neutral litmus papers are purple in color.
Litmus test is a test done to find out whether a given compound is acidic, basic or amphoteric in nature. It is a natural chemical indicator that shows color change with pH(hydrogen ion concentration) change. While acid turns blue litmus red a base or alkali turns red litmus blue. Litmus test is done with the aid of a filter paper called Litmus paper, that has been pretreated with a specific indicator that shows color change in response to acidic or basic conditions. If the solution is neutral the color observed is purple.
CAUTION: Litmus milk is a complex medium that can produce a diversity of results. Because of this, litmus milk can give quite unreliable results (i.e., the results often give negative results when something positive should happen).
In the second part, 0.2 g (a small scoop) of acetamide is dissolved in 1 mL of 3 M HCl and heated in a boiling water bath. After 10 minutes, students note the odor of vinegar coming from the tube and test the vapors with moist blue litmus paper.
