au·tol·y·sis. n. The destruction of tissues or cells of an organism by the action of substances, such as enzymes, that are produced within the organism. Also called self-digestion. Loss of freshness brings about immediate alterations in tissues with regard to chemical and enzyme. processes, including rigor mortis, disintegration of muscle structure, carbohydrate metabolism, as well as nucleotide and enzyme degradation.
In biology, autolysis, more commonly known as self-digestion, refers to the destruction of a cell through the action of its own enzymes. It may also refer to the digestion of an enzyme by another molecule of the same enzyme. The term derives from the Greek words αὐτο- (self) and λύσις (splitting). In the food industry, autolysis involves killing the yeast and encouraging breakdown of its cells by various enzymes. It is used to give different flavors. For yeast extract, when this process is triggered by the addition of salt, it is known as plasmolysis.
Yeast extracts in liquid form can be dried to a light paste or a dry powder. Yeast extracts and fermented foods contain glutamic acid, which, in solution with sodium ions, is the same as monosodium glutamate. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, after which the husks (yeast with thick cell walls) are separated. Removing the cell walls concentrates the flavours and changes the texture. Yeast extract is used as a flavour enhancer in processed foods of all kinds.
It is also used as an ingredient for pet-food and as a nutrient for micro-organisms in some fermentation processes. Production process of Autolysed Yeast The process is the same as for Yeast Extract except for the duration of autolysis and the non-removal of yeast cell walls, as explained above. Autolysed Yeast is usually available as roller-dried or spray-dried powder. Autolysed Yeast contains both soluble and insoluble components derived from the whole yeast cell. Applications of Autolysed Yeast Thanks to its speciﬁc notes: roasted, toasted, cereals, and its taste enhancing power, Autolysed Yeast is used for the ﬂavouring of snacks, cocktail biscuits, savoury mixes, etc.
Viscous yeast extract. Yeast extract is the common name for various forms of processed yeast products made by extracting the cell contents (removing the cell walls); they are used as food additives or flavourings, or as nutrients for bacterial culture media. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, after which the husks (yeast with thick cell walls) are separated. Removing the cell walls concentrates the flavours and changes the texture. Yeast extract is used as a flavour enhancer in processed foods of all kinds.

Autolytic cell destruction is uncommon in living adult organisms and usually occurs in injured cells or dying tissue. Autolysis is initiated by the cells' lysosomes releasing digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm. In the food industry, autolysis involves killing the yeast and encouraging breakdown of its cells by various enzymes. It is used to give different flavors. For yeast extract, when this process is triggered by the addition of salt, it is known as plasmolysis.
