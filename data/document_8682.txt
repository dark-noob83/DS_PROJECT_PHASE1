7. A group of membrane proteins can be extracted from membranes only by using detergents. All the proteins in this group have a similar amino acid sequence at their C-terminus: -KKKKKXXC (where K stands for lysine, X stands for any amino acid, and C stands for cysteine). This sequence is essential for their attachment to the membrane. Cells can import materials from the external medium by ________ in a process known as__________. The reverse process is known as_____________ A. Capturing them in vesicles that pinch off from the plasma membrane; Exocytosis; EndocytosisB.
DNA Sequencing. After the finding that DNA's information was encoded in its sequence of nucleotides (A, C, T, and G), it was believed that one could find this sequence through a method of analyzing a large number of identical strands of DNA and identifying each nucleotide in order of it's appearance in the DNA sequence. As a result, polyacrylamide gels would be capable of resolving even 1 base pair differences in DNA, making this very useful for sequencing. In addition, the chemical structure of DNA allows geneticists to manipulate its normal function and use it to identify the sequence of a strand of DNA.
A nucleoside triphosphate is a molecule containing a nucleoside bound to three phosphates (also known as a nucleotide). Nucleotide derivatives are necessary for life, as they are the building blocks of nucleic acids and have thousands of other roles in cell metabolism and regulation. For example, if a nucleotide has one phosphate, it is a nucleoside monophosphate (NMP). If the nucleotide has two phosphates, then it is called a nucleoside diphosphate (NDP), and for three, it is a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP).
To do this, it adds one nucleotide complementary to the template strand at a time. In order to do this, Polymerase requires a DNA Primer, a short strand of DNA complementary to the end of the template strand for a 3' OH group. The following diagram shows the structure of a normal nucleotide (dNTP): As a result, polyacrylamide gels would be capable of resolving even 1 base pair differences in DNA, making this very useful for sequencing. In addition, the chemical structure of DNA allows geneticists to manipulate its normal function and use it to identify the sequence of a strand of DNA.
6. Because hydrogen bonds hold the two strands of a DNA molecule together, the strands can be separated without breaking any covalent bonds. Every unique DNA molecule “melts” at a different temperature. In this context, Tm, melting temperature, is the point at which two strands separate, or become denatured. Cells can import materials from the external medium by ________ in a process known as__________. The reverse process is known as_____________ A. Capturing them in vesicles that pinch off from the plasma membrane; Exocytosis; EndocytosisB.
Thus, these molecules form the basis of the dideoxy chain-termination method of DNA sequencing, which was developed by Frederick Sanger in 1977. Dideoxynucleotides are useful in the sequencing of DNA in combination with electrophoresis. 
Dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) lack the 3'-OH group of dNTPs that is essential for polymerase-mediated strand elongation in a PCR. Figure 1: The enzymatic dideoxy chain termination sequencing method of Sanger[1] relies on the linear amplification of a single-stranded template DNA using a 5'-fluorescently labeled primer and a modified Taq polymerase.
When present in small amounts in sequencing reactions, dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs) terminate the sequencing reaction at different positions in the growing DNA strands. c.lack a hydroxyl (-OH) group at their 3′ end. Emulsion PCR generates millions of clonally amplified sequencing template on each bead b. 400,000 DNA fragments are simultaneously sequenced c. a light signal is generated during DNA synthesis to read the sequence and the signal strength is proportional to the number of a specific nucleotide incorporated.
You are studying a protein, and a small fragment of its sequence is shown below. You have decided that the glutamine in the protein segment has an important role in its function. You decide to change this glutamine to a lysine using DNA technology with the use of site-directed mutagenesis. 10-23 You have the amino acid sequence of a protein and wish to search for the gene encoding this protein in a DNA library. Using this protein sequence, you deduce a particular DNA sequence that can encode this protein.

(a) The human genome is more similar to the orangutan genome than it is to the mouse genome. (b) A comparison of genomes shows that 90% of the human genome shares regions of conserved synteny with the mouse genome. (c) Primates, dogs, mice, and chickens all have about the same number of genes.
