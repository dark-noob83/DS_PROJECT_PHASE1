If you have a qualifying cataract, your underlying cataract surgery will be covered by Medicare or most insurance plans. Depending on your insurance, you will likely have some out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, co-payments or co-insurance. 
1 Many patients who need cataract surgery are 65 or older, and Medicare covers cataract surgery. 2  For patients covered by insurance, typical out-of-pocket costs would consist of coinsurance of 10 to 20 percent or more -- or $1,000 or more for both eyes. 3  However, a supplemental Medicare policy could cover those costs. 1 Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed. 2  This typically costs $250 to $450 and usually is covered by insurance.
1 For patients not covered by health insurance, cataract surgery typically costs $5,000 to $10,000 per eye, for a total of $10,000 to $20,000 for both eyes. 2  For example, at Park Nicollet, a hospital in Minneapolis, Minn., it costs about $4,365 per eye -- a total of $8,730 for both eyes. 1 Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed. 2  This typically costs $250 to $450 and usually is covered by insurance.
If you want a high-tech, presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens for your cataract procedure, then costs would increase to an average of about $4,591 per eye (vs. $4,461 in 2010, $4,337 in 2011, $4,269 in 2012 and $4,350 in 2013). 1 An average additional charge of $2,188 per eye for a premium, presbyopia-correcting IOL, if you already have Medicare coverage for basic cataract surgery costs. 2  An average additional charge of $607 per eye, if you need an extra surgical procedure to correct mild astigmatism

Average Cost of Cataract Surgery. The average cost of Cataract surgery in a Medicare outpatient setting is generally around $2,500.00/eye for the surgeon, the out patient facility, and the anesthesia provider. Medicare would pay 80% or $2,000.00/eye and you would pay the remaining $500.00 out of pocket. If you are using the standard lens without any upgrades like astigmatism management/laser cataract surgery or ORA (intraoperative aberrometry), etc. the usually cataract surgery would be about $500 per eye out of pocket after Medicare (if you have already met your Medicare deductible) or $1,000 for both.
So while the costs of a basic cataract procedure and standard IOL would be covered by an insurance provider, you would need to pay out-of-pocket for any extra expense associated with a premium or presbyopia-correcting lens that may help perfect your vision. 1 An average additional charge of $2,188 per eye for a premium, presbyopia-correcting IOL, if you already have Medicare coverage for basic cataract surgery costs. 2  An average additional charge of $607 per eye, if you need an extra surgical procedure to correct mild astigmatism
You can have cataracts in one eye or both. Outpatient cataract surgery is typically covered under Medicare Part B benefits, while inpatient surgery is usually covered under Medicare Part A. You may have greater coverage and lower out-of-pocket costs if you have a Medicare Advantage or Medigap plan. See Medicare Plans. The actual cause of cataracts is unknown.
