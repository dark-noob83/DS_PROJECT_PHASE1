The entire process converts glucose into forms of energy the cell can easily use through two enzymatic pathways. In the first pathway, the 6-carbon glucose compound is broken down to pyruvic acid, a 3-carbon compound, which has several alternate uses depending on the needs of the cell. This 10-step chain of enzymatic reactions is called glycolysis.
Glycolysis involves nine distinct reactions that convert glucose into pyruvate. In this section, we will cover the first four of these reactions, which convert glucose into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
The anaerobic pathway in which pyruvate is converted to lactic acid is referred to as lactic acid fermentation. Glycolysis is the pathway is which glucose is oxidized into two molecules of pyruvic acid.
Husband. Father. Physician. The process by which glucose is turned into pyruvate is called glycolysis. In this process the six carbon (6C) glucose molecule is split into two (3C) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphates at an energy cost of 2 (2 ATPs are used up).
The anaerobic process of splitting glucose to form pyruvic acid is  called glycolysis. The citric acid cycle is a series of reactions  in aerobic respiration that begins and … ends with the same 6 carbon  compounds.
Glycolysis is the degredation of glucose and is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO− + H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy compounds ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
Gluconeogenesis Pathway. Basically Gluconeogenesis is the reversal of Glycolysis which is the process of breaking down of glucose to produce energy. [ 1 ]Glycolysis proceeds to another energy cycle called Citric acid cycle by forming a substance called pyruvate.
