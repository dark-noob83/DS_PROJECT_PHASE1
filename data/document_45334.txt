Your doctor may conduct liver enzyme and liver function tests if: 1  You are taking a medication that can harm the liver. 2  You have liver disease. 3  You have symptoms of liver or bile system disease (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, or yellow skin).
76. Liver function tests (LFTs) measure various chemicals in the blood made by the liver. An abnormal result indicates a problem with the liver, and may help to identify the cause. Further tests may be needed to clarify the cause of the liver problem.
Doctors usually do blood tests: (1) liver enzymes which show if there may be damage to the liver cells. (2) liver function tests to show if the cells of the liver are functioning well to keep the body healthy (3) viral testing to see if there is a liver problem caused by a virus like Hepatitis A,B,C,ETC.
Liver enzyme tests, formerly called liver function tests (LFTs), are a group of blood tests that detect inflammation and damage to the liver. They can also check how well the liver is working.
A liver function test (LFT) is a blood test that gives an indication of whether the liver is functioning properly. The test is also very useful to see if there is active damage in the liver (hepatitis) or sluggish bile flow (cholestasis). Liver function tests measure the amount of particular chemicals in the blood.
Some of these tests measure how well the liver is performing its normal functions of producing protein and clearing bilirubin, a blood waste product. Other liver function tests measure enzymes that liver cells release in response to damage or disease.
The physician may also order the LFT blood test for the patient that is known to have a liver problem to evaluate the extent of the health condition. However, these are only a few of the reasons why your physician may have ordered this type of test as it has multiple uses.
