What To Expect During Cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI takes place in a hospital or medical imaging facility. A radiologist or other doctor who has special training in medical imaging oversees MRI testing. Cardiac MRI usually takes 30 to 90 minutes, depending on how many pictures are needed. The test may take less time with some newer MRI machines. The MRI machine will be located in a special room that prevents radio waves from disrupting the machine.
Heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging method that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the heart. It does not use radiation (x-rays). Single MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film.
The length of MRI examinations can vary from 15 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, averaging 45 minutes. ChaCha! [ Source: http://www.chacha.com/question/how-long-does-a-mri-take ].
The scan will take 30 to 90 minutes. Preparation and sedation take an additional 60 minutes. The length of time depends upon the part of the body being scanned. https://www.med.virginia.edu/internet/radiology/pediatrics/pediatrics-mri-scan.cfm. A really long time, maybe half an hour, that you can't move you head.
1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a high strength magnet and radiowaves to scan the body and produce pictures or images. MRI does not use ionising radiation, which is required for many other types of imaging, and is not known to have any long term harmful effects.
