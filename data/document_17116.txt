The organisms in kingdom fungi include mushrooms, yeasts, molds, rusts, smuts, puffballs, truffles, morels, and molds. More than 70,000 species of fungi have been identified. T he fungi constitute and independent group to that of plants and animals.
Kingdom Fungi comprises the fungi, such as mushrooms, molds, and yeasts, eukaryotic heterotrophs that digest food outside of their bodies. Most fungi are multicellular, but some, the yeasts, are simple unicellular organisms probably evolved from multicellular ancestors.
Fungi are a group of living organisms, consisting from unicellular yeasts, and multicellular molds and mushrooms. A word fungus, plural fungi, is adopted from Latin fungus (mushroom), from Greek sphongos (sponge), and refers to a physical appearance of fungi.
Lesson Summary. The kingdom Fungi includes a vast variety of organisms such as mushrooms, yeast and mold, made up of feathery filaments called hyphae (collectively called mycelium). Fungi are multicellular and eukaryotic. They are also heterotrophs, and gain nutrition through absorption.
