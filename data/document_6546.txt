Normal axillary temperature is 97.8 degrees F. However, a normal infant's temperature can range between 97.6 to 100 degrees F. Rectal Method.... 1  How to Take A Baby's Temperature Under The Armpit. This measurement, also known as axillary temperature, tends to be about half a degree to a degree below oral temperature. Therefore, normal axillary temperature would range between 97.6 degrees and 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit (36.4-36.7 degrees Celsius).
Generally, the correlation of temperature results are as follows: 1  The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
Normal range runs between 97 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 36.0-37.7 degrees Celsius. Ear temperature (or tympanic temperature) also is very accurate in children and adults. 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) is the normal temperature for this method. Measuring body temperature orally is perhaps the most traditional means of measurement. Although 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the standard norm, healthy range can vary between 98.2 and 98.8 degrees (36.7-37.1 degrees Celsius). This measurement, also known as axillary temperature, tends to be about half a degree to a degree below oral temperature. Therefore, normal axillary temperature would range between 97.6 degrees and 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit (36.4-36.7
Temperature / Fever. Normal axillary (under the arm) temperature ranges from 97.5 to 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 to 37.4 degrees Celsius)*. Taking a rectal temperature. Normal rectal temperature is 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit or less (37.9 degrees Celsius or less)*. 1 Before taking your baby's axillary temperature, make sure the area under the arm is dry. 2  Insert the end of the thermometer under your baby's arm and hold his/her arm snugly against his/her body. 3  Wait five minutes or until the electronic thermometer beeps before removing. 4  Use only a blunt tipped rectal thermometer.
If you think your baby has a fever, it's important to know exactly what his temperature is, so you'll need a good digital thermometer. We'll help you choose one. (Get more details in our thermometer buying guide .). Regular multi-use digital thermometers are sold in drugstores for less than $10. Some babies don't mind having their temperature taken rectally, while others seem to hate it. If your baby protests, you might want to take her underarm (axillary) temperature first. If that reading is over 99 degrees Fahrenheit, take her rectal temperature for a more precise and accurate result.
1 The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.

Checking a person's temperature under the arm, known as the axillary site, is often easier than taking a rectal temperature in children and others who may not be able to assist you in properly taking an oral temperature reading. However, axillary readings are less reliable than those obtained orally or rectally. 
1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
1 An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 2  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature.
