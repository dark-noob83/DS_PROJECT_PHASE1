The Earth is constantly degassing, which transports helium from the crust and mantle into the oceans and atmosphere. Because it is such a light atom, helium escapes from Earth and is thereby continually lost from the atmosphere. The approximate lifetime of helium in the atmosphere is ~ 1 to 2 Myr.
This trace amount of helium is not gravitationally bound to the earth and is constantly lost to space. The earth's atmospheric helium is replaced by the decay of radioactive elements in the earth's crust. Alpha decay, one type of radioactive decay, produces particles called alpha particles. An alpha particle can become a helium atom once it captures two electrons from its surroundings.
The crust is the upper layer of the earth. It is where the movement  of plates occur due to which earthquakes occur. The Earth's crust  is a thin layer of rock, like skin on … an apple.
MATERIALS ON THE EARTH’S CRUST The Earth crust is the outer layer of our planet. It covers the whole Earth surface. The thickness of this layer varies from 6 to 12 Km on the seabed to up 60 Km in the great mountain ranges. The Earth crust is made up of rocks which in turn are made up of minerals.
The Earth's outermost layer of hard brittle rock is called the crust. The crust is typically about 23 miles thick beneath continents, and about 6.5 miles thick beneath oceans. … The crust is relatively light and brittle compared to other Earth layers. Most earthquakes occur within
Earth’s original atmosphere was probably just hydrogen and helium, because these were the main gases in the dusty, gassy disk around the Sun from which the planets formed. The Earth and its atmosphere were very hot. Molecules of hydrogen and helium move really fast, especially when warm.
