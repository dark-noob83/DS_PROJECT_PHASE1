It is used for molecular biology research. During the process of replication, an RNA primer is filled in the lagging strand of the DNA. DNA polymerase 1 removes the RNA primer and fills in the nucleotides which are necessary for the formation of the DNA in the direction- 5’ to 3’.
DNA POLYMERASE vs RNA POLYMERASE. The main function of a polymerase which is an enzyme is somehow similar to nucleic acid polymers like that of DNA and RNA.
Hey pal, DNA Polymerase is a polymerase that synthesizes a DNA strand ... so it's used in DNA replication. RNA Polymerase is not used to form the primer-that is primases job. RNA Pol is used during transcription to synthesize the mRNA strand. EK does a decent job describing a primer. I believe it is in orange text on the right hand margin. Anyhow, the primer starts DNA Polymerase off during
4.DNA is double stranded whereas RNA is a single stranded. 5.DNA contains the pentose sugar deoxyribose while RNA contains the pentose sugar ribose. 6.DNA polymerase will be continuous till the work is finally done wherein RNA polymerases will continue but eventually may break in the event it will reach a “stop” cycle.
1.DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA while RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA. 2.In contrast with the DNA polymerase, RNA polymerases do not necessarily require the so called primer to start the process and they actually have no proofreading systems.
7.Subunits contained in RNA polymerases must unwind the templates of DNA and the DNA polymerases do actually abide the helicase that the double helix may be open just in front of it. 8.Lastly, DNA polymerase is a lot faster compared to RNA polymerase.
