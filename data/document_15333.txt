The major difference between free and Pro version is the ability of SketchUp Pro to import from and export into AutoCAD. If you really want to import AutoCAD drawings, you could download the SketchUp Pro version for an 8 hour trial, import the AutoCAD drawing, and just not follow through with your purchase. The earlier version, SketchUp 7.1, allows for using a free AutoCAD import plugin that you can download from the Google SketchUp site
If you want to draw something 14 feet long, type 14’ , just to let SketchUp know that you mean feet instead of inches.
