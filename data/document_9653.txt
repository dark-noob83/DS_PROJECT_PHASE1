The price of oil rigs for land drilling in the United States typically starts at around $18 million to $20 million and goes up to around $25 million, but it can be nearly twice that amount depending on the specific rig purchased. The average cost for offshore rigs can be as much as 15 to 20 times greater than the average cost for land rigs. The least-expensive offshore rigs typically cost nearly $200 million. The average price for offshore oil-drilling rigs is approximately $650 million. The Brazilian energy company Petrobas, in a plan to replace leased U.S. and European rigs with its own fleet of offshore floating rigs, recently began producing offshore rigs estimated to cost up to $900 million each
Average costs vary widely between different types of oil rigs, starting at around $20 million and ranging as high as close to $1 billion. The cost of oil rigs and drilling equipment invariably represents a very large capital expenditure for an oil producer. The average cost for offshore rigs can be as much as 15 to 20 times greater than the average cost for land rigs. The least-expensive offshore rigs typically cost nearly $200 million. The average price for offshore oil-drilling rigs is approximately $650 million.

The price of oil rigs have tripled since 2003 and deepwater rigs now cost between $600 million and $650 million to build, according to Hemmingsen. Maersk Drilling’s deepwater semi-subs operate at water depths of as much as 3,000 meters (9,800 feet), according to the company’s website. “Deepwater is very promising,” said Hemmingsen, who took over responsibility for Maersk Drilling in 2005.
How deep do Offshore Rigs drill? Depending on the rig type, offshore rigs are rated to drill in water depths as shallow as 80 feet to as great as 12,000 feet. The greatest water depth a jackup can drill in is 550 feet, and many newer units have a rated drilling depth of 35,000 feet.
But the well turned out to be a dry hole with no oil. Little wonder then that oil drilling is risky and expensive. According to Arizona Geological Survey, Oil drilling in Arizona costs between $400,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the depth of the hole and its location. A rig capable of drilling most exploratory holes typically costs $8,000-15,000 per day.

The drilling equipment package is the largest equipment expenditure, and typically costs $20 to $70 million for jackups and $100 to $200 million for floaters (or on the order of 10 to 30% of total costs). 
Large capital expenditures are required to drill an offshore well, with rates to rent the drilling rig costing anywhere from $50,000 to $500,000 per day, depending on the rig type, water depth, market conditions and offshore basin.
