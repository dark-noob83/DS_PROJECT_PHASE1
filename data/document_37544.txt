One of the most important parts of a house is its foundation. When constructing a new home from the ground up, the cost of building a foundation will vary depending on the region and market in which the foundation is built as well as the complexity of the job. There are several different foundation types from which individuals who are constructing a home may choose. Construction costs include excavation, grading and the addition of a base layer of gravel that lies beneath the slab. Homeowners can expect to pay approximately $7,000 up to $16,000 to construct a concrete slab foundation for a home that is up to 1,800 square feet.
The budget will also include material and labor costs associated with building forms for the concrete, casting the footers and stem wall, and pouring and finishing the slab. At the time of publication, the cost of a typical slab foundation for a home between 1,600 and 1,800 square feet ranges between $7,000 and $16,000. Like most building costs, the cost of a foundation fluctuates from region to region, and the overall cost of a particular foundation will be influenced by both the complexity of the job and the local building market.
1 Labor costs to pour and form concrete run somewhere around $3.50 to $7.00 per square foot. 2  One homeowner paid $11,000 for a crawl space for a 1,500 square foot home. 3  One customer in Texas received a quote for a 2,500 square foot foundation slab of about $20,000. 1 Concrete is typically measured by cubic yards (3’x3’x3’). 2  An average cost for a cubic yard of concrete is $75 to $125, depending on how much is needed and local prices. 3 
1 Repairing a simple crack in a poured concrete foundation can cost about $400-$800, depending on the extent of the damage. 2  Replacing an entire basement floor can add another $200-$400. 3  And in earthquake-prone areas, reinforcing the foundation with anchor bolts runs $1,500-$3,500 or more. 4  Poor soil causes the most damage.
