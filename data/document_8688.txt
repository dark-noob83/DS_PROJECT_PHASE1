Egg to chick in just 3 weeks!) and require a constant temperature of 37.5°C. Eggs will start to produce their own heat in the latter stages of development but the incubator thermostat takes care of this, keeping the temperature the same throughout the incubation period. Humidity should ideally be between 45 and 50%. Eggs need turning regularly by 180 degrees and you will need to do this yourself if the incubator doesn’t have an automatic turning mechanism. Expect 50% to 75% of your eggs to hatch, not all eggs will be fertile. 
1 Temperature: Chicken eggs should be incubated at a temperature between 99 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (99.5 is often considered to be ideal). 2  Avoid temperatures outside the 97–103 °F (36–39 °C). 3  range. 4  If the temperature remains beyond either extreme for several days, hatchability may be severely reduced. Humidity should be around 50 to 60 percent throughout incubation, except during the last 3 days when you will want to raise it to 65 percent. You may need higher or lower humidity levels depending on the type of eggs you wish to hatch. Consult your hatchery or the available literature on hatching your species of bird.
We keep ours at 'basement' temperature. About 65 degrees, maybe a little cooler at times. We make a rule of it to turn the eggs 4 times a day and only 'store' them for about 3 days before they go in the incubator. . anything past 3 seems to drastically drop our hatch rate. Ideally hatching eggs should be stored between 55 to 65 degrees at 75% humidity. That's the ideal. But unless you live in the northern half of the country that's going to be hard to do for most of the year. Here in Florida I keep my eggs in my refrigerator which stays between 35-40 degrees.
The temperature is not the only consideration as the humidity must be rig … ht also. Eggs should be at a 55% humidity rate through to the 18th day and raised to better than 65% during the final days.Chickens take 21 days from start yo hatch and ducks can take as much as 35 days. 1 person found this useful. What temperature should you set a heating pad to hatch a bird egg? Normally eggs are hatched naturally in farms but in case of commercial manufacture of eggs on a large-scale still air incubators are used.. for these incubators an optimal tem … perature of about 102 fahreinheit is required.
The air cell increases in size during incubation at a rate that depends on temperature and humidity as moisture evaporates from the egg. The drawing shows the normal size of an egg's air cell at 7, 14, and 18 days of incubation. Size of the air cell in the egg on the 7th, 14th, and 18th day of incubation. Temperature –Maintain the temperature in the 99-102° F. temperature range (100-101° F., if possible). Place the thermometer to measure the temperature at a level at or slightly above where the center of the egg will be.
Temperature: The eggs need to be kept at 99.5 degrees at all times; just one degree higher or lower for a few hours can terminate the embryo. Humidity: 40 to 50 percent humidity must be maintained for the first 18 days; 65 to 75 percent humidity is needed for the final days before hatching. 
The heat from the candles can easily keep the eggs above 90°F until the power returns. Embryos have survived at temperatures below 90°F for up to 18 hours. You should continue to incubate the eggs after the outage; then candle them 4 to 6 days later to check for further development or signs of life. Extensive research has shown that the optimum incubator temperature is 100°F when relative humidity is 60 percent. Concentrations of oxygen should be above 20 percent, carbon dioxide should be below 0.5 percent, and air movement past the egg should be 12 cubic feet per minute.
When temperatures were at 98 degrees, eggs hatched a day or two late. When at 102 degrees, eggs hatched early and some chicks were deformed. When (hatching quail eggs) , keep the temperature at 100 degrees (or as close as possible), and we believe you will be satisfied with all your hatches. Coturnix eggs takes 16 to 18 days to hatch. all else same as bobwhi
This is important since the air stratifies in these incubators. There can be as much as a 5° difference in temperature from the top to the bottom of some of the still-air incubators. Humidity should be 60-65% (80-90° wet bulb) during incubation and 70-75% (92-97° wet bulb) at hatching time. It is very easy to overheat the eggs in still-air incubators and difficult to maintain proper humidity. Extensive research has shown that the optimum incubator temperature is 100°F when relative humidity is 60 percent. Concentrations of oxygen should be above 20 percent, carbon dioxide should be below 0.5 percent, and air movement past the egg should be 12 cubic feet per minute.
