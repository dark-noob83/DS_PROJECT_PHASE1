When you take oral capsule forms of hydrocodone, the drug is dissolved in the stomach and then absorbed through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Once hydrocodone is absorbed by the digestive system, it takes about 30 minutes for you to feel the effects of hydrocodone.
Best Answer: It typically takes 15-25 minutes to feel the full effects of the medication, sometimes it can be faster on an empty stomach and a bit slower on a fuller stomach. If you are still in pain, I myself would take another pill. If you wait too long before taking pain medication the pain can become unmanageable.
Hydrocodone’s kick. Hydrocodone is used to treat pain and is a relatively strong opioid drug included in brands like Vicodin, Lortab, or Norco. Hydrocodone is a powerful pain killer because it attaches to opiate receptors in the brain to prevent you from feeling pain.

Vicodin take an average of about 30 minutes to an hour to take effect on the body. The acetaminophen present in the medication helps to accelerate the absorption rate into the body. It may take longer for some people to feel Vicodin kick in, especially if they have a high tolerance to Vicodin.
