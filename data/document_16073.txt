A normal fetal heart rate (FHR) usually ranges from 120 to 160 beats per minute (bpm) in the in utero period. It is measurable sonographically from around 6 weeks and the normal range varies during gestation, increasing to around 170 bpm at 10 weeks and decreasing from then to around 130 bpm at term. Although in the healthy fetus the heart rate is usually regular, a beat-to-beat variation of approximately 5 to 15 beats per minute can be allowed.
Fetal Heart Rate for Gender Prediction. As the old wives' tale has it, if your unborn baby's heart rate is higher, above 140 beats per minute, that means you're carrying a girl. A lower heart rate below 140 bpm means you're having a boy. It's hard to resist such an easy test, and ever so tempting to over-analyze the pitter patter of that tiny heart
Confidence votes 202. Starting at week 5 the fetal heart will accelerate at a rate of 3.3 beats per day for the next month.

Also, arrhythmia may, at some point in development, be normal. During the second trimester, the baby’s heart may begin to beat irregularly as the electrical pathways of the heart mature. This is natural, and not a cause for alarm unless the arrhythmia lasts for a considerable period of time. Fetal arrhythmia is a term that refers to any abnormality in the heart rate of your baby. These can include tachycardia–an increased heart rate–or bradycardia, which is a slowed heartbeat. The normal heart rate for a fetus is anywhere between 120 and 160 beats per minut
Keep in mind that a baby's heartbeat is much faster than an adult's. If you're in your first trimester and you can't hear your baby's heartbeat, don't worry. Dopplers can't reliably detect a baby's heartbeat until 10 to 12 weeks. Your doctor may try again on your next visit.

By this point in the pregnancy, everything that is present in an adult human is present in the developing embryo. The embryo has reached the end of the embryonic stage and now enters the fetal stage. A strong fetal heartbeat should be detectable by ultrasound, with a heartbeat of 140-170 bpm by the 9th week. If a strong heartbeat is not detected at this point, another ultrasound scan may be done to verify the viability of the fetus.
