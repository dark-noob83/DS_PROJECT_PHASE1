EXTRAS: I think what really made the difference was all the extracurricular practice. Obviously there would be huge variation but an experienced piano teacher presumably would know roughly how much practice a student at grade X level is doing and how long they are typically at grade X before moving on. For bonus points, I'd love to see an estimate of hours for each grade.
Other piano teachers base practice recommendations on age, on level, on motivation, or a combination of those three factors. For four-and-five year old beginners, 10 minutes of practice time is a common recommendation, unless the child is a prodigy or unusually self-motivated.
