1. Don’t get too frivolous with your spending. You will have the urge to spend a lot of money on items for your baby, but the truth is that newborns don’t need a lot of the things parents rush out to buy. You can save yourself a ton of money if you concentrate on age-appropriate items in the beginning.
Finally, save the amount of money you need to cover those items plus about 20 percent extra for items you decide to buy on impulse. There will likely be plenty of those -- the baby cuteness factor is too much for most parents to resist, even if they're on their second or third.
Newborn babies use an average of 75 diapers per week and up to 320 diapers per month. At about $.25 per diaper, that adds up over the year. Tack on two boxes of wipes per month ($3 each), and baby soap, lotion, powder, oil, and diaper rash ointment (about $14 month) and you have an additional $240 per year.
Statistics. The costs of having and raising a baby will vary, depending on your unique situation and style of parenting. However, you can use statistical information to help you estimate how much money you might need.
RE: how much money should i save before having a baby? i want to be comfortable money wise and give my baby everything it needs. I&#39;m in australia so medical care is free and medication is only $5, so that doesn&#39;t need to be factored in.
After you bring a new baby into your family, you will probably want to spend as much time as you can with the little one before you go back to work. If you do not have paid leave through your job, save enough money to replace your income for the amount of time you plan to stay home with your new family favorite. For example, if you plan to stay home for three months, save three months' worth of income.
