An asteroid belt divides the inner planets (Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars) and outer planets (Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptune).
Nothing really separates the planets into groups. If you are referring to the outer planets as the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. With the inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. Then the difference is simply their masses.
The inner planets (in order of distance from the sun, closest to furthest) are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. After an asteroid belt comes the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The interesting thing is, in some other planetary systems discovered, the gas giants are actually quite close to the sun.
In our solar system, there are 8 planets. They are divided into two groups inner and outer planets. The inner solar system contains Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars the planets closest to the sun. The outer solar system contains Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
Â· just now. Report Abuse. If you mean what is the difference between the inner planets and the outer planets, the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) are mostly composed of rock and the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are mostly gases and ices. Pluto is also mostly ices but has been demoted from being a planet.
