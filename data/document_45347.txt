Moths also play a vital role in telling us about the health of our environment, like the canary in the coalmine. Since they are so widespread and found in so many different habitats, and are so sensitive to changes, moths are particularly useful as indicator species. Many birds eat both adult moths and their caterpillars, but the caterpillars are especially important for feeding the young. Some of Britain's favourite garden birds rely on caterpillars to rear their nestlings, with our blue tit chicks alone needing an estimated 35 billion a year!
The luna moth (Actias luna) is a lime-green, Nearctic Saturniid moth in the family Saturniidae, subfamily Saturniinae. It has a wingspan of up to 114 mm (4.5 in), making it one of the largest moths in North America. This moth is found in North America from east of the Great Plains in the United States to northern Mexico and from Saskatchewan eastward through central Quebec to Nova Scotia in Canada.
Although many people overlook them, moths are numerous and widespread, with over 2,500 species in Britain living in a wide range of habitats. They are a major part of our biodiversity and play vital roles in the ecosystem, affecting many other types of wildlife. Both adult moths and their caterpillars are food for a wide variety of wildlife, including other insects, spiders, frogs, toads, lizards, shrews, hedgehogs, bats and birds. Many birds eat both adult moths and their caterpillars, but the caterpillars are especially important for feeding the young.

Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.
Luna moths are attracted to the moon as a source of light. In spiritual terms, they signify rebirth and new beginnings. Because they gravitate towards light in the darkness of the night, the luna moth is seen as a symbol of spiritual transformation, of heightened awareness, and a striving towards truth.. This is a male Luna Moth (not 'Lunar moth'); only the fourth I've ever seen in 60 years. Luna moths are native to North America, and not so much rare as secretive. These are forest-dwelling, night-flying, short-lived moths. In New England, adults emerge from pupa in late May to mid-June.
Once the wings are inflated, the adult moth will wait until nightfall to fly off to find a mate. Adult Luna Moths don't eat; in fact, they don't even have a mouth. They only live for about a week, and their only purpose is to mate. Female Luna Moths release a chemical at night which attracts males. They only live for about a week, and their only purpose is to mate. The caterpillars will continue to eat and grow, molting their skins as they grow. They will do this five times over a period of three to four weeks. When the caterpillar is fully grown, it will be 2 1/2 inches long and ready to become a pupa.
Luna Moths are members of the Saturniidae family, also known as the Giant Silkworm Moths.. Luna Moths are huge moths, with a wingspan of four and a half inches. They have a white body, pinkish legs, and huge pale green wings. The hindwings have eyespots and long tails. They fly, only at night, in Spring and early Summer. The female Luna Moth lays eggs on the bottom of Black Walnut leaves. They only live for about a week, and their only purpose is to mate. The caterpillars will continue to eat and grow, molting their skins as they grow. They will do this five times over a period of three to four weeks. When the caterpillar is fully grown, it will be 2 1/2 inches long and ready to become a pupa.

Luna Moth. Description: The striking Luna Moth is a large pale-green moth with a wingspan of about 11.5 centimeters (nearly four inches). Both males and females are entirely green with conspicuous “eye spots” on the lower wings meant to confuse predators. Similar to all moths, adult Luna Moths do not have mouths and consequently do not eat. Their sole purpose is to reproduce. The average life span of a Luna Moth is about a week. Range: The Luna Moth is found throughout eastern Canada and the United States, west to the Great Plains. They are found south to Northern Mexico
After breaking out of its cocoon, the moth's sole purpose is to reproduce, and after this they die. The Luna moth is a Saturniidae, a group name which applies to some of the larger and more spectacular species in the Lepidoptera category. As with all Sarurniidae, this moth has no mouth and no need to eat, and therefore has a very limited life span, in the Luna moth's case, only one week.
