Bankruptcy is a legal process that releases a person from almost all of their debts. You can apply to become bankrupt voluntarily if you have a debt of any amount you cannot pay.
Bankruptcy is a difficult and painful process. It can also be an embarrassment, and people may not want to admit to going through bankruptcy. If you need to know if someone you are dealing with is bankrupt, or has gone through bankruptcy in the past, you can check the records of bankruptcy courts to find out. The court records include both personal and business bankruptcies.
If your paying any monies to that person as long as you know their name then write them a cheque and if the person objects give you a **** and bull then you know there bankrupt as any cheque paid into their bank will go to their creditors they may ask you to make it payable to someone else So beware.
For individuals, Chapter 7 is the most common type of bankruptcy claim. Most businesses will file a Chapter 11 claim. Thus, if a person has filed under Chapter 7, then you know that they are probably filing due to personal hardship rather than for business purposes.
Report Abuse. If you're owed money by someone filing bankruptcy, you should be on their creditor list and receive notice by mail. Bankruptcy is done through the Federal court system. You can call the clerk of court for the bankruptcy office in your area. Look in the blue pages of your phone book, the government section. They will likely be able to search by name and tell you if someone is listed. You will probably have to go down to the courthouse to view the actual paperwork.
If they declared bankruptcy but did NOT list you as a creditor then they still owe you. However, if you wish, go to the court house in the town or county where you live and see if you're a creditor. If they didn't list you, they can't have their debt to you discharged, so
