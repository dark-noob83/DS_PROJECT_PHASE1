Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas that heads the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among all the elements.
It is less soluble in water than any other gas. The Physical and Chemical Properties are the characteristics of a substance, like Helium, which distinguishes it from any other substance. Most common substances exist as States of Matter as solids, liquids, gases and plasma.
The fact that helium is inert and does not form compounds or react to any existing element is its chemical property….”its inability to undergo a change that alters its composition”.[“Physical and Chemical Properties of Matter” University of California Davis ].
Helium DOES have chemical properties. By definition, a chemical property is “any characteristic that gives a sample of matter the ability/inability to undergo a change that alters its composition.” Considering this definition, helium is matter and therefore possesses
Helium. Properties. Gaseous chemical element, symbol: He, atomic number: 2 and atomic weight 4,0026 g/mol. Helium is one of the noble gases of group O in the periodic table. It’s the second lightest element. The main helium source in the world is a series of fields of natural gas in the United States.

Helium is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. It has a number of unusual properties. For example, it has the lowest boiling point of any element, -268.9°C (-452.0°F). The boiling point for a gas is the temperature at which the gas changes to a liquid. The freezing point of helium is -272.2°C (-458.0°F).
