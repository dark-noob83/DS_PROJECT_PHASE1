Cook until the ham reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Remove from oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 15 to 20 minutes. NOTE: Cutting into the meat too early will cause a significant loss of juice. Drain, glaze, and brown at 400 F 15 minutes.) 10 to 16, whole; 5 to 8, half 20 to 25 PRE-COOKED HAM A precooked ham does not have to be cooked, but will taste better if you heat it thoroughly to an internal temperature of 140 degrees F. (60 C). Place the ham in a 325 degrees F. oven (163 C). You want to reheat the ham without drying it out. The best way to do this is to place the ham on a rack in a roasting pan

1 For a whole 10- to 15-pound ham, allow 18 to 20 minutes per pound; for a half--5 to 7 pounds--about 20 minutes per pound; or for a shank or butt portion weighing 3 to 4 pounds, about 35 minutes to the pound. 2  In all cases, cook uncovered until the internal temperature reaches 160°F. 1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. 2 
Try to work the glaze into the scored lines. 5 Place ham in oven. Cook for about 1 1/2 hours (check after 1 hour, will take longer if the ham is not at room temp to begin with), or about 10 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature of the ham is 110°-120° (use a meat thermometer). 
1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. 2  To heat the ham, place it on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and bake uncovered. 3  For a whole ham, allow 15 to 18 minutes to the pound; for a half, 18 to 24 minutes per pound. 4  The ham will be ready when the internal temperature reaches 140°F. 1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. 2  For a whole 10- to 15-pound ham, allow 18 to 20 minutes per pound; for a half--5 to 7 pounds--about 20 minutes per pound; or for a shank or butt portion weighing 3 to 4 pounds, about 35 minutes to the pound.
1 Bake the ham for 2 hours in the preheated oven. 2  The internal temperature should be 160 degrees F (80 degrees C) when done. 3  Be sure not to touch the bone when taking the temperature. 4  Remove ham from bag to a serving plate, and let stand for 10 minutes before carving.
