Here's a few more resources you can use tho to find the carrier for mobile / cellular phones: http://www.reversephonedetective.com/. http://www.tracenumber.com/ - Gives you location and carrier and type of phone (land line or cellular/mobile). http://il-phone.info/. The problem is now that people can move their phones to any carrier, that site is only good up until the person moves the phone to a new carrier. For example, I tested it on my phone and it is showing my original carrier I signed up the phone with, not AT&T whom I'm currently using (iPhone.....). Hope this helps!
