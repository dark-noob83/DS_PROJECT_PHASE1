Definition. Felsic rocks are igneous rocks that are rich in feldspar and silicon, in the form of quartz (the word 'felsic' was made up from parts of those words). Because they are made of lighter elements, they tend to be more buoyant than mafic rocks such as basalt, which are high in magnesium and iron.
