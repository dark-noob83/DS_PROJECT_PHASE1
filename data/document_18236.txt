Complete and Incomplete combustion. Combustion is the process of the burning of a fuel in the presence of oxygen. Combustion reactions are exothermic and produce heat and sometimes light energy. Common examples of combustion are. 1  the burning of coal in a power station. 2  the burning of petrol in an automobile engine
You should be able to write balanced symbol equations for the complete combustion, or incomplete combustion, of a simple hydrocarbon fuel, if you are given its molecular formula. The formula of oxygen gas is O 2. 
The Inc omplete Combustion of Natural Gas-Methane. Incomplete combustion means burning in a lack of air (not enough oxygen). If there is not enough oxygen available for all the carbon to turn into carbon dioxide (see complete combustion), then some or all of the carbon turns to carbon monoxide. This happens with any hydrocarbon. We shall take methane as an example.
Incomplete combustion process(es). Definition: A reaction or process which entails only partial burning of a fuel. This may be due to a lack of oxygen or low temperature, preventing the complete chemical reaction. Carbon monoxide is produced as a byproduct from incomplete combustion of carbon.

Carbon monoxide is produced as a byproduct from incomplete combustion of carbon. Report Abuse. The chemical equation for imcomplete combustion is any combustion reaction that does not result in only the products of water and carbon dioxide. Many posters mentioned carbon monoxide as an incomplete combustion product and they are right, but it isn't the only incomplete combustion product.
Incomplete combustion. Incomplete combustion occurs when the supply of air or oxygen is poor. Water is still produced, but carbon monoxide and carbon are produced instead of carbon dioxide. In general for incomplete combustion: hydrocarbon + oxygen → carbon monoxide + carbon + water. The carbon is released as soot. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas, which is one reason why complete combustion is preferred to incomplete combustion. Gas fires and boilers must be serviced regularly to ensure they do not produce carbon monoxide. Here are the equations for the incomplete combustion of propane, where carbon is produced rather than carbon monoxide: propane + oxygen → carbon + water. C 3 H 8 + 2O 2 → 3C + 4H 2 O. Page: 1  1.
The general reaction equation for incomplete combustion of one mole of a hydrocarbon in oxygen is: The simple word equation for the incomplete combustion of a hydrocarbon in oxygen is: For stoichiometric (complete) combustion, z = x + ¼ y. Complete combustion is stoichiometric with respect to the fuel, where there is no remaining fuel, and ideally, no remaining oxidant.
Combustion /kəmˈbʌs.tʃən/ or burning is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. Complete combustion is stoichiometric with respect to the fuel, where there is no remaining fuel, and ideally, no remaining oxidant.
