In the ocean, the thermocline may be thought of as an invisible blanket which separates the upper mixed layer from the calm deep water below. Factors that affect the depth and thickness of a thermocline include seasonal weather variations, latitude and local environmental conditions, such as tides and currents.
Ocean water, with an average salinity of 35 psu, freezes at -1.94 degrees Celsius (28.5 degrees Fahrenheit). That means at high latitudes sea ice can form. The average temperature of the ocean surface waters is about 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 90 % of the total volume of ocean is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean. The deep ocean is not well mixed. The deep ocean is made up of horizontal layers of equal density
The oceans have a well-mixed surface layer where the water temperatures are relatively constant. Below the mixed layer is the thermocline, a zone where temperature changes rapidly with depth. Below the thermocline the temperature is relatively uniform with depth, showing only a small decrease to the ocean bottom. The temperature structure of the upper ocean varies during the year. There is little wind so the mixed layer is shallow, as is the thermocline. During the fall and winter, cooler temperatures and wind from storms cool the surface waters. This increases the density of the surface water, which then sinks to a level of similar density.
In the thermocline, the temperature decreases rapidly from the mixed layer temperature to the much colder deep water temperature. In the ocean, the depth and strength of the thermocline vary from season to season and year to year. A thermocline is the transition layer between the warmer mixed water at the surface and the cooler deep water below. It is relatively easy to tell when you have reached the thermocline in a body of water because there is a sudden change in
The red line in this illustration shows a typical seawater temperature profile. In the thermocline, temperature decreases rapidly from the mixed upper layer of the ocean (called the epipelagic zone) to much colder deep water in the thermocline (mesopelagic zone).

Confidence votes 542. A thermocline is an abrupt change in the temperature of ocean water within a small depth. Warm water has a lower density than cold water so it creates a thin layer, commonly called the thermocline, which separates the hot and cold water. Warm, Surface Water. _______________________________________________________. Thermocline. _______________________________________________________. Cold, Deep Water. Thermocline is located in a giant body of fluid such as air or water. It is the layer where climate changes more quickly than any other layer section below or above.
A thermocline (sometimes metalimnion in lakes) is a thin but distinct layer in a large body of fluid (e.g. water, such as an ocean or lake, or air, such as an atmosphere) in which temperature changes more rapidly with depth than it does in the layers above or below. Factors that affect the depth and thickness of a thermocline include seasonal weather variations, latitude and local environmental conditions, such as tides and currents.
If you want to know about the temperature of the ocean, you have to learn about the parts of the the ocean first. The top part of the ocean is called the surface layer. Then there is a boundary layer called the thermocline. The thermocline separates the surface layers and the deep water of the ocean. The average temperature of the ocean surface waters is about 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 90 % of the total volume of ocean is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean.
