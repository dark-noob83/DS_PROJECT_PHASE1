As you get older, your body changes. These changes can increase the chances that you’ll have side effects when you take medications. Older people usually have more health problems and take more medications than younger people. Because of this, they are also more likely to experience dangerous drug-drug interactions. Every year, one in three adults 65 or older has one or more adverse (harmful) reactions to a medication or medications. This is why it’s important for researchers to identify and help reduce use of drugs that are associated with more risks than benefits in older people. The Beers Criteria was last updated in 2003. 
3 • Americans age 65 years and older are more likely to take prescription medications on a regular basis than those under age 65. • People who are retired are more likely to say they take prescription drugs on a regular basis than those who are employed. 3 Reported differences are significant at the .05 level. 5People who say they take prescription drugs on a regular basis report taking an average of four different prescription drugs daily (Figure One).

• Americans age 65+ (87%) are even more likely to say they take a prescription drug on a regular basis than those between the ages of 50-64 years (67%). • Those who say they are currently taking prescription drugs regularly say they take on average four different prescriptions drugs daily. 5People who say they take prescription drugs on a regular basis report taking an average of four different prescription drugs daily (Figure One).

Elderly patients take about three times as many medications as younger patients do. 1 They are also the greatest consumers of prescribed and nonprescribed medications. 2 There has been a gradual increase in prescription drug use in the United States. According to the Medicare, the average number of prescriptions per year, including refills, is currently 28.5 per senior (up from 19.6 in 1992).
The average cost per prescription has also jumped from $28.50 in 1992 to $42.30 in 2000, an increase of 48%. Since the elderly have less participation in drug trials, there is insufficient information on the side effects and adverse reactions of drugs on the elderly. 1 They are also the greatest consumers of prescribed and nonprescribed medications. 2 There has been a gradual increase in prescription drug use in the United States. According to the Medicare, the average number of prescriptions per year, including refills, is currently 28.5 per senior (up from 19.6 in 1992).
1 Today there are over 43.1 million adults aged 65 and older in the United States; by 2040, that number will rise to 79.7 million. 2  Seniors represent 13.7% of the United States population, about 1 in 7 Americans. 3  Nearly 92% of older adults have at least one chronic condition, and 77% have at least two. Health Affairs 2001;6: 267–78. 1  Seniors represent just over 13% of the population, but consume 40% of prescription drugs and 35% of all over the counter drugs. 2  On average, individuals 65 to 69 years old take nearly 14 prescriptions per year, individuals aged 80 to 84 take an average of 18 prescriptions per year.

Between 1986 and 2002 Americans age 45 and older reported their regular use of prescription drugs increased from 52% to 75%. At the same time, there was a similar increase in the proportion Americans age 45 and older who say they have health insurance for prescription drugs (51% in 1986 and 76% in 2002). 5People who say they take prescription drugs on a regular basis report taking an average of four different prescription drugs daily (Figure One).
