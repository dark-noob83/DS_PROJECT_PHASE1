The power in a battery can be impressive. Take a standard car battery. It is rated at 45 amp/hours. That means it can crank out 2.25 amps for 20 hours. Also it will start out at about 12.9 volts and drop to about 11 volts, averaging about 12 volts during the period.
ANSWER: The most common battery rating is the AMP-HOUR RATING. This is a unit of measurement for battery capacity, obtained by multiplying a current flow in amperes by the time in hours of discharge. (Example: A battery which delivers 5 amperes for 20 hours delivers 5 amperes times 20 hours, or 100 ampere-hours.).
If a battery is said to have 20 amp-hours of capacity, it means that it can hypothetically discharge one amp of current for 20 hours, 20 amps for one hour, or any combination of amps and hours that equal 20 amp-hours. That might be five amps for four hours, 10 amps for two hours, or 6.66 amps for three hours.

If it says 60 ampere-hours then, if it is in good condition, it should be able to deliver a current of near to 60 amps for 1 hour or 30 amps for 2 hours or 1 amp for 60 hours, etc. The condition of any battery will deteriorate over time: depending on its original quality and the kind of use it has been subjected-to.
A standard small car battery is about 45 amp/hours. That means that it will supply over two amps for 20 hours. A battery should not be discharged at a higher current draw, or asked to deliver more amps than its amp/hour rating divided by 10 in order to get maximum capacity out of it.
Most batteries are rated in electrical capacity for a discharge rate of 20 hours. A 20 amp/hour battery should provide one amp of current for 20 hours before being fully discharged. It will still show a voltage, it will no longer be functioning correctly and if rechargeable, it will be in serious need of a recharge.
