Hi, I am also searching for such answer. My 97 crv keeps leaking oil from the engine. 2 days ago I have an oil changed in a local mechanic shop. They noticed the problem too and I was quoted $260 for fixing it by changing a new valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket and a drain plug, of course, including labor charge. I didn't expect to pay close to $300 to solve this problem in a regular oil change visit. 4)I replaced a valve cover gasket on a 1996 Honda Odyssey which would be the equivalent job as on a 97 CRV. It is about the easiest gasket job you can do for this vehicle. A rubber gasket should not cost more than $25-$35 at a local auto parts store.
The OIl Pan Gasket sells for around $49 and the Labor Time Guide calls for 3 hours to complete the job. Labor rates vary from shop to shop, so what you pay for labor will effect the botXXXXX XXXXXne. For a job of this type, a fair labor rate can by anywhere from $85-$125 per hour. To this you will need to add the cost of an Oil Change. This can vary from shop to shop, but the average is around $25. 
Parts: $15 - $29. The average cost for an oil pan reseal-engine is between $396 to $511. Labor costs are estimated between $381 to $482 while parts are priced between $15 to $29. Get a personalized estimate based on your location and specific car. Estimate does not include taxes and fees. 
2) I had my oil pan gasket replaced in Long Beach, CA in December of '06. The oil pan gasket cost $10, if purchased from an after market auto parts store, the repair shop charged $25. It was $100 for the labor and that was after haggling them down to that amount. 4)I replaced a valve cover gasket on a 1996 Honda Odyssey which would be the equivalent job as on a 97 CRV.

bbmak024, You can buy an OEM oil pan from rockauto ranging $16.50 - $53 for an acdelco brand. Labor on the book is only 1.1 hours times the prevailing labor rate in your market so you should end up spending from $80 to $150 total + oil change. Or you can find a local home mechanic on craigslist, ask and call 2-3 of his references and pay him/her $25-40 for labor.

I still think $750 for the rear main seal is a little high. However, $450 for an oil pan gasket is just crazy. Only 8 bolts to remove the oil pan and he wanted $450.

My Infiniti dealer wanted $2200 to replace the oil pan. The part costs about $300 and labor costs came in at $1900. You may be able to save some money by buying the part yours â€¦ elf and having an outside shop do the job. My local Nissan dealership said they would do it for $1500. You will want to make sure you have purchased not only the oil pan gasket and sealer for the gasket.. But also the sealer and gasket for the exaust.. These only run about $5-10 each. Then after removing the exaust push it to the side..
I drive an 04 Infiniti i35. With the rear main seal they will have to drop the tranny to get to it. That's more work than the oil pan gasket. I still think $750 for the rear main seal is a little high. However, $450 for an oil pan gasket is just crazy. Only 8 bolts to remove the oil pan and he wanted $450.
Here is one oil pan replacement that calls for 10+ Hours Labor. That would be multiplied by the Shop Hourly Labor Rate for each hour to get a labor estimate. If a shop charges $75.00 per hour, then 10+ hours would be $750.00+ in labor then add in the parts plus new oil and a new filter.
