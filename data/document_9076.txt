An average home needs 3 tons of heating capacity, and the average cost of a geothermal system is at least $2,500 per ton of capacity. Generally, for each ton of capacity, air source heat pumps are about $3,000 less to install than geothermal heat pumps. 1 Low operating cost – geothermal heat pump cost tends to be lower than conventional heating systems by anywhere from $400 to $1,400 per year. 2  Despite spending more initially, geothermal heating ends up paying back in around five years.
1 CostHelper readers report spending $12,000-$15,000 for complete installation of a geothermal system, at an average cost of $13,400; and a reader in Iowa spent $35,000 to install three geothermal units (one for each floor of a 6,500-square-foot barn which was converted into a bed and breakfast). HRV installed as well. Geothermal is way too much money and the life of the system is 15 years vs. 45 years for a good quality electric boiler. PEX tubing for radiant heat has a life expectancy of 100 to 600 years according to some scientists.
Fact 3: Geothermal has real benefits. Much lower operating costs than other systems. A geothermal heat pump will immediately save you 30 to 60 percent on your heating and 20 to 50 percent on your cooling costs over conventional heating and cooling systems. Uses clean, renewable energy (the sun). For a typical 2,000-sq.-ft. home, a geothermal retrofit ranges from $10,000 to $20,000. The system may require ductwork modifications along with extensive excavation. In a new home, installation costs would be on the lower end. Even so, a geothermal system will cost about 40 percent more than a traditional HVAC system.
Geothermal heating system price varies depending on the type of loop system, usually either vertical or horizontal. On average, a typical home of 2500 square feet, with a heating load of 60,000 BTU and a cooling load of 60,000 BTU will cost between $20,000 to $25,000 to install. Because of the upfront cost for installing geothermal heat pump systems, it is very common to finance these systems. Monthly payments for financing a geothermal system are very reasonable and can actually save a homeowner money as soon as the system is installed. Two examples of financing are listed below.
Renewable Energy Vermont estimates the cost of the above ground geothermal components at $3,800 to $5,000 per ton of capacity at the time of publication, plus $1,500 to $2,000 per ton for the underground portion of a typical geothermal system. While geothermal heating and cooling costs several times more than other technologies, these systems pay for themselves in energy savings in 5 to 10 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
This is around double the cost of a conventional heating, cooling, and hot water system, but geothermal heating/cooling systems can reduce utility bills by 40% to 60%. The payback for a system can range from 2-10 years, while the lifetime of a system can be 18-23 years, almost double a conventional system. Because of the upfront cost for installing geothermal heat pump systems, it is very common to finance these systems. Monthly payments for financing a geothermal system are very reasonable and can actually save a homeowner money as soon as the system is installed. Two examples of financing are listed below.
According to the United States Department of Energy the average cost of a geothermal heat pump system is $2,500 per ton. The agency goes on to say that the average residential property is going to require a unit of three tons to supply their needs. The modern system will include a ground heat exchanger that is either a closed or open loop variety (with the closed loop the most common). For the purpose of this discussion we will look at the materials and costs associated with the installation of a closed loop geothermal heating system in a residential property.
Let’s not sugarcoat it—installing a geothermal system is expensive. It costs $10,000 to $30,000 depending on your soil conditions, plot size, system configuration, site accessibility and the amount of digging and drilling required. For a typical 2,000-sq.-ft. home, a geothermal retrofit ranges from $10,000 to $20,000. The system may require ductwork modifications along with extensive excavation. In a new home, installation costs would be on the lower end. Even so, a geothermal system will cost about 40 percent more than a traditional HVAC system.
NEXT STEP. Find out how much your project will cost. Provide a few details about your project and receive competitive quotes from local pros. The average national cost to install a geothermal heating or cooling system is $5,745, with most homeowners spending between $3,534 and $11,089. The installation of a geothermal heating and air conditioning system will pay for itself after two to 10 years. The exact payback time depends on several factors including current utility rates, how energy efficient the rest of the home is and how much energy the home typically uses for heating and cooling purposes.
