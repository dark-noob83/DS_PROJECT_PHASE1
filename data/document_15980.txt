Most people love the taste of sweets, and they're seldom disappointed -- sugar is added to an array of foods, including soda, breakfast cereals, baked goods and even to foods not normally considered sweet, such as bread and canned soups. As of 2010, the American diet has 19 percent more sugar than in 1970, according to TIME Magazine.. Rates of obesity and some chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke, have increased right along with it.
The World Health Organization issued new recommendations for sugar intake Wednesday, halving its optimal recommended allowance from 10% of what people eat per day to 5%. Most of that isnâ€™t poured on at the dinner table with a spoon, but hiding in plain sight, in processed foods and sweetened beverages. For an adult who consumes 2,000 calories a day, 5% of total energy intake works out to about 25 grams, or 6 teaspoons, of added sugar.
A committee of scientists has advised the government to halve the current recommended daily intake of sugar. Nutrition experts say no more than 5% of daily calories should come from added sugar-about seven teaspoons. Most people consume at least twice this limit. The government has said it will accept the recommendations and will use them to develop its national strategy on childhood obesity, which is due out later this year. Achieving the expected threshold for added sugar-no more than 5% of calories consumed-will be a challenge for government, industry and the public. At the moment, the average intake in all age groups is
3.Use the rule of 4 to calculate added sugar intake for your own daily calories. Start with your calories, and use the first 3 numbers for the 10 percent added sugar goal (1,500 daily calories is 150; 2,400 daily calories is 240). Divide your number by 4 to get daily sugar grams; divide grams by 4 to get your daily teaspoons.

Women should limit added sugar to 24 grams, or 6 teaspoons, each day. As of 2010, the American diet has 19 percent more sugar than in 1970, according to TIME Magazine.. Rates of obesity and some chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke, have increased right along with it.
The World Health Organization is dropping its sugar intake recommendations from 10 percent of your daily calorie intake to 5 percent. For an adult of a normal body mass index (BMI), that works out to about 6 teaspoons -- or 25 grams -- of sugar per day. Many people don't realize much of the sugar they take in are hidden in processed foods, according to WHO. A can of soda may contain up to 10 teaspoons or 40 grams of sugar
DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include: 1  Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%-98%) healthy people. 1 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%-98%) healthy people. 2  Adequate Intake (AI): established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA and is set at a level assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy.
When it comes to added sugars in the diet, here's the bottom line: For 2000 calories per day, 50 grams of added sugars, about 12 teaspoons. Start with your calories, and use the first 3 numbers for the 10 percent added sugar goal (1,500 daily calories is 150; 2,400 daily calories is 240). Divide your number by 4 to get daily sugar grams; divide grams by 4 to get your daily teaspoons.
They were opened up for public comment through March 31, 2014. The American Heart Association recommends limiting sugar intake to no more than half of your daily discretionary calorie allowance: No more than 100 calories per day for women (about 6 teaspoons) and no more than 150 calories per day for men (9 teaspoons). For an adult of a normal body mass index (BMI), that works out to about 6 teaspoons -- or 25 grams -- of sugar per day.
For a person consuming 2000 calories, this is about 200 calories per day (or 50 grams and about 12 teaspoons a day). Here's how to translate from calories to grams to teaspoons. Use the divide by 4 rule of simple sugar math. Take the calories and divide by 4 to get the grams of added sugar. Start with your calories, and use the first 3 numbers for the 10 percent added sugar goal (1,500 daily calories is 150; 2,400 daily calories is 240). Divide your number by 4 to get daily sugar grams; divide grams by 4 to get your daily
