Types of DNA Analysis. DNA analysis is the process in which genetic sequences are studied. It is used by law enforcement and medical personnel to identify a particular person or species, and even specific cancers and diseases. At one point the analysis process was very limited.
Back in 1985, the first genetic fingerprint was a miracle of science. Today, DNA analysis is standard practice for defining paternity or maternity, predisposition to disease, embryonic health, criminal guilt or innocence, and so on.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, categorizes DNA analysts as forensic science technicians. The job of the forensic science technician or DNA analyst is to analyze the evidence from crime scenes for the purpose of connecting it to a suspect. This evidence may include blood, bodily fluids, or hair follicles.
In tracking down criminals, it is the DNA Analyst who gets provided samples from which DNA traces are drawn. From the samples (pieces of evidence such as cigarette butts, blood or hair), the analyst is able to determine the identity of the people whose DNA matches those in the samples.
DNA Structure and Function. It is vital to understand the structure and function of DNA and how this relates to DNA analysis in forensic science. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule arranged into a double-helix, its structure first described by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.
