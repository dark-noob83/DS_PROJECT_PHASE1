The qualified dividend tax rates are 0%, 15%, and beginning in 2013, a 20% maximum tax. Qualified dividends are subject to the 0% rate for taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets. For taxpayers in the 25%, 33% and 35% tax brackets, the tax rate on qualified dividends is 15%. For 2013 and beyond, a 20% rate applies if the regular tax rate is 39.6%

Qualified dividend. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Qualified dividends, as defined by the United States Internal Revenue Code, are ordinary dividends that meet specific criteria to be taxed at the lower long-term capital gains tax rate rather than at higher tax rate for an individual's ordinary income. For dividends that do not meet the above criteria, the effective qualified dividend tax rate is determined by the date on which the dividend was paid and the individual's ordinary income tax bracket.
A qualified dividend is a type of dividend that is taxed at the capital gains tax rate. Generally speaking, most regular dividends from U.S. companies with normal company structures (corporations) are qualified. For individuals, estates, and trusts, qualified dividends are taxed at the current capital gains rate of 15%. For individuals whose income tax rate is 10% or 15%, then the capital gains tax rate is zero.
