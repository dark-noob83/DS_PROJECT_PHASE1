The four types of lipids are triglycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, and sterols (cholesterol). Triglycerides are important for metabolism and production of energy. Fatty acids are used to make lipids in cells, attatch to phosphate groups to form phospholipids, and they are used for storage. Phospholipids are the main part of cell membranes and assist in regulating cell environment.
The different types of lipids are triglycerides, sterols, and  phospholipids. Triglycerides include many fats and sterols,  including cholesterol. A phospholipid consists of … two fatty acids,  glycerol, and a phosphate group. Joanna Grana Maciel. Lipids come in the form of fatty acids, waxes, steroids and neutral fats. They can also be in compound form, which occurs when the lipids combine with another chemical compound. Under the latter category are lipolipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids. 1 person found this useful.
Phospholipids consist of two fatty acid chains, a phosphate group and a glycerol group. Phospholipids are characterized by their hydrophobic--not soluble on water--tails, formed by the fatty acid chains and hydrophilic--soluble in water--heads. Overview. Lipids are a group of biological molecules that all share two distinct characteristics: they are insoluble in water, and they are rich in energy due to the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds.
Out of all lipid compounds; three types of lipids are more common. They are also called as neutral fats. The triglycerides have ester as functional group which comprised of one glycerol molecule (1,2,3-trihydroxypropane) combined with three fatty acids molecules. Lipids are primarily involve in the formation of cell membranes which is a bilipid layer and present in all living things like bacteria and human. Lipids also present in the form of more complex structures such as cholesterol and other biologically active molecules in living systems.
By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Lipids are a diverse group of fat-soluble biological molecules. Here is a look at different types of lipids and where they are found. 1  Triacylglycerols or Triglycerides. 2  The largest class of lipids goes by different names: triacylglycerols, triglycerides, glycerolipids, or fats

Phospholipids are the main part of cell membranes and assist in regulating cell environment.
Lipids are a group of naturally occurring molecules that include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, phospholipids, and others. Fatty acids or fatty acid residues when they form part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis.
This is the last class of macromolecules. Unlike the previous groups, however, lipids are a chemically diverse group of molecules that all share a common property: they are (relatively) insoluble in water due to their hydrophobicity (and thus soluble in other lipids).
