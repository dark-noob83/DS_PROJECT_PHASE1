Bowel health is an important topic, as changes in bowel movements can be a sign of a health problem. But before you begin to worry about how “normal” you are, you have to know what a regular bowel movement is for you. Many people wrongly believe that having regular bowel movements means you move your bowels every day.
Many people worry about going the “correct” number of times a day. Again, this can vary widely from person to person. One does not have to have a bowel movement every day. A person may goes 2-3 times a day or once every 3-4 days and be considered normal if there are no symptoms of pain, bloating or discomfort.
The average number of bowel movements for formula-fed babies is about 3 per day. The average number of bowel movements for breast-fed babies is 6 per day. This is just an average, and your child may have more or less bowel movements and still be normal. Signs of constipation include hard stool and the appearance of straining or pain with bowel movements.
People usually have a myth that only 1 bowel movement per day is normal. Fact is that there are no fix numbers. This only depends on your body and your lifestyle. Generally people have 3 to 4 movements every day. Below that some times people have the issues like constipation etc.
School of Medicine, Family Medicine answered. Generally the normal number of bowel movements a person may have ranges from 3 per day to one every 3 days. Each person may be slightly different, and this variation is normal. Less than one stool every 3 days may indicate constipation if the stool is dry, hard, and difficult to pass.
