Charges are lower overseas, despite longer stays. The cost of the average American hospital stay nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010 while average stay length declined. The decade was a period of low inflation, but some sectors of the economy didn’t get the memo. 
In 2012, mean hospital costs per stay for surgical stays ($21,200) were 2.5 times the mean costs for medical stays ($8,500) and approximately five times the mean costs for maternal and neonatal stays ($4,300). 5 ■ Medicare-covered stays had high mean hospital costs but slow growth between 2008 and 2012. Mean hospital costs in 2012 were highest for hospital stays billed to Medicare: $12,200 compared with $8,100 for Medicaid-covered stays, $8,800 for stays for uninsured patients, and $9,700 for privately insured stays.
