When comparing price per watt, capacity factor should be considered in the overall cost comparison. For instance; if the cost of solar is $1 per watt, when including an average capacity factor of approximately 20%, this cost rises to $5 per watt when compared to a hypothetical source that produces energy consistently. It refers to the number of dollars one would have to spend to buy a machine capable of producing one watt of electricity. It is calculated by dividing the total project capital cost by the amount of peak power or watts-peak (W p) it can produce.
Deutsche Bank sees substantial room for improvement over the longer term in cost per watt terms – from $0.50/w to $0.20/w – as solar gains mainstream acceptance, is recognized as a cost competitive source of electricity, and companies develop new/improved methods to interact with customers. The cost of production today. Deutsche notes that total module costs of leading Chinese solar companies have decreased from around $1.31 a watt in 2011 to around $0.50/W in 2014. It says this was primarily due to the reduction in processing costs, the fall in polysilicon costs and improvement in conversion efficiencies.
In 2011, residential solar system installers paid a little over $1.80 per watt for solar panels in both Germany and the United States. In Germany, installers added $1.20 to the cost of the solar panel to complete an installation. But in the U.S., they tacked on $4.36 per watt, more than three times as much. A report released this month by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory explains why
In addition, costs for fossil fuels may creep up due to raw material costs, shipping costs, and possibly carbon dioxide taxes. At an installed price of $1.25 per watt, the cost of PV solar is always cheaper than coal. At $2 per watt, it is cheaper after year 40. At $3.00 per watt, it is cheaper about year 80. It is expected that PV solar costs will reach conventional coal parity by 2017. As a result, no new coal plants are expected to be initiated, although some current coal plants will likely be upgraded.
Solar panels are currently selling for as low as US$0.70 per watt (7-April-2012) in industrial quantities; the balance of system The price difference between German and US photovoltaic systems was analyzed in 2013 by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It refers to the number of dollars one would have to spend to buy a machine capable of producing one watt of electricity. It is calculated by dividing the total project capital cost by the amount of peak power or watts-peak (W p) it can produce.
So what is the current cost of residential solar power? As of early 2015, it’s approximately $3.00 per installed watt. The average sized solar panel system is 5,000 watts, so this brings the total cost to $15,000. That 15k figure is just an average amount. Systems can cost more or less mostly depending upon a homeowner’s energy usage. That $3.00 per watt is, if anything, on the very low side. Pricing can vary due to specific brand of panels used, inverter brand, and regional pricing differences
Price per watt history for crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells since 1977. Price per watt, or $/W is a common way to compare the capital costs of various forms of electricity generation. It refers to the number of dollars one would have to spend to buy a machine capable of producing one watt of electricity. It is calculated by dividing the total project capital cost by the amount of peak power or watts-peak (W p) it can produce.
The chart at the left shows the average cost of electricity for 2014 by consumer group per the EIA (the US Energy Information Administration). For 2014 the average residential cost was 12.50 cents per kilo-watt hour up 3.1% from 2013. Commercial was 10.75 cents and industrial 7.01 cents. At $2 per watt, it is cheaper after year 40. At $3.00 per watt, it is cheaper about year 80. It is expected that PV solar costs will reach conventional coal parity by 2017. As a result, no new coal plants are expected to be initiated, although some current coal plants will likely be upgraded.
The average residential household in the southwest installs a 5 kWh system and during Q1 2015, it cost about $3.40 per DC watt or $17,000 (5000 times $3.40) before incentives. Utilities on the other hand typically install systems in the 100 mega-watt or greater range. At $2 per watt, it is cheaper after year 40. At $3.00 per watt, it is cheaper about year 80. It is expected that PV solar costs will reach conventional coal parity by 2017. As a result, no new coal plants are expected to be initiated, although some current coal plants will likely be upgraded.
