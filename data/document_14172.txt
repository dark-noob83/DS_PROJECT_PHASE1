The first thing you need to do is season it. You can do a pretty simple seasoning on it like salt and pepper or Lawry’s seasoning salt. One seasoning that I like to use on my NuWave Oven Pork Chops is McCormick Smokehouse Maple Seasoning. This stuff has the perfect flavor of sweet and smoky.
Season your pork chops to taste. Place pork chops on the cooking rack, and cover with the dome, lifting it by the handles on the power head.
Turn the oven on HI, and set the timer for 12 minutes for each inch of pork chop thickness. Remove the dome of the NuWave cooker when the timer goes off. Check your pork chop for doneness using a meat thermometer; pork should register at 145 degrees Fahrenheit when thoroughly cooked. Rest for 3 minutes before serving.
Two primary methods before my oven that I used to cook pork chops is to grill them or to put them in the oven and use one of the bag and season cooking kits, the kind you find with things like the gravy seasoning, taco seasoning, etc. There really isn’t much to cooking a pork chop in the NuWave oven.
Easily achieve this using a NuWave oven's infrared technology, and enjoy your pork chop in less time that it would take in your home oven. Cook your pork chop from fresh or frozen and come out with a product that tastes great with little fuss.
Then place the pork chops on the 4″ rack in the NuWave oven. Cook the pork chops on high for 5 minutes. When the timer goes off, take off the dome and turn the pork chops over. Cook them on high for another 5 minutes. At the end of the 10 minutes you will have some delicious pork chops.
