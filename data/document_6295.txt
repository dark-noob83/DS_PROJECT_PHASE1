VDC is an abbreviation for vehicle dynamic control.. It also is known as electronic stability control.. This is a revolutionary active safety system, first developed by Bosch in 1995, that Nissan and other automobile manufacturers incorporate into their models.
Vdc is an acronym for Volts Direct Current. VDC is often shown on electrical schematics to indicate a connection to the positive side of a battery or other DC power source … . In TTL logic, VDC is traditionally 5 volts and ground refers to Earth Ground (0 volts).
VDC is Vehicle Dynamics Control VDC is composed of 2 main systems: VTD plus VDC full time 4 wheel traction and engine management. VDC is traction control that senses vehicle direction and uses brake, throttle and engine management to help maintain stability. The components of the VDC system are: all wheel drive using the VTD system.

Jay: VDC is Vehicle Dynamic Control. When this is on, it won't let the wheels spin. It slows them down by the ABS system and pulsates the wheel. So example is if your stuck in the snow. If the VDC is on, you won't be able to sit there and spin your tires.
