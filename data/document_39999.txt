Digestive Organs. The digestive system is a group of organs (Buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, liver, gall bladder, jejunum, ileum and colon) that breakdown the chemical components of food, with digestive juices, into tiny nutrients which can be absorbed to generate energy for the body.
The digestive system. The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract—also called the digestive tract—and the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
The Digestive System and Body Metabolism. The digestive system is responsible for breaking down the food and drink we consume into usable substances and, transferring them into energy for our body; as well as for cell growth and repair. It consists of a network of organs working harmoniously to achieve the task. On top of harnessing the substances we consume, the digestive system is also responsible for excreting waste from the body. Metabolism is the process that your body uses to convert the food and drink that you consume into energy. The digestive system and body metabolism work together to ensure that your body is consistently and efficiently energized to carry out normal day-to-day tasks, as well as background bodily functions.
Food enters the mouth and passes to the anus through the hollow organs of the GI tract. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system. The digestive system helps the body digest food. Bacteria in the GI tract, also called gut flora or microbiome, help with digestion.
