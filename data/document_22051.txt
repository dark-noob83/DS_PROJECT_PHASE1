The designation of registered psychologist is authorized by Section 2909(d) of the California Business & Professions Code. The registered psychologist is a two and a half-year, nonrenewable registration. A person may be registered concurrently as a registered psychologist at more than one qualifying nonprofit community agency.
A PhD is required to be licensed as a psychologist. So you know a therapist with a Master’s degree studied an additional 2 or 3 years (varies with degree) beyond their four year college degree and the Psychologist studied for another couple of years.

One could have a B.A. in psychology with a certificate course, and the other a doctorate in psychology registered with a Board of Examiners. Only the letters after the name define which therapist is more qualified.
But even here there is no consistency. For instance, the term counselor is most often used by Master's level practitioners.

Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) is a professional doctorate degree intended to prepare graduates for practice in psychology.
