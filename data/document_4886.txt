Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Both genetics and environment may play a role. 1  Genetic problems. 2  Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a physical condition linked to abnormal biology and chemistry in the brain. The exact causes of these abnormalities are not known. There is likely a combination of factors that lead to ASD. It may run in some families, and research shows that a number of genes may be involved.
Causes of autism spectrum disorder. The exact causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are unknown, although it is thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. The causes of ASD can be described in two ways:
There are various theories as to what causes the different forms of autism including Asperger syndrome, autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder (not otherwise specified). Most researchers believe that autism has a variety of causes.
Causes. There is no known single cause for autism spectrum disorder, but it is generally accepted that it is caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function. Brain scans show differences in the shape and structure of the brain in children with autism compared to in neurotypical children.
