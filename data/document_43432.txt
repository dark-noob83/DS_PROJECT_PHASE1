Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use. Insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia).
1 Sugar upsets the mineral relationships in the body. 2  Sugar can cause hyperactivity, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and crankiness in children. 3  Sugar can produce a significant rise in triglycerides. 4  Sugar contributes to the reduction in defense against bacterial infection (infectious diseases).

Glucose. Glucose is a simple sugar that your body likes. Your cells use it as a primary source of energy, so when you consume glucose, it's actually helpful. When it's transported into the body, it stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin.
Glucose is a carbohydrate, and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism. Glucose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates. Glucose is also sometimes called dextrose. Corn syrup is primarily glucose.
Glucose is precious fuel for all the cells in your body when it's present at normal levels. But it can behave like a slow-acting poison. 1  High sugar levels slowly erode the ability of cells in your pancreas to make insulin. 2  The organ overcompensates and insulin levels remain too high.
Fructose is a carbohydrate, and is a simple sugar found in fruits. It is often called just fruit sugar. Fructose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates.
