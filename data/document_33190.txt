An atom is made up of a nucleus of neutrons and protons &dash; even smaller particles than an atom. They are called subatomic particles. Electrons circle around this nucleus. Atoms tend to have the same number of electrons as the number of protons in the nucleus.
Well, this could be 2 things, a solid or a property called density. Solids are tightly packed atoms, while Density is how packed the atoms are.
Even in solids there is a small space between the atoms. Depending on how tight the atoms are packed determines the density of matter. This means that a one inch block of wood is not as dense as a one inch block of gold. There is more space between the atoms of the wood than the atoms of the gold.
User: The nucleus of most atoms is composed of a. tightly packed protons. b. tightly packed neutrons. c. tightly packed protons and neutrons. d. loosely connected protons and electrons. The nucleus of most atoms is composed of
In simple terms, graphene, is a thin layer of pure carbon; it is a single, tightly packed layer of carbon atoms that are bonded together in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. In more complex terms, it is an allotrope of carbon in the structure of a plane of sp2 bonded atoms with a molecule bond length of 0.142 nanometres.
Matter that is composed of atoms packed tightly together are known as solids. You cannot walk through a solid wall. The matter is packed so tight that it prevents you from moving through it.
