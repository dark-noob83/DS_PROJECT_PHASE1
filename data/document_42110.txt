As Governor George W. Bush ran for President in 2000, reporters and pundits trotted out sound-bite versions of a lesson students have been taught about Texas for years: Compared to the U.S. President or the chief executives of other states, the Texas Governor occupies a weak office. The overall effect of these boards and commissions is consistent with the plural executive concept that characterizes Texas government: governors with sufficient political skill and long enough tenures in office can have an impact on the boards.

This arrangement produces an executive branch whose officials jealously guard their jurisdiction, their power, and their prerogatives. In short, everyone defends his or her turf, and the Governor lacks any formal power to dictate or referee.
