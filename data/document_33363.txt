Sear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast. The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit.
How to cook Rolled Rib of Beef. Roasting beef. First 25% of the cooking time should be at 240˚c /475˚f Gas Mark 9, then reduced to 190˚c /375˚f / Gas mark 5 for the rest of the cooking time. Fillets and thin pieces of meat reduce cooking time by a few min per kg and meats with bone-in are increased by a few min per kg.
Method. Preheat oven to 200oC. Wipe roast with damp paper towels. Combine flour, mustard, salt and pepper in a small bowl and rub all over beef. Place the roast, fat side up in a roasting pan and roast, uncovered, for 30-40 minutes for a rare roast or 40-50 minutes for a medium roast. Once cooked, cover with foil and let stand for 15-20 minutes for easier carving. Reserve the cooking juices to make a gravy or jus, if desired

Residual Heat or Carry-Over Cooking: Remember, the rib roast will continue to cook as it sets. The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit.
Place the beef on top of the vegetables. To cook your beef: Place the roasting tray in the preheated oven. Turn the heat down immediately to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 and cook for 1 hour for medium beef. If you prefer it medium-rare, take it out 5 to 10 minutes earlier. For well done, leave it in for another 10 to 15 minutes. 
Place the roast in a pan large enough to hold it comfortably, bone-side down, and spread the top thickly with the salt and pepper. Roast the meat for 45 minutes. Without removing the meat from the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and roast for another 30 minutes. Finally, increase the temperature to 450 degrees F and roast for another 15 to 30 minutes, until the internal temperature of the meat is 125 degrees F. (Be sure the thermometer is exactly in the center of the roast.) The total cooking time will be between 1 1/2 and 1 3/4 hours.
