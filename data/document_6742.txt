17. One or more stones sometimes form in one of the salivary glands. A stone can cause a blockage of the flow of spit (saliva), which can lead to pain and swelling of the affected salivary gland. The reason why these stones form is not known. Sometimes a stone comes out into the mouth on its own, or with gentle probing.
The salivary glands produce saliva to moisten the mouth, to help protect teeth from decay and to digest food. The three major salivary glands are the parotid gland, submandibular gland (also called the submaxillary gland), and sublingual glands. Saliva drains into the mouth through small tubes called ducts. 1  The parotid gland makes 25% of the saliva and drains into the mouth near the upper teeth
We call the major salivary glands the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. They all secrete saliva into your mouth, the parotid through tubes that drain saliva, called salivary ducts, near your upper teeth, submandibular under your tongue, and the sublingual through many ducts in the floor of your mouth. Besides these glands, there are many tiny glands called minor salivary glands located in your lips, inner cheek area (buccal mucosa), and extensively in other linings of your mouth and throat. Salivary glands produce the saliva used to moisten your mouth, initiate digestion, and help protect your teeth from decay.
Salivary Gland Stone Causes and Symptoms. Salivary stones form when chemicals in the saliva accumulate in the duct or gland. They mostly contain calcium. The exact cause is not known. But factors contributing to less saliva production and/or thickened saliva may be risk factors for salivary stones. A salivary gland stone -- also called salivary duct stone -- is a calcified structure that may form inside a salivary gland or duct. It can block the flow of saliva into the mouth. The majority of stones affect the submandibular glands located at the floor of the mouth

A salivary gland stone is sometimes called a sialolith or a salivary calculus. Most salivary stones are mainly made of calcium. However, there is no abnormality of the blood calcium level or any other problem with calcium in your body. A stone can cause a blockage of the flow of spit (saliva), which can lead to pain and swelling of the affected salivary gland. The reason why these stones form is not known. Sometimes a stone comes out into the mouth on its own, or with gentle probing.
Sialolithiasis (sigh a lo THIGH a sis) is a condition where tiny salivary stones form in the glands. The stones, called sialoliths, are made of calcium. Some stones do not cause any symptoms, but some stones block the ducts. The saliva flow is partially or completely stopped. The three major salivary glands are the parotid gland, submandibular gland (also called the submaxillary gland), and sublingual glands. Saliva drains into the mouth through small tubes called ducts.
A salivary duct stone is a calcification in the salivary gland, which blocks the flow of saliva in the mouth. Stones most often form in the base of the mouth; however, the deposits can form on the cheeks and under the tongue. Most individuals who experience stones have multiple deposits. As salivary gland stones are caused by the buildup of calcium and other minerals in the salivary gland, treatment focuses on naturally dissolving the buildup. Common treatments include apple cider vinegar, lemon juice and oregano oil.
A salivary gland stone is a calcified deposit located in the salivary gland or duct. These deposits often block the flow of saliva and can cause swelling and discomfort. Effective natural treatment works to safely dissolve deposits and return normal function to the salivary glands. As salivary gland stones are caused by the buildup of calcium and other minerals in the salivary gland, treatment focuses on naturally dissolving the buildup. Common treatments include apple cider vinegar, lemon juice and oregano oil.
