As with other woody plants, the time and energy you'll spend pruning vines has much to do with the plant you select and the spot in which you place it. You'll save yourself a good deal of anguish if you pick a vine that can live comfortably in the space you have. When you prune, be sure to do the following: 1  Cut to healthy wood if removing dead, diseased, or damaged growth. 2  Cut back to a lateral shoot or bud. 3  Cut to a bud or stem that is pointing in the direction you want the vine to go. 4  Cut cleanly and don't leave a stub, which is an invitation to bugs and diseases.
Killing ground vines with herbicides may affect the soil and harm neighboring trees. Vines often grow rapidly and can quickly take over trees, whether they were planted intentionally or they are poisonous vines, such as poison oak. If left to grow, ground vines can grow into tree canopies and suffocate the tree. While herbicides kill vines and other plants, they may also harm trees. Keep the mulch 3 inches away from the trunk of the tree to prevent insect and rodent infestations. Mulching prevents the vines from reestablishing themselves around the tree. Alternatively, you can sow grass seed or lay sod in the bare area to crowd out the area and restrict vine growth.
