Grill or broil halibut steaks approximately 4 minutes per side or until a meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 140 degrees F (halibut will be slightly opaque in thickest part). Remember the halibut continues to cook after it is removed from the heat source. Approximately cooking times for halibut: 1/4 to 1/3-inch - 3 to 4 minutes 1/2 to 3/4-inch - 4 to 6 minutes 1 to 1 1/2-inch - 8 to 12 minutes This is the type of cooking and meat thermometer that I prefer and use in my cooking.
