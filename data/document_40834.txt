A transaction where a companyâ€™s management team purchases the assets and operations of the business they manage. A management buyout (MBO) is appealing to professional managers because of the greater potential rewards from being owners of the business rather than employees.
BREAKING DOWN 'Management Buyout-MBO'. An MBO is different from a management buy-in (MBI), in which an external management team acquires a company and replaces the existing management team.
A management buy-in (MBI) occurs when a manager or a management team from outside the company raises the necessary finance, buys it, and becomes the company's new management. A management buy-in team often competes with other purchasers in the search for a suitable business.
The difference to a management buy-out is in the position of the purchaser: in the case of a buy-out, they are already working for the company. In the case of a buy-in, however, the manager or management team is from another source.
A management buyout, or MBO, is a transaction where a company's management team purchases the assets and operations of the business they manage.
