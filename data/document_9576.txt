Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March 24 to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century. 
Standing 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level, its peak is the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Much of the mountain is under water; when measured from its oceanic base, Mauna Kea is over 10,000 m (33,000 ft) tall, significantly taller than Mount Everest.
Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain in the Hawaiian Chain. Its summit rises to an elevation of 4205m above sea level and it is located on the island of Hawaii. It is the second largest in subaerial surface area of the five shield volcanoes that comprise the island of Hawaii. Eruptive History. Mauna Kea is considered to be a dormant shield volcano in what is commonly known as the post-shield stage. Submarine eruptions began to build Mauna kea from the sea floor around ~0.8 million years ago. The basaltic shield stage of volcanism began by at least 0.3 million years ago. Alkalic postshield activity began about 60-70 thousand years ago and its youngest known eruptions occurred around 4000-5000 years ago
This is the first Bulletin report for Mauna Kea, the tallest volcano on the Island of Hawai`i (figures 1, 2, and 3). Although the most recent eruption occurred ~4,500 years ago, this volcano has the potential to reawaken. 
Mauna Kea stands 4,205 m (13,800 ft) above sea level, just 35 m (110 ft) higher than its neighbor Mauna Loa, and is the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Measured from its base on the ocean floor, it rises over 10,000 m (33,000 ft), significantly greater than the elevation of Mount Everest above sea level. Much of the mountain is under water; when measured from its oceanic base, Mauna Kea is over 10,000 m (33,000 ft) tall, significantly taller than Mount Everest.
Mauna Kea, or White Mountaina volcano of the Big Island of Hawaii, is the tallest mountain on earth. It measure about 10,200 meters from base to summit. Chimborazo is a volcano in the Andes of Ecuador. It measures about 6,310 meters above sea level. (Everest). The TALLEST mountain on earth, measured from base to summit is the volcanic peak of Mauna Kea, one of five volcanic masses making up the Big Islandof Hawaii. It is about 9,000 m (30,000 ft) tall, however only 4,245 m (13,796 ft) of that is above sea level.. 9,000 m. (Mauna Kea)
Mauna Kea is over 3,200 km 3 (770 cu mi) in volume, so massive that it and its neighbor, Mauna Loa, depress the ocean crust beneath it by 6 km (4 mi). The volcano continues to slip and flatten under its own weight at a rate of less than 0.2 mm (0.01 in) per year. Much of the mountain is under water; when measured from its oceanic base, Mauna Kea is over 10,000 m (33,000 ft) tall, significantly taller than Mount Everest.
Hawai ªi's Tallest Volcano. Tall cinder cones atop the summit of Mauna Kea (4,205m) and lava flows that underlie its steep upper flanks have built the volcano a scant 35 m higher than nearby Mauna Loa (4,170 m).
