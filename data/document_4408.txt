An EPP code is an authorization key provided by your old registrar and required by your new registrar to complete a registration transfer for a domain name. You must contact the old registrar to obtain this. 
EPP (expanded polypropylene) is a unique raw material that has many important characteristics making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Some striking selection criteria are: energy absorption, low weight and high thermal stability. Thanks to the mechanical properties, EPP is extremely suitable for components that must resist pressure. The low weight, high energy absorption and good deformation properties of EPP, even after repeated shock loads, are extremely suitable properties for components in the automotive industry.

By combining polypropylene resin with magic dust, and applying heat, pressure and CO 2 in an autoclave, the material is formed into small plastic beads. Expanded polypropylene (EPP) is an exceptionally eco-friendly, flexible and versatile plastic foam designed for lightweight, energy management and cushioning applications.
Where to find the EPP Code. If your domain is registered by SiteGround you can find the EPP key in your Customer's area, My Account, Domain names. Next to the domain you are interested in there will be a button Manage. Following this link will provide you with all the information about your domain name including the EPP key.
What is EPP Code. The EPP key (Authorization code) is one of the safeguards against unauthorized transfers of domain name registrations and it protects your rights as a domain owner. The EPP key is required when transferring .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info and .us domain names. If your domain is registered by SiteGround you can find the EPP key in your Customer's area, My Account, Domain names. Next to the domain you are interested in there will be a button Manage. Following this link will provide you with all the information about your domain name including the EPP key.
In the case that your EPP file doesn't open, it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your PC to view or edit EPP file extensions. If your PC opens the EPP file, but it's the wrong application, you'll need to change your Windows registry file association settings. In seconds, you will learn exactly what type of EPP file you have, the software program associated with your file, the publisher who created it, its security safety status, and a variety of other useful information.
The EPP has been the largest party in the European Parliament since 1999 and in the European Council since 2002. It is also by far the largest party in the current European Commission. The President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission are both from the EPP. As the officially recognised EPP association of workers, the EUCDW is led by Elmar Brok, MEP. It aims at the political unification of a democratic Europe, the development of the EPP on the basis of Christian social teaching, and the defence of workers' interests in European policy-making.
EPP is in particular used for expensive and vulnerable electronics products or moulded parts for, for instance, the climate-control and the automotive industries. Thanks to the mechanical properties, EPP is extremely suitable for components that must resist pressure. The low weight, high energy absorption and good deformation properties of EPP, even after repeated shock loads, are extremely suitable properties for components in the automotive industry.
Part of the Printers glossary: EPP/ECP (Enhanced Parallel Port/Enhanced Capability Port) is a standard signaling method for bi-directional parallel communication between a computer and peripheral devices that offers the potential for much higher rates of data transfer than the original parallel signaling methods. EPP is for non-printer peripherals. ECP is for printers and scanners. EPP/ECP are part of IEEE Standard 1284, which also specifies support for current signaling methods (including Centronics, the de facto standard for printer communication) so that both old and new peripherals can be accommodated.
What is an Auth/EPP code? Domain Authorization Code (also referred to as an Auth Code, Domain's secret or an EPP Code) provides an extra level of security for the domain name registration. The authorization code is unique for each domain name and is assigned by the registrar at the time the domain name is registered. Auth/EPP code will be required for .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info, .mobi, .asia, .ca, .cc, .co, .cn, .de, .in, .me, .pe, .tv, .us and .ws domain transfers.
