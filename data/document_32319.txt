The minimum salary is $507,336. For the first time in NBA history, every player will make at least half a million bucks for an entire season. The veteran’s minimum for players with 10-plus years of experience is $1,448,490. The league offsets a portion of this amount when computing a team’s total payroll. The maximum salary for players with 0-6 years is $14,746,000. That is roughly 25 percent of the salary cap. Signing a player from another team to a four-year contract with the maximum 4.5 percent annual raises totals $62,970,000.
For more, see below: Salaries remain flat: $25,500, $19,000 and $13,000 for the league's three player classifications, which means D-League players are virtually playing for free -- and a modest per diem on the road of $40 compared to $120 in the NBA -- although they do receive housing and insurance benefits. The D-League also employs a per-team salary cap of $173,000 ... with a dollar-for-dollar luxury tax, just like in the NBA, for teams that go over that amount. Foreign teams that want to pull players out of the D-League must pay $40,000, $45,000 or $50,000, depending on the player's classification, to buy out their D-League deal
Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports. There are a wide range of opinions regarding the value of the NBA Development League, but the one that comes up in every conversation is the lack of compensation for players. As you may know, salaries in the D-League have three tiers: $13,000, $19,000 or $25,000. 
In 1970, the average NBA salary was $35,000, about $207,000 in today's dollars. Big money, but far from the $5 million average now. Today, the estimated median salary — half the players make more than that — is $2.5 million. The league minimum is $473,604. The salary cap for an entire WNBA team of 11 players is $878,000. Even prorated for the 34-game season, it's less than the median NBA salary. 
Teams can sign players for the NBA's minimum salary even if they are over the cap, for up to two years in length. In the case of two-year contracts, the second-season salary is the minimum salary for that season. Under the CBA ratified in December 2011, the cap will continue to vary in future seasons based on league revenues; for the 2014–15 season, the salary cap was $63.065 million and the luxury tax limit was $76.8 million.
Something interesting to note is that, according to Stein, the per-team salary cap has actually decreased, from $178,000 to a now $173,000. With ten players per team, that's an average D-League salary of $17,300. The D-League also employs a per-team salary cap of $173,000 ... with a dollar-for-dollar luxury tax, just like in the NBA, for teams that go over that amount. Foreign teams that want to pull players out of the D-League must pay $40,000, $45,000 or $50,000, depending on the player's classification, to buy out their D-League deals
With that in mind, here are some of the best players on a league-minimum salary: Delonte West, Dallas Mavericks. 2012-2013 Salary: $1.2 million ($854,389 by the Mavs, the rest by the NBA). Some see West for his bipolar disorder or his rap sheet, but neither should overshadow his tremendous value as a role player. Ronnie Brewer, New York Knicks. 2012-2013 Salary: $1.1 million ($854,389 by the Knicks, the rest by the NBA). Brewer is one of the top perimeter defenders, and for that reason alone a minimum contract is outstanding value. But the real bonus lies in Brewer’s misunderstood offensive game
