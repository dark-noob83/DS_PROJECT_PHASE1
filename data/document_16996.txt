This means women following 1,200-calorie weight loss diets need about 135 to 195 grams of carbs each day, women consuming 1,600-calorie diets need 180 to 260 grams, women following 2,000-calorie diets need 225 to 325 grams and women consuming 2,400 calories per day require 270 to 390 grams of carbohydrates each day.
Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day. You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label.
1 All of those 1155 calories will come from carbs. 2  And, since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, all our example person would need to do now is divide 1155 by 4 and get 288. 3  Which means, this example person would need to eat about 288 grams of carbs per day.
