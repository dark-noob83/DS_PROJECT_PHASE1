For this purpose, it is typically ordered along with other hormone tests and a transvaginal ultrasound (to count the number of follicles as a reflection of the woman's egg supply). An AMH test may be used to evaluate polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) . AMH may be elevated due to the increased number of follicles present. Some ovarian cancers produce increased levels of AMH. Anti-Muellerian müllerian (HORMONE) amh is not a routinely ordered test but may be useful in specific. circumstances
AMH/MIS may be used in the investigation of ovarian reserve and the perimenopausal transition in women; the detection and onset of puberty in the young, the differential diagnosis of intersex disorders; the diagnosis of cryptorchidism and anorchidism, and the evaluation of male gonadal function in all ages. 
One of the most significant things that makes AMH a good test is the fact that it is produced directly from the follicles found within the ovaries. What better way of trying to assess ovarian reserve (egg supply) status than by measuring a hormone produced directly from the oocytes that make up the ovarian reserve. Testing Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels provides an indirect measurement of a woman’s egg supply which is also known as
Confirm diagnosis of premature ovarian failure: AMH levels are low or absent. 4. Predict likelihood of IVF success: AMH levels correlate positively with number of retrieved oocytes 1; low AMH levels predict a lower likelihood of follicle response. However in the cycling female, AMH is secreted by preantral and small antral follicles in the ovary, and circulating levels positively correlate with the number of remaining ovarian follicles. Thus, AMH levels reflect ovarian reserve (ie, the number of primordial follicles present).
Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) is a protein hormone produced by granulosa cells (cells lining the egg sacs or follicles) within the ovary. AMH can be measured in the blood at any time in the menstrual cycle as it is stable throughout the cycle. It is a marker for ovarian (egg) reserve. With the availability of AMH blood test, it is not necessary to subject a woman through a standard stimulated cycle unnecessarily for diagnosis of her ovarian response. Treatment options can be either Natural (no stimulating drugs) or Stimulated IVF.
SUMMARY ANSWER: AMH may be a good substitute for polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in diagnosing PCOS. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: AMH has been suggested as an alternative to antral follicle count (AFC) in diagnosing PCOS. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: AMH may be a good substitute for PCOM in diagnosing PCOS. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was financed by the Cooperative of Central Norway Regional Health Authority and Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome. Clinical Background. Anti-Muellerian müllerian (HORMONE) amh Or-muellerian müllerian inhibiting substance is known to be instrumental in the determination of gender in, the embryo inducing testicular differentiation in the male and permitting development of the female reproductive tract in. its absence However in the cycling female, AMH is secreted by preantral and small antral follicles in the ovary, and circulating levels positively correlate with the number of remaining ovarian follicles. Thus, AMH levels reflect ovarian reserve (ie, the number of primordial follicles present).
