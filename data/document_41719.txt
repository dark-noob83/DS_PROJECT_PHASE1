Coniferous trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome. A very few species in four main genera are found: the evergreen spruce, fir and pine, and the deciduous larch. In North America, one or two species of fir and one or two species of spruce are dominant. The taiga is the terrestrial biome with the lowest annual average temperatures after the tundra and permanent ice caps. Extreme winter minimums in the northern taiga are typically lower than those of the tundra.
Plants Animals Climate Siberian Taiga A biome is the type of habitat in certain places, like mountain tops, deserts, and tropical forests, and is determined by the climate of the place. The taiga is the biome of the needleleaf forest. Living in the taiga is cold and lonely. Coldness and food shortages make things very difficult, mostly in the winter. Some of the animals in the taiga hibernate in the winter, some fly south if they can, while some just cooperate with the environment, which is very difficult. (Dillon Bartkus) Taiga is the Russian word for forest and is the largest biome in the world. It stretches over Eurasia and North America. The taiga is located near the top of the world, just below the tundra biome. The winters in the taiga are very cold with only snowfall

The Taiga Biome The taiga is a forest of the cold, subarctic region. This biome lies in the Northern Hemisphere right below the tundra. The temperature range is -65° F to 70°F (-54 to 21° C). For one half of the year, the temperature is below freezing. But the temperature is warmer than the temperature in the tundra. The taiga climate has an average annual rainfall of 12 - 33 inches (30 - 84 cm). Most of the precipitation falls in the summer as rain, but a portion of the precipitation does fall as sleet or snow in the winter.
For six months out of the year, the temperature in the taiga biome is below freezing. Plants can only grow during the summer when temperatures are favorable. This growing season only lasts about three months. The conifer trees in the taiga biome are referred to as evergreen. This means they remain green all year round and never drop their leaves. Because evergreen trees do not drop leaves, there is nothing to keep the soil in the taiga full of nutrients. This is the reason why there is not much variety in the vegetation.
The taiga biome is the largest terrestrial biome and extends across Europe, North America, and Asia. It is located right below the tundra biome. The taiga biome is also known as coniferous forest or boreal forest. This biome typically has short, wet summers and long, cold winters. Precipitation is moderate in the taiga. It gets plenty of snow during the winter and plenty of rainfall during the summer. The conifer trees in the taiga biome are referred to as evergreen.

LOCATION: Taiga, also known as coniferous or boreal forest, is the largest terrestrial biome on earth. It extends in a broad band across North America, Europe, and Asia to the southern border of the arctic tundra. The most common type of tree found in the taiga is the conifer, or cone-bearing tree. Conifers, also known as evergreens, include pines, spruces and firs. There may also occasionally be deciduous species present, such as oak, birch, willow, or alder, in a particularly wet or disturbed area.
Coniferous trees are very common in the taiga biome. This is why it is often referred to as the boreal forest. These types of trees include Douglas Fir, White Spruce, and Hemlock. There are also lots of lichen and moss that grow in the taiga biome. The American Black Bear is found in the taiga biome. It consumes a variety of different foods including twigs, leaves, and plants. Only about ¼ of what they eat is in the form of small prey and left over carcasses.
The taiga biome is one that has very long and cold winters. They summers are short and they are cool in temperature. The cool air masses from the arctic can move in rapidly.
