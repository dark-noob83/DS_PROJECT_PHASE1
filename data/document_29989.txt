Although migraine is more common among women than men, the only two large, randomized trials of low-dose aspirin for migraine prophylaxis have been conducted in men.
It has several actions that make it useful for treating migraine. First, it is an analgesic or pain reliever. Secondly, it blocks or reduces inflammation. This action is controlled in the body in part by a series of chemicals called prostaglandin. Aspirin blocks the ability of the body to manufacture these compounds. An additional finding of this study was a 10% reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks among male physicians taking low-dose aspirin. Your doctor may recommend daily aspirin to reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke. These daily doses of aspirin vary from 81 mg (baby aspirin) to 325 mg.
As part of the Women's Health Study, an ongoing randomized trial of low-dose aspirin and vitamin E among 39 876 female health professionals aged 45 and older, 1001 women with frequent migraine attacks were assigned to 100 mg of aspirin every other day (n = 525) or aspirin placebo (n = 476). 2001 Apr;21(3):167-8. Although migraine is more common among women than men, the only two large, randomized trials of low-dose aspirin for migraine prophylaxis have been conducted in men.
Women assigned to aspirin reported small and consistent decreases in migraine frequency (59.6% vs. 56.4% assigned to placebo reporting improvement at 36 months; odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval, 0.86--1.48), as well as decreases in severity, duration, and migraine-related incapacitation. 2001 Apr;21(3):167-8.

Peter Goadsby, MD, PhD. An inexpensive, hundred-year-old therapy for pain – aspirin – is effective in high doses for the treatment of severe headache and migraine caused by drug withdrawal, according to a new study by researchers with the UCSF Headache Center. To develop a successful treatment plan for these patients, physicians first turn to a hospital inpatient program where medication withdrawal can be overseen by a neurologist or pain specialist. High-dose intravenous aspirin can help patients manage headache pain while undergoing medication withdrawal, the study shows.

For most people, the benefits of aspirin for migraine treatment outweigh the risks, notes Hreib. Patients in these studies took a single dose of aspirin in the range of 900 to 1000 milligrams, which is equal to three adult-strength aspirins, a safe dose for most people. The findings come from an extensive review comparing the effectiveness of aspirin to either a placebo or a prescription-strength drug for the relief of migraine headache pain. Researchers were aware that many people with migraine headaches rely on over-the-counter (OTC) medications for their migraine treatment.
At present, the cost for IV aspirin costs around $7 per dose depending on the drug provider. Triptans cost about $22 per pill. For the study, researchers reviewed the charts of 168 patients ranging in age from 18 to 75 years – 51 were men and 117 were women. To develop a successful treatment plan for these patients, physicians first turn to a hospital inpatient program where medication withdrawal can be overseen by a neurologist or pain specialist. High-dose intravenous aspirin can help patients manage headache pain while undergoing medication withdrawal, the study shows.
For headache pain, the recommended adult dose of aspirin is 325 to 650 mg every three to four hours as needed, up to six times per day. While aspirin may help alleviate acute migraine pain, it shouldn't be used more than twice a week for this purpose since rebound — or medication overuse — headaches can occur. 
1 Using this high dosage, 52 percent of aspirin users got significant headache pain relief within two hours, compared to 32 percent who were given a placebo. 2  Aspirin also reduced other migraine symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to noise and light.
