The head of a pin is about 2mm in diameter. Use this animation to compare the relative sizes of cells and organisms sitting on a pinhead. Nearly invisible without magnification, dust mites dwarf pollen grains and human cells. In turn, bacteria and viruses are even smaller.
The size of a typical bacterial cell is 0.5-5.0 micrometers, a average human cell is 10 micrometers.
How big is a bacteria compared to a human cell? The size of a typical bacterial cell is 0.5-5.0 micrometers, a average human cell is 10 micrometers. 8 people found this useful. Edit.
Smaller cells have a large surface area compared to cell volume, while larger cells have a reduced ratio of surface area to volume. One reason why bacterial cells are so small is that they need a large surface area to cell volume to take in nutrients. Bacteria accumulate nutrients from the environment by diffusion.
Bacterial Cells. Bacterial cells are very small-about 10 times smaller than most plant and animal cells. Most bacterial cells range in size from 0.2 to 10 microns or micrometers (0.0000079 to 0.00039 inches). Common Escherichia coli, or E.coli, bacteria are rod-shaped bacteria, 1 micron by 2 microns long.
