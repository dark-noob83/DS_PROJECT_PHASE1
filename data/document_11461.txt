While the peripheral blood monocytes of patients with autoimmune angioedema produce a normal, functionally active, 105 KD Cl-Inh in normal quantities, the Cl-Inh isolated from the patient's plasma exists in a dysfunctional lower molecular weight (96 KD) performance. Angioedema may be due to hereditary forms of Cl-Inh deficiency, but recently an autoimmune form of angioedema has been described in which the mechanism is novel.
1 Other causes Thyroid gland disease and some types of inflammatory arthritis are more common in people with urticaria (hives) and angioedema. 2  In some people whose swellings persist for years without an obvious cause, an autoimmune process may be responsible. Angioedema is a condition in which small blood vessels leak fluid into the tissues, causing swelling. There is no known cure, but it may be possible to prevent the swelling with medications or occasionally diet. Allergy is a very rare cause of
Definitions. Urticaria is a transient erythematous swelling of the skin, associated with itching, which usually resolves within 24 hours. Angioedema (previously known as angioneurotic edema) is characterized by swellings caused by edema in the deeper dermal, cutaneous and sub-mucosal tissue. Acute attacks of urticaria or angioedema can be treated with H1 antihistamines. Treatment with 1% menthol in aqueous cream may suppress itching. As wheals can occur where tight clothing is in contact with the skin, loose clothing should be recommended.
For better understanding, let me divide this article into two sections: first one describing autoimmune whereas the second one about stress angioedema. Autoimmune angioedema is a skin problem found in patients that develop angioedema in response to an autoimmune trigger, i.e. certain antibodies. Mast cells are widespread in the skin and contain certain fluids. They basically act as a defensive mechanism in our bodies against the disorders. When they are disturbed by an autoimmune trigger or an allergen, they release fluid called histamine into the skin which causes swelling or angioedema.
Thyroid Disease and Chronic Urticaria. Thyroid disease is the most commonly reported autoimmune condition in patients with CU. In the literature, the frequency of thyroid autoimmunity in patients with CU encompasses a vast range of values, varying from 6.5% 24 to 57% 25. Beyond thyroid disease, a variety of additional autoimmune diseases have been examined for associations with CU. Confino-Cohen et al. found that 12.5% of patients had one additional autoimmune disease, 2.1% had two diseases, 0.1% had three diseases, and single patients each had an additional four or five diseases.
1 This means that part of the body's immune system may be attacking the skin. 2  Unfortunately, in the vast majority of cases, a cause is rarely found. 3  Angioedema can be associated with nasty symptoms, but rarely with nasty underlying disease. Angioedema is a condition in which small blood vessels leak fluid into the tissues, causing swelling. There is no known cure, but it may be possible to prevent the swelling with medications or occasionally diet. Allergy is a very rare cause of angioedema.
Acquired angioedema (AAE) can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic. It is usually caused by allergy and occurs together with other allergic symptoms and urticaria. It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly ACE inhibitors. In acquired angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. Cinnarizine may also be useful because it blocks the activation of C4 and can be used in patients with liver disease, while androgens cannot [1] .
The development of thyroid disease is often considered to be a marker of autoimmunity. Thyroid disease has been connected to a variety of autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in addition to CU. In patients affected by both CU and thyroid autoimmunity, there is an increased risk of developing angioedema. Leznoff and Sussman reported that the triad of thyroid autoimmunity, CU, and angioedema occurred in 15% of patients with CU.

Angioedema, also known as angiooedema, Quincke's edema, and angioneurotic edema, is the rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues. It is very similar to urticaria, but urticaria, commonly known as hives, occurs in the upper dermis. Cases where angioedema progresses rapidly should be treated as a medical emergency, as airway obstruction and suffocation can occur. Epinephrine may be life-saving when the cause of angioedema is allergic. In acquired angioedema, HAE types I and II, and nonhistaminergic angioedema, antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid may be effective. Cinnarizine may also be useful because it blocks the activation of C4 and can be used in patients with liver disease, while androgens cannot [1] .
