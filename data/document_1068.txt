Say the concrete footing is 12 inches wide by 12 inches deep (don't worry about variations, just use the average). If we convert this to feet we have 1 foot by 1 foot. So, we will need 1 cubic foot per linear foot of footing. If you have 218 total feet of trench, you will need 218 cubic feet of concrete. There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard (concrete is sold by the cubic yard) so we divide 218 by 27 to end up with 8.07 yards of concrete. Order 9 yards at least.
