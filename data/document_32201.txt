Yield. A bond's yield is the return earned on the bond, based on the price paid and the interest payment received. Usually, yield is quoted in basis points, or bps. One basis point is equal to one one-hundredth of a percentage point or 0.01%. For example, 8.00% = 800 bps (8.00% / 0/01% = 800 bps)
Treasury bills are issued in 3 month, 6 month and 1 year maturities, and they are sold at a discount to par. The bonds do not pay period interest, and the return an investor receives is based on the amount that the purchase price is discounted from par. Most bonds have a fixed coupon that does not change during the life of the bond. Most bonds have two coupon payments per year. For example, a bond with a 5.0% coupon will pay $25 twice per year, for total interest of $50 which is 5.0% of the face value of the bond (almost all bonds have a face value of $1,000).
The coupon rate is the fixed annual interest payment expressed as a percentage of the face value of the bond. A 9% coupon bond, for instance, pays $90 interest a year on each $1,000 of face value. The payment is set when the bond is issued and does not change as the bond's price fluctuates. Current yield is the annual interest payment expressed as a percentage of the bond's current market price.
BREAKING DOWN 'Premium Bond'. For example, if a bond has a 7% coupon at a time when the prevailing interest rate is 5%, investors will bid up the price of the bond until its yield to maturity is in line with the market interest rate of 5%. A bond will trade at a premium when it offers a coupon rate that is higher than prevailing interest rates. This is because investors want a higher yield, and will pay more for it.
Consider a $1,000 bond with a coupon interest rate of 8% — $80 a year. If interest rates rise to 9% after the bond is issued, you can sell your 8% bond only by offering it at a price that will deliver a 9% current yield. So the price becomes whatever $80 represents 9% of, which is $889. Thus, you lose $111 if you sell. A 9% coupon bond, for instance, pays $90 interest a year on each $1,000 of face value. The payment is set when the bond is issued and does not change as the bond's price fluctuates. Current yield is the annual interest payment expressed as a percentage of the bond's current market price.
DEFINITION of 'Premium Bond'. 1) A bond that is trading above its par value. A bond will trade at a premium when it offers a coupon rate that is higher than prevailing interest rates. This is because investors want a higher yield, and will pay more for it. 2) A specific type of bond issued in nations such as the United Kingdom and Canada
Par value, also known as Face value, is the value of the bond at maturity. Almost all bonds have a $1,000 par value. Bond prices are almost always quoted as a percentage of par, so you will hear prices such as 99 or 101.5. These refer to the percentage of $1,000, and mean $990 and $1,015 per bond respectively. Most bonds have a fixed coupon that does not change during the life of the bond. Most bonds have two coupon payments per year. For example, a bond with a 5.0% coupon will pay $25 twice per year, for total interest of $50 which is 5.0% of the face value of the bond (almost all bonds have a face value of $1,000).
Then it will provide the general formula for the price of a bond. Example 1: A One-Year Bond Consider a bond – I’ll call it B1 – with principal equal to $1000 and interest payment of $70. That is, the bond is a promise to pay the principal plus interest, or $1000+$70=$1070, one year from now. If the price of the bond were $1000, then clearly it would be paying an interest rate for that year of 7%. 
In finance, a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders. It is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) and/or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. Bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond.
The price and interest rate of a bond are determined at auction. The price may be greater than, less than, or equal to the bond's par amount (or face value). (See rates in recent auctions .). The price of a fixed rate security depends on its yield to maturity and the interest rate.
