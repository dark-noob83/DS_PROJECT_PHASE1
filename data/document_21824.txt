The hexadecimal number system, also called base-16 or sometimes just hex, is a number system that uses 16 unique symbols to represent a particular value. Those symbols are 0-9 and A-F. For example, the hexadecimal value F4240 is equivalent to 1,000,000 in decimal and 1111 0100 0010 0100 0000 in binary. Another place hexadecimal is used is as an HTML color code to express a specific color. For example, a web designer would use the hex value FF0000 to define the color red
Hex = 6 and Decimal = 10, so it is called hexadecimal. Four bits is called a nibble (sometimes spelled nybble). A nibble is one hexadecimal digit, and is written using a symbol 0-9 or A-F. Two nibbles is a byte (8 bits). Most computer operations use the byte, or a multiple of the byte (16 bits, 24, 32, 64, etc.).
One common way of overcoming this problem is to arrange the binary numbers into groups or sets of four bits (4-bits). These groups of 4-bits uses another type of numbering system also commonly used in computer and digital systems called Hexadecimal Numbers. We remember from our first tutorial about Binary Numbers that a 4-bit group of digits is called a “nibble” and as 4-bits are also required to produce a hexadecimal number, a hex digit can also be thought of as a nibble, or half-a-byte.
10995. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), and the primary use of hexadecimal notation is a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values in computing and digital electronics. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble, which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, byte values can range from 0 to 255 (decimal), but may be more conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits in the range 00 to FF. Hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses.
Why base-16 is called hex. chrisname (7398). Though the behaviour is considered bad practice when done to excess, programmers sometimes need to embed constants in their programs. These magic numbers were historically written in base-16, and the tradition has lasted to this very day. A hex is a magical spell, so magic numbers, when written in base-16, are therefore  hex numbers. Hex was later combined with the word decimal to indicate that it was a numeric base, hence hexadecimal. Later, the Greeks used the words heks and deka to mean six and ten respectively (from hex a dec imal and because base- 16 = 6 + 10).
The hexadecimal numeral system, also known as just hex, is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). Four bits is called a nibble (sometimes spelled nybble). A nibble is one hexadecimal digit, and is written using a symbol 0-9 or A-F. Two nibbles is a byte (8 bits). Most computer operations use the byte, or a multiple of the byte (16 bits, 24, 32, 64, etc.).
The word hexadecimal is a combination of hexa (meaning 6) and decimal (10). Binary is base-2, octal is base-8, and decimal is of course base-10. Hexadecimal values are sometimes written with the prefix 0x (0x2F7) or with a subscript (2F7 16), but it doesn't change the value. For example, the hexadecimal value F4240 is equivalent to 1,000,000 in decimal and 1111 0100 0010 0100 0000 in binary. Another place hexadecimal is used is as an HTML color code to express a specific color. For example, a web designer would use the hex value FF0000 to define the color red
In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0 – 9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble, which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, byte values can range from 0 to 255 (decimal), but may be more conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits in the range 00 to FF. Hexadecimal is also commonly used to represent computer memory addresses.
