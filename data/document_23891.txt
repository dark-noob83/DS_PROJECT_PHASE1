Its competitor, Otrexup, costs $500 to $600 a month for a 25 mg dose – more than a vial of methotrexate and far more than pills, which cost $20 to $30 for a dozen 2.5 mg tablets.
Antares has indicated that it will price Otrexup at a price of $548 per prescription. Each prescription contains four weekly injectors. This has cost implications as the biologics can cost $15,000 to $25,000 per year versus about $6,600 for Otrexup. If Otrexup can avoid the use of a biologic, a health care plan can save $10,000 to $20,000 per year.
Otrexup auto-injectors are available in strengths of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg of methotrexate per 0.4 mL. The usual dosage of methotrexate for patients with rheumatoid arthritis ranges from 7.5 to 25 mg once weekly. Otrexup should be administered SC in the abdomen or thigh. Four 25-mg auto-injectors cost $548.00, compared to $5.00 for a single 4-mL vial of generic methotrexate containing 25 mg/mL. Nevertheless, some patients with rheumatoid arthritis who find it difficult to draw up methotrexate solution from a vial and inject it with a syringe may prefer Otrexup.
