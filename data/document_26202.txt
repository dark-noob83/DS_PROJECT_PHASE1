If spices and herbs are kept as we have discussed the shelf life will be as follows: • Whole spices and dried herbs, leaves and flowers will keep 1 - 2 years. • Seeds will keep 2 – 3 years and whole roots (i.e. ginger root or galangal root) will keep 3 years. • Ground spices and herb leaves keep 1 year.
The good news about spices is that they virtually last forever. It’s rare, if not impossible, for a spice to go “bad.” The biggest threat of time is that it causes spices to lose potency and flavor. Ground cinnamon that’s three years old will not carry as much flavor as cinnamon that’s only three months old. There are some people who recommend tossing out spices after six months, but I think that is ridiculous. Whole spices like cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and peppercorns last for years and years. Ground spices have a shorter shelf life because their surfaces are more exposed to the elements, but can still be good for 1-2 years, easily. If you’re concerned about a particular spice, try these two tricks: 1. Smell it.
They can last up to four years in an airtight container that is stored in a cool, dry place. It will keep even better in the dark. Extremely strong spices, such as whole cloves, cinnamon, and pepper, may last even longer.
Unopened dried spices have a shelf life of up to two or three years, depending on the specific spice and whether it is a whole spice or a ground spice. A rule of thumb is that whole spices (such as peppercorns, cinnamon sticks, and cloves) have the longest life. Ground herbs and spices are generally more fragile.
Stored in an airtight container [like our glass jars and bottles], these dry ingredients will be usable for a long time. Expert opinions vary, but, if you average all the opinions out, here’s approximately how long you should keep “Old Spice[s]” on your spice shelf: * Herbs – 1-3 years. * Spices – Whole 2-4 years.
