Healthy Carbs. It's important to include a few healthy carbs in your low-carb, low-sugar diet plan to up your intake of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients. That means whole grains, starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes and winter squash, fruit, milk and yogurt.
Fish. Fish is a leaner source of protein that is also low in carbs and sugar. Examples are salmon, halibut, cod, sardines, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sole and flounder. Shellfish like crab, lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, squid and oysters are also low carb, low sugar foods.
Beef, pork, game meats, turkey, chicken, duck, goose, pheasant and lamb are all types of meats that are high in protein, low in carbs and low in sugar. All derivatives of these meats are as well such as ham, bacon, sausage, steak, burgers and hot dogs.
A healthy breakfast on your low-carb, low-sugar diet might include two eggs scrambled in 1 teaspoon of olive oil with 1/2 cup of peppers and onions and served with a container of low-fat yogurt and 12 almonds. Substitute 1 cup of soft tofu for the eggs for a nonmeat tofu scramble.
Vegetables. Vegetables are loaded with vitamins and minerals, and they have a high content of water. But not all vegetables are low in carbs and sugar. Vegetables that are include asparagus, baby spinach, all forms of lettuce, mushrooms, cauliflower, broccoli, celery, peppers, tomatoes, radishes and cabbage.
Healthy Proteins. Many protein foods are naturally carb-and sugar-free. But not all protein foods make good choices. Some are high in fat and saturated fat, such as bacon and cheese. Try to include healthier protein options, such as lean red meat, white-meat poultry, seafood, eggs, tofu and low-fat cheese.
Definition. A low-carb diet limits carbohydrates — such as those found in grains, starchy vegetables and fruit — and emphasizes foods high in protein and fat. Many types of low-carb diets exist. Each diet has varying restrictions on the types and amounts of carbohydrates you can eat.
