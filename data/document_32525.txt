The Moon orbits Earth at a speed of 2,288 miles per hour (3,683 kilometers per hour). During this time it travels a distance of 1,423,000 miles (2,290,000 kilometers). 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 
3. An astronaut travels at a speed of 7800 m/s relative to the earth, a speed that is very small compared to c. According to a clock on the earth, the trip lasts 15 days. Determine the difference (in seconds) between the time recorded by the earth clock and the astronaut's clock. 4. 8. A muon created 20.0 Km. above the earth's surface (as measured in earth's frame) is moving with a speed relative to the earth of 0.9954c. The lifetime of the muon, as measured in its own frame, is 2.2 x 10^-6 seconds. In the frame of the muon, the earth is moving towards the muon with a speed of 0.9954c.
The muon(-/+) mass is roughly 310 times that of an electron (positron). Assume that a muon is created at an altitude of 5.00 km above the surface of the earth and it travels toward the earth with a speed of 0.995c. The muon the gets a certain distance into the atmosphere and decays. So there is a time delay between the two events.

Muon Velocity. On top of a mountain at 6000 ft a muon detector measures a flux of 550 muons per hour. At a laboratory at the base of the mountain at 2000 ft, a simultaneous experiment measures 422 muons/hr. The half-life of the muon is 1.56 microseconds
The muon is currently used as proof of time dilation, since without it, we are told, the muon would not live long enough to reach the surface of the earth. The muon lives only 2.2 x 10-6 seconds, and travels only about 660m under normal circumstances. But it is thought to be produced at an altitude of 15km. It does reach detectors on the surface of the earth, or at sea level, therefore it must be experiencing time dilation. Abstract: I will show that the atmospheric muon, now used as proof of time dilation, is not experiencing time dilation at all. In fact, the classical gravity equations, even without the fine tuning of Einstein, were always enough to explain the muon's detection at the earth's surface.
As is the case with other leptons, the muon is not believed to have any sub-structure—that is, it is not thought to be composed of any simpler particles. The muon is an unstable subatomic particle with a mean lifetime of 6994220000000000000♠2.2 µs. Among all known unstable subatomic particles, only the neutron (lasting around 15 minutes) and some atomic nuclei have a longer decay lifetime; others decay significantly faster. The decay of the muon (as well as of the neutron, the longest-lived unstable baryon), is mediated by the weak interaction exclusively. Muon decay always produces at least three particles, which must include an electron of the same charge as the muon and two neutrinos of different types.
The muon (/ˈmjuːɒn/ ; from the Greek letter mu (μ) used to represent it) is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with electric charge of −1 e and a spin of 1⁄2, but with a much greater mass (7002105700000000000♠105.7 MeV/c2). The decay of the muon (as well as of the neutron, the longest-lived unstable baryon), is mediated by the weak interaction exclusively. Muon decay always produces at least three particles, which must include an electron of the same charge as the muon and two neutrinos of different types.
