The price goes up from there if you add features like a chip seal top coat, which extends the life of the driveway, or a decorative top coat that is stamped or colored. Very high-end concrete could cost as much as $15 per square foot. Again, if you’re building a driveway where none existed, budget about an extra $2 to install a layer of gravel beneath the concrete. Removal of an existing driveway usually runs $50 to $60 per hour.
