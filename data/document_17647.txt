US Light Rail CostsNear $70 Million per Mile. A national survey of light rail systems in planning (as reflected in the Federal New Starts reports published in 1999 and 2000) shows an average of $68.91 million per mile (Table #1). This is up 24 percent from 1999.

1 This figure is less than half that of that for light rail transit (LRT), $26.4 million and one-tenth of metro rail transit (MRT), $128.2 million. 2  However, in some situations BRT can be more expensive per mile than LRT, and some LRT systems have exceeded the per-mile cost of MRT projects. 1 Compared with LRT systems, bus rapid transit is associated with greater land-acquisition costs ($3.018 million per mile, versus $1.52 million). 2  In addition, dedicated BRT guideways average $6.459 million per mile versus $4.289 million for light rail. 3  Station costs are also slightly higher for BRT than LRT
Another way to compare costs per mile of monorail and light rail transit projects is to use data for projects included in the federal New Starts report for 2002 from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). These data are useful because they present costs in roughly comparable Year of Expenditure (YOE) dollars. 
The cost of light rail construction varies widely, largely depending on the amount of tunneling and elevated structures required. A survey of North American light rail projects shows that costs of most LRT systems range from $15 million to over $100 million per mile. At the other end of the scale, four systems (Baltimore, Maryland; Camden, New Jersey; Sacramento, California; and Salt Lake City, Utah) incurred construction costs of less than $20 million per mile. Over the US as a whole, excluding Seattle, new light rail construction costs average about $35 million per mile. By comparison, a freeway lane expansion typically costs $1.0 million to $8.5 million per lane mile (a lane mile is a mile-long lane) for two directions, with an average of $2.3 million
1 Metro systems cost less than LRT systems per vehicle revenue mile, $6.5; the most per vehicle revenue hour, $152; and the least per thousand place mile and thousand passenger mile, $49.2 and $282, respectively. 2  Buses have the lowest average line capacity per hour, 3,800 to 7,200. 1 Compared with LRT systems, bus rapid transit is associated with greater land-acquisition costs ($3.018 million per mile, versus $1.52 million). 2  In addition, dedicated BRT guideways average $6.459 million per mile versus $4.289 million for light rail. 3  Station costs are also slightly higher for BRT than LRT
There is no way to justify these costs when buses are so much less expensive. Even worse, some cities are paying heavy-rail prices for light-rail capacities, getting the worst of both. Honolulu is building an elevated line at a cost of $250 million per mile whose capacity will be little greater than light rail. Seattle is building an underground light-rail line for more than $600 million a mile that will be able to carry no more people than San Diegoâ€™s original, $17 million-per-mile lin
1 On average, bus rapid transit (BRT) costs $10.24 million in 1990 dollars per mile to build. 2  This figure is less than half that of that for light rail transit (LRT), $26.4 million and one-tenth of metro rail transit (MRT), $128.2 million. 1 Compared with LRT systems, bus rapid transit is associated with greater land-acquisition costs ($3.018 million per mile, versus $1.52 million). 2  In addition, dedicated BRT guideways average $6.459 million per mile versus $4.289 million for light rail. 3  Station costs are also slightly higher for BRT than LRT
The cost of recent surface light rail lines has ranged from a low of $43 million per mile in Norfolk, VA to a high of $204 million per mile for the new Milwaukie line in Portland. Los Angeles's Crenshaw Line, which includes short subway sections, clocks in at $165 million per mile. In the United States, the cost of recent projects has ranged from $20 million per mile for an one track extension of the existing St. Louis rail system to $50 million per mile for streetcars in the First Hill area of Seattle and connecting downtown Tucson to the University of Arizona campus.
