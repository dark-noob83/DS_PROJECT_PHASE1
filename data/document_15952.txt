Calculate the Population Standard Deviation. 1  Calculate the mean or average of each data set. 2  Add up all the numbers in a data set and divide by the total number of pieces of data. 3  For example, if you have found numbers in a data set, divide the sum by 4. 4  This is the mean of the data set.
Standard Deviation Formula. The standard deviation formula is similar to the variance formula. It is given by: Ïƒ = standard deviation. xi = each value of dataset. x (with a bar over it) = the arithmetic mean of the data (This symbol will be indicated as mean from now). N = the total number of data points.
To calculate the standard deviation of those numbers: 1  1. 2  2. Then for each number: subtract the Mean and square the result. 3  3. Then work out the mean of those squared differences. 4  4. Take the square root of that and we are done!
To calculate the standard deviation of those numbers: 1  1. 2  Work out the Mean (the simple average of the numbers). 3  2. Then for each number: subtract the Mean and square the result. 4  3. Then work out the mean of those squared differences. 5  4. Take the square root of that and we are done!
Calculate the Sample Standard Deviation. 1  Calculate the mean or average of each data set. 2  To do this, add up all the numbers in a data set and divide by the total number of pieces of data. 3  For example, if you have found numbers in a data set, divide the sum by 4.
Calculating the standard deviation using Excel. Excel has functions to calculate the population and sample standard deviations. The appropriate commands are entered into the formula bar towards the top of the spreadsheet and the corresponding cells in the spreadsheet are updated to show the result.
