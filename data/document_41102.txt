Development. Development is the process through which an embryo becomes an adult organism and eventually dies. Through development, an organism's genotype is expressed as a phenotype, exposing genes to the action of natural selection. Studies of development are important to evolutionary biology for several reasons:
If both dominant alleles are present in a genotype (homozygous dominant) then the phenotype is A phenotype. If one dominant allele and one recessive allele are present (heterozygous dominant) then the phenotype is A.
If both dominant alleles are present in a genotype (homozygous dominant) then the phenotype is A phenotype. If one dominant allele and one recessive allele are present (heterozygous dominant) then the phenotype is A.
genotype is the genetic constitution of an organism like the alleles present etc whereas phenotype is the character expressed. for example in the case of sweet pea T T is the … genotype whereas tall plant is the genotype expressed by that genetic constitution (TT).

Yes because if the phenotype is recessive there is only one possible genotype, little letter little letter ex. rr (wrikled pea plant seed), cc (albino), tt (short pea plant) w … hereas if you have a dominante phenotype there are two possible genotypes, big letter big letter or big
A genotype is the actual composition of the alleles present on each chromosome for a particular gene in an organism. A phenotype is the observed trait in the organism. For example, let's say the gene for being tall is represented by the letter T.
