The size of your dog is easier to estimate if you've seen the dog's mother and father. The American Kennel Club standards for an ideal full-grown lab declare that a male dog's height at the withers is between 22.5 and 24.5 inches, and a female dog's at 21.5 to 23.5 inches. The approximate weight of a male, the AKC asserts, ranges between 65 and 80 pounds; female dogs weigh 55 to 70 pounds. While much depends on the individual dog, labs reach full size by the age of 18 months. By this point, he's added weight, but it's not fat. Regular exercise helps develop the bone and muscle that pack on pounds by this late stage.
(He was weighed at the vet. when he was getting his microchip, so I know his weight is accurate). When I told my buddies they said that I'm going to have a huge dog because labs are half their weight and height at 6 months. Right now my dog is putting on between 1.6-2.3 lbs. per week. So if I do the math 4 wks x 2 lbs/week = 8 lbs. 8 + 49 = 57 57 x 2 = 114 lbs. fully mature male lab!!! The standard is 80 lbs. 
Do English labs grow less than American labs? my lab 6.5 months old is 58lbs. he is 22- 23 inches tall and 32-33 inches long. His father was more than 85 pounds. Just want to know how much will he grow in terms of weight and height on an average. Best Answer: English labs grow much larger than American. My lab was about 60lbs at 6 months, on his 1st birthday he weighed 96lbs! Now he's 1yr and 6 months and his weight has pretty much stayed the same, he fluctuates anywhere between 96 and 100. Good luck! English labs are the best dogs ever!!
Weight. A healthy adult black Lab female weighs 55 to 70 pounds and a male 65 to 80 pounds. By the age of 6 months, black Lab puppies reach approximately two-thirds of their adult weight, so a dog of 7 months should be in this range or slightly heavier. Males reach a height of 22 to 25 inches. By the age of 6 months, most dogs reach approximately 75 percent of their full adult height, so your 7-month-old black Lab should be between 15 and 18 inches tall.
Size. The average female black Lab grows to a height of between 21 and 24 inches from the floor at the withers, or shoulders, although even a purebred dog can be bigger or smaller. Males reach a height of 22 to 25 inches. By the age of 6 months, most dogs reach approximately 75 percent of their full adult height, so your 7-month-old black Lab should be between 15 and 18 inches tall.

In 15 months, the Labrador retriever puppy (born around one lb) multiplies his birth weight by 70 or more! Most Lab puppies are around 10 lbs at eight weeks of age and reach 50 lbs at around seven months of age. As a rule of thumb, they will gain 2 lbs a week until they are about 26 weeks old. Because they grow so quickly, your pup may appear clumsy and awkward for a while as he adapts to his bigger, stronger body.
