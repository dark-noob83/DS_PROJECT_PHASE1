Any member of the group can add photos to a group album. Group photos are only visible to other members, and only group members can be tagged in group photos.
Photos posted on closed and secret groups are only visible to other members. You are only able to post photos to a Facebook group if the group admin allows it. If photo uploads are allowed you can upload a maximum of five photos at a time. There is no limit on moving photos between albums.
