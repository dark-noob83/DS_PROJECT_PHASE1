Many people also try supplements to help treat their depression. St. John's wort, omega 3 fatty acids and s-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) are a few of the most common supplements taken to deal with depression. While these may have positive effects, it's a good idea to ask your doctor before starting any supplement treatments.
Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You're not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there's a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments. These tips can help you feel better -- starting right now.
If you prefer to fight depression without drugs, however, there are many simple, effective strategies to try, especially if youâ€™re dealing with a passing case of the blues or a situational depression triggered by life circumstances. These steps can also be helpful when used along with medication for serious depression.
Engage in Useful Therapies. Don't underestimate the power of therapy when it comes to dealing with depression. Talking to a professional is one of the best ways to treat depression without the use of medication. If your depressive symptoms start to seriously interfere with your daily life, your next step should be to contact a counselor or psychologist.
