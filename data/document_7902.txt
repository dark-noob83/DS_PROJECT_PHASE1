At DDC the range is smaller, from $189 to $459 (with further discounts often available), depending on the services needed and use of results for legal purposes. This post sheds some light on what goes into paternity testing costs. Although a DNA test may seem as simple as a pregnancy test, many factors can affect the accuracy of a DNA test result and what you can use the results for. These are the top two considerations when looking at how much a paternity test costs. First, let’s talk about accuracy.
Costs will vary, depending on which types of procedures are performed. Prices can range from $400.00 to $2,000.00. Prenatal testing is often more costly than testing done after a baby is born because of the additional doctor and hospital-related fees.
The cost of genetic testing can range from under $100 to more than $2,000, depending on the nature and complexity of the test. The cost increases if more than one test is necessary or if multiple family members must be tested to obtain a meaningful result. For newborn screening, costs vary by state. Some states cover part of the total cost, but most charge a fee of $15 to $60 per infant. From the date that a sample is taken, it may take a few weeks to several months to receive the test results.
