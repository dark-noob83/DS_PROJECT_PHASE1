The global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature, show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C, in the period 1880 to 2012, based on multiple independently produced datasets. The Earth's average surface temperature rose by 7002273890000000000♠0.74±0.18 °C over the period 1906–2005. The Earth's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961-1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land, oceans and sea ice regions, with a best estimate of 14 °C (57.2 °F).
August 31, 2001. The average temperature of the ocean surface water is about 17 °C (62.6 F).. 17 °C. So even though surface waters can be a comfortable 20 degrees Celsius (good for swimming in!), the majority of our ocean water has a temperature between 0-3 degrees Celsius (32-37.5 degrees Fahrenheit).. 0-3 °C. Recordings have shown that the average temperature of water ranges from 0-3 degrees Celsius (32–37.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Back in 1899 it was estimated that 92% of the ocean floor had a temperature of lower than 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
From 1970-1999, global sea surface temperature rose at an average rate of 0.06 to 0.11º Celsius per decade. The rate decreased from 2000-2012 due to a prevalence of La Nina-niña like. conditions From 2011-2012, as a weak La Nina niña transitioned to more neutral, conditions average sea surface temperature for the global ocean warmed by about.0 1º. celsius
Weekly average sea surface temperature for the World Ocean during the first week of February 2011, during a period of La Nina. niña The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
Sea surface temperature—the average temperature of water at the surface of the global ocean—is a key indicator of the ocean's staus. Because the ocean is constantly interacting with the atmosphere, changes in sea surface temperature can have profound effects on other aspects of Earth's climate. From 2011-2012, as a weak La Nina niña transitioned to more neutral, conditions average sea surface temperature for the global ocean warmed by about.0 1º. celsius
Since 1976, every year including 2014 has had an average global temperature warmer than the long-term average. Over this 37-year period, temperature warmed at an average of 0.50 °F (0.28 °C) per decade over land and 0.20 °F (0.11 °C) per decade over the ocean. Temperatures measured on land and at sea for more than a century show that Earth's globally averaged surface temperature is experiencing a long-term warming trend. The concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd.
This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures. The 10 warmest years in the 134-year record all have occurred since 2000, with the exception of 1998. The year 2014 ranks as the warmest on record. (Source: NASA/GISS). 0.68 °C. 
Sea surface temperature increased over the 20th century and continues to rise. From 1901 through 2012, temperatures rose at an average rate of 0.13°F per decade. Sea surface temperatures have been higher during the past three decades than at any other time since reliable observations began in 1880. The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
Sea surface temperature (SST) is the water temperature close to the ocean 's surface. The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between 1 millimetre (0.04 in) and 20 metres (70 ft) below the sea surface. Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore. The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
Sea surface temperature in 2012 compared to the 1981-2010 average, based on data from NOAA National Climatic Data Center. The dark red and blue areas reveal areas of the global ocean that were up to 7º Fahrenheit warmer or cooler than average. From 2011-2012, as a weak La Nina niña transitioned to more neutral, conditions average sea surface temperature for the global ocean warmed by about.0 1º. celsius
