The Minecart is a craftable item that makes riding a Minecart Track faster. It can be equipped in the Minecart equipment slot and dyed (the default can be dyed as well, without an item in the slot). It is the second tier minecart, being worse than the Mechanical Cart, but better than the default minecart. The Minecart has a max speed of 48.4 blocks per second, or 66 mph.
Perpetually moving minecart track. Works underwater and above. Upvote this! http://redd.it/m9zrx. If you are using this for survival, make sure you have air bubbles along the way (such as signs) so you can breath. Song: Rainy Day in Paris: http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/liste...
Minecarts are a great way to travel places in Minecraft without running! Every big mine can use a minecart track to help you move yourself and your equipment to and from the mine. Minecarts have other uses as well, including more creative uses such as trains and rollercoasters.
Place your ingots like so and you have a mine cart. Once you’ve made enough rails, you can get started building a mine cart track but first, it’s important to understand a couple of the rules, a couple of the laws of how mine cart tracks work in Minecraft.
