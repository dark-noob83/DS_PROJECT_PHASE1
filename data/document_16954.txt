May 21, 1850 - March 19, 1914. Giuseppe Mercalli (May 21, 1850 – March 19, 1914) was an Italian volcanologist. He is best remembered for the Mercalli intensity scale for measuring earthquakes which is still used today.
Mercalli, Giuseppe (1815–1914) An Italian professor of natural sciences who studied the major earthquake districts of Italy, Mercalli is best known for his scale of earthquake intensity, first formulated in 1897, and refined several times. See also MERCALLI SCALE. Cite this article.

Figure 2 - Giuseppe Mercalli. Another way to measure the strength of an earthquake is to use the Mercalli scale. Invented by Giuseppe Mercalli in 1902, this scale uses the observations of the people who experienced the earthquake to estimate its intensity. The Mercalli scale isn't considered as scientific as the Richter scale, though.
