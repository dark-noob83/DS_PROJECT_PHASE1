The section of the spine at the neck is called the cervical spine. It starts at the atlas, the top cervical vertebra, and continues down to the C7 vertebra.
They form the region of the spinal column inferior to the cervical vertebrae of the neck and superior to the lumbar vertebrae of the lower back.... Click to read more below. The thoracic vertebrae are a group of twelve small bones that form the vertebral spine in the upper trunk.
Your spine is made up of three segments. When viewed from the side, these segments form three natural curves. The c-shaped curves of the neck (cervical spine) and lower back (lumbar spine) are called lordosis. The reverse c-shaped curve of the chest (thoracic spine) is called kyphosis.
