Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of inkjet printheads, DNA chips, lab-on-a-chip technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies.
Microfluidics is a multidisciplinary field intersecting engineering, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, with practical applications to the design of systems in which low volumes of fluids are processed to achieve multiplexing, automation, and high-throughput screening.
The “micro-“ in microfluidics refers to small volumes (nL, pL, fL), small size, low energy consumption, or physical effects of the micro domain.
Active microfluidics refers to the defined manipulation of the working fluid by active components as micropumps or micro valves. Micro pumps supply fluids in a continuous manner or are used for dosing. Micro valves determine the flow direction or the mode of movement of pumped liquids.
Microfluidics can be considered both as a science (study of the behaviour of fluids in micro-channels) and a technology (manufacturing of microfluidics devices for applications such as lab-on-a-chip).
microfluidics. The science of building microminiaturized devices with chambers and tunnels for the containment and flow of fluids. With devices measured at the micrometer level and fluids measured in nanoliters and picoliters, microfluidics devices are widely used in inkjet printer heads and labs on a chip.
Active microfluidics refers to the defined manipulation of the working fluid by active (micro) components such as micropumps or micro valves. Micro pumps supply fluids in a continuous manner or are used for dosing. Micro valves determine the flow direction or the mode of movement of pumped liquids.
By including tiny pumps or electric devices on a microfluidics chip, it greatly expands the variety of applications. Future microfluidics devices may come equipped with millions of tiny gates that let users manipulate flow in complex and useful ways.
