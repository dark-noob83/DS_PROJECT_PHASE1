Two completely new “expedited” court processes – Rules 79 (“Simplified Procedure”) and 80 (“Certain Claims not exceeding $30,000”) – that saw Court of Queen’s Bench judges adjudicate claims up to $75,000 and $30,000 respectively, replaced the Small Claims Court. Relaxed procedural and evidentiary rules also help to move the process forward more quickly, and at a lower cost. The new Court’s monetary limit is more than double that of the pre-2010 small claims regime ($6,000). However, it is substantially less than the $30,000 threshold under Rule 80.
What if my claim is over $12,500? If your total claim for debt, damages or personal property is over $12,500, you would have to start a civil action through the Court of Queen’s Bench. You could only use Small Claims Court if you decide to “give up” (abandon) the amount of your claim over the $12,500 limit. An appeal to the Court of Appeal is complicated and expensive. Talk to a lawyer to make sure there is reason to appeal. See the fact sheet: Appealing a Decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.

Development The Small Claims Court of New Brunswick was established on January 1st, 1999. This court hears civil suits for debt or damages, return of personal property or a combination of those claims, where the value involved does not exceed $6,000. On March 14, 2009, it was announced that the Small Claims Court will be eliminated as part of budget cuts included in the 2009-2010 New Brunswick Budget.
● The judge who decided the case. You must pay a filing fee of $250 with the Notice of Appeal and deposit $300 with the clerk of the Appellate Division within 30 days of the Notice of Appeal. The deposit could be used to pay settlement or court costs if the appeal is lost. If the appeal is successful, the deposit will be refunded. 
A person may also claim interest as long as the total amount of the interest and the claim is not more than $30,000. Rule 80: Certain Claims Not Exceeding $30,000 is found in the New Brunswick Rules of Court. Rule 80 came into force on July 15, 2010 and it replaces the previous small claims process with a simplified process for making claims in the Court of Queen's Bench, Trial Division. The fee to file a counterclaim depends of the amount of the claim. If the amount of the counterclaim is for $3,000 or less, the filing fee is $50. If the amount is for $3,001 to $30,000, the filing fee is $100.
The amount payable is $35 for each day or $18 for a half day. You also have to pay for any travel costs, at a rate of 20¢ per kilometre to and from the hearing, and $30 for overnight accommodations (if necessary). H. At the Hearing The small claims hearing is informal, but similar to a court proceeding. An appeal to the Court of Appeal is complicated and expensive. Talk to a lawyer to make sure there is reason to appeal. See the fact sheet: Appealing a Decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench. It is available at the Clerk’s Office or from Public Legal Education and Information Service (www.legal-info-legale.nb.ca).
COSTS AWARDS. The new Small Claims Court rules permit an adjudicator to order a maximum of $500 in costs against a party for unreasonably bringing or defending an action. Under Rule 80, cost awards were based on the Rule 59 tariff and could thus be much greater. On March 14, 2009, it was announced that the Small Claims Court will be eliminated as part of budget cuts included in the 2009-2010 New Brunswick Budget.
This is called a Counterclaim. A Counterclaim in Small Claims Court may be for an amount of money and/or personal property with a combined value of up to $12,500. See page 18 on Defending a Claim. If the amount of the Counterclaim is $3,000 or less, the filing fee is $50. An appeal to the Court of Appeal is complicated and expensive. Talk to a lawyer to make sure there is reason to appeal.
