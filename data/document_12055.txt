Q: When will my baby start to walk? A: Most babies start taking their first steps between 11 and 15 months, but this milestone is hugely variable, and anywhere from 9 to 18 months is really considered normal.
JustMommies / Babies / Baby Development. Most babies start to walk around 13 months, but your baby may start walking as early as 9 or 10 months or as late as 15 or 16 months. Some babies go from cruising the furniture to walking rather quickly and other babies learn to walk at a little slower pace.
Most babies take their first steps sometime between 9 and 12 months and are walking well by the time they're 14 or 15 months old. Don't worry if your child takes a little longer, though. Some perfectly normal children don't walk until they're 16 or 17
The normal age range when a child starts walking is 9 to 15 months, and most children start walking just after the age of one-between 13 to 14 months. So if your 14 month child cannot walk, but can crawl, sit, stand, there is no cause for concern.
Best Answer: My oldest son didn't walk until he was 15 months and my third son was 16 1/2 months but he had started seeing a pedatrician beacause he was not showing any interest in walking at all, but he did walk and it was in his own time, they only start to worry if they are not walking at 18 months.
