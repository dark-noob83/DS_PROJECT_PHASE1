According to Walmart's website, the average wage for a full-time store worker is $12.83 per hour, which translates into a salary of about $27,000 per year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median pay for retail sales people at large in the U.S. economy was $20,990 in 2010, or $10.09 per hour. Anthony Goytia, a Walmart store worker in California who spoke on Capitol Hill Wednesday, said he earns $9.60 per hour after working a year for the company.
According to Walmart's website, a full-time hourly Walmart employee earns an average of USD 12.78 per hour in the United States. However, according to the IBISWorld research, an average sales associate actually earns around USD 8.81 per hour, making less than the Federal Poverty Level for a family of four, annually. According to a survey conducted at Walmart, around 70 percent of the employees leave their job within the first 12 months-courtesy the inadequate pay and failure of the company to give employee recognition. Walmart has a very strict policy against the formation of unions.
Average Walmart hourly pay ranges from approximately $7.30 per hour for Sales Consultant to $100.00 per hour for Quality Assurance Engineer. The average Walmart salary ranges from approximately $15,000 per year for Lube Technician to $220,000 per year for Market Manager. Salary information comes from 45,631 data points collected directly from employees, users, and jobs on Indeed. 
After years of employee protests and outrage over meager pay, Walmart said Thursday that it will spend $1 billion this year to give raises to half-a-million workers. About 500,000 full-and part-time associates at both Walmart and the company's Sam's Club warehouse stores will start making $9 an hour or more in April. Walmart employs more than 1.3 million people in the U.S. Of the 500,000 employees getting raises, approximately 6,000 currently make the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, says spokesperson Kory Lundberg.
Full-time employees currently make an average of $12.85 an hour, and part-time employees make an average of $9.48, Lundberg says. Those averages will increase to $13 and $10 respectively under the new plan. Walmart employs more than 1.3 million people in the U.S. Of the 500,000 employees getting raises, approximately 6,000 currently make the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, says spokesperson Kory Lundberg.
In other words, if Walmart decided to use 100% of its operating profit to pay all of its employees more, the average store associate's salary would go from $20,000 to $30,000. If Walmart paid bosses like CEO Mike Duke less (Duke made $6 million last year) that would create some more operating profit. Last year, for example, the company paid $7 billion of taxes--a bill that reduced its income before taxes from $22 billion to $15 billion. If Walmart were to eliminate its $22 billion of income before taxes by giving every employee a raise, it would then pay no taxes. Which wouldn't help our national budget deficit.

This translates to annual pay of $15,576, based upon Walmart’s full-time status of 34 hours per week 1. This is significantly below the 2010 Federal Poverty Level of $22,050 for a family of four. If Walmart were to pass this cost directly to shoppers, the average consumer would need to pay only 46 cents more per shopping trip, or $12.50 per year.

This is the latest wage increase announced by the world’s largest retailer, which sees annual sales of more than $470 billion. Walmart said in February that it would bump its starting salary for workers to $9 an hour in April, and to $10 sometime next year. That move affected 500,000 of the company’s 1.3 million U.S. employees. 
The company said 500,000 full-time and part-time associates, more than a third of its work force at Walmart (WMT) U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs, will receive pay raises in April to at least $9 an hour. That will be $1.75 above the federal minimum wage. By next February 1, their pay will go to at least $10 an hour. Walmart's pay and employment policies have been the focus of protest by some workers and outside labor groups seeking to organize Walmart employees. Black Friday protesters last year were demanding a $15 an hour pay minimum across the company. Related: New laws mean wage bumps at Walmart.
