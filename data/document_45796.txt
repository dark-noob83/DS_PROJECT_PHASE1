A thyroid scan is a nuclear medicine test that uses a radioactive iodine tracer to examine the structure and function of the thyroid gland. This test is often done together with a radioactive iodine uptake test.
A ventilationâ€“perfusion (VQ) scan is a nuclear medicine scan that uses radioactive material (radiopharmaceutical) to examine airflow (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion) in the lungs.
Summary. Nuclear scans use radioactive substances to see structures and functions inside your body. They use a special camera that detects radioactivity. Before the test, you receive a small amount of radioactive material. You may get it as an injection.
A nuclear scan is an imaging test that uses imaging technology and trace amounts of radioactive materials, called radiotracers, to diagnose and monitor diseases and treatments. Nuclear scans can show the structure and function of most body organs and tissues.
A nuclear heart scan is a test that provides important information about the health of your heart. For this test, a safe, radioactive substance called a tracer is injected into your bloodstream through a vein.
Topic Overview. Nuclear medicine scans use a special camera (gamma) to take pictures of tissues and organs in the body after a radioactive tracer (radionuclide or radioisotope) is put in a vein in the arm and is absorbed by the tissues and organs.
