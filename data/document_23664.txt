Of the more than 30 eruptions of Mauna Loa in the last hundred years, the 1975 and 1984 eruptions are the first events for which we have detailed seismic and deformation data. Thus, we consider the 1975 and 1984 data sets important standards against which future unrest can be compared and interpreted. 
Rising gradually to more than 4 km above sea level, Mauna Loa is the largest volcano on our planet. Its long submarine flanks descend to the sea floor an additional 5 km, and the sea floor in turn is depressed by Mauna Loa's great mass another 8 km. This makes the volcano's summit about 17 km (56,000 ft) above its base!
Identification. Mauna Loa takes up half of the biggest island in the chain that makes up the Hawaiian Islands. The fact that it is a shield volcano accounts for the enormity and why it spreads out so much. Shield volcanoes are formed by many lava flows that build up and create long, gentle slopes rather than a steep-sided mountain. Size. What you see of Mauna Loa is less than half of the entire volcano. The volcano rises 13,680 feet above sea level, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Mauna Loa, or Long Mountain in Hawaiian, is located on the island of Hawaii. It is pictured above rising 13,680 ft. (4,170 m) above sea level (this photo was taken from over Loihi seamount, some 30 km or so to the south). Since 1832, Mauna Loa has erupted 39 times; its last eruption was in 1984. Thus, if one wanted to say how thick (at its center) is the lava pile that makes up Mauna Loa, one would need to add its above sea level height, its sea floor to sea level height, and the thickness of its depression in the Pacific sea floor. These total 56,080 ft (17,170 m)
Mauna Loa: The Fiery Mountain. Mauna Loa is Earth’s largest volcano and most massive mountain as it takes up nearly half of the flourishing landscape of the island of Hawai’i.
Articles. Mauna Loa is the largest volcano on Earth with an estimated volume of 9,600 cubic miles (40,000 cubic kilometers). It makes half of the area of the Island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa began to form nearly a million years ago. There is a caldera, Mokuaweoweo, at the summit and rift zones extend to the northeast and southwest.
The Mauna Loa Volcano is the largest volcano on the planet as it rises over 4 kilometers above the sea level but the 4 kilometers that you see on top is not even half the size of the volcano. 
Rising to more than 4 km above sea level, Mauna Loa is the largest volcano in the world. The enormous volcano covers half of the island, and is among the Earth’s most active volcanoes, having erupted 33 times since its first well-documented historical eruption in 1843. Rising to more than 4 km above sea level, Mauna Loa is the largest volcano in the world. There have been many stories about Pele and her home on Mauna Loa. One story says that Pele had a white dog that she’d send to alert the people when an eruption was underway.
Mauna Loa, or 'Long Mountain' in Hawaiian, is located on the island of Hawaii. It rises 13,680 ft. (4,170 m) above sea level. Since 1832, Mauna Loa has erupted 39 times; it's last eruption was in 1984. Mauna Loa is a REALLY tall and big mountain. At 60 miles long and 30 miles wide, it makes up half of the entire island. When one considers that the flanks of Mauna Loa sit on sea floor that is about 16,400 ft (5,000 M) deep, the height of this volcano relative to neighboring land (the sea floor) is more like 30,080 ft (9,170 m)!
