Cost to Run a Gas Furnace. The average U.S. household requires between 50 million and 150 million British thermal units, or Btu, of heat each winter. Those living in mild climate zones will likely fall on the lower end of this range. While more than 70 percent of California residents rely on gas for heating, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, another 22 percent turn to electricity to heat the home. When considering a gas furnace, it may be helpful to compare the cost of operating a gas furnace to the cost of electric heating.
Cost. Electric companies charge consumers by the kilowatt-hour, and rates vary from company to company and can depend on how much electricity you use and the season. For example, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company base rate is from $0.08 to $0.13 for base usage and from $0.27 to $0.34 for heavy usage. Multiply your applicable rate by the number of kilowatt-hours the heater consumes to find out how much it costs to operate. For example, for a consumer who pays the base rate in winter, PG&E charges about three dollars for the electricity to run a 1500-watt heater for 24 hours
Based on the U.S. average price of $1.15 per therm of natural gas as of the publication date, the U.S. Energy Information Institute estimates that 1 million Btu of heat costs about $14.02. This figure assumes an average gas furnace efficiency of 82 percent. In California, natural gas costs $9.20 per thousand cubic feet, or 90 cents per therm, according to the EIA. At this price it would cost $10.98 to generate 1 million Btu of heat using an 82 percent efficient furnace. While more than 70 percent of California residents rely on gas for heating, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, another 22 percent turn to electricity to heat the home. When considering a gas furnace, it may be helpful to compare the cost of operating a gas furnace to the cost of electric heating.
Costs. Assuming the cost of natural gas is $1.20 per cubic foot (CCF), consider the costs of producing a million BTUs with heating systems of different efficiencies of 60 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent. Because so many variables factor into how much you'll pay to heat a home (location, type of heater, cost of gas, time of year), one of the easiest ways to look at heating costs is to consider how much it costs to produce one million BTUs.
While it costs around $14.02 to generate 1 million Btu from furnace in the United States with an 82 percent efficiency (based on U.S. average natural gas prices), it costs just $12.10 for the same million Btu from a unit that is 95 percent efficient. While more than 70 percent of California residents rely on gas for heating, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, another 22 percent turn to electricity to heat the home. When considering a gas furnace, it may be helpful to compare the cost of operating a gas furnace to the cost of electric heating.
1 Replacing a gas floor furnace (the heat rises from a grill flush with the floor) typically costs about $900-$2,500 for just the unit, depending on size, BTUs and features like the type of thermostat; installation brings the total cost to $2,000-$4,500 or more. Gas furnaces can be powered by natural gas (from a utility company) or propane (LP). Capacity is measured in British thermal units (one BTU is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit). A furnace rated 50,000 BTU consumes 50,000 BTUs an hour.
The running costs vary from gas to electric. The average running cost for an electric water heater is $550. The average running costs of a gas water heater is $400. The difference in usage price per year is $150. You will average more savings if you live in a cold climate and will average less if you live in a warm climate. In other words, you will naturally save more if your hot water heater runs a lot because itâ€™s cold. Gas Water Heater Cost. The average cost for gas water heating units is $850. That will buy you a decent water heater that is rated for 12 years. These, too, can be found for cheaper than that price. You may find a 3 year rated water heater for about $350. Quality units can cost $1,000 to $1,400.
1 Prices of gas wall heaters vary depending on the design and energy output. 2  A 30,000 BTU vent free natural gas wall heater can cost $100 to $450 and can provide heat of up to a 1,000 square foot space. 3  A 6,000 BTU LP gas wall heater will provide sufficient heat for a moderate room. 1 A 30,000 BTU vent free natural gas wall heater can cost $100 to $450 and can provide heat of up to a 1,000 square foot space. 2  A 6,000 BTU LP gas wall heater will provide sufficient heat for a moderate room. 3  This is an ideal source for primary or secondary source of heating. 4  These can be purchased from $250 to $460
