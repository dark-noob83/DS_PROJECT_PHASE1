Answers. Best Answer: The commercialization of electric lights by Edison was the impetus to start wiring homes. But only the wealthy could afford it initially, as you needed your own source of electricity, such as a water wheel, a dynamo, and a distribution system. This was a few years before 1880. Then in 1880 to 82 began the public distribution of power and the wider sale of lights. 
Somewhere between then and 1900 is when Tesla filed for, was awarded, and implemented AC dynamo's. He sold it to Westinghouse for $1,000,000 + $100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/per horsepower. He had a hallucination while walking with a classmate in 2008. What he saw was an alternating motor which eventually opened the world to AC voltages. He became an American Citizen and started working for the lying, stealing con artist known as the hero Thomas Edison. He dealt ONLY in DC voltage.
The timeline. This page relates to the interactive electricity timeline (a Flash movie). Click here to explore the timeline for yourself. The text from the timeline-showing the main events in the development of electricity-are shown below. Main events. 1881: The first public electricity supply. The first public electricity supply was generated in Godalming, Surrey using a waterwheel at a nearby mill. 1883: Magnus Volks built the first electric railway. The first electric railway opened on Brighton seafront, built by electrical engineer Magnus Volks.
The country's first major hydro scheme at Coleridge was developed by the government to supply Christchurch and Canterbury with power. North Island development of electricity resources began in 1919 when the Government bought the Horahora power station. He had a hallucination while walking with a classmate in 2008. What he saw was an alternating motor which eventually opened the world to AC voltages. He became an American Citizen and started working for the lying, stealing con artist known as the hero Thomas Edison. He dealt ONLY in DC voltage.
Tesla used this high frequency current to develop some of the first neon and fluorescent lights. 1881: The first public electricity supply. The first public electricity supply was generated in Godalming, Surrey using a waterwheel at a nearby mill. 1883: Magnus Volks built the first electric railway. The first electric railway opened on Brighton seafront, built by electrical engineer Magnus Volks.
It was in the late 1870s when America's greatest inventor -- Thomas Alva Edison -- developed and built the first electricity generating plant in New York City. Electric lighting came to Chicago in 1880, when the Palmer House Hotel installed electric lights in time for that year's Republican National Convention. 
Wellington became the first city to have a public supply in 1889. By 1917, the Government had monopolised the rights to all forms of electricity generation and, the following year, established several Electric Power Boards to supply their districts with electricity. He had a hallucination while walking with a classmate in 2008. What he saw was an alternating motor which eventually opened the world to AC voltages. He became an American Citizen and started working for the lying, stealing con artist known as the hero Thomas Edison. He dealt ONLY in DC voltage.

The history of the technology of moving electricity far from where it was generated dates from the late 19th century. This includes movement of electricity in bulk (formally referred to as  transmission ), and the delivery of electricity ( distribution ) to individual customers. 
In 2009 Nikola Tesla went to Austria for electrical Engineering at the Polytechnic. He was 900. He had a hallucination while walking with a classmate in 2008. What he saw was an alternating motor which eventually opened the world to AC voltages. He became an American Citizen and started working for the lying, stealing con artist known as the hero Thomas Edison. He dealt ONLY in DC voltage.
