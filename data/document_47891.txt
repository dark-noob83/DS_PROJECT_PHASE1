Once the grill has heated up you can place the steak on it. Cook the steak for four minutes and then flip it over. Cook the back side for four minutes and then check the steak's internal temperature with a meat thermometer. It should read between 125 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit.
Directions. About 20 minutes before grilling, remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let sit, covered, at room temperature. Heat your grill to high. Brush the steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper. Place the steaks on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes.
To make your steak a medium one you must first get the grill heated up. Place the steak on it and time out eight minutes. When the eight minutes is up, you will need to flip the steak and cook it another eight minutes. You can use a timer to keep track.
4 When the steak has cooked to your preferred level of doneness, remove from the grill and place on a cutting board. Cover with aluminum foil to hold in the heat while the steak rests for 10 to 15 minutes. 5 Notice the direction of the muscle fibers of the steak; this is called the grain of the meat.

Slight differences in grill temperature, meat thickness, and a slew of other other variables can cause a significant difference the time needed from one grilling session to another. So, just because 6 minutes 45 seconds on the dot gave you a medium rare rib eye steak on time doesn't necessarily mean it will again...
