Reflection, Refraction, and Diffraction. Like any wave, a sound wave doesn't just stop when it reaches the end of the medium or when it encounters an obstacle in its path. Rather, a sound wave will undergo certain behaviors when it encounters the end of the medium or an obstacle. Refraction of waves involves a change in the direction of waves as they pass from one medium to another. Refraction, or bending of the path of the waves, is accompanied by a change in speed and wavelength of the waves.
Diffraction Definition. Refraction is the bending of light or sound waves that moves from one medium to another and a change in speed is forced. Refraction creates optical phenomenon and illusions. Diffraction of Light is bending of the light waves around an object.
In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described as the interference of waves according to the Huygensâ€“Fresnel principle. These characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as visible light, X-rays and radio waves. Since physical objects have wave-like properties (at the atomic level), diffraction also occurs with matter and can be studied according to the principles of quantum mechanics.
While diffraction occurs whenever propagating waves encounter such changes, its effects are generally most pronounced for waves whose wavelength is roughly comparable to the dimensions of the diffracting object or slit. Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as visible light, X-rays and radio waves. Since physical objects have wave-like properties (at the atomic level), diffraction also occurs with matter and can be studied according to the principles of quantum mechanics.
This is due to the addition, or interference, of different parts of a wave that travels to the observer by different paths, where different path lengths result in different phases (see diffraction grating and wave superposition). Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as visible light, X-rays and radio waves. Since physical objects have wave-like properties (at the atomic level), diffraction also occurs with matter and can be studied according to the principles of quantum mechanics.
Diffraction describes the change in a wave's direction as it travels between or around barriers. It's similar to reflection and refraction in that it involves a change in the direction of waves when they encounter a change in medium. Reflection describes how waves bounce off surfaces. Diffraction describes how waves bend, or change direction, as they travel around the edges of obstacles. Diffraction occurs in water waves, sound waves, and light waves, but the amount of diffraction depends on the size of the obstacle or opening in relation to the wavelength of the wave.
Diffraction of sound waves and of light waves will be discussed in a later unit of The Physics Classroom Tutorial. Reflection, refraction and diffraction are all boundary behaviors of waves associated with the bending of the path of a wave. The bending of the path is an observable behavior when the medium is a two-or three-dimensional medium. Reflection occurs when there is a bouncing off of a barrier. Refraction is always accompanied by a wavelength and speed change. Diffraction is the bending of waves around obstacles and openings. The amount of diffraction increases with increasing wavelength.

noun. Diffraction is defined as a process by which light waves break up into dark and light bands or into the colors of the spectrum. Light passing through a narrow opening in the blinds, causing bright and dark shadows and patterns to fall across the floor is an example of defraction. diffraction-Computer Definition. The process by which the propagation of radiant waveforms or light waves is modified as those waves encounter an obstacle or discontinuity, or exit one medium and enter another. Some of the waves deviate from their paths, i.e., bend, by diffraction.
This lesson explores diffraction as one of the many behaviors of waves. Learn how diffraction occurs in sound and light waves and how it is affected by the wavelength of a wave. Find out how animals use diffraction to communicate and how scientists use it to study molecules. Diffraction describes how waves bend, or change direction, as they travel around the edges of obstacles. Diffraction occurs in water waves, sound waves, and light waves, but the amount of diffraction depends on the size of the obstacle or opening in relation to the wavelength of the wave.
