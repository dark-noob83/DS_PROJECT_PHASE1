Metamorphic Rocks. Any rock (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) can become a metamorphic rock. If rocks are buried deep in the Earth at high temperatures and pressures, they form new minerals and textures all without melting. If melting occurs, magma is formed, starting the rock cycle all over again.
Metamorphic Rocks, Processes, and Resources Metamorphic rocks are rocks changed from one form to another by intense heat, intense pressure, and/or the action of hot fluids. Protolith or parent rock is the rock type that a metamorphic rock was before it was subjected to metamorphic conditions.
Exposure to intense heat and pressure can result in the metamorphism of previously formed rocks. Learn about the factors that influence metamorphism and the metamorphic processes: recrystallization, neometamorphism and metasomatism in this lesson.
The original rock that has undergone metamorphism is called the protolith. Protolith can be any type of rock and sometimes the changes in texture and mineralogy are so dramatic that is difficult to distinguish what the protolith was. 1  Note that diagenesis and weathering are also a changes in form that occur in rocks.
Rock metamorphosis, or metamorphism, is the change in the crystalline components, chemical composition, or structure of rocks from exposure to intense pressure, heat, or exchange of ions through heated solutions.
