Start with about 40 yards or 1/3 of the spool mono. Fill to capacity. with your braid, the back off 5 yards or so. Tie your fluorocarbon. leader and reel down so that the knot is just above the first guide. and over the tip 8 or so. The leader will probably last a trip or two before needing replacement.
Keeping tension on the line, I begin to wind the reel handle and fill the reel spool. Keep an eye on the reel spool to make sure that the line is filling the spool evenly and fill the spool within 1/8 to 3/16 of an inch from the edge. Too much or too little line will affect the reelâ€™s performance. Once the reel is spooled, cut the line from the remaining line in the package and tie on your favorite lure.
Through your line in the tub with water in it, it will float. Put your line through the rod eyelets and tie onto your reel. hold a little pressure close to your bottom eyelet, not too much! reel as fast as you can and you should feel the water on your line as you reel. Stop a little past 3/4 full. Too full and your line will bounce off, too tight it will do the same in spurts.
6. fill the reel with top shot. 7. you now have your reel with backing and 2 cast worth of top shot. ^this is the easiest way to do it but I actually do it a little different which involves measuring the line out and using 2 reels to transfer the line but I am anal about things sometimes. That's a good idea.
If you are just flicking for flathead or bream, I would fill the spool with slightly more mono and less braid. Mono is cheaper and the fish won't take that much off. For my smaller reels that I use for bream and flathead, I only have 75-100metres of braid. I fill the backing up with a cheaper mono.
I have decided to remove it (most of it) from my spinning reel. I purchased Stren Super Braid in a 125 yard spool. Since I had previously removed a fair amount of the Trilene, but am unsure about how much I should pull off.
