pol·y·an·gi·i·tis. Inflammation of multiple blood vessels involving more than one type of vessel, for example, arteries and veins, or arterioles and capillaries. /poly·an·gi·itis/ (-an″je-i´tis) inflammation involving multiple blood or lymph vessels. Fever, malaise, myalgia, weight loss, and autoimmunity, including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA). Skin lesions occur in 30 to 50%, usually presenting as purpura due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis, less commonly as nodules involving the vessels of the dermis and subcutaneous fat and ulcers.
Inflammation of more than one type of blood vessel. A systemic small-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the kidneys, skin, and lungs of middle-aged men. Clinical findings. Fever, malaise, myalgia, weight loss, and autoimmunity, including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA). Skin lesions occur in 30 to 50%, usually presenting as purpura due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis, less commonly as nodules involving the vessels of the dermis and subcutaneous fat and ulcers.
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is vasculitis of small vessels. It was initially considered as a microscopic form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Long-term damage in a study of 296 patients with microscopic polyangiitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, as measured with the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI), was associated with the severity of initial disease, older age, the number of relapses, and duration of glucocorticoid treatment.
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), MPA, and Churg-Strauss syndrome comprise a category of small vessel vasculitis related to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and are characterized by a paucity of immune deposits. Long-term damage in a study of 296 patients with microscopic polyangiitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, as measured with the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI), was associated with the severity of initial disease, older age, the number of relapses, and duration of glucocorticoid treatment.
Microscopic Polyangiitis. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a small vessel vasculitis which primarily affects the arterioles (small arteries), capillaries and venules (small veins). Since patients with this condition often have a positive blood test known as an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), it is also a form of “ANCA-associated vasculitis”. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA/Wegener’s) is a related condition that shares features with MPA including the presence of ANCA.
Microscopic polyangiitis (also known as microscopic polyarteritism, Microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, MPA) is an ill-defined autoimmune disease characterized by a systemic, pauci-immune, necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis without clinical or pathological evidence of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Clinical features may include constitutional symptoms like fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and kidney failure.

(Redirected from Wegener granulomatosis). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), also known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), is a systemic disorder that involves both granulomatosis and polyangiitis. It is a form of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) that affects small-and medium-size vessels in many organs. It requires long-term immunosuppression. When referred to as Wegener's granulomatosis, it is named after Friedrich Wegener, who described the disease in 1936. As a response to Wegener's association with the German Nazi party, professional bodies and journals have replaced his name with a descriptive name.
Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) Global Clinical Trials Review, H2, 2014 by PR Newswire. Granulomatosis with. (GPA) is a multi-systemic necrotizing vasculitis which may involve any organ system, although it affects the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys most commonly. Subsets include eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (affects esophagus, stomach, or intestines); eosinophilic granulomatosis with. , aka Churg-Strauss Syndrome, (affects lungs, sinuses, heart, and various organ systems); and hypereosinophilic syndrome (affects blood and organs).
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an uncommon disease. It is the result of blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), which can damage organ systems. The areas most commonly affected by MPA include the kidneys, lung, nerves, skin, and joints. MPA is not a form of cancer, it is not contagious, and it does not usually occur within families. Evidence from research laboratories strongly supports the idea that the immune system plays a critical role in MPA such that the immune system causes blood vessel and tissue inflammation and damage.
