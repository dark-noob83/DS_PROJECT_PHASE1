I have Danish geese-beautiful white and sweet. I am in love. They have started laying and having them only for 4 months now I really don't know what the price of their eggs should be. Only 2 of us to eat and I also have 10 chickens @ 1 egg each a day -- way too much for us. I am selling the chicken eggs at 2.50$ a dz. Oh and I live in Manitoba, Canada.

Hi, We had our very first goose egg last week. At the moment getting one every other day but not sure who is laying them, whether it is one or more.

Goose Eggs. The largest egg of common barnyard poultry belongs to the goose. The eggs average 3 to 4.5 inches in length with a circumference of more than 7 inches. Laying on its side, the egg may raise 3 inches off the counter. An average goose egg weighs 144 grams. The yolk of a goose egg is sometimes as large as a chicken egg, and you can use one goose egg for every two chicken eggs in a recipe.

Like other eggs, goose eggs vary in size, so you'll need to use some judgment as to their volume based on the specimens you have in hand. Knowing that a large chicken egg (which is what is called for in most recipes) measures 1/4 cup is helpful when substituting goose eggs for chicken eggs in recipes.
