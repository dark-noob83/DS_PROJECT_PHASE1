Plant. Hollyhock, Alcea rosea, is a summer blooming biennial that has an upright habit with thick sturdy stems. They are winter hardy to zone 3. Zones 3 to 8 begin blooming mid to late summer. In zones 9 to 10, young plants are set out in fall and bloom early spring through summer. Hollyhocks are drought-resistant.
Because hollyhocks are biennial, flowers do not appear until the second year of growth. Blooms first appear in June and continue flowering through the summer, usually finishing in August.
Blooms. Hollyhocks have large, bell-shaped flowers that range from 4 to 5 inches across and are open throated and colorful. Traditionally, the flowers come in red, white or a range of pink hues, but they can also be yellow or violet.
