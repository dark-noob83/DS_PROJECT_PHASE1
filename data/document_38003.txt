In most cases the car at the front of a train is the engine or the locomotive.
Best Answer: The engineer is usually operating the engine consist from the lead locomotive, seated on the right hand side in the direction of movement. The very front of the engine is called the 'pilot'. Often there is a snow plow that is integral to the locomotive, called the 'pilot plow'. Where there is no pilot plow, there are the 'foot boards'. When referring to the front of the train in general, this is referred to as the 'head end'.
The front of a train, where the engines are located, is the head end. The lead end, however, is the engine end only if the train is going forward. If the the train is backing up, which is called a shoving move, or just a shove, then the last car, (or the caboose) is the leading end.
In most cases the car at the front of a train is the engine or the locomotive. However, sometimes the train is pushed from behind and then the engine is the car at the end. 3 people found this useful. Edit.

An engine heads a trains, with cars behind it, and the caboose the last car. NOTE: If a train is heavy with freight, it may have several engine 'cars' pulling it, AND even pushing it from the back. NOTE: There are several types of train cars.
