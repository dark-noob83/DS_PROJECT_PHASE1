At the time I switched to human synthetic insulins in the 1980s, they cost about $30-35/vial-the same as NPH at that time. I switched to Novolog and lantus in the 2001's whn I got insurance that covered them. By 2008, when I was laid off and lost medical coverage, the co-pay had risen to $25/month. 
I was looking for low cost insulin this week. We usually go through Medco, but there prices are as much as my rent it! I can't afford both! I found this website that explains all the details of what you can do to locate a Wal Mart in your area that has Novolin 75/30 insulin for as low as 16.95.

Lantus costs around $120 at Sams club without insurance. Syringes cost around $25 per 100. My copay is 50%. My daily dosage is 24 units. but others take anywhere from a few units to over 100. Some also take fast acting insulins like Humalog which is about the same price as the Lantus. Vial of insulin lasts 28 days!! then whatever remains in it is tossed. It begins to deteriorate in quality. so lets see 2 insulins at $120 each is 240 plus 4 syringes per day at $.25 each times 28 is $9 per the 28 days costs me about $8.80 per day for the insulins.

I am curious what other insulin users are ending up paying for insulin. With my insurance I'm currently paying $15.00 for 1500 units of Lantus or Humalog in Pen injectors at the local Walgreens. A box of pens (5 x 300units each) lasts me just about a month. That works out to a penny a unit. If I use the mail in pharmacy it would be $30 for 3 months or 2/3 of a cent/unit. Of course you need to add in about $30/100 pen needles on top of the med cost. I think the going price for a box of 5 pens without insurance is somewhere in the $230-$250 range.
