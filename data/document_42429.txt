The adrenal gland has a center gland (medulla) that produces adrenaline and an outer gland (the cortex) that produces several hormones, such as cortisol an aldosterone. This page is about cortisol overproduction by the adrenal cortex. Causes of Cushing's Syndrome.
1  A tumor in one of the adrenal glands is producing too much cortisol. 2  In this scenario, the adrenal tumor acts alone and the pituitary gland is normal. 3  Adrenal tumors are responsible for endogenous Cushing's syndrome in about 30% of cases.
any of the hormones produced by the adrenal cortex; also, their synthetic equivalents. Called also adrenocortical hormone and adrenocorticoid. All the hormones are steroids having similar chemical structures, but quite different physiologic effects.
The causes of Cushing's syndrome can be divided into:  1  In these diseases, the body is making too much ACTH which leads to too much cortisol production. 2  Pituitary tumors and ectopic ACTH producing tumors are examples.  3  In this case, the adrenal gland is making too much cortisol and the ACTH is low.
When a pituitary tumor secretes too much ACTH (adreno corticotropic hormone), it causes the otherwise normal adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol. This type of Cushing's syndrome is termed Cushing's disease, and it is diagnosed like other endocrine disorders (by measuring hormone production).
The term endogenous simply refers to the ACTH that is produced by the animal itself (as opposed to synthetic ACTH, which is used for diagnostic testing purposes). ACTH regulates the production of cortisol (a stress hormone) by the adrenal glands and its concentration can be measured in the blood. If the level of cortisol in the blood is low, the pituitary gland will be stimulated to secrete ACTH.
epinephrine. a hormone produced by the medulla of the adrenal glands; called also adrenaline. Its function is to aid in the regulation of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system.
