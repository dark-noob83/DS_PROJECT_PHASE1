Penticton and the Okanagan Valley are surrounded by the Rocky Mountains. The mountains block Arctic winds from reaching Penticton. They also prevent mild maritime air from reaching Penticton in summer, resulting in higher temperatures than encountered in Vancouver. Penticton’s high summer temperatures are more pleasant than Ontario’s, because the Okanagan Valley’s summer humidities are lower than Ontario’s. Penticton’s afternoon humidity in summer is about 35 percent. Toronto’s is about 55 percent. Snow depths of greater than 1 cm are seen on about 35 days each year in Penticton compared with about 65 days in Toronto, 88 in Calgary, and 120 in Ottawa.
The result is hot conditions for Penticton, BC and the rest of the Okanagan. Here are some historic Penticton weather facts for you. Summer temperatures, which include the months of June, July and August average in the high 20°C (low 80°Fahrenheit) range.
