However, this protection only lasts a few weeks so they need regular vaccinations from an early age. Puppies are typically vaccinated at eight and 10 weeks, kittens at nine and 12 weeks, with an initial course of two injections. Your young pet should then be given a booster 12 months after their first vaccination. Rabbits need regular vaccinations too.
The earliest a puppy can be vaccinated is 6 weeks. If they are vaccinated that early then they must get their 2nd vaccination at 10 weeks of age. Our vaccination protocol has changed ever since the vaccine company developed a more comprehensive Leptospirosis vaccine.
How Puppy Vaccinations Work. Puppy vaccines are typically first administered at about six to eight weeks of age, then repeated every three to four weeks until about four months of age. Some of these vaccines might be given together in one injection that is called a combination vaccine.

Drs. Foster and Smith prefer to vaccinate puppies with a combination vaccine at six weeks of age initially, with boosters given every three weeks until the puppy is about sixteen weeks of age. We feel that this schedule will help protect the widest range of dogs.
The number increased to 60% by 16 weeks of age, and by 18 weeks, 95% of the puppies were protected by the vaccine. Almost all researchers agree that for puppies and kittens, we need to give at least three combination vaccinations and repeat these at one year of age.
I asked Dr. Dodds to first explain what California Assembly Bill AB 272 is all about. She responded that the bill was proposed by public health officials in Los Angeles County to lower the rabies vaccine age requirement for puppies in the state of California from 16 weeks to 12 weeks.
