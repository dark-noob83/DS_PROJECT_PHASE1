So it's logical to assume that the newer hosts make between 50-100K, while the top sellers are somewhere in the six figures. Someone like Lisa R may be in high six or low 7's depending on how successful she and her agent have been at tying Q revenues to her presence on-air.
Long-time hosts may make $300,000 yearly, but in my opinion not much more than that. A website called Celebrity Net Worth says Lisa is worth $1.5 million, and that's after so many years at the Q. I think she'd be worth so much more if she made over $500,000 a year. 1jac.
Here are a few more facts I gleaned about QVC from LinkedIn and QVC's website: 1  Founded in 1986 and employs 17,200 people around the world. 2  Broadcasts live, 24 hours a day, 364 days a year. 3  Presents more than 1,150 products a week, with 288 of those being new to the QVC customer.
According to this article in the New York Times which QVC apparently responded to regarding casting calls for QVC hosts, QVC pays up to $500,000 per year for these positions.
The salaries received by hosts differ on their length of service at the company. For example, individuals who are new to the television programs launched by the firm received a yearly income of $70,000.
One of the multinational companies based at West Chester in Pennsylvania that is popular for home shopping, QVC was established on June 13, 1986 by Joseph Segel.
