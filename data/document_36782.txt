Supplemental Pay. In addition to their base pay, recruiters in any branch of the service were eligible for special duty pay of $450 per month, or $5,400 per year, as of 2012. They could also receive a special clothing allowance and other perks required for duty. An E-4 with five-plus years of service was one step higher on the seniority scale, and earned $2,266 per month, or $27,192 per year. Recruiters with a higher rank or more time served are paid more, of course.
Your top performers earn over $100K. A perm recruiter typically earns more but really works hard for the placement as he/she is commission driven. That means he/she only works with the top 20% of the workforce. this is when you see a lot of complaints about staffing/recruiting firms not returning calls, etc. Army recruiters get nothing extra for a person who enlists into the Army, they do not work on compensation, no bonuses nothing. Recruiters do receive an extra $450.00 a month â€¦ to offset the difference from living on a Military Installation and having to live off the civilian economy while in Recruiting.
Air Force. At a minimum, Air Force recruiters must have achieved the rank of senior airman and have served either three years of a four-year enlistment, or five years of a six-year enlistment. Senior airman is the fourth step up the enlisted ranks, designated as E-4 on the pay table. An E-4 with five-plus years of service was one step higher on the seniority scale, and earned $2,266 per month, or $27,192 per year. Recruiters with a higher rank or more time served are paid more, of course.
A corporal with two years of service time -- the absolute minimum requirements for a Marine recruiter -- earns $1,868 a month, or $22,416 a year. At the other end of the spectrum, a master sergeant with a common figure of 12 years of experience makes $3,976 a month, or $47,712 a year. An E-4 with five-plus years of service was one step higher on the seniority scale, and earned $2,266 per month, or $27,192 per year. Recruiters with a higher rank or more time served are paid more, of course.
Matthew Lancey, Worked in recruitment in London and Sydney for nearly 10 years. 48.2k Views. In my time as a recruiter in London and Sydney (13 years all up, up until late 2012), the way it generally worked is outlined below. tl;dr:
A: More than you might think! With contract staffing, you earn money for every each of your contractors work. It is common for recruiters to have a goal of keeping 10 active contractors working at a time and to earn $12 per hour in recruiter income for each contractor. This calculates out to an additional quarter of a million dollars in annual recruiter income.
(This is 1/3 of some percentage of what the successful candidate's starting salary is likely to be-eg. starting salary $150,000, fee of 25% = $37,500 total fee = $12,500 per installment). In my time as a recruiter in London and Sydney (13 years all up, up until late 2012), the way it generally worked is outlined below.
A typical recruiter gets paid 15-25 percent of the annual fee paid to a hired candidate. That means that an independent recruiter that places 1 high paid position (150k dollars) a month will make 22.5k dollars to 37.5k dollars a month. A rule of thumb that seems to work well for recruiters working for recruitment firms is: a recruiter earns (before tax) about 25%-30% of the revenue he generates, per year.
For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Recruiter I in the United States is $53,311 so 50% of the people who perform the job of Recruiter I in the United States are expected to make less than $53,311. Source: HR Reported data as of October 2015. Median $53,311. 
The 25-30% of revenue estimate is also probably a bit lower than the industry expectation, in Sydney at least-I used to hear the rule of thumb that recruiters should earn a third of their revenue - but I was happy with my income, and with the company I was working for, for the whole seven years I worked there. In my time as a recruiter in London and Sydney (13 years all up, up until late 2012), the way it generally worked is outlined below.
