the average temperature on Jupiter is about -121 degrees Celsius (152. 15K) with its lowest temperature at-165 degrees Celsius (110.15K). The temperature of Jupiter at the top … of its clouds is about -145 degrees celsius, the temperature at its core is about 24 000 degrees celsius. Hope this helps    the average temperature on Jupiter is -166° F or -110° C.
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and largest planet of the solar system. Jupiter's orbit is beyond the asteroid belt about 484 million miles or 778 million kilometers from the sun. It orbits the sun every 12 years. In order from the sun it is the first of the Jovian planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
Planet Jupiter Facts. 1  Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun. 2  Its average distance from the sun is around 484 million miles (779 million km), more than five times Earth's distance. 3  The gas giant is the largest planet in the solar system with a diameter of around 89,000 miles (143,000 km). The temperature in Jupiter's upper atmosphere is around -145C (-230F). Deeper below the clouds the temperate reaches 21C (70F). Near the planet's center the temperature is around six times hotter than the surface of the Sun! Jupiter has 62 moons, 16 of which have a diameter of at least 6 miles.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: At the cloud tops, the temperature of Jupiter is thought to be -145 degrees C. As you descend into the planet, temperatures increase. When the pressure of the atmosphere is about 10 times what we have on Earth, the temperatures are roughly room temperature – about 20 degrees C. As you continue to descend into Jupiter, the temperature and pressure increase dramatically

1 The gas giant is the largest planet in the solar system with a diameter of around 89,000 miles (143,000 km). 2  Jupiter is 11 times larger than Earth in diameter and around 10% as large as the sun. 3  Over 1,000 Earth's could fit inside the volume of Jupiter. The temperature in Jupiter's upper atmosphere is around -145C (-230F). Deeper below the clouds the temperate reaches 21C (70F).

Temperature Range on Jupiter  The temperature at the top of Jupiter's clouds is approximately -230oF (-145oC). The temperature increases as you move downward through the clou … ds, and reaches 70oF (21oC) at the point in the atmosphere where its atmospheric pressure is about 10 times that of earth's. Near the core of Jupiter the temperature may reach 43,000oF (24,000oC), which is hotter than the surface of the sun. 15K) with its lowest temperature at-165 degrees Celsius (110.15K).

With an average temperature of minus 234 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 145 degrees Celsius), Jupiter is frigid even in its warmest weather. Unlike Earth, whose temperature varies as one moves closer to or farther from the equator, Jupiter's temperature depends more on height above the surface. At the top of the atmosphere, temperatures can reach as high as 1,340 F (725 C), over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) above the planet's surface. Heating sources. Because Jupiter's distance from the sun is an average of 484 million miles (778 million km), heat from the star is weak, though it does contribute.
