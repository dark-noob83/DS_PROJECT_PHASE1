The polymer used is poly (vinyl alcohol). The monomer has a formula of: 1  Borax is sodium borate, Na 3 BO 3. 2  The borax actually dissolves to form boric acid, H 3 BO 3. 3  This boric acid-borate solution is a buffer with a pH of about 9 (basic).
Polyvinyl alcohol, (-[CH 2 CH(OH)]n-) - PVA can be high MW (about 120 000) or low MW (about 15 000). If high MW PVA is used, prepare a 4% solution by placing 960 cm of water into a tall 1 dm beaker. Measure out 40 g of high MW PVA and add this slowly to the beaker of water, with stirring.
It has a molecular weight of between 26,300 and 30,000, and a degree of hydrolysis of 86.5 to 89%. 3 Manufacturing The primary raw material used in the manufacture of polyvinyl alcohol is vinyl acetate monomer. It is manufactured by the polymerization of vinyl acetate followed by partial hydrolysis.
Applications 2-1 General Introduction PVA(Polyvinyl Alcohol)-POLINOL, is a water-soluble resin is produced by the hydrolysis of polyvinylacetate which is made by the polymerization of vinyl acetate monomer. It is classified into two main groups namely fully hydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed grades.
1 The chemical formula for an ethylene monomer is -(CH2-CH2)-. 2  It has a total of 6 atoms: 2 carbon (C) atoms and 4 hydrogen (H) atoms.
Poly(ethenol), ie poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA, has a repeating vinyl alcohol unit with a molecular formula of [-CH 2 CHOH-] n.
Sample Molecular Weight Calculation. 1  The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means this molecule has 3 atoms: 2 of hydrogen (H) and 1 oxygen (O) atom. 2  The chemical formula for an ethylene monomer is -(CH2-CH2)-.
Polyvinyl acetate (PVA or PVAc) is a thermoplastic polymer with a chemical formula of (C4H6O2)n. It is normally manufactured by the free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate. The procedure involves the reaction of monomer molecules of vinyl acetate by submerging them into water.
