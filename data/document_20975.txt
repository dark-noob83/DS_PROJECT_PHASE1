1 Uhl anomaly: Introduction. 2  Uhl anomaly: A rare congenital heart malformation where the myocardial layer (muscle wall of the heart) of the right ventricle is completely or partially absent.
Uhl anomaly is an unusual cardiac disorder which affects the right ventricle where there is almost complete absence of right ventricular myocardium, normal tricuspid valve, and preserved septal and left ventricular myocardium. It is named after Henry S D Uhl, who first described the condition in 1952 3.
Introduction. Uhl’s anomaly of the right ventricle is an unusual cardiac disorder with almost complete absence of right ventricular myocardium, normal tricuspid valve, and preserved septal and left ventricular myocardium. 1. We report MRI of the heart from a 17-year-old boy with Uhl’s anomaly.
Summary. Uhl anomaly is characterized by an almost complete absence of the myocardium in the right ventricle resulting in a thin walled nonfunctional right ventricle manifesting with cardiac arrhythmias and right ventricular failure.
