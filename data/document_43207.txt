An opioid antagonist, or opioid receptor antagonist, is a receptor antagonist that acts on opioid receptors. Naloxone and naltrexone are commonly used opioid antagonist drugs which are competitive antagonists that bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but do not activate the receptors. This effectively blocks the receptor, preventing the body from responding to opioids and endorphins.
An opioid antagonist is a drug that binds itself to receptors in the brain and blocks the ability of the brain to respond to opiate use. Some drugs used are partial antagonists, while others provide full antagonist effects. An opioid antagonist is often used to combat addiction to opiates.
Opiate antagonists drugs are used to bind to the opioid receptors in the body more strongly or with a higher affinity that agonists which results in the blocking of the opiate receptors and prevents the body from have a response to drugs such as heroin or other opiates.
opioid antagonist, a drug that blocks mu, kappa, or delta opioid receptors, used primarily in the treatment of opioid-induced mu receptor-mediated respiratory depression. The opioid antagonist naloxone is administered parenterally, wheras naltrexone is administered orally. (ō'pē-oyd an-tag'ŏ-nist).
