They feed on honey for energy so that they can generate heat within the hive. If the colony runs out of honey before spring, they will freeze to death. For survival reasons, during winter, the drones are often driven out of the hive by the worker bees and left to die. Some beekeepers feed honey or sugar syrup to the colony when the bees do not have enough food during winter. Here's a collection of questions related to honey bee and honey that visitors of Benefits of Honey have asked via the Just Ask Page. Check out if these answer your most pressing question.
With practice,the quick shake can be a very efficient way todislodge the bees from their comb.If a brush is used, it should be clean and usedonly for the purpose of brushing bees off honey-combs. This ensures that it does not contaminateyour honey with other substances. Also, leaving the hive open toolong may cause stress to the brood and encouragerobbing by other bees. Robbing will mean an endto honey gathering until the bees settle down.The advantages are that individual frames thatare completely ripe can be removed, leavingthose that still contain ripening nectar.

Click here for a list of Alabama beekeepers that will remove bees from inside the walls of a house or other structure. A honeybee swarm is a mass of bees in a cluster usually hanging from a tree limb. Swarms are not generally a threat and are reluctant to sting HOWEVER honeybees can and will sting if provoked. Nature has programmed the honey bee to swarm as a method of propagating the species. The worker bees start several new queen cells. Before the new queens start emerging from their cells, roughly 60% of the bees in the colony will leave with the old queen and that is a swarm. After the swarm has left the hive, the new queens start emerging from their cells.
In order to produce body heat and stay alive, honeybees must rely on honey for energy. Some studies have found that hives of honeybees will consume up to 30 pounds of stored honey over the course of a single winter. On warmer days, bees will leave the cluster briefly in order to eliminate body waste outside the hive. As the weather becomes cool, the honeybees gather in a central area of the hive and form a “winter cluster .. A winter cluster is much like a huddle you may have seen at a football game — except it lasts all winter! Bees have one main job in the winter — to take care of the queen bee.
View the video to see bees robbing a hive and what to do. Make sure your hive is being robbed. Over time you will be able to tell if your hive is being robbed or if the activity you are seeing is something else, such as orientation flights of young bees or drones being kicked out in the fall. A hive can be robbed out of it's honey stores in a day if there are many colonies in the area that are robbing the hive. Also a top bar hive is smaller in volume and a larger Langstroth hive(s) or tree colonies in the area. Larger colonies can quickly take over a smaller colony of bees.
Honey bees store enough up food (honey and pollen) in their hive to sustain them through long periods of time when there is little forage available (like winter). If a hive is sealed up they will continue to live off their stores, possibly for months. There is no real way to tell how large a hive is by the number of bees on the outside. There are photos of what typical hives looked like on the outside and what they looked like on the inside on the Do You Have Bees? page. I always try to take pictures of the hive so the homeowner can see what the hive looks like.
Bees require honey for a number ofreasons.• Honey is the main energy source for the bees’survival — without it, they will perish.• Worker bees consume honey to stimulate waxglands in their abdomens.
