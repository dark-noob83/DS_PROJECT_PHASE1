The second stage of labor begins when you're fully dilated and ends with the birth of your baby. This is sometimes referred to as the pushing stage. The third stage begins right after the birth of your baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta. Every pregnancy is different, and there's wide variation in the length of labor. For first-time moms, labor often takes between ten and 20 hours.
1 The next portion of the first stage of labor is the active phase, which is the phase of the most rapid cervical dilatation. 2  For most women this is from 3 to 4 centimeters of dilatation until 8 to 9 centimeters of dilatation. Labor is described in three stages, and together these stages complete the delivery and the passage of the placenta.
Labor has four stages. Labor has four stages; the longest is Stage 1, which can be broken down into three phases – Early, Active and Transition – before you progress to Stage 2. Find out what happens to your body, what you can do, and what your partner can do before labor begins and during each stage of labor.
Stage One: The first state of labor begins with the onset of contractions that cause progressive changes in the cervix and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. This stage is divided into two phases: early (also known as latent), and active labor (the later part of this phase is referred to as transition). During this time the cervix dilates from about 3 to 4 centimeters to 10 centimeters. With active labor, the baby generally starts to descend. Some women request pain (usually an epidural) during this stage of labor. The later part of this phase is also referred to as transition
Stage 1: Early labor and active labor. The first stage of labor occurs when the cervix opens (dilates) and thins out (effaces) to allow the baby to move into the birth canal. This is the longest of the three stages of labor. It's actually divided into two phases of its own — early labor and active labor. Early labor. During early labor, your cervix will begin to dilate.
Stage One. The first stage is the process of reaching full cervical dilatation. This begins with the onset of uterine labor contractions, and it is the longest phase of labor. The first stage is divided into three phases: latent, active, and deceleration. Labor is described in three stages, and together these stages complete the delivery and the passage of the placenta.
The process of labor and birth is divided into three stages: The first stage begins when you start having contractions that cause progressive changes in your cervix and ends when your cervix is fully dilated. This stage is divided into two phases: 1  Early labor: Your cervix gradually effaces (thins out) and dilates (opens). This is sometimes referred to as the pushing stage. The third stage begins right after the birth of your baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta. Every pregnancy is different, and there's wide variation in the length of labor. For first-time moms, labor often takes between ten and 20 hours.
Lesson Summary. And that's it; the three stages of labor: 1  The dilation stage, where the cervix widens and opens to about ten cm to allow passage of the fetus, or baby. 2  The expulsion stage, where uterine contractions push the baby through the cervix and down the birth canal, ending with delivery of the baby. 1 The dilation stage: this begins when true labor starts. 2  The expulsion stage, which ends in parturition, or the birth of the baby. 3  The placental stage, which, as you may be able to guess, is the expulsion of the placenta from the uterus.
Stage Three: The third and final stage of labor begins after the birth of the infant and ends with the separation and subsequent delivery of the placenta. Minutes after giving birth the woman’s uterus will be to contract again. The first several contractions usually separate the placenta from the uterine wall. During this time the cervix dilates from about 3 to 4 centimeters to 10 centimeters. With active labor, the baby generally starts to descend. Some women request pain (usually an epidural) during this stage of labor. The later part of this phase is also referred to as transition
