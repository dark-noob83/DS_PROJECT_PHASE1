Under normal practical conditions, a broiler must gain an average of 65 grams or more per day. The average daily weight gain is not uniform for each week and varies considerably depending on age and sex. Table 3 demonstrates the daily gains from 1 to 49 days on a weekly interval basis for straight run broilers. Table 2. There is no doubt that a direct relation exists between egg size and chick weight/quality. The larger the fertile egg, the larger the initial chick weight. The rule of thumb is that 68-72% of a small egg must be converted to chick, whereas 65-68% of a medium or large egg must be converted to chick. This can be achieved if the incubators and hatchers are working optimally
Birds are grown to different sizes depending on the market they are meant to fill. On average a broiler consumes about 9 pounds of feed (current cost of about $1.50 or $.30/pound) and reaches 5 pounds (live weight) in 5 weeks. When the birds reach the desired weight, a company catching crew will catch and load the birds onto trucks to be transported to the processing plant. Today’s broiler can achieve a 5-pound market weight in five weeks. Forty years ago, it took 10 weeks to achieve a 4-pound market weight. These advances are the result of scientific progress in genetic, nutritional, and environmental research.
An average egg is about 15 cm long, 12 cm wide and weighs about 1.5 kg. Although the shell is only 2 mm thick, the egg can sustain a weight of up to 120 kg. Source(s): http://www.southafrica-travel.net/eastca... Each is about six inches long and weighs up to 2½ pounds. That's 24 chicken eggs in volume. The shell is 0.06 of an inch thick (the diameter of a pinhead) but can support the weight of an adult human. The largest ostrich egg on record was laid in 1988 on a collective farm in Israel. It weighted 5 lb. 2 oz
Somebody has a shrunken ruler. I have had many Ostrich eggs, and never saw one bigger than 6 X 5. From … wikipedia, on average they are 15 centimetres (5.9 in) long, 13 centimetres (5.1 in) wide, and weigh 1.4 kilograms (3.1 lb), over 20 times the weight of a chicken egg. They are glossy. This is without the shell. One egg white weighs 1 ounce, or 28 grams. One egg yolk weighs .67 ounces, or 19 grams. A pound is about 9 1/2 eggs, a pound of whites is about 16 whites, and a pound of yolks is about 24 yolks.
the average weight of adult men is 172 lbs with a standard deviation of 29 lbs. 35 men were asked their weight and the mean was calculated to be 180. Test the hypothesis that the mean is not 172 lbs using alpha=0.05. Find.
