There are two mechanisms responsible for this compensation to respiratory alkalosis; 1) rapid cell buffering and 2) a decrease in net renal acid excretion. As in respiratory acidosis, these responses occur in different moments of time, distinguishing acute respiratory alkalosis from chronic respiratory alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by an elevation in the frequency of alveolar ventilation and more importantly tidal volume that result in an increase in minute ventilation.
Respiratory alkalosis is a medical condition in which increased respiration elevates the blood pH beyond the normal range (7.35-7.45) with a concurrent reduction in arterial levels of carbon dioxide. 1 Chronic respiratory alkalosis is a more long-standing condition. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO 2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 5 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion. 3  The drop of 5 mEq/L of bicarbonate ion is a compensation effect which reduces the alkalosis effect of the drop in PCO 2 in blood.
There are two types of respiratory alkalosis: chronic and acute as a result of the 3-5 day delay in kidney compensation of the abnormality. 1  Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs rapidly. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 2 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion due to acute compensation. 1 Chronic respiratory alkalosis is a more long-standing condition. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO 2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 5 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion. 3  The drop of 5 mEq/L of bicarbonate ion is a compensation effect which reduces the alkalosis effect of the drop in PCO 2 in blood.
Respiratory alkalosis can be acute or chronic. In acute respiratory alkalosis, the PaCO 2 level is below the lower limit of normal and the serum pH is alkalemic. In chronic respiratory alkalosis, the PaCO 2 level is below the lower limit of normal, but the pH level is relatively normal or near normal. Respiratory alkalosis is a disturbance in acid and base balance due to alveolar hyperventilation. Alveolar hyperventilation leads to a decreased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2).
1 Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs rapidly. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 2 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion due to acute compensation. 3  During acute respiratory alkalosis, the person may lose consciousness where the rate of ventilation will resume to normal. 1 Chronic respiratory alkalosis is a more long-standing condition. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO 2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 5 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion. 3  The drop of 5 mEq/L of bicarbonate ion is a compensation effect which reduces the alkalosis effect of the drop in PCO 2 in blood.
Respiratory Alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when there isnâ€™t enough carbon dioxide in your bloodstream, and is normally caused by hyperventilation. It can also result from a high fever, lack of oxygen, or salicylate poisoning. People at high altitudes may develop respiratory alkalosis due to oxygen loss. Medical conditions such as liver disease or lung disease may also cause respiratory alkalosis.
By Susan Renzo, Fri, August 22, 2014. Metabolic alkalosis is caused by too much bicarbonate in the body's fluids, causing them to become alkaline. It can occur as the result of kidney disease, which anyone with diabetes should be aware of. 
Metabolic alkalosis is a condition that occurs as a result of decreased hydrogen ion concentration or increased bicarbonate ion concentration not as a result of primary respiratory issues. The hydrogen ion is acidic and the bicarbonate ion is basic. 
Normally, these two gases are kept in balance by the respiratory system. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when carbon dioxide levels drop too low. This causes the pH of the blood to rise and become too alkaline. This condition is basically the opposite of respiratory acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic. Overbreathing itself is a sign that respiratory alkalosis is likely to develop. Low carbon dioxide levels in the blood also have a number of physical effects. These include: 1  dizziness. 2  bloating. 3  feeling light-headed. 4  numbness and/or muscle spasms in the extremities (hands and feet). 5  discomfort in the chest area.
