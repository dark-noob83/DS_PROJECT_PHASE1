Considerations. Wall hung vanities come in multiple sizes, depending on the manufacturer. You must take into account the existing height of the piece when you install one in your bathroom. If the piece measures 20 inches high and you want a height of 31 inches, you must mount it 11 inches above the floor. If you want the look of a floating sink with the entire vanity raised 12 inches or higher above the floor, you want a vanity of a smaller height.
A bathroom vanity typically sits 29 inches high. The height puts the top of the cabinet at waist-high or slightly lower, depending on your height. If you have smaller children in your home, this height is just right because it lets kids easily reach the sink handles.
I base it on the client's height. Anything between 83cm - 90cm...(32- 35) (and that should be where the sink finishes, so if you have a vessel sink, the vanity will be lower). Not sure if there are stricter standards in the US... Like Bookmark April 22, 2014 at 10:58PM. Thank you for reporting this comment.
The height of almost all modern furniture-style vanities is 33 1/2, with a few coming in 3/4-2 shorter. This usual height, with 1 granite, marble or quartzite, brings them to 34 1/2. This is about as standard as I can see for a current adult-height, furniture-style vanity.
The type sink being used also has an effect on the cabinet height. If the customer wants to use one of the new vessel sinks, the ones that are installed on top of the countertop, you will want to use the lower height vanity, otherwise, the top of the vessel bowl will be about 40 to 42 if used with a 36 high vanity.
