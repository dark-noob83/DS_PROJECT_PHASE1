To illustrate this information for the reader, requirements may include not only clearly written text, but charts, graphs, diagrams, use cases, and mock-ups, to name just a few tools in the business analyst's box. Your resulting requirements would specify how often the delivery service would run, whether it would run year-round, how customers could participate, effective routes, what to do with produce that is not picked up, etc. Thus requirements unearth real needs and define effective, clear solutions.
Another way of determining stakeholders is to identify those who are directly impacted by the project and those who may be indirectly affected.
