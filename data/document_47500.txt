Cotranslational translocation. Proteins that are targeted for translocation across the ER membrane have a distinctive amino-terminal signal sequence (shown in yellow in the animation) which is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP).

Definition. noun. The process by which protein synthesis is closely coupled with the translocation of the growing protein to the destination within the cell, such as rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and plasma membranes.
Introduction. Protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the first step in the biogenesis of most extracellular and many soluble organelle proteins of eukaryotic cells (such as resident proteins of the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment/ERGIC, Golgi, endosome, and lysosome) [1] , [2] and [3] .
Posttranslational translocation in eukaryotes. During cotranslational translocation, the ribosome provides the motive power that pushes the growing peptide into the ER lumen. During posttranslational translocation, additional proteins are necessary to ensure that the peptide moves unidirectionally into the ER membrane.
