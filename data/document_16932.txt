Gifting generally is a way to avoid estate taxes for the donor and the recipient, according to Borison. That's because the tax code allows each American to give away up to $5 million -- through gifts, an estate or a combination of the two – tax-free in his lifetime. A married couple can give up to $10 million. Both amounts are adjusted for inflation under the 2010 legislation. “I can give $130,000 per year -- and my wife can, too -- and we have not even begun to eat into the $5 million limit.”. Theoretically, there is no limit to the amount you can give away under this part of tax law as long as it is limited each year to $13,000 (or twice that from a couple) per person, he said.
Exclusions. The entire $50,000 you give isn't vulnerable to taxation. The IRS allows exclusions, a dollar limit you can give away tax-free. As of the 2012 tax year, the exclusion amount is $13,000 for each person you make a gift to. If you're married, you can double that: you and your spouse are each entitled to give away $13,000 per person. 
Annual Limit. For citizens of average means, the most important portion of the tax code allows taxpayers to give away up to $13,000 (adjusted for inflation) annually, tax-free, to as many people as the giver wants. For a married couple the limit is $26,000. These gifts are not part of the $5 million lifetime limit. “I can give $130,000 per year -- and my wife can, too -- and we have not even begun to eat into the $5 million limit.”. Theoretically, there is no limit to the amount you can give away under this part of tax law as long as it is limited each year to $13,000 (or twice that from a couple) per person, he said.
Gift Tax. If you really break the bank on the gifts to your family members, you might owe extra money in taxes. You can give away $13,000 per year each to as many people as you want, tax-free. If you give someone more than $13,000 worth of property in one year, you've made a taxable gift. The total value given over $13,000 for the year is the taxable gift. However, you are still a long way from owing taxes.
For instance, if you give your daughter $20,000 on December 17, $6,000 of it is taxable. You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax. But if you give your daughter $10,000 in December and wait to hand over the other $10,000 until January 1, both gifts are tax-free.
In 2015, a taxpayer can give up to $14,000 per person per year without being taxed on the gift. For example, this year you could give Friend A $14,000, Friend B $14,000, and your sister $14,000 and not be taxed on your gifts. Also, another way for parents to avoid the gift tax is to remember that each parent is entitled to their own individual $14,000 exclusion. This means that your mother and father could each give you $14,000 this year — for a total of $28,000 — without being taxed on that gift.
Gifts. According to the IRS, certain gifts are not taxable. These include gifts that are less than the annual exclusion amount. As of 2012, a married couple can give up to $26,000 tax-free, referred to as gift splitting.. If you pay tuition or medical expenses for someone, you don't have to pay tax on the money. Gifts to your spouse are also tax-free.
Generally, the following gifts are not taxable gifts. 1. Gifts that are not more than the annual exclusion for the calendar year. For tax year 2009 or 2010 one family member can gift to any other number of family members up to $13,000 each without any reporting by either party each year.
In other words, if you aren't paid back, at least not fully, it's a gift. In 2014, you can give a lifetime total of $5.34 million in taxable gifts (that exceed the annual tax-free limit) without triggering the gift tax. Beyond the $5.34 million level, you would actually have to pay the gift tax. 
For deaths in 2015, everyone has a lifetime gift and estate tax exemption of $5.43 million, which means you can leave or give away up to $5.43 million without owing any federal tax. This amount goes up every year to adjust for inflation. You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax. But if you give your daughter $10,000 in December and wait to hand over the other $10,000 until January 1, both gifts are tax-free.
