When the time to the peak of contraction of 81 randomly selected motor units is plotted against the number of units in each 10-ms group, we see that there is a wide range of contraction times within the muscle. The shortest time is 58 ms and the longest is 193 ms, with the greatest number falling between 80 and 90 ms.

Motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the group of skeletal muscle fibers which it innervates. Three types of motor units are found in skeletal muscle. The largest of these are the type A motor units, which are characterized by high contractile speed and power.
Now that we've identified the sarcomere as the functional unit of contraction, let's consider how sarcomeres shorten to cause contraction. Sarcomeres within a myofibril can be thought of as a bunch of people holding hands in a line. If everyone in the line pulls their arms to their side, the line will shorten.
Myofilaments are packed in a functional unit of striated muscle referred to as sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are connected end to end by Z lines along the length of each myofibril. Thin filaments attach to the Z lines and make up the I zone of the sarcomere.
Hole's Anatomy 12th edition, pg 287 states: Muscle fibers, and in a way â€¦ muscles themselves, are basically collections of sarcomeres, discussed later in this chapter as the functional units of muscle contraction. sarcomere.
the nerve-muscle functional unit; consists of a motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it supplies; small motor units (more precise movement) [ex: fingers], larger motor units (less precise movement) [ex: hip muscles, bone].
