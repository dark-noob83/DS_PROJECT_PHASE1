Home or Farm Scale Wind Turbines. Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more). Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.
Answer by Answers Publisher. Confidence votes 263K. The estimated cost of installing a wind turbine is $8000 - $10000 for a small turbine and up to $20000 for a larger one. The average wind speed will also determine how expensive a model is required. More affordable wind turbines range from $200 to $600. These turbines are typically smaller, which means less electricity is generated. Larger wind turbines can cost as much a … s $2,000 for those used in the home and upwards of $20,000 for those used industrially. 1 person found this useful.
1 The wind turbine typically lowers the utility bill of a household by roughly 50%-90%. 2  It is not unusual for homeowners with total-electric homes and wind turbines to have utility bills of $8-$15 per month for part of the year. 1 For example, the equipment cost for a 10 kW wind turbine costs roughly $40,000, while a 100-kW turbine can cost more than $350,000. 2  According to Bergey.com, the average wind turbine can cost $48,000 to $65,000 to install. 3  The equipment costs alone will be around $40,000
We install wind turbines all over the US. The cost of a wind turbine is around $1 M per MegaWatt. The turbines we install are 2.3 mW and while running can provice clean renewable energy to almost 3000 average size homes. 
The costs for a utility scale wind turbine range from about $1.3 million to $2.2 million per MW of nameplate capacity installed. Most of the commercial-scale turbines installed today are 2 MW in size and cost roughly $3-$4 million installed. Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.

Total costs for installing a commercial-scale wind turbine will vary significantly depending on the number of turbines ordered, cost of financing, when the turbine purchase agreement was executed, construction contracts, the location of the project, and other factors. Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall, but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.
The cost of a wind energy project will vary depending on the scale, site and installation requirements. Some typical figures for the installed cost for different scales of wind turbine are provided in the following table. Capital cost figures are approximate and include installation costs due to civil works. Planning and feasibility study costs are not included as these vary considerably.
This improvement will be driven by declining costs of wind farm installation, foundations and turbine The potential for cost reductions towers, which are expected to fall by 6.6%, 6.1% and 5.4% respectively in the next five years. In terms of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE), survey respondents expect offshore wind costs to decrease to £122.70 per MWh for projects that reach a FID in 2018 and £111 per MWh for projects that reach a FID in 2023, a 8% and 17% decrease respectively on the current cost (£133 per MWh).
