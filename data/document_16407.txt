Salaries remain flat: $25,500, $19,000 and $13,000 for the league's three player classifications, which means D-League players are virtually playing for free -- and a modest per diem on the road of $40 compared to $120 in the NBA -- although they do receive housing and insurance benefits.
But if we look at all the teams, basketball players in the NBA have the largest average salary of any league in the world. The average NBA player made $4.5 million last year, slightly better than the average salary for players in India's top cricket league, the Indian Premier League.
So that's a little misguided, that average salary.. The top three players on the Heat actually are under contract to make about $16 million (for two of them) and $15.5 million (for the other) in 2011-12, according to hoopshype.com. The rest are scheduled to make anywhere from around $5.4 million to $300,000.
Thatâ€™s just barely over six figures. The average salary of a WNBA player for the 2012 season was $72,000 while the league minimum rests just above $35,000 for rookies. Players with three or more years experience earn at least $51,000. $72,000 is still a decent check to people earning thousands lesser.
Looks like I should have gotten better at basketball while I had the chance. The figures are staggering, with NBA's average player salary clocking in at $5.15 million, $1.85 million more than players in Major League Baseball who average close to $3.2 million a year. Major League Soccer rounds out the bottom of the list, with players making a relatively meager average salary of $0.16 million.
Something interesting to note is that, according to Stein, the per-team salary cap has actually decreased, from $178,000 to a now $173,000. With ten players per team, that's an average D-League salary of $17,300. For more, see below:
