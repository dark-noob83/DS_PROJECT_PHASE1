Whenever airlines advertise openings for flight attendants, the applications gush in. Southwest Airlines recently received 10,000 applications for 750 attendant positions—in about two hours. A year ago, 114,000 people sought 2,500 flight attendant spots at the airline, known for its laid-back work environment. Few people ever get rich corralling a drinks cart, but a veteran flight attendant can make more than $50,000 annually—though no new hire will approach that amount, even at Southwest, which is noted for its relative generosity. To start, $25,000 per year is typical.
In a typical month, a Flight Attendant will usually work between 75 and 85 hours up to a maximum of approximately 100 hours. Factors such as weather, employees calling in sick or employees going over their maximum monthly limitation are among some of the reasons why airlines need Flight Attendants to cover extra shifts. Some airlines require F/A’s to have a minimum of one or more years of service to become a Service Director. At Air Canada for example, in 2011 a purser on a narrow-body aircraft earned $50.14 per hour while a Purser on the B777 earned $67.92 per hour.
On average flight attendants make $35,000-$40,000 a year. What most people don’t realize is newly hired flight attendants in the U.S. start out only making between $14,000 – $18,000 a year. I can usually get 75 hours worth of flying by working just twelve to fifteen days a month. But due to pay cuts after 9/11 most flight attendants are forced to work high time (100 plus hours a month) or take on second jobs in order to make ends meet.
Southwest is a little unusual in that it calculates salary based on a flight's distance and time. After their first year, Southwest's flight attendants are guaranteed at least 80 flight segments per month, which are based on $22.36 for each trip up to 243 miles and 55 minutes or less.

In 1995 I made $18,000 a year working for a major U.S. carrier. Nowadays most newly hired flight attendants make even less than that. This is because right after 9/11 the majority of flight attendants took huge pay cuts in order to help keep the airlines up and running. I can usually get 75 hours worth of flying by working just twelve to fifteen days a month. But due to pay cuts after 9/11 most flight attendants are forced to work high time (100 plus hours a month) or take on second jobs in order to make ends meet.
For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Flight Attendant in the United States is $68,374 so 50% of the people who perform the job of Flight Attendant in the United States are expected to make less than $68,374. Source: HR Reported data as of October 2015. Median $68,374. 
Based on the factors above, the salary for a newly hired flight attendant in the U.S. is $24,000 – $38,000 on an annual basis, depending on the number of flight hours they are given. The average salaries end up leveling off around $45,000 – $60,000 per year. Hourly wages can improve depending on how long a flight attendant has worked for a specific airline company. Or where they are stationed for example Las Vegas. If they are just starting, their pay will usually be around $12 – $14 per hour, and will increase as their experience does.
