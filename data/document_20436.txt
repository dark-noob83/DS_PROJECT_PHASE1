Like their close relations, chillies and capsicums will do best in a deep, well draining soil with a bit of compost in it. That said, I have seen capsicums do well in really clay soils and in sandy soils. The secret to their success is warm soil, mulch and room to breathe. Leave about 50cm – 60cm between your capsicums when planting out, as this gives them space and free air movement. Chillies are amazingly pest free, due to the fact that most pests don’t seem to like chilli. Capsicums can be susceptible to blossom end rot and fruit fly, and can suffer sunburn like a redhead on the Gold Coast! I have to say that I reckon chilies and capsicums are so trouble free, even my mum could grow them.
