In my third year, third surgery, 1st knee went 4 months then infection, Surgeon opened it up, replaced the plastic parts, washed it out, then 6 weeks on pump with antibiotics, 6 months oral antibiotics. 7 weeks after going off oral antibiotics the infection was back. Going in for third surgery to remove everything. Will have an antibiotic block for 6 months, then another knee put in. so 4 surgery's, 4 deductibles, years of pain, not worth it.
