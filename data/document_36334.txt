Peripheral Neuropathy. In some people, leg and foot (and sometimes arm and hand) pain can be the result of neuropathy, a disorder of the peripheral motor, sensory and autonomic nerves that connect the spinal cord to our muscles, skin and internal organs. Neuropathy can cause numbness, tingling and a heavy sensation. “It usually starts in the feet and may cause a burning sensation in the legs,” Fesperman says. In some cases, people may lose their ability to feel sensation in their legs, which can put them at risk for injury and infection.
A common cause of a burning sensation in the extremities is peripheral neuropathy, a condition that can result from chronic diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, vascular disease, and long-term alcohol abuse. Some neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, may also cause a burning sensation in the extremities.
A burning sensation is a particular type of pain distinct from dull, stabbing, or aching pains. A burning kind of pain is often related to nerves, but there are many other potential causes. Injuries, natural wear and tear, infections, and autoimmune disorders all have the potential to cause nerve damage and pain. Many causes of a burning sensation have no cure, but treatments are helpful in controlling the pain.
Various Injuries And Disorders-Injuries to muscles and joints can be another cause of burning pain. Injuries or overexertion in the shoulder blade and upper back can result in a burning sensation, although an aching pain is probably more common.
