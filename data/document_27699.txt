A kangaroo is a marsupial, native to Australia. Its baby is the size of a jelly bean when it is born, and it grows and develops in its mother's pouch. Kangaroos are known for … their powerful legs, and all members of the kangaroo family share this characteristic of strong hind legs and short forelegs. A kangaroo cannot jump if its tail is lifted off the ground. There are over 60 varieties of kangaroo, from the largest, the Red kangaroo, through many varieties of wallabies, and down to the smallest member of the kangaroo, the musky-rat kangaroo.
The red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) is the largest of all kangaroos, the largest terrestrial mammal native to Australia, and the largest extant marsupial. It is found across mainland Australia, avoiding only the more fertile areas in the south, the east coast, and the northern rainforests. The red kangaroo is still an abundant species and like all Australian wildlife is protected by legislation. It has even benefited from the spread of agriculture and creation of man-made waterholes.
