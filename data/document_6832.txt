Compensation Package. A salesperson may be paid on strictly commission, a base salary and commission or a base salary, commission and a bonus. A 30 percent base and 70 percent commission is fairly typical according to the article Best Ways to Pay Your Sales Staff, published by BloombergBusinessWeek magazine. For example, the commission is 4 percent for sales up to $30,000 in a month, 5 percent for sales from $30,001 to $50,000 per month and 7 percent for sales $50,001 or more. Another alternative is for the percentage to be retroactive and apply to all sales once the higher sales level is reached.
Some salespeople may be paid a commission that is variable and based on sales volume. This means that the more you sell, the higher your commission rate for the month. Such a commission structure usually has the rate increasing by 0.5 percent for each tier of sales. Sales tiers vary greatly by industry. For example, a retail store may have tiers of up to $2,500, $2,501 to $4,000, $4,001 to $6,500, and $6,501 and up. Insurance agents are paid a base salary in addition to the commission. For car salespeople, the average commission rate is 30 percent on the front end after dealer costs. The front end is the difference between the selling price and the price the dealer paid for the vehicle. Related Reading: Sales Commission Duties

Re: What is the Standard Brokerage Commission. In the US it is 10%. If you have a $100,000+ boat you can try negotiating, but like real estate, if you cut the commision then a participating selling broker has less incentive to show your boat. So it is all a trade off. We listed our last boat for sale with 8% commission, negotiated it to 6% when they wanted us to help out by meeting the buyer, and finally agreed 5% in exchange for us accepting slightly less than our asking price.
