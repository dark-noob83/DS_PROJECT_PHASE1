Extra glucose is then taken to the liver and skeletal muscles for storage in the form of glycogen, which is ready for use when the body's energy needs exceed the amount of glucose available. The body can only store a limited amount of glycogen, so any extra glucose is stored in the body as fat.
Back to Top Function. The primary function of carbohydrates is to provide energy for the body, especially the brain and the nervous system. An enzyme called amylase helps break down carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar), which gives your body energy.
Insulin Resistance. Insulin is a hormone your body releases to allow your cells to absorb blood sugar for storage or energy. The more processed carbohydrates are, the greater impact they have on your blood sugar and insulin levels, according to Harvard School of Public Health.
When you eat carbohydrates they break down into glucose, which is the simple sugar your body and brain use for energy. Glucose enters your bloodstream and when there is too much, insulin is called into action. Insulin is a hormone secreted by your pancreas that moves glucose out of your blood.
Type 2 Diabetes. Carbohydrates are your body's preferred source of energy. When you eat carbs they break down into glucose, which is the simple sugar your body and brain use for energy. Glucose gets absorbed out of your digestive tract and into your bloodstream.
