Typically, a store will discount an item by a percent of the original price. The rate of discount is usually given as a percent, but may also be given as a fraction. The phrases used for discounted items include,  off, Save 50%, and Get a 20% discount..rocedure: 1  The rate is usually given as a percent. 2  To find the discount, multiply the rate by the original price. 3  To find the sale price, subtract the discount from
Typically, a store will discount an item by a percent of the original price. In this problem, an item that originally costs $15 is being discounted by 10%. So 10% off refers to the rate of discount. To solve this problem, we need a procedure. Procedure: 1  The rate is usually given as a percent. 2  To find the discount, multiply the rate by the original price. 3  To find the sale price, subtract the discount from
Instructions. Find the sales price and the discount percentage. For example, an item is 25 percent off and sells for $15 on sale. Subtract the discount percentage from one. In the example, one minus 0.25 equals 0.75. Divide the sales price by one minus the discount percentage. In the example, $15 divided by 0.75 equals an original price of $20.
To do this, you need to find the amount of discount of the original price. To find a percent of a number you first convert the percent to a decimal (i.e. 25% = 0.25). Then you multiply this decimal by the original price. For example the $22.95 shirt has a 25% discount.ound this to $5.74 Step 2: Find the sale price by using the formula Sale Price = original price – (% of discount * original price) For our shirt example: Sale Price = $22.95 - $5.74 = $17.21 Therefore, the sale price is $17.21. However, we want to find the Total Cost of the shirt.
Stores will often sell items for a discounted sales price. The store will discount an item by a percent of the original price. For example, an item that originally cost $20 may be discounted by 25%. To find the amount of discount calculate 25% of $20. ($20.00*25/100=$5.00) Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price. ($20.00-$5.00=$15.00 sales price). 
If the original price is $P and the sale price is $S and the discount rate is still 15%. The discount is $P × 0.15 and hence the sale price is given by. $S = $P - $P × 0.15 = $P(1 - 0.15) = $P × 0.85. Now I hope you can see what to do. If you know the original price and the discount percent you can calculate the sale price. A little algebra then lets you turn this around and calculate the original price if you know the discount percent and the sale price. Here is an example. Suppose the original price of a pair of shoes is $80.00 and it is on sale for 15% off. The discount is then 15% of $80.00 or $80.00 × 0.15 and the sale price is. sale price = $80.00 - $80.00 × 0.15. You can now do the arithmetic to fi
So an additional discount of 50% off the sale price would bringthe price to 35% (that is, 50% • 70%) of the original price. Thus, a $100item would cost $35 after both discounts. An 80% off sale means thatyou pay 100% – 80%, or 20% of the original cost of the item.alculatewhat the sale price would be after a 30% discount. Then find out howmuch the item would cost at 50% off the sale price. Complete Solution: • If an item originally costs $100, the tables below show the different finalcosts.
