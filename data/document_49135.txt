VAT is an indirect tax, in that the tax is collected from someone other than the person who actually bears the cost of the tax (namely the seller rather than the consumer). As VAT is intended as a tax on consumption, exports (which are, by definition, consumed abroad) are usually not subject to VAT or VAT is refunded. VAT was invented by a French economist in 1954. In this way, the total tax levied at each stage in the economic chain of supply is a constant fraction of the value added by a business to its products, and most of the cost of collecting the tax is borne by business, rather than by the state.

When a business entity is VAT registered, it is subject to 12% sales tax on its gross sales or receipts. Such sales tax is referred to as VAT or Output Tax. On the other hand, if a business entity is NON-VAT, it is subject to 3% sales tax on its gross sales or receipts. 1.

Basically yes. If your employer is to recover any VAT that has been charged on your expenses the invoice/receipt should have a VAT number on it. I don't think the amount of VAT charged necessarily has to be itemised separately though. As well as the VAT number it should show a breakdown of the VAT charged. If there are several items at different rates then it should show what amount is being charged at each rate as well. Normal receipts usually just show the VAT inclusive amount.
