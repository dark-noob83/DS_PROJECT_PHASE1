Arrange the drumsticks in a single layer and broil them for 15 to 30 minutes, turning the drumsticks periodically. You can broil chicken that’s been seasoned with a dry rub; toss it with olive oil and fresh herbs or marinate it for two hours or longer in your favorite marinade before broiling it. Roast drumsticks for approximately 30 to 40 minutes in an oven that’s preheated to 425 F. To make a one-dish meal, roast chicken drumsticks on a bed of sliced or cubed potatoes and flavorful vegetables such as chopped kale, sliced onions and minced garlic.

Best Answer: Depending on the sauce you do or don't use, about 45 min to an hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have a heavy sauce, an hour. If you have a light sauce or none at all, about 45 min. Turn once during baking. If they're boneless, drop about 15-20 min off the cook time. Always check for doneness by making a couple of deep pricks with a sharp fork. Be sure you poke all the way to the bone. I cook mine for about 45 minutes, at 325 degrees. I brown them by putting them in the oven for 10-15 minutes on broil. Then reduce the heat to 325 and cover them.

Baking the Chicken: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake the chicken, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink inside. You can bake the chicken legs in a 375°F. oven, if desired. Increase the baking time to 45 to 50 minutes. Tip: An accurate way to check chicken doneness is to insert an instant-read thermometer into the thigh, avoiding the bone. It should read 180°F when the chicken is done.
