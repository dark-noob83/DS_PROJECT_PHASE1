A nanosecond (ns or nsec) is one billionth (10 -9) of a second and is a common measurement of read or write access time to random access memory (RAM). A picosecond is one trillionth (10 -12) of a second, or one millionth of a microsecond. A femtosecond is one millionth of a nanosecond or 10 -15 of a second and is a measurement sometimes used in laser technology. An attosecond is one quintillionth (10 -18) of a second and is a term used in photon research. See also: Grace Hopper nanosecond
nanosecond-Computer Definition. (1) One billionth of a second. Used to measure the speed of logic and memory chips, a nanosecond can be visualized by converting it to distance. In one nanosecond, electricity travels approximately a foot in a wire. The SI prefix nano- +ž second. (1) One billionth of a second. Used to measure the speed of logic and memory chips, a nanosecond can be visualized by converting it to distance. In one nanosecond, electricity travels approximately a foot in a wire.
So 1 nanosecond = 10 -9 arcseconds. The definition of a second is as follows: A second of arc or arcsecond is a unit of angular measurement which comprises one-sixtieth of an arcminute, or 1/3600 of a degree of arc or 1/1296000 (approximately 7.7 10-7) of a circle. The SI base unit for time is the second. 1 second is equal to 1000000000 nanosecond, or 1000 millisecond. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results.

You are here: Dictionary N-Definitions. Abbreviated as ns or nsec, a nanosecond is a unit of time representing .000000001 (10 -9) or 1 billionth of a second. Computer memory speed is often represented in nanoseconds, for example, 60ns, 40ns, and 10ns are all different speeds of time it takes for the computer to access the memory. 
A nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or 1⁄1000 microsecond. Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 −8 and 10 −7 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds. Times of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics. 1 1.0 nanosecond – cycle time for radio frequency 1 GHz (1 × 10 hertz), an inverse unit. 2  This corresponds to a radio wavelength of 1 light-nanosecond or 0.3 m, as can be calculated by multiplying 1 ns by the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10 m/s) to determine the distance traveled.
So 1 nanosecond = 10 -9 arcseconds. The definition of a second is as follows: A second of arc or arcsecond is a unit of angular measurement which comprises one-sixtieth of an arcminute, or 1/3600 of a degree of arc or 1/1296000 (approximately 7.7 10-7) of a circle. We assume you are converting between nanosecond and second. You can view more details on each measurement unit: nanosecond or second. The SI base unit for time is the second. 1 nanosecond is equal to 1.0E-9 second.
A nanosecond (ns) is an SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10 −9 or 1 / 1,000,000,000 s). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.71 years. The word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second. Its symbol is ns. 1 1.0 nanosecond – cycle time for radio frequency 1 GHz (1 × 10 hertz), an inverse unit. 2  This corresponds to a radio wavelength of 1 light-nanosecond or 0.3 m, as can be calculated by multiplying 1 ns by the speed of light (approximately 3 × 10 m/s) to determine the distance traveled.
