DNA is a long string of these blocks or letters. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (deoxyribose) bound on one side to a phosphate group and bound on the other side to a nitrogenous base. There are two classes of nitrogen bases called purines (double-ringed structures) and pyrimidines (single-ringed structures). The four bases in DNA's alphabet are: 
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: DNA is composed of nitrogenous bases, phosphate groups, and the sugar, deoxyribose. Nitrogenous bases can be: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. One nitrogenous base, one phosphate group, and one deoxyribose molecule form a nucleotide, the basic component of DNA. A pairs with T, and C with G. DNA is not composed of amino acid or proteins, rather it serves as a set of instructions to combine amino acids into proteins (after it hads been transcribed into RNA the RNA is translated into amino acid sequences for proteins).
DNA helicase an enzyme that unwinds the DNA double helix during DNA replication 7. DNA polymerase an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the DNA molecule 8. double helix Spiral-staircase structure characteristic of the DNA molecule 9. guanine Nitrogen base found in DNA and RNA: pairs with cystosine. 10
For example, Phoebus Levene had shown that each nucleotide building block of DNA is made up of a phosphate group linked to a deoxyribose sugar — which, in turn, is linked to one of four nitrogenous bases — adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). So, DNA is like a twisted ladder, where the sugar and phosphate are the rails, and the base pairs are the rungs. The rails run in opposite orientation to each other. The nucleotide rungs are complementary to each other. Wherever there is an A on one strand, there is a T in the same position on the other strand.
DNA is composed of nucleotides, which are composed of a 5-carbone sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine abbreviated A, G, T, or C). DNA is composed of two complimetary strands, with complimentary bases matching up through hydrogen bonds. A pairs with T, and C with G. DNA is not composed of amino acid or proteins, rather it serves as a set of instructions to combine amino acids into proteins (after it hads been transcribed into RNA the RNA is translated into amino acid sequences for proteins).
511800366. DNA Replication. ___________ is the process of making two exact copies of a DNA molecule from one parent molecule. 511800367. Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. ________, ________, _______, and ________ are the four nitrogenous bases found in DNA. 511800368. Thymine. Adenine pairs with __________
Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by the combination of at least two strands. Recombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called chimeric DNA, because they can be made of material from two different species, like the mythical chimera. 
  . What does DNA code for? What are proteins made up of? What are the nitrogenous bases found in DNA? What is the backbone of DNA made up of? What do the rungs of DNA consist of? What is the process by which the genetic code of DNA is copied into a strand of RNA is called? The process by which DNA makes a copy of itself is called? What ... Whic Transcription: 1. The DNA unzips like it did during DNA replication. One strand of DNA is transcribed or copied to make a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The nitrogenous bases pair up. Uracil is now paired up with adenine for RNA. 2. Once the mRNA has transcribed the message, it breaks away from the DNA strand.
All of you are wrong accept for jpm896 because DNA is composed of-Deoxyribose is a sugar, not made of protein (chains of amino-acids) and the phosphate group plus the nitrogenous base (either Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, or Thymine). A pairs with T, and C with G. DNA is not composed of amino acid or proteins, rather it serves as a set of instructions to combine amino acids into proteins (after it hads been transcribed into RNA the RNA is translated into amino acid sequences for proteins).
