You can replace them in pairs, but I would replace all four with struts that have a lifetime warranty. This way, you won't have to pay for the next set. Mine have a lifetime warranty on parts only, so if they ever wear out, I will only have to pay for labor. 0.
Finally, replace your struts and shocks in pairs. Shocks and struts should always be replaced in pairs or, better yet, all four, for even, predictable handling and control. After all, all four have been on the vehicle for the same number of miles and worked under the same conditions.
Â· just now. Report Abuse. Ideally struts should always be replaced at least as a pair (axle), preferably all four should be replaced at the same time. This is so that all will have the same amount of wear and maintain the same performance and handling balance to make the car behave the way it was engineered to behave.
The shocks should always be replaced in pairs (left and right together, see Project 61). I recommend that you replace your shocks every 50,000 miles or so, or if they start to show signs of fading or wearing out. If you push down on a corner of the car, it should spring back with little oscillation up and down.
To me it's prudent to replace both struts at the same time so that they wear at the same rate, but thats me..especially given your car is 7 model years old and especially if you have over 50,000 miles on them.
Why should shocks and struts always be replaced in pairs. Unlike some steering and suspension components, there is no significant difference in wear rates between left and right shocks or struts. If one shock or strut is shot, chances are its companion also needs to be replaced.
