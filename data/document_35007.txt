View full size image. A satellite is an object in space that orbits or circles around a bigger object. There are two kinds of satellites: natural (such as the moon orbiting the Earth) or artificial (such as the International Space Station orbiting the Earth).
man made satellites are used to orbit around the earth. these satellites collect information that can be used for communication, defense, weather forecasting, research etc..
What Satellites are Made Of If you mean man-made satellites ... Traditionally the main structure has been made of aluminum, although many now are some sort of composite. Usually it's some sort of graphite fiber-polycyanate face sheet over aluminum honeycomb, though it varies a lot by manufacturer and application.
A satellite is any object that moves in a curved path around a planet. The moon is Earth's original, natural satellite, and there are many man-made (artificial) satellites, usually closer to Earth. The path a satellite follows is an orbit, which sometimes takes the shape of a circle.
A satellite is an object that orbits another object. In space, satellites may be made by man, or they may be natural. The moon is a natural satellite that orbits the Earth. Most man-made satellites also orbit the Earth, but some orbit other planets, such as Saturn, Venus or Mars, or the moon.
