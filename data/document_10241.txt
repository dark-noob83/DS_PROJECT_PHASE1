Eggs can vary quite a lot. Incubation generally begins the night before the last egg is laid. The female incubates the eggs for 12 to 13 days and the young leave the nest about 9 to 13 days after hatching. Most of us in the lower 48 never get to see these birds during the breeding season as they move much further North. Although they can be found during the breeding season in higher elevations.
Dark-eyed juncos are small birds that are 12.5 to 16.5 cm long. They weigh about 19 g and have a wingspan of about 23.5 cm. They have a dark gray head, back and breast and a very white belly. Their tails are dark gray on the middle feathers and white on the outside feathers.

The eggs are usually slightly glossy and about 19 mm long. The female incubates the eggs for 12 to 13 days. The chicks are helpless when they hatch, but they are able to leave the nest after 9 to 13 days. The parents feed the chicks while they are in the nest and for about 3 weeks after they have left the nest. Most dark-eyed juncos begin breeding when they are 1 year old.
That night I read about Juncos and learned that they nest in tall vegetation on the ground. The female builds the nest, a cup of grass, moss, and roots. She lays up to six eggs. Incubation lasts 12 or 13 days and the babies leave the nest 9 to 13 days after hatching. Juncos can have two broods a season. As it turns out we had removed the tall grass in front of the Junco's nest which was built in a hole on a short bank of dirt.
