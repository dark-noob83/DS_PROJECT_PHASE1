It is produced in the brain from Glutamate (another amino acid and neurotransmitter) as well as vitamin B6. However, GABA does not work in a similar fashion to most other amino acids; it does not become involved in the building of proteins.GABA is also the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter within the body. Despite all of these benefits of GABA, you might be wondering why GABA supplements themselves are ineffective for anxiety. The reason has to do with something called the blood-brain barrier which is a system in your brain that separates circulating blood from reaching your brain tissue.
The noun GABA has 1 sense: 1. an amino acid that is found in the central nervous system; acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Familiarity information: GABA used as a noun is very rare. GABA; gamma aminobutyric acid. Hypernyms (GABA is a kind of...): amino acid; aminoalkanoic acid (organic compounds containing an amino group and a carboxylic acid group). neurotransmitter (transmits nerve impulses across a synapse).
GABA, abbreviation for gamma-aminobutyric acid. γ-aminobutyric acid An amino acid that is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate gray matter; it is excitatory in the hippocampus; GABAergic neurons are classified according to the direction of the cell processes, and signal transmitted/received. C 20 H 32 O 2, an omega-6 fatty acid formed by the action of enzymes on phospholipids in cell membranes. The acid is found in many foods. It is metabolized primarily by the cyclo-oxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase pathways to produce prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are important mediators of inflammation.
Gabaergic neurons which produce GABA. Exogenous GABA does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier; it is synthesized in the brain. It is synthesized from glutamate using the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and pyridoxal phosphate (which is the active form of vitamin B6) as a cofactor. Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate. Medium Spiny Cells are a typical example of inhibitory CNS GABAergic cells.
GABA'S ROLE IN THE BRAIN. GABA is made in brain cells from glutamate, and functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter meaning that it blocks nerve impulses. Glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter and when bound to adjacent cells encourages them to fire and send a nerve impulse. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter and it enhances GABA. Therefore, as precursors to serotonin, Tryptophan and 5-HTP increase GABA action. Theanine is an amino acid found in large amounts in tea. It is why a cup of tea can be calming despite the fact it contains caffeine.

GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, which means it decreases the neuron's action potential. When the action potential drops below a certain level, known as the threshold potential, the neuron will not generate action potentials and thus not excite nearby neurons. Neurons in every region of the brain use GABA to fine-tune neurotransmission. Increasing GABA at the neuronal synapse inhibits the generation of the action potential of the neuron, thereby making it less likely to excite nearby neurons. A single neuron may have thousands of other neurons synapsing onto it.
INTRODUCTION: Gamma-Amino Butyric acid (GABA) is an amino acid which acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It inhibits nerve transmission in the brain, calming nervous activity. As a supplement it is sold and promoted for these neurotransmitter effects as a natural tranquilizer. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter and it enhances GABA. Therefore, as precursors to serotonin, Tryptophan and 5-HTP increase GABA action. Theanine is an amino acid found in large amounts in tea. It is why a cup of tea can be calming despite the fact it contains caffeine.
