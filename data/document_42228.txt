Stainless steel is the universal name for a number of different steels used primarily for their anti-corrosive element. This steel has been developed to resist a number of corrosive environments. It ensures that our workplaces are safe, that buildings last longer and that our food preparation surfaces are hygienic. 
In addition to iron, carbon, and chromium, modern stainless steel may also contain other elements, such as nickel, niobium, molybdenum, and titanium. Nickel, molybdenum, niobium, and chromium enhance the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. The most familiar stainless steel is probably Type 304, sometimes called T304 or simply 304. Type 304 surgical stainless steel is an austenitic steel containing 18-20% chromium and 8-10% nickel. Ferritic : Ferritic steels have ferrite (body centered cubic crystal) as their main phase.
Stainless steel is an alloy of Iron with a minimum of 10.5% Chromium. Chromium produces a thin layer of oxide on the surface of the steel known as the 'passive layer' . This prevents any further corrosion of the surface. 
18-8 has superior corrosion resistance to 400 series stainless, is generally nonmagnetic, and is hardenable only by cold working. 304: The basic alloy. Type 304 (18-8) is an austenitic steel possessing a minimum of 18% chromium and 8% nickel, combined with a maximum of 0.08% carbon. 18-8: 300 series stainless steel having approximately (not exactly) 18% chromium and 8% nickel. The term 18-8 is used interchangeably to characterize fittings made of 302, 302HQ, 303, 304, 305, 384, XM7, and other variables of these grades with close chemical compositions.
In metallurgy, stainless steel, also known as inox steel or inox from French  inoxydable , is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content by mass. Stainless steel does not readily corrode, rust or stain with water as ordinary steel does. However, it is not fully stain-proof in low-oxygen, high-salinity, or poor air-circulation environments. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment the alloy must endure
Austenitic steels are not hardenable by heat treatment. The most familiar stainless steel is probably Type 304, sometimes called T304 or simply 304. Type 304 surgical stainless steel is an austenitic steel containing 18-20% chromium and 8-10% nickel. Ferritic : Ferritic steels have ferrite (body centered cubic crystal) as their main phase.
Stainless steel is a group of iron-based metal containing at least 10% chromium (alloy metals). The chrom ium oxide CrO creates an invisible barrier (passive film) to oxygen and moisture. Therefore the Chromium protects the iron against most corrosion or red-colored rust; thus the term “stainless” steel. The purpose of stainless steel is to provide hard steel material highly resistant to stain, rust and corrosion and resistance against: - Adverse atmospheric conditions such as carbon dioxide, moisture, electrical fields, sulfur, salt, and chloride compounds. - Natural and artificially produced chemical (e.g. ozone).
'Stainless' is a term coined early in the development of these steels for cutlery applications. It was adopted as a generic name for these steels and now covers a wide range of steel types and grades for corrosion or oxidation resistant applications. Stainless steels are iron alloys with a minimum of 10.5% chromium. Other alloying elements are added to enhance their structure and properties such as formability, strength and cryogenic toughness. These include metals such as: 1  Nickel. 2  Molybdenum. 3  Titanium. The main requirement for stainless steels is that they should be corrosion resistant for a specified application or environment. The selection of a particular type and grade of stainless steel must initially meet the corrosion resistance requirements.
Type 316 is also austenitic, non-magnetic, and thermally nonhardenable stainless steel like Type 304. The carbon content is held to 0.08% maximum, while the nickel content is increased slightly. What distinguishes Type 316 from Type 304 is the addition of molybdenum up to a maximum of 3%. 18-8: 300 series stainless steel having approximately (not exactly) 18% chromium and 8% nickel. The term 18-8 is used interchangeably to characterize fittings made of 302, 302HQ, 303, 304, 305, 384, XM7, and other variables of these grades with close chemical compositions.
