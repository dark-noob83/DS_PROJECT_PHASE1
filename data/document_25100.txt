Evergreen species in the taiga (spruce, fir, and pine) have a number of adaptations specifically for survival in harsh taiga winters, although larch, the most cold-tolerant of all trees, is deciduous. The boreal forest, or taiga, supports a relatively small range of animals due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects. Insects play a critical role as pollinators, decomposers, and as a part of the food web.
tundra. Treeless arctic or alpine biome characterized by cold, harsh winters, a short growing season, and potential for frost any month of the year; vegetation includes low-growing perennial plants, mosses and lichens. 
The Taiga is a biome which is also known as a boreal forest. Consisting of mostly coniferous forests. It is the worlds biggest biome. Winter in the Taiga lasts around 5 - 7 mo … nths, with average temperatures below freezing. exists and is an alternate of. Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answer by Answers Publisher. Confidence votes 262K. Taiga is a certain type of forest. Taiga is characterized by Pinophyta division grouped in coniferous forests that mainly has spruces, pines and larches.
Coniferous trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome. A very few species in four main genera are found: the evergreen spruce, fir and pine, and the deciduous larch. In North America, one or two species of fir and one or two species of spruce are dominant. The boreal forest, or taiga, supports a relatively small range of animals due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects. Insects play a critical role as pollinators, decomposers, and as a part of the food web.
1 See more images of the taiga/boreal forest. 2  Found south of the arctic and tundra regions, primarily in the northern hemisphere. 3  Northern boreal forest receives tremendous snowfall in winter; the conical shape of pines may help them shed snow and avoid damage to their branches from the weight of snow. 1 Temperate Deciduous Forest. 2  Found south of the coniferous forest in areas of relatively high rainfall and relatively high elevation, but with longer day length than in coniferous regions. 3  Major plant form: deciduous (i.e., trees that seasonally drop their leaves) flowering trees and shrubs.
The taiga is the terrestrial biome with the lowest annual average temperatures after the tundra and permanent ice caps. Extreme winter minimums in the northern taiga are typically lower than those of the tundra. The boreal forest, or taiga, supports a relatively small range of animals due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects.

ABIOTIC DATA. The taiga is characterized by a cold, harsh climate, low rate of precipitation (snow and rain), and short growing season. Long, severe winters last up to 6 months, with average temperatures below freezing. Summers are short, lasting maybe 50 to 100 days without frost. Many conifer trees (evergreens with needles) grow in the taiga. These include evergreen spruce, fir, pine, and deciduous larch, or tamarack. In North America, one or two species of fir and one or two species of spruce are dominant.
