Disadvantages. Not all tempered hardboard is manufactured the same, with disparities in factors like the oils or resins applied in the manufacturing process and the surface grades on each side of the board. Terms like heat-tempered, vat-tempered, core-tempered and chest-tempered only add to the confusion.
Tempered hardboard is sturdier than other hardboard, meaning it's more rigid and yet bendable, with greater surface hardness and tensile strength.
Tempered Hardboard. Tempered hardboard is the hardest of all the hardboard products. It's made by cooking small wood particles in steam until they break down. It's then pressed into sheets with hydraulic presses while being heated.
Tempered hardboard is particularly suitable in applications where there is a need for extra water resistance, surface hardness, rigidity, bending and tensile strength. Tempered hardboard is impregnated with a special oil which is polymerized by heat treatment.
Tempered hardboard, an engineered wood product, is made from wood fibers that have been tightly compressed together to form a solid sheet of building material. It is frequently referred to as MasoniteÂ® because it was invented by William H. Mason and originally manufactured by the Masonite Corporation.
Tempered hardboard, or high-density fiberboard, is an engineered wood board that, unlike particleboard, is made with ground-up wood fibers rather than wood chips and held together with resins.
