If you want additional insurance for your quilt, they often require a written appraisal to prove the value of your quilt to their insurance company. When shipping quilts, they can easily be lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed. A homeowner’s policy generally does not cover your property during shipping. The policy will cover antique quilts, new quilts and the contents of your sewing room. You will need an appraisal or record of sales as your proof for a claim for a quilt loss. I know quite a few antique quilt owners, quilt makers and quilt teachers who have this policy and they are very happy with it.
The price of a standard appraisal is $45. Show and Collection prices are negotiable. Please contact Ann to determine the cost of your appraisal. It is important to have appraisals done every three years. Each quilt averages about 30-45 minutes. An appointment is necessary. 
Written appraisals appropriate for insurance purposes include photographs, a full description of the quilt, the fair market value and insurance value, all signed and dated by Betsey. Hints on how best to display your treasure are also happily offered! Written appraisals start at $150* per quilt, plus the cost of shipping and insurance back to you. *Written appraisal charge may be more for extraordinary and/or early quilts. If you are planning to visit the shop and would like a verbal appraisal, Betsey would be happy to tell you all about your quilt while you record the information. A verbal appraisal costs $75, but please keep in mind that verbal appraisals can not be used for insurance purposes.
