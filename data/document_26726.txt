An ultrasound test (sonogram) is a painless exam that uses sound waves to check a pregnancy or to get images of body organs. An ultrasound can give your doctor almost the same information as an x-ray, but it doesn’t expose you to harmful radiation. There are 3 types of ultrasound: pelvic, pregnancy, and abdominal.
Back to Top How the Test Is Performed. An ultrasound machine creates images that allow various organs in the body to be examined. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves, which reflect off body structures. A computer receives these reflected waves and uses them to create a picture.
Ultrasound scans use sound waves to build up a picture of the inside of the body. They are painless. You usually have this test in the hospital X-ray department. A trained professional who specialises in ultrasound scanning is called a sonographer. The ultrasound scanner has a microphone which gives off sound waves. The doctor (radiologist) or sonographer moves the microphone over the area of your body being scanned. The sound waves bounce off the organs inside your body, and the microphone picks them up again.
An ultrasound can help your doctor determine how far along you are in your pregnancy. It may verify or change your expected due date. The ultrasound may show your baby's sex, heart rate, breathing, movements and position in the uterus.

1 This type of ultrasound gives a more detailed picture of your baby’s heart. 2  The test may be used to check your baby for heart defects. 3  Three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound. 4  This creates images that look more lifelike than standard ultrasound images do.
