A. The kidneys are located on either side of the body underneath the diaphragm near the lower back. Each kidney is connected to the bladder in the pelvis by ureters (long tube-like structures) that drain the urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Urine stored in the bladder is excreted from the body through the urethra.
Kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine, at the small of the back. The kidneys filter wastes from the blood and help balance water, salt, and mineral levels in the blood. Wastes filtered out of the blood are carried out of the body as urine.
