These are the cushion-like structures between the bones (vertebrae) of the spine. The bones of the spine are arranged one on top of the other in a Atower and a disc is in between them so that the bones are not directly attached to one another.

They have a thick outer ring of cartilage called the Annulus Fibrosus as well as a much softer center called the Nucleus Pulposus.
Spine Basics. Your spine is made up of 24 small bones (vertebrae) that are stacked on top of each other to create the spinal column. Between each vertebra is a soft, gel-like cushion called a disc that helps absorb pressure and keeps the bones from rubbing against each other.
The vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs, which act as cushions between the bones. Each disc is made up of two parts. The hard, tough outer layer, called the annulus, surrounds a mushy, moist center, called the nucleus.

The back is a complex structure made up of the following parts: 1  Bones: Spinal bones are also known as vertebrae. 2  Discs: the cartilage-like pads that act as cushions between the spinal segments.
