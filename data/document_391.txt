HACCP is a production control system for the food industry. It is a process that identifies where potential contamination can occur (the critical control points or CCPs) and strictly manages and monitors these points as a way of ensuring the process is in control and that the safest product possible is being produced. By focusing HACCP on food safety, the number of critical control points that are closely monitored and controlled are limited to those areas of greatest concern. If quality and economic adulteration concerns were built into a HACCP system, they would dilute the focus on food safety.
HACCP is a systematic approach to the identification, evaluation, and control of food safety hazards based on the following seven principles: Principle 1: Conduct a hazard analysis. Principle 2: Determine the critical control points (CCPs). A thorough hazard analysis is the key to preparing an effective HACCP plan. If the hazard analysis is not done correctly and the hazards warranting control within the HACCP system are not identified, the plan will not be effective regardless of how well it is followed.
Introduction. HACCP is a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. A thorough hazard analysis is the key to preparing an effective HACCP plan. If the hazard analysis is not done correctly and the hazards warranting control within the HACCP system are not identified, the plan will not be effective regardless of how well it is followed.
One of the critical control points of a prehanest HACCP plan will likely include monitoring and verifying that feed and other inputs do not introduce or encourage contamination in the feedyard. Requiring suppliers to operate under HACCP makes sense and is likely to be seen throughout the food production process. By focusing HACCP on food safety, the number of critical control points that are closely monitored and controlled are limited to those areas of greatest concern. If quality and economic adulteration concerns were built into a HACCP system, they would dilute the focus on food safety.
