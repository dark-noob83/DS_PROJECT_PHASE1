Total number of births in a year x multipler. ------------------------------------------------------------. Total population. The Crude Birth Rate does not separate males and females, nor does it consider females of child-bearing age. Birth rate is how many live births there were in an area per 1000 of the population in a year.

Crude net migration rate = I – E / P * 1,000 where: I is the number of immigrants or in-migrants E is the number of emigrants or out-migrants P is the total midyear population of the country or designated area. 3.6. 0.2. Total Fertility Rate (TFR)- The total fertility rate of a population is a synthetic fertility rate, indicating the total number of children a woman is expected to bear during her reproductive lifetime. It is calculated by adding together the age specific fertility rates for women of each age from 15-44.
The general fertility rate (GFR) is the total number of live births per 1,000 women of reproductive age (ages 15 to 49 years) in a population per year.

Submit. · just now. Report Abuse. to find birth rate, you need to divide the number of new borns(in a year) on the entire population and multiply it by 1000, the unit will be: per mille; or by 100, the unit will be percent %.you do the same thing to find death rate (you divide number of deaths in one year... 
The total (crude) birth rate (which includes all births)—typically indicated as births per 1,000 population—is distinguished from an age-specific rate (the number of births per 1,000 persons in an age group). The first known use of the term birth rate in English occurred in 1859. According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision Population Database, the crude birth rate is the number of births over a given period, divided by the person-years lived by the population over that period.
The birth rate (along with mortality and migration rate) are used to calculate population growth. The crude birth rate is the number of live births per 1,000 people per year. Another term used interchangeably with birth rate is natality. When the crude death rate is subtracted from the crude birth rate, the result is the rate of natural increase (RNI). According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision Population Database, the crude birth rate is the number of births over a given period, divided by the person-years lived by the population over that period.
The answer depends on the number already in that population. To determine per capita birth or death rates, you simply divide the absolute number of births (B) or deaths (D) by the number in the population (N) at the midpoint of the time interval (usually year). By convention, for human demographics, we use the total number (N) of people, regardless of age or sex. 
Instructions. The crude birth rate (CBR) is equal to the number of live births (b) in a year divided by the total midyear population (p). This number is then usually multiplied by 1,000 to arrive at the actual crude birth rate. Therefore, the formula for crude birth rate is: CBR = (b/p)*1000. Example. In 2007, there were 3,250 births in a city with population of 223,000. Therefore: CBR = (3,250/223,000)*1,000. CBR = 14.57. So, there were 14.57 births for every 1,000 people in the city.
A crude rate is calculated by dividing the total number of events in a specified time period by the total number of individuals in the population who are at risk for these events and multiplying by a constant, such as 1,000 or 100,000 [e.g., (numerator/denominator) × constant].
