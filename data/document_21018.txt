Blood sugar goes up after eating, but returns to the normal range in 1 or 2 hours. A good blood sugar range for most people with diabetes is from about 70 to 150.

A good blood sugar range for most people with diabetes is from about 70 to 120. This is before a meal -- like before breakfast -- or four to five hours after your last meal. Your blood sugar should be less than 200 about two hours after your last meal. However, these goals vary depending on the person.
What we call fasting blood sugar or blood glucose levels is usually done six to eight hours after the last meal. So it's most commonly done before breakfast in the morning; and the normal range there is 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter.
Normal blood sugar varies from person to person, but a normal range for fasting blood sugar (the amount of glucose in your blood six to eight hours after a meal) is between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter. For most individuals, the level of glucose in the blood rises after meals.
A fasting blood sugar of 99 mg/dL or less is considered within the normal range. A person is prediabetic if fasting blood sugar is between 100 to 125 mg/dL. Diabetes is diagnosed at 126 mg/dL or greater. It's important to note that one high blood sugar does not automatically make you diabetic.

And it's less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating. During the day, levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL. For some people, 60 is normal; for others, 90.
