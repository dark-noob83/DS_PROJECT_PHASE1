With this new barrel of oil, the production cost increases from 25$ to 25,001 dollars and the marginal price of a barrel of additional 675 100 $ (9 00 100-225 000 $ = 675 100 $). Imagine a world with 10 oil wells that can produce 1,000 barrels per day. There are nine oil wells that produce at a cost of $ 25 and $ 100 in the 10th. - If the request is 9 000 barrels per day, the nine wells with a production cost of $ 25 are used.
Energy analysts at Bernstein say the marginal cost of oil production, already $92 per barrel, is nearing $100 per barrel. The marginal cost of the 50 largest oil and gas producers globally increased to US$92/bbl in 2011, an increase of 11% y-o-y and in-line with historical average CAGR growth. Peak Oil is going to happen because marginal cost will go too high for the world economy to afford to pay what it takes to boost production. At that point oil production will start falling. I originally expected peak production to happen at a much higher price for oil.
By Kim Fustier. Much has been written lately about the falling marginal cost of crude supply, as breakeven costs for US shale continue to fall. Last week, Goldman Sachs cut its Brent oil price forecast to $65/bbl in 2016-18 and to just $55/bbl in 2020, well below consensus and the long-term forward curve. 
“This is not sustainable. Either prices must rise or costs must fall,” it added. Sanford C. Bernstein estimates that the marginal cost of oil production has increased about 250 per cent over the last decade, rising from just under $30 a barrel in 2002 to a record of $104.5 a barrel last year. At the same time, cash costs have risen from $9.70 a barrel in 2002 to $44.20 a barrel last year. 
As to marginal costs, while it is perhaps formally correct to say that the marginal cost of production in the Bakken has a break-even point of $85/bbl, it is very misleading not to point out that this number refers to less than 3% of overall Bakken oil production. 
So, the marginal cost of oil is above the average production cost of that first 92.9 million [...]. Pingback. View 83 days ago. [...] it is the price to provide the very last barrel required to meet up with desire that decides the marginal cost of oil. In 2011, the marginal cost of production for oil was $92.26 for the 50 largest listed oil and gas companies, according to the Wall Street Journal. This will climb to $100 a barrel in 2012
Tangible evidence of the rising marginal cost of production of oil. Kashagan is one of the world's largest oil projects, a massive project being developed in a joint effort by oil super majors Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Shell (NYSE: RDS.A), Total (NYSE: TOT), Eni (NYSE: E) and CNPC (NYSE: PTR). The marginal cost of production for oil just rose another 7%. Perhaps it is time to buy some smaller onshore US oil producer stocks.

Production cost, marginal cost and price of oil. Today, understanding the evolution of the price of a barrel of oil it is better to focus on the marginal cost at production cost. Rather than ask you a brutally abstract formula to calculate the marginal cost we will proceed with a simplified example to the fullest. Imagine a world with 10 oil wells that can produce 1,000 barrels per day. There are nine oil wells that produce at a cost of $ 25 and $ 100 in the 10th. - If the request is 9 000 barrels per day, the nine wells with a production cost of $ 25 are used.
