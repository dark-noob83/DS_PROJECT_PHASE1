Tenure: Repayment starts from six months after student graduation date. The tenure depends on the level of loan amount: PTPTN allows borrower to start paying loan six months after graduation date. That means the borrower has 6 months time to find the means to pay off your loans (i.e. to find a job first). Loan coverage The loan covers RM5,000 per year for a Diploma course and RM16,000 per year for a Degree course. How to apply Students can purchase the application form from the Cashier Counter at your colleges or from the PTPTN office. Forms are currently available at RM5.00.
If the borrower is working, the borrower should be able to start paying PTPTN and pay on time then the borrower should not have problem with this issue. Call PTPTN and get them to sort this out if the borrower has been paying back PTPTN on time. The 1% interest that they charge isnt even enough to cover the costs and inflation. PTPTN loan is exactly what it is, a study loan, not a scholarship, unless you did very well and had it converted to a scholarship. Please pay up and cut the lame excuses.
