A A. Listen. EDMONTON – Alberta, one of the lowest payers of minimum wage in Canada, is about to become one of the highest. As part of a plan to increase Alberta’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2018, the province will increase minimum wage from $10.20 to $11.20 on Thursday. When that kicks in, only Ontario ($11.25 an hour on Oct. 1) and the Northwest Territories (currently at $12.50 an hour) will pay more to those who earn the least. Saskatchewan and Manitoba are also increasing their minimum wage
Minimum wage workers in Ontario will see a few more loonies on their paycheques this fall. The province announced Thursday that its standard minimum wage will rise from $11 an hour to $11.25, effective Oct. 1.
Ontario’s minimum wage is $11 and the Liberal government recently announced a 25-cent increase starting Oct. 1. But Ryan says although the labour movement has made some gains in Ontario, $11 an hour is still not a liveable wage.
Ontario is raising the general minimum wage from $11 to $11.25 per hour, effective October 1, 2015. Minimum wage rates for jobs in special categories (liquor servers, homeworkers, students, etc.) are also increasing at the same time.
The minimum wage in Ontario rose to $11 an hour on Sunday — a hike of 75 cents. Other wage increases now in effect include a 70-cent hike in the student minimum wage to $10.30 an hour and 65 cents for liquor servers, who are now entitled to $9.55.
Ontario is increasing minimum wage to $11 per hour on June 1, 2014, giving the province the highest minimum wage in Canada. Ontario is acting on the recommendations put forward by the Minimum Wage Advisory Panel to ensure a fair, competitive, and predictable wage system for both workers and businesses in the province.
