Ecological Footprint The footprint used in this exercise is attached, it is one that we developed using the Living More Lightly Profile developed by The Institute for Earth Education and first published in Earth Education...A New Beginning by Steve Van Matre.
A country’s ecological footprint is the sum of all the cropland, grazing land, forest and fishing grounds required to produce the food, fibre and timber it consumes, to absorb the wastes emitted when it uses energy and to provide space for infrastructure.
Footprint Basics-Overview. Human activities consume resources and produce waste, and as our populations grow and global consumption increases, it is essential that we measure nature’s capacity to meet these demands. The Ecological Footprint has emerged as one of the world’s leading measures of human demand on nature.
An ecological footprint measures how much people take from nature. The footprint is then compared to what natural resources there are to provide for people. The ecological footprint takes into account how much farm land, forest area, grazing land and sea area it takes to provide everything people use.
Earthday.net, with its theme of 'Protecting our home' , offers a number of resources to understand and study the concept of ecological footprint. Together with Redefining Progress, it measures how much is needed to produce the resources we consume and dispose of our waste.
The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems, the amount of natural capital used each year.
