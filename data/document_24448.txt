Best Answer: No, you don't need a passport to go to Jamaica; U.S. citizens can enter by showing U.S. birth certificate and picture ID (driver's license); U.S. residents can present the Green Card.
If you are traveling by air to the Bahamas or Jamaica, you are required to show a valid U.S. passport upon leaving the United States.
Citizens of the United States, require a valid passport for entry into Jamaica, as this travel document is a requirement of the US for re-entry into that country.
Save. American citizens must have a United States passport in order to enter Jamaica. Visiting American citizens must also have a return or round-trip ticket, and be able to demonstrate that they have sufficient funds for the visit.
Student Visas. To attend school in Jamaica, you must present a valid passport, a return ticket, proof of sufficient funds and, if appropriate, the name of the person responsible for you during your stay. If you have already been accepted to school, you can obtain a one-year student visa.
If you are a US citizen, and the cruise departs and returns to the same port, you don't need a passport--just a government-issued ID and a birth certificate.
If you are travelling on business you will need a passport. Also, if you're trip takes you through the United States in either direction whether on business or for pleasure, you will need a passport to enter the U.S. Further information: http://jamaica-guide.info/travel.basics/passports.and.documentation/.
Answer by Olive (1195). Yes, now you do need a passport to visit Jamaica. In the past this wasn't true, espcecially for cruises but now the passport is a requirement.
If you hold a U.S. passport, you won’t need a visa to visit Jamaica as a tourist or to do business and if you’re on a cruise you won’t even need a passport. Violent crime, particularly theft, is common on the Caribbean island so carry valuables like your passport in a money belt or pouch inside your clothing.
