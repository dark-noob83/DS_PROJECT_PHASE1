Step 3. Divide the cost of labor by the total cost of doing business to get the percentage of labor cost. For example, labor costs $8,000 per month. If the total cost of doing business is $15,000 per month, you divide $8,000 by $15,000, which equals 0.53, or 53 percent. The employee labor percentage, therefore, is 53 percent of the total cost of doing business.
Example: You have an employee you are paying $20 an hour. You charge them out at $20 x 2.6, or $52 an hour. Or, take the same employee at $20 an hour and add the labor burden at 1.35 (or whatever your labor burden is-in some areas, like California, the rate is closer to 1.48). That makes their total cost $27/hour.
Improve Your Construction Labor Costs. Most construction companies only make an average annual net profit between 2 and 3 percent. Improve your construction labor costs by only 5%, and you can improve your net profit amount to 4-5%. This can be as much as a 100 percent increase in your construction businessâ€™ bottom line! If you can improve your construction labor by 5 percent (see figure 1 above), your net profit will increase to $7,000, or from 5 to 7 percent net profit. Improve Construction Field Productivity and Beat the Projected Schedule by 5 Percent (see Figure 2 and 3 below).
Labor costs should be no more than 20 to 30 percent on a construction project. The cost may be lower for residential projects and higher for commercial projects.
