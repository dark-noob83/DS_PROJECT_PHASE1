While green roofs have been used for the past 30-40 years in Europe, the spread of green roof technology in North America is much more recent. Need for low impact stormwater management techniques is one of the biggest drivers for green roof technology in North America.
Costs for green roofs in the United States are estimated to average between $15 to $20 per square foot for all use types, i.e., high density residential, commercial, industrial etc.1 These costs include all aspects of green roof development, from the waterproofing membrane to soil substrate creation to planting.
We estimate that, at costs per square foot from $15 per square foot (929 cm 2) and up, the first gallon costs (i.e. cost for first 3.785 liters of water) for extensive green roofs (defined as having a growing medium depth 6 inches/15 cm or less) range from $28-$35.
• The installed cost premium for multi-course extensive green roofs ranges from $10.30 to $12.50 per square foot more compared to a conventional, black roof. • The installed cost premium for semi-intensive green roofs ranges from $16.20 to $19.70 per square foot more compared to a conventional, black roof. • Annual maintenance for a green roof is typically higher than for a black roof, by $0.21 to $0.31 per square foot.
In Alberta, a green roof can cost between $10–40/square foot, compared to the cost of installing traditional residential waterproof roofing membrane ($6/square foot). But as more builders become familiar with green roofs and embrace this technology, the cost of constructing green roofs will decrease.
The first gallon cost of green roofs is significantly higher than that of most other urban stormwater best management practices (BMPs). In comparison, we estimate that cisterns cost about $2 to $5 per first gallon treated, and urban trees about $6 to $8 per first gallon treated.

Costs for green roofs can range from $15 per square foot on up, depending on many factors, such as growing medium, depth, and green roof size. First gallon cost is the capital cost to install enough of a stormwater BMP to treat 1 gallon of runoff, and it’s how we often discuss the cost of stormwater management tools.
