Platelets are important elements in the blood that are important for blood coagulation (clotting and prevention of bleeding). The normal platelet count ranges between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter (one-millionth of a liter). Although the number of platelets is decreased, their function may remain intact in most cases of thrombocytopenia. All blood cells (white cells, red cells, and platelets) are made in the bone marrow.
A. Platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. A normal platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter, abbreviated mcL). The average platelet count is 237,000 per mcL in men and 266,000 per mcL in women.
Normally, a person's platelet count is 150,000 to 400,000 per μl (microlitre). But the normal platelet count range in children is between 150,000-450,000 per μl. There is a slight decrease in the platelet count in pregnancy as there is an increase in the blood produced while the number of platelets remain the same.
A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Having more than 450,000 platelets is a condition called thrombocytosis; having less than 150,000 is known as thrombocytopenia. You get your platelet number from a routine blood test called a complete blood count (CBC).
The normal number of platelets in the blood is 150,000 to 400,000 platelets per microliter (mcL). Normal value ranges may vary slightly. Some lab use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about your test results.
