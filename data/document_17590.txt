Another characteristic of chordates is a structure called the endostyle, a ciliated groove on the ventral wall of the pharynx that secretes mucus and traps small food particles that enter the pharyngeal cavity. The endostyle is present in tunicates and lancelets.
Most chordates are vertebrates. Invertebrate chordates, which belong to two of the subphyla of chordates—Cephalochordata and Urochordata, also have a dorsal tubular nerve cord, a notochord, pharyngeal pouches, a postanal tail, and, possibly, an ancestral thyroid gland. They ha ve no backbone, however.
3. They have a skeletal rod called Notochord, lying on the dorsal side of the body.  4. There is a nerve cord that lies dorsally in the body, directly above the notochord.  5. There is presence of Pharyngeal Gill slits atleast at the embryonic stage.
The Urochordata, sometimes known as the Tunicata, are commonly known as sea squirts.. The body of an adult tunicate is quite simple, being essentially a sack with two siphons through which water enters and exits. Water is filtered inside the sack-shaped body.
All chordates have pharyngeal slits, which are openings that  connect the inside of the throat to the outside of the neck, often  used as gills. Their main feature, the noto … chord, a bundle of nerve  fibers which connect the brain with the muscles and organs is  present in all chordae's as well.
Chordata-Vertebrates, Tunicates, Lancelets. At some point, all of the organisms in this phylum have a structure called a notochord. A notochord is a flexible rod-like cord of cells that provides the main support for the organism's body during its embryonic stage.
All chordates have a notochord that is present during some or all of their life cycle.
