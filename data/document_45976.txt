Diagnosis. A mental health professional makes a diagnosis of gender identity disorder by taking a careful personal history. He or she obtains the age of the patient and determines whether the patient's sexual attraction is to males, females, both, or neither.
Transsexuality is a disorder characterized by the development of a gender identity opposed to phenotypic sex, whereas homosexuality is not a disturbance of gender identity but only of sexual attraction, expressing sexual orientation towards people of the same sex.
Definition. Gender identity disorder is a condition characterized by a persistent feeling of discomfort or inappropriateness concerning one's anatomic sex.
Gender identity disorder can affect children, adolescents, and adults. Individuals with gender identity disorder have strong cross-gender identification. They believe that they are, or should be, the opposite sex. They are uncomfortable with their sexual role and organs and may express a desire to alter their bodies.
Definition. The psychological diagnosis gender identity disorder (GID) is used to describe a male or female that feels a strong identification with the opposite sex and experiences considerable distress because of their actual sex.
Description GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER (GID) Gender Identity disorder (GID) is a condition characterized by strong and persistent cross-gender identification accompanied by persistent gender dysphoria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR, 2000]).
Gender identity disorder (GID), recently renamed gender dysphoria (GD), is a rare condition characterized by an incongruity between gender identity and biological sex.
Because this diagnosis was a controversial one, not unlike the controversy that arose in the 1970s regarding the DSMâ€™s inclusion of homosexuality as a diagnosable mental disorder, the criteria and name of Gender Identity Disorder (GID) has been changed in the DSM-5 to Gender Dysphoria.
