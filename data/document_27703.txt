Fortified Foods. There are few natural sources of vitamin D. For that reason, most of the vitamin D in your diet comes from fortified foods, such as dairy products and alternatives, breakfast cereals, juices and margarine.
Dairy and Eggs. Dairy products and eggs are good sources of vitamin D. In contrast with a vegan diet, vegetarian diets typically include both of these vitamin D sources. A cup serving of 1 percent milk contains 2.9 micrograms of vitamin D, or 19.3 percent of your daily intake.
In the U.S., most liquid cow's milk is fortified with vitamin D, and eggs contain vitamin D naturally. A large, raw, whole egg contains over 17 IU of vitamin D, which is 4 percent of the recommended daily amount for adults.
As it does not occur naturally in many foods, your main sources of vitamin D are sunlight and fortified foods. With the exception of fish, fish oils and animal organs, most major sources of vitamin D are vegetarian-friendly.
Sardines. Sardines are one of the best foods sources of vitamin D. One small tin can of sardines will provide you with approximately 70% of your daily needs. These tiny canned fish are also a great source for vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and selenium.
Fortified Foods. Fortified foods are a good vegetarian source of vitamin B-12. These include soy products, dairy alternatives and breakfast cereals. For example, a single veggie burger patty contains 1.41 micrograms and a cup of fortified bran flakes contains 1.5 micrograms of the nutrient.
