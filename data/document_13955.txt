ARCADY is based on three decades of research and development by TRL and is used for predicting capacities, queues, delays (both queueing and geometric) and accident risk at roundabouts. Entry Lane Simulation. First introduced in ARCADY 8, the Entry Lane Simulation tool enables full simulation of individual entry lanes to be performed on existing ARCADY models. The user can quickly see where unbalanced queuing may occur and if lane starvation may take place.
ARCADY is listed in the UK's design manual for roads and bridges. RODEL is similar to ARCADY and utilises TRL equations under licence from TRL.

Junctions is a software package by Transport Research Laboratory incorporating the ARCADY and PICADY modules which were previously separate programs. Junctions 8 was the first integrated version.
About Us. Arcady Bay Estates is a cluster subdivision of 230 acres located on the West shore in the Northern basin of 32 mile-long Lake George about 2 miles North of the Silver Bay Association in Hague, New York.
