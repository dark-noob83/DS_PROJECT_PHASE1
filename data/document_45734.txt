The South American coati, or ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), is a species of coati from tropical and subtropical South America. In Brazilian Portuguese it is known as quati. They typically live in the forest. They are omnivorous and primarily eat fruit, invertebrates, other small animals and bird eggs. Coatis search for fruit in trees high in the canopy, and use their snouts to poke through crevices to find animal prey on the ground.
The principal predators of coatis are other carnivorans. Predators include jaguarundis, boa constrictors, foxes, dogs, tayras, ocelots, and jaguars. However, large raptors, such as ornate hawk-eagles, black-and-chestnut eagles, and harpy eagles, also are known to hunt them. Adult coatis measure 33 to 69 cm (13 to 27 in) from head to the base of the tail, which can be as long as their bodies. Coatis are about 30 cm (12 in) tall at the shoulder, and weigh between 2 and 8 kg (4.4 and 17.6 lb), about the size of a large house cat

The coati eats a variety of different fruits, nuts and seeds, along with insects, birds eggs, rodents and small reptiles such as lizards and snakes. Due to the generally small size of the coati, the coati has numerous predators within its natural environment. Jaguars and pumas, along with other large wildcats, are the main predators of the coati, along with birds of prey, snakes and crocodiles. The coati breeds at the start of the rainy season which occurs at different times of the year, depending on the region, when there is an abundance of food. The male coati is a solitary animal and only comes together with the females to mate. The coati is a nocturnal and omnivorous animal, meaning that the coati eats both plants and animals during the darkness of night.
