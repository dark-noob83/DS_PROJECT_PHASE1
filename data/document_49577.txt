If your furnace blower motor appears to have stopped working, try turning the fan by hand. If it works, the stop/start function of the capacitor has failed and needs to be replaced. A capacitor is similar to a battery in that it stores an electrical charge.
A capacitor helps the motor run and gives it more torque. If a motor doesn’t have the torque to turn the blower wheel or the fan belt, it won’t start. So the capacitor plays a big role. The capacitors on most of residential blower motors are very small, so technicians tend to overlook them.
The blower resistor is connected in series with the blower fan. This means that the current running through the blower motor, and thus is speed is controlled by the resistor value. The user chooses a suitable fan speed by using a selector to connect one of the resistors in the blower resistor pack.
Save. Many electrical devices use some type of capacitor, including a furnace blower. A capacitor is a device that stores an electrical charge. A start capacitor is typically found on an air conditioning unit or heat pump where extra torque is needed to start the compressor. A furnace usually uses a run capacitor to maintain a relatively constant voltage supply to the blower motor.
Remove the metal panel on the furnace that covers the blower motor and capacitor with the screw driver. This panel is usually indicated by a tag on it saying that the blower motor is behind it.
There are at least two if not three run capacitors (one for each motor) on your A/C unit. Your blower motor (indoor fan) will not be coming on. You can check this by turning, at your thermostat, the fan switch from auto to on and note there is no airflow at the registers in the home.
The capacitor gives the blower motor a boost on start up to get the motor up to spped once the motor is running full speed it drops out of the circuit. Hello my name is XXXXX XXXXX will be my pleasure to assist you.
