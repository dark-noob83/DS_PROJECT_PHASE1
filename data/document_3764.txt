Nylon is a synthetic product. It is made from chemicals. Polyester also is a synthetic product but there are options to make it from plants. It includes the cutin of the cuticles of the plants and some synthetics like polycarbonate.
When shopping for carpet, a lot of people naturally focus on carpet fiber and often assume that nylon is always better than polyester. However, carpet fiber is only one of the factors that you need to consider. Equally important are carpet construction factors like density, filament type and twist level.
Nylon and polyester are both synthetic fabrics, but nylon production is more expensive, which results in a higher price for the consumer. Nylon also tends to be more durable and weather-resistant, which is why it is more likely to be used in outdoor apparel or gear.
edit Manufacture. The chemical name for nylon is polyamide, and the chemical name for polyester is polyethylene naphthalate. Both were first produced in the United States by the DuPont Company, nylon in 1939 and polyester in 1953. Production for both starts from a chemical liquid base that is spun and dried into fibers.
Nylon vs Polyester. Nylon and polyester are thermo plastic polymers. Though they have some similar properties, the differences are many. Right from the appearance to the structure, there are differences. The polyester compounds can be thermosets as well.
When fabrics are made from nylon and polyester, the natural feel is more in the nylon dress. But polyester fabrics have some advantages like the durability and wrinkle resistance capability over nylon. Compared to polyester, nylon has very good resistance to abrasion, fungi, insects, chemicals, and even mildew.
