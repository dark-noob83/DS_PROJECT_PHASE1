Preparing the Nest. Before she can lay her eggs, the female robin, with help from her mate, builds a nest from twigs, mud and dried grass. A finished nest is circular and deep enough to safely cradle the eggs and, later, the nestlings. Nest-building takes the robins two to six days. Laying the Eggs. The female robin lays one small blue egg each day to a total of three to five eggs. She feeds on earthworms in the morning in order to ensure that her body has the energy to handle the physical demands of laying an egg. Until all eggs are laid, she may limit the time she spends sitting on the nest.
