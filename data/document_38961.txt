Sear and Slow Roast Method-Preheat the oven to 250°F. Lightly oil and season roast. Sear roasts in a large pan, with small amount of oil, or on the grill for 2-3 minutes on each side or until well browned. Place the roast on an elevated rack in a roasting pan. Refer to approximate cooking times below. Allow 15-20 minutes resting time before slicing and serving
1 Sear the steaks for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. 2  After the steaks are seared, reduce the heat to moderately hot to hot and continue cooking the steaks to a desired doneness using the timing suggestions in the chart below. 1 Your vent or fan should be set on high because this method creates a fair amount of smoke as the steak is seared. 2  Sear the steaks for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. 3  After the steaks are seared, put the pan directly into the oven and roast
1 Place the steaks 3 to 5 inches from the flame to sear the outside and seal in the juices. 2  Sear the steaks for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. 3  After the steaks have been seared on both sides, remove from heat, and brush both sides with extra virgin olive oil. 1 Your vent or fan should be set on high because this method creates a fair amount of smoke as the steak is seared. 2  Sear the steaks for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. 3  After the steaks are seared, put the pan directly into the oven and roast the steaks to a desired doneness using the timing suggestions in the chart below.
Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 500 degrees. 2  Put rump roast into large roasting pan and sear each side of roast for about 15 minutes until dark brown. 3  Add 1/4 cup of water to pan. 1 Add 1/4 cup of water to pan. 2  Cover with foil, reduce heat to 325 degrees and cook approximately 1-1/2 to 2 hours (depending on the size of your roast), OR until fork goes easily into meat. 3  Remove roast from pan and let it rest for about 30 minutes. 4  Meanwhile, make the most wonderful gravy from all of the drippings.
1 Carefully place meat in pan and sear for 2-3 minutes on first side or until well browned. 2  Flip meat and place pan on lower oven rack. 3  Use chart below to determine how long to leave pan in oven. 4  Use caution when removing pan from oven. 5  Handle will be very hot; use oven mitts. 1 If desired, lightly oil and season meat prior to cooking. 2  Carefully place meat in pan and sear for 2-3 minutes on first side or until well browned. 3  Flip meat and place pan on lower oven rack. 4  Use chart below to determine how long to leave pan in oven.

4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 1 hour 45 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour 30 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°
