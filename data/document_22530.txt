Xylem. Xylem vessels xylem vessel: Vein-like tissue which transports water and minerals up a plant are involved in the movement of water through a plant from its roots to its leaves. Water: 1  Is absorbed from the soil through root hair cells. 2  Is transported through the xylem vessels up the stem to the leaves.
Xylem is described as a tissue because it consists of one or more layers of cells.
Xylem is the tissue of vascular plants that transports water and nutrients from the soil to the stems and leaves. Xylem plays an essential ‘supporting’ role providing strength to tissues and organs, to maintain plant architecture and resistance to bending.
Plants have two different types of transport tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The most distinctive cells found in xylem are the tracheary elements, that is tracheids and vessel elements. However, the xylem is a complex tissue of plants, which means that … it includes more than one type of cell. This is why it is a tissue not a cell. 2 people found this useful.
