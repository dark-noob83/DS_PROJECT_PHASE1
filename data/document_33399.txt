Summary of what reptiles eat. Most reptiles are predators which means they eat other animals to survive. But many reptiles are not very large so they limit their prey to animals that are smaller than they are such as invertebrates, amphibians, small mammals and small reptiles.
All adult amphibians are meat-eating predators. Their prey includes insects, slugs, worms, and even small mammals, such as mice. Aquatic amphibians eat water snails, insects, and small fish. Many amphibians hunt at night, using their sharp sight, smell, and hearing to track victims.
Amphibians are a class of animals like reptiles, mammals, and birds. They live the first part of their lives in the water and the last part on the land.
They are vertebrates and cold blooded like amphibians. As compared to reptiles, amphibians have smooth skin. The skin of most amphibians is not water-proof unlike reptiles. Although most of the amphibians have lungs, they usually breathe through their skin and lining of their mouth, whereas most reptiles do not.
Reptiles are a diverse group of vertebrates and consequently what reptiles eat differs from species to species. That said, there are some general dietary trends in reptiles that can be noted. Most reptiles are carnivores that feed on small invertebrates, mammals and reptiles.
Amphibians are carnivores. They eat each other and other small insects. Most amphibians live off small invertebrates such as insects, water fleas and beetles, slugs and larvae and such. Many species are cannibalistic and will eat larvae of their own species, and tadpoles will often eat their siblings when food runs out, though.
