The conifer trees in the taiga biome are referred to as evergreen. This means they remain green all year round and never drop their leaves. Because evergreen trees do not drop leaves, there is nothing to keep the soil in the taiga full of nutrients. This is the reason why there is not much variety in the vegetation. For six months out of the year, the temperature in the taiga biome is below freezing. Plants can only grow during the summer when temperatures are favorable. This growing season only lasts about three months.
LOCATION: Taiga, also known as coniferous or boreal forest, is the largest terrestrial biome on earth. It extends in a broad band across North America, Europe, and Asia to the southern border of the arctic tundra. PLANTS: Compared to other biomes, the taiga has less diversity in plant life. The most common type of tree found in the taiga is the conifer, or cone-bearing tree. Conifers, also known as evergreens, include pines, spruces and firs.
The dominant plant in the taiga is the coniferous evergreen tree. These trees include spruce, pine, cedar, and fir trees. They grow close together forming a canopy over the land, like an umbrella. This canopy soaks up the sun and only lets a little bit of sunlight through to the ground. The other two are the temperate forest and the tropical rainforest. The taiga is the driest and coldest of the three. The taiga is sometimes called the boreal forest or the coniferous forest. It is the largest of all the land biomes.
Plants Animals Climate Siberian Taiga A biome is the type of habitat in certain places, like mountain tops, deserts, and tropical forests, and is determined by the climate of the place. The taiga is the biome of the needleleaf forest. Living in the taiga is cold and lonely. Coldness and food shortages make things very difficult, mostly in the winter. Taiga is the Russian word for forest and is the largest biome in the world. It stretches over Eurasia and North America. The taiga is located near the top of the world, just below the tundra biome. The winters in the taiga are very cold with only snowfall.
The taiga biome is sometimes called a coniferous forest. This is because it is home to many coniferous trees such as pine, spruce, fir, and hemlock. Taiga biomes are found between 50 and 60 degrees north latitudes. The taiga is the largest land biome on Earth, covering over 15 percent of the Earth's land. A large area of taiga is located in the northernmost forests across Europe, Asia, and North America. The taiga generally has two seasons
Taiga: Plants Because the climate of the taiga is very cold, there is not a large variety of plant life. The most common type of tree found in the taiga is the conifer--trees that have cones. Four kinds of conifers are common in the taiga. Three of the common conifers are evergreens; spruce, fir, and pine. The fourth common conifer is the tamarack, or larch, a deciduous tree. Under certain conditions, broadleaf trees, such as birch and aspen, are able to survive the harsh climate of the taiga.

The winters in the taiga are very cold with only snowfall.
Coniferous trees are very common in the taiga biome. This is why it is often referred to as the boreal forest. These types of trees include Douglas Fir, White Spruce, and Hemlock. There are also lots of lichen and moss that grow in the taiga biome. 
The taiga biome is the largest terrestrial biome and extends across Europe, North America, and Asia. It is located right below the tundra biome. The taiga biome is also known as coniferous forest or boreal forest. This biome typically has short, wet summers and long, cold winters. Precipitation is moderate in the taiga. It gets plenty of snow during the winter and plenty of rainfall during the summer. For six months out of the year, the temperature in the taiga biome is below freezing. Plants can only grow during the summer when temperatures are favorable. This growing season only lasts about three months.
