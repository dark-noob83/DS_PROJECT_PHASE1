To find the area of a parallelogram you have to find the height, which is not the slanted side, to find the height you have have to draw a line down from the highest point to … the base so it forms a perpendicular line on both the top and bottom sides. Then from here you just do base times height and that's your area.
Basically, to find the area of a parallelogram you use the same formula as with rectangles. A = base • height. A = bh. Notice that the lengths of the slanted sides of the parallelogram do not have any affect on the area of the parallelogram. Find the area of this parallelogram. A = bh. A = (5)(2). A = 10 u^2
Given the base and height of a parallelogram, we can find the area. Given the area of a parallelogram and either the base or the height, we can find the missing dimension. The formula for area of a parallelogram is: where is the base, is the height, and · means multiply.
The area of a parallelogram is given by the product of the base and the height. That is, areas of parallelograms can be expressed as. where A represents the area, b is the base, and h is the height. Let's practice using this formula by doing the exercise below.
= 6 cm. Summary: Given the base and height of a parallelogram, we can find the area. Given the area of a parallelogram and either the base or the height, we can find the missing dimension. The formula for area of a parallelogram is: where is the base, is the height, and · means multiply.
For a parallelogram that is NOT a rectangle or square (i.e. a rhombus or rhomboid), multiply the base times the height. Draw a line through the parallelogram so that it is a l … arge rectangle in the middle, and two small triangles to each side.
