Authorities differ in what they consider a phylum, and in the actual name of the phylum. Despite this, there is agreement on most phyla. Most modern surveys include groups above the phylum: superphyletic groupings based on evidence of common descent. Differences of opinion about evolutionary relationships have been reduced by the use of molecular evolution and molecular clock research.
General characteristics of the Kingdom Animalia are as follows: Animals are eukaryotic, multicellular and heterotrophic organisms. They have multiple cells with mitochondria and they depend on other organisms for food. Habitat-Most of the animals inhabit seas, fewer are seen in fresh water and even fewer on land.
List of animal phyla is a list of the major groups of animals usually classified as a phylum.
All animals are members of the Kingdom Animalia, also called Metazoa. This Kingdom does not contain the prokaryotes (Kingdom Monera, includes bacteria, blue-green algae) or th … e protists (Kingdom Protista, includes unicellular eukaryotic organisms).
The Kingdom Animalia is characterized by eukaryotic and heterotrophic organisms. They are multicellular and lack cell wall. They depend directly or indirectly of plants for their food. Food is ingested and digested in their internal cavity and food reserves are stored as glycogen or fat.
This process, called taxonomy, has a specific order, which … is as follows: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. To answer your question, standard US scientific textbooks state that there are six different Kingdoms. The six Kingdoms are Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Moneran, and Bacteria.
By Phil Myers. All animals are members of the Kingdom Animalia, also called Metazoa. This Kingdom does not contain prokaryotes (Kingdom Monera, includes bacteria, blue-green algae) or protists (Kingdom Protista, includes unicellular eukaryotic organisms).
