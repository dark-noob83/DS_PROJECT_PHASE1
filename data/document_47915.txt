Every planet in the solar system has its own rotation time. Earth’s solar day and sidereal day are nearly the same, but some other planets are very different. Mercury’s sidereal day is equivalent to 59 days, but its solar day is 176 days!
Mercury, the first planet in our solar system can completely orbit around the sun in a mere 88 Earth Days, but nearly takes 60 days to complete a turn of its axis. Venus, which is the closet planet to Earth, takes 224 days to orbit around the sun.
Uranus as seen by NASA’s Voyager 2. Credit: NASA/JPL. Uranus, which takes its name from the Greek God of the sky, is a gas giant and the seventh planet from our Sun. It is also the third largest planet in our Solar System, ranking behind Jupiter and Saturn.
Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in our Solar System rotating on average once in just under 10 hours. That is very fast especially considering how large Jupiter is. This means that Jupiter has the shortest days of all the planets in the Solar System. Since Jupiter is a gas planet, it does not rotate as a solid sphere. Jupiter's equator rotates a bit faster than its polar regions at a speed of 28,273 miles/hour (about 43,000 kilometers/hour). Jupiter's day varies from 9 hours and 56 minutes around the poles to 9 hours and 50 minutes close to the equator.
Mercury circles the Sun in only 88 days, compared to 365 days for Earth, at at an average speed of 105,947 miles (170,505 kilometers) per hour. This is faster than any other planet in the Solar System. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 2  Learn how.
Uranus has a radius of 25,500 km, and a mass of 14.5 Earth's. It has a density similar to Jupiter: 1.27 gm/cm 3. It also spins rapidly, and has a day of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This is the internal rotation period, the cloud layers rotate in about 14 hours.
