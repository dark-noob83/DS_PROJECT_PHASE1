To perform a Babality on Shao Kahn, you must play the game on Medium or higher difficulty, not use continues, and perform a Babality on every single opponent on the Arcade Ladder, including Shang Tsung and Goro/Kintaro.
To do this, you must perform a Babality to end every match. If you do a Babality on Shang Tsung. You will automatically do one on Kintaro and Goro, but to get the big man himself. You must do one on EVERYONE.
Yes it is. You need to be playing on Medium or higher difficulty, and you have to perform a Babality on every single character on the ladder, from Match 1 to Shang Tsung. Once you do that, you'll automatically Babality the bosses after you beat them.
Goro, Kintaro and Shao Kahn are supposed to be unplayable. You can pretty much only do it in the Challenge Tower or by Shang's Soul Steal move. Yet many fans want them playable, so the MK team might reconsider and make some kind of patch to make them playable.
5 Comments. In Mortal Kombat 9 (2011 version) for the PS3 and Xbox 360, even Shao Kahn has a babality animation, but you’re going to need a lot of skill to pull this one off. To perform a Babality on Shao Kahn, you must play the game on Medium or higher difficulty. You can’t use any continues, and you must have performed a babality on every opponent you fought in the Arcade Ladder including Shang Tsung and Goro / Kintaro.
To perform a Babality on Kintaro, you must play the game on Medium or higher difficulty, not use continues, and perform a Babality on Shang Tsung in his base form (not transformed). Then you cannot block on the winning round against Kintaro.
