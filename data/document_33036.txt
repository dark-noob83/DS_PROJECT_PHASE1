But there’s another value listed: how much energy you actually used. If you are a perfectly average American living in a perfectly average household, your monthly electricity bill will read 903 kilowatt hours (kWh), which costs $107, per household.
When we look at how much the average person is spending directly on energy each year, we focus on energy expenditures in the residential and transportation sectors. Energy in these two sectors is primarily in the form of gasoline, heating fuel and electricity.
Depending on whether a state is hot or cold, urban or rural, an average household can use as little as 531 kWh a month (Maine) or as much as 1,245 kWh (Louisiana). Costs vary state-by-state, too. Hawaiians pay the most for electricity ($203 a month) and New Mexicans pay the least ($75 a month).
Since we can convert between kilocalories (kcal) and Btu, and we know that the average American consumes 149 million Btu -- or 37 million kcal -- a year in residential and transportation-related energy, we know that they consume the equivalent of about 31,000 burritos in energy each year, per capita.
The average toilet flush is about 3.5 gallons. The average person will flush the toilet about 5 times per day or 17.5 gallons. The average dishwasher uses about 30 gallons of water per day. The average clothes washer uses about 5 gallons per load, or 10 gallons per week, or 1.3 gallons per day. The average person drinks about 20 ounces of water a day, or about 1/4 gallon. The average amount of water used per person to cook is about 1 gallon per day. Add these all up and you get about 44 gallons per day. (dishwasher total is for two people) so average of 15 gallons per day per person.).
By comparison, the average person needs to eat the equivalent of about 600 burritos each year to maintain their weight. This means that, every day, transportation and residential energy needs are 50 times as energy demanding as your body’s energy needs (also known as your metabolism).
