Comments. According to a report released this morning by IBM and the Ponemon Institute, the per-record cost of a data breach reached $154 this year, up 12 percent from last year's $145. In addition, the average total cost of a single data breach rose 23 percent to $3.79 million. If there were lost or stolen devices, costs increased by an average of $9 per record. And the single biggest factor was if a third party was involved in the cause of a breach. That increased the average per-record cost by $16, from $154 to $170.
1 The cost of data breach varies by industry. 2  The average global cost of data breach per lost or stolen record is $154. 3  However, if a healthcare organization has a breach, the average cost could be as high as $363, and in education the average cost could be as high as $300. Healthcare emerged as the industry with the highest cost per stolen record with the average cost for organizations reaching as high as $363. Additionally, retailers have seen their average cost per stolen record jump dramatically from $105 last year to $165 in this year's study.
Meanwhile, the average total cost of a data breach worldwide jumped a whopping 23% in 2014 -- to $3.8 million, and the average cost of a stolen record containing sensitive information increased from $145 to $154, an increase of more than 6%. The problem is they're being used for both, Barlow says. In the US, the cost per stolen record is $217 and in Germany, $211. The total cost of a data breach is an average of $6.5 million in the US and $4.9 million in Germany. Brazil and India were on the other end of the spectrum, with the average cost per record at $78 in Brazil and $56 in India. The average cost of a breach to an organization in Brazil was $1.8 million and in India, $1.5 million
Comments. The cost of a data breach rose last year to $204 per customer record, according to the Ponemon Institute. The average total cost of a data breach rose from $6.65 million in 2008 to $6.75 million in 2009. The management skills of the CISO, or an individual in an equivalent position, seemed to help hold down the cost of a data breach: The average per capita cost of an incident was $157 per record for companies with a CISO, versus $236 for companies without one.

IBM is proud to sponsor the tenth annual Cost of Data Breach Study, the industry’s gold-standard benchmark research independently conducted by Ponemon Institute. The study found the average consolidated total cost of a data breach is $3.8 million representing a 23% increase since 2013. The study also reports that the cost incurred for each lost or stolen record containing sensitive and confidential information increased six percent from a consolidated average of $145 to $154. 
1 The most costly breaches continue to occur in the U.S. and Germany at $217 and $211 per compromised record, respectively. 2  India and Brazil still have the least expensive breaches at $56 and $78, respectively. 3  The cost of data breach varies by industry. Healthcare emerged as the industry with the highest cost per stolen record with the average cost for organizations reaching as high as $363. Additionally, retailers have seen their average cost per stolen record jump dramatically from $105 last year to $165 in this year's study.
According the Ponemon Cost of Data Breach Study report German and US entities experienced the higher costs at $195 and $201, respectively. Both countries paid the highest value per compromised record for data breach caused by malicious and criminal attacks, nearly $246 and $215 record. “Malicious attacks are more costly globally. Figure 6 reports the per capita cost of data breach for three root causes of the breach incident on a consolidated basis. These results show data breaches due to malicious or criminal attacks cost companies increased from and average of $157 in last year’s study to $159.
