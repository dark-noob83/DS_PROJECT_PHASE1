Classifying Organisms in their Kingdoms. The Kingdom Eubacteria consists of mostly heterotrophic bacteria that come in three main shapes. They are cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod shaped-as shown above), and spirilla (corkscrew shape). This kingdom is one of the two prokaryotic kingdoms. Bacteria in this kingdom have cell walls made without peptidoglycan.
Eubacteria is the first on the list of the kingdoms, making it the least complex. They are prokaryotic, and can move in three different ways with: flagella, cilia, or by pseudopodia.
Bacteria: The Monera Kingdom Bacteria are classified into two groups: Eubacteria (true bacteria) and Archaebacteria (Ancient Bacteria). They are autotrophic. 28-1 Chapter 28: Microbiology. 28-2 Viruses Viruses are noncellular, nonliving particles and therefore are not included in the classification scheme.
The Six Kingdoms. When Linnaeus developed his system of classification, there were only two kingdoms, Plants and Animals. But the use of the microscope led to the discovery of new organisms and the identification of differences in cells. A two-kingdom system was no longer useful. Today the system of classification includes six kingdoms.
