1 On average, the cost may vary depending on location, the mechanic/repair shop and kind of vehicle. 2  Most people pay anywhere from $250 to $375. 3  Each rotor can cost $30 to $55 each, depending on the mechanic.
The rotors wear out every time brakes are applied. The rate of wear and tear of the rotors depend on factors such as the type of brake pads, the quality of castings, how the rotors cool, the kind of driving the vehicle is subjected to and exposure to road salt and moisture.
You can take the rotors off yourself and have your local auto parts store true them for you, probably about $35 for both. But, thanks to our Comrades in China you can buy aftermarket replacement brake rotors pretty cheap these days! Update. Thank you so much Austin!
