Vertical and horizontal asymptotes vertical and oblique asymptotes vertical and horizontal asymptotes How to find asymptotes Vertical: 1. Reduce f(x) to the lowest terms: (i) factor completely the numerator and the denominator; (ii) cancel common factors 2. Solve the equation: denominator = 0 3. 
Then the full answer is: domain: vertical asymptotes: x = 3/2 horizontal asymptote: y = 1/4 slant asymptote: none. A given rational function may or may not have a vertical asymptote (depending upon whether the denominator ever equals zero), but it will always have either a horizontal or else a slant asymptote. x2 + 9 = 0 x2 = 9. Oops! This has no solution. Since the denominator has no zeroes, then there are no vertical asymptotes and the domain is all x . Since the degree is greater in the denominator than in the numerator, the y-values will be dragged down to the x-axis, and the horizontal asymptote is therefore  y = 0 .
Horizontal Asymptotes. A horizontal line is an asymptote only to the far left and the far right of the graph. Far left or far right is defined as anything past the vertical asymptotes or x-intercepts. Horizontal asymptotes are not asymptotic in the middle. It is okay to cross a horizontal asymptote in the middle. 
The vertical asymptotes will occur at those values of x for which the denominatoris equal to zero:x 1 = 0x = 1Thus, the graph will have a vertical asymptote at x = 1.To nd the horizontal asymptote, we note that the degree of the numerator is two and thedegree of the denominator is one. Since the larger degree occurs in the denominator, thegraph will have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 (i.e., the x-axis).The graph of f(x) =3x+ 1x 2 4is given below:Notice the graph shows the following limits:1. lim x! 2 f(x) = 12. lim x! 2 + f(x) = 13.
Write rational functions given their characteristics such as vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, x intercepts, hole. Problem 1: Write a rational function f that has a vertical asymptote at x = 2, a horizontal asymptote y = 3 and a zero at x = - 5. Solution to Problem 1: 1  Since f has a vertical is at x = 2, then the denominator of the rational function contains the term (x - 2). 2  Function f has the form. 3  f(x) = g(x) / (x - 2). 4  g(x) which is in the numerator must be of the same degree as the denominator since f has a horizontal asymptote.
domain: vertical asymptotes: x = 2 horizontal asymptote: none slant asymptote: y = x + 1. When you go to graph the function in this last example, you can draw the line right on the slant asymptote, but you will need to leave a nice open dot where x = 2, to indicate that this point is not actually included in the graph. x2 + 9 = 0 x2 = 9. Oops! This has no solution. Since the denominator has no zeroes, then there are no vertical asymptotes and the domain is all x . Since the degree is greater in the denominator than in the numerator, the y-values will be dragged down to the x-axis, and the horizontal asymptote is therefore  y = 0 .
x 2 4.Solution. The vertical asymptotes will occur at those values of x for which the denominatoris equal to zero:x 2 4 = 0x 2 = 4x = 2Thus, the graph will have vertical asymptotes at x = 2 and x = 2.To nd the horizontal asymptote, we note that the degree of the numerator is one and thedegree of the denominator is two. Since the larger degree occurs in the denominator, thegraph will have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 (i.e., the x-axis).The graph of f(x) =3x+ 1x 2 4is given below:Notice the graph shows the following limits:1. lim x! 2 f(x) = 12. lim x! 2 + f(x) = 13.
An asymptote is, essentially, a line that a graph approaches, but does not intersect. For example, in the following graph of y=1/x, the line approaches the x-axis (y=0), but never touches it. No matter how far we go into infinity, the line will not actually reach y=0, but will always get closer and closer. y=1/x: This means that the line y=0 is a horizontal asymptote. Horizontal asymptotes occur most often when the function is a fraction where the top remains positive, but the bottom goes to infinity. Going back to the previous example, y=1/x is a fraction. When we go out to infinity on the x-axis, the top of the fraction remains 1, but the bottom gets bigger and bigger. 
Problem 4: Write a rational function f with a slant asymptote y = x + 4, a vertical asymptote at x = 5 and one of the zeros at x = 2. Solution to Problem 4: 1  The graph of f has a slant asymptote y = x + 4 and a vertical asymptote at x = 5, hence f(x) may be written as follows. 2  f(x) = (x + 4) + a / (x - 5). Solution to Problem 1: 1  Since f has a vertical is at x = 2, then the denominator of the rational function contains the term (x - 2). 2  Function f has the form. 3  f(x) = g(x) / (x - 2). 4  g(x) which is in the numerator must be of the same degree as the denominator since f has a horizontal asymptote.
