Essentially Double Natting is what happens when you place your computer behind a NAT router which is itself, behind another NAT router.
Hi !!!! This is must due to the Double Natting. Yes you can turn off NAT in your secondary Router and the Main Router's Router will act as DHCP server assigning static ip to the clients connected to it.. On the secondary router, you can assign static ip in the Range of the First router and then disable NAT.
The NAT mechanism (natting) is a router feature, and is often part of a corporate firewall. NAT gateways can map IP addresses in several ways: 1  From a local IP address to one global IP address statically; 2  From a local IP address to any of a rotating pool of global IP addresses a company may have;
NAT gateways sit between two networks, the inside network and the outside network. Systems on the inside network are typically assigned IP addresses that cannot be routed to external networks (e.g., networks in the 10.0.0.0/8 block). A few externally valid IP addresses are assigned to the gateway.
Best Answer: NAT = Network Address Translation It refers to taking an address off one network and translating it to addresses on another. The most common use is to share an internet connection. So you take a public address like 24.153.178.222 and translate it to the locale computers on 192.168.11.XXX.
Tweet. Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process where a network device, usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer (or group of computers) inside a private network.
The Remedy. To check for double NAT on your network, log into your router and look up the IP address of its WAN port. If you see an address in the 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x range (both of which are private) it means that the device your router's WAN port connects to is doing NAT, and hence, you're dealing with double NAT.
