2) You can not access a non static variable inside any static method in Java, but reverse is fine i.e. you can access static variables or call static method from a non static method without any compile time error.
Let's see couple of differences between static and non static method in Java programming language, which is enforced by language itself. 1) I think first and foremost difference between them is that you can call static method without creating any object e.g. Collections.sort() .
Java static method. Java static method program: static methods in Java can be called without creating an object of class. Have you noticed why we write static keyword when defining main it's because program execution begins from main and no object has been created yet.
A static method in Java belongs to class, which means you can call that method by using class name e.g. Arrays.equals() , you don't need to create any object to access these method, which is what you need to do to access non static method of a class.
static method. 1  It is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object (instance). 2  A static method can access only static data. 3  It can not access non-static data (instance variables). 4  A static method can call only other static methods and can not call a non-static method from it.
