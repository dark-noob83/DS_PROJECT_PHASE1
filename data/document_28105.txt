The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons' starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit's load.
Shock Protection. Grounding means linking an electrical circuit to the ground and works on the principal that the earth is a handy conductor of electricity. The grounding of electrical devices and appliances protects those who handle and use them from electrical shocks and accidents.
The term technically applies to the path that electricity takes from an electrical circuit to the earth but is also used to refer to the path an electrical flow will take from a main supply source to an electronic device. The Importance of Grounding. The grounding of electricity is important for three main reasons. Grounding helps to direct the path of electricity to electrically powered devices, helps to stabilize the voltage levels of electrical power, and helps protects your home and appliances from electrical overload.
To prevent the danger of electrical shock and the possibility of electrocution, ground fault interrupt devices detect open circuits to earth ground in attached electrical or electronic devices. When an open circuit to earth ground is detected, the GFI device immediately opens the voltage source to the device.
Electric current flows in a closed path called an electric circuit. The point where those electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the source of electrons. The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the return or earth ground.
The earth wire is a crucial part of the home electrical system and is designed to protect against electric shock. If faults occur in the electrical system, the electricity will flow to earth by the shortest and easiest path. The shortest path is through a circuit breaker or fuse, which will break the electrical circuit. The earth wire should help stop electricity passing through your body if you have an electrical accident.
