The official name of this gene is “cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ATP-binding cassette sub-family C, member 7).”. CFTR is the gene's official symbol. The CFTR gene is also known by other names, listed below. Read more about gene names and symbols on the About page.
People with cystic fibrosis inherit a defective gene on chromosome 7 called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). The protein produced by this gene normally helps salt (sodium chloride) move in and out of cells.
The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. This protein functions as a channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes.
The most common CFTR mutation is a deletion of just three DNA nucleotides, which leads to the deletion of an amino acid (phenylalanine) at position 508 of the protein sequence. This is denoted as δF508, and is found in around 90% of CF patients.
CFTR stands for Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator. The CFTR protein functions as a channel for the movement of chloride ions in and out of cells, which is important for the salt and water balance on epithelial surfaces, such as in the lungs or pancreas.
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation on the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene) on chromosome 7 (7q31.2). The CFTR gene is located on the long arm in the q31.2 region of chromosome 7. CFTR is an autosomal recessive gene.
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a membrane protein and chloride channel in vertebrates that is encoded by the CFTR gene. CFTR is an ABC transporter-class ion channel that codes for a protein that conducts chloride and thiocyanate ions across epithelial cell membranes.
