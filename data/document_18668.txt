Fovea: In the eye, a tiny pit located in the macula of the retina that provides the clearest vision of all. Only in the fovea are the layers of the retina spread aside to let light fall directly on the cones, the cells that give the sharpest image. Also called the central fovea or fovea centralis. The word fovea is the Latin word for small pit.. The fovea is literally a small depression (in the retina).
Definition of FOVEA. 1. : a small fossa. 2. : a small rodless area of the retina that affords acute vision — see eye illustration. — fo·ve·al \-vē-əl\ adjective. — fo·ve·ate \-vē-ˌāt, -ət
In the middle of the retina is a small dimple called the fovea or fovea centralis. It is the center of the eye's sharpest vision and the location of most color perception.
Foveal hypoplasia is a medical condition wherein there is an abnormality in the fovea which is part of the eye. The fovea is an important part of the retina in the eye, and it is composed of various cone cells that are responsible for giving good vision.
The base of the fovea centralis with a diameter of about 0.35 mm (or about 1º of the visual field). The image of the point of fixation is formed on the foveola in the normal eye. The foveola contains cone cells only (rod-free area). The foveal avascular zone is slightly larger (about 0.5 mm in diameter) (Fig. F9).
