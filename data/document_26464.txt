The highest average temperature in Chicken is July at 60.6 degrees. The coldest average temperature in Chicken is January at -8.4 degrees. The most monthly precipitation in Chicken occurs in August with 2.2 inches. The Chicken weather information is based on the average of the previous 3-7 years of data.
Birds have a much higher metabolic rate than humans. The average body temperature of a chicken is 41-45 degrees C, compared to a human's average body temperature of 37 degrees C. The pulse rate of a chicken can reach as high as 400 beats/min. All of these factors place a great demand on the chicken's heart which has to work much harder than a human heart.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below
In the adult chicken the variability is between 105°F and 107°F (40.6° and 41.7°C). The body temperature of a newly hatched chick is about 103.5°F (39.7°C), and increases daily until it reaches a stable level at about three weeks of age. Smaller chicken breeds have a higher body temperature than larger breeds.
One and a half hours is much too long to cook the chicken at 350 degrees F. The time your chicken will bake in the oven does depend on the internal temperature and the size of your chicken or chicken pieces. Generally I bake chicken at 350 degrees F. for 30 to 40 minutes.
