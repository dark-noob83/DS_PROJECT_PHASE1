It commences near to the apex of the heart in the anterior part of the interventricular groove. It passes superiorly in the company of the anterior interventricular artery.
The great and the middle cardiac veins merge at the apex of the heart, forming together with the coronary sinus into which they both empty, a complete venous ring around the left ventricle (13%).
The distal portion of the coronary sinus commonly narrows to form the great cardiac vein. In most human hearts we have observed valves of Vieussen covering the ostium of
The great cardiac vein is one of the largest veins in the body. It is located in the heart, leading away from the coronary sinus. It's function is to lead blood that has had the oxygen removed from it away from the heart.
The great cardiac vein (left coronary vein) begins at the apex of the heart and ascends along the anterior longitudinal sulcus to the base of the ventricles.
great cardiac vein, one of the five tributaries of the coronary sinus, beginning at the apex of the heart and ascending along the anterior interventricular sulcus to the base of the ventricles. It then curves left in the coronary sulcus, reaches the back of the heart, and opens into the left part of the coronary sinus.
The great cardiac vein leads to the coronary sinus. The coronary  sinus is vein that varies in size from 15 to 65 millimeters, and it  leads into the right atrium.
