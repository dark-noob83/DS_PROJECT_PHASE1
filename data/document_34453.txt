Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a free swimming larva.
The Phylum: Rotifera derives its name from Bearing a wheel or Wheel animacules.. There is a prominent circular array of cilia at the anterior end of the animal that looks like a rotating wheel. This is known as the Trochal disc or Corona. Rotifers occur primarily in freshwater and all are microscopic.
Phyla with a true coelom and digestive system are divided into two groups, the protostomes and the deuterostomes. As the hollow sphere of cells known as a blastula develops, an invagination produces an opening called the blastopore. In protostomes, the blastopore becomes the mouth.
Locomotion. -- There are two kinds of locomotion: (1) ciliary activity on the corona and (2) crawling on vegetation by making particular use of the foot. Pedal glands secrete adhesive material, which comes out on the foot. It can thus adhere to surfaces.
Food is sucked into the mouth by the powerful pumping pharynx. Chaetonotus is a gastrotrich an belongs to the phylum Gastrotrichia. This is a relatively small phylum of unsegmented, worm-like aquatic invertebrates. Gastrotrichs are found in the interstitial waters of fine sediments, or on overlying detritus. Most are less than a mm in length, although a few reach sizes up to 3mm. They are covered with cilia and use it for their means of locomotion. Because of this, they are sometimes confused with ciliates (protozoans).
