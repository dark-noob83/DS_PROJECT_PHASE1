White potash is produced by a process of dissolution and recrystallization. Potash ore is dissolved under pressure in hot brine, and MOP is precipitated as the brine cools and pressure reduces. The iron is removed in this process, and the resulting MOP fertilizer is white.
Potassium chloride is the most common K source used in Minnesota. Red, pink, and white forms are available. These materials are equivalent as sources of K. The color in 0-0-60 is due to iron impurities that have no effect on the availability of K for crop growth.

QROP MOP-MURIATE OF POTASH GRANULAR 0-0-60. Granular potassium chloride (MOP) produced in Chile. Contains 60% K2O and is white in color. The granules are applied in dry form or in dry blends to the soil.
Potassium chloride (potash) is the most common potassium source used in agriculture. Potash is known as Muriate of Potash (MOP) with an analysis of 0-0-60. The chemical formula is KCl. Its nutrient composition is approximately: Potassium (K): 61% K2O, Chloride (Cl): 46%. Cleveland Potash (CPL) offers high-quality granular potash in red color. Granular potash is used both for direct application and for bulk blending (mixing of dry fertilizers to obtain a compound NPK formulation).
