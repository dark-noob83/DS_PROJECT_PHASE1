47, XXY (or XXY) is a genetic condition caused when someone has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome. Males normally have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome (46, XY), and females normally have two X chromosomes (46, XX).
Klinefelter syndrome is a condition related to the X and Y chromosomes (the sex chromosomes). People typically have two sex chromosomes in each cell: females have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males have one X and one Y chromosome (46,XY).
Klinefelter's syndrome, (also known as 47,XXY or XXY syndrome) is a genetic disorder in males caused by having an extra X chromosome instead of the usual XY pattern that men have.
Klinefelter Syndrome is not caused by genes but is rather caused by  chromosomal nondisjunction, or an odd number of chromosomes.  Klinefelter Syndrome is particularly the p … resence of more than one  X chromosome in a male's karyotype in addition to one Y chromosome  (normal males have one X and one Y). Typically, a Klinefelter  patient will feature the XXY karyotype, although the presence of  additional X chromosomes has been reported.
Some people with features of Klinefelter syndrome have the extra X chromosome in only some of their cells; in these individuals, the condition is described as mosaic Klinefelter syndrome (46,XY/47,XXY).
Males normally have a total of 46 chromosomes; one X and one Y chromosome (46-XY). However, males with Klinefelter’s syndrome have an extra X chromosome (47-XXY) and therefore a total of 47 chromosomes. The presence of an extra X chromosome primarily affects the testes.
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects males. Klinefelter syndrome occurs when a boy is born with one or more extra X chromosomes. Most males have one Y and one X chromosome. Having extra X chromosomes can cause a male to have some physical traits unusual for males. Many men with an extra X chromosome are not aware that they have it, and they lead normal lives.
