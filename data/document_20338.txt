This may be removed through curettage of the uterus in which the tissue is scraped from the uterus. Bleeding may result and in some cases, an infection may also develop. The ovaries will begin to produce an egg after about two weeks following the miscarriage and a period will take place within 4-6 weeks. A check up with the doctor is advisable after six weeks to rule out the possibility of further complications and to ensure that the uterus has regained its normal size.
Breastfeeding helps contract the uterus. Your uterus should be about the size of a lime about 6 weeks after. The shape of your abs is another story and is entirely based on how much weight you gained, the size of your baby, how big your tummy was stretched, and the elasticity of your skin.
My first pregnancy, I had a healthy baby girl, breast-fed her, and the weight was off completely within a few months (I didn't get my BODY back for a year, but that's just hormonal). The second pregnancy, 5 lbs stuck around after my D&C. The third pregnancy, another 5 lbs.
There is no solid scientific/medical evidence supporting how long after a miscarriage you should wait to try to conceive after having miscarriage. Three months is a pretty common answer. Women who take additional folic acid at the time of conception are less likely to have a infant with neural tube defects.
a few weeks. Not very long. More than one week, less than three (for me). That said, I gained a little weight with each of my three pregnancies, on top of the actual weight of the uterus stuff.
If you are nursing, your uterus will shrink much faster. I think 4-6 weeks is normal just because that is the time it can take for the bleeding to stop. Try to be patient with your body and rest up. I considered 6 weeks my start up point after both my kids for worrying about my weight, fitness, etc.
