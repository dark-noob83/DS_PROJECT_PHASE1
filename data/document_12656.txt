With that in mind, this former first-round pick has to have one of the strongest arms in the league. Roethlisberger led the NFL in yards per attempt as a second-year player back in 2004.
Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens. Courtesy of the Baltimore Ravens: Arm strength was never a question for Flacco. Not only does Flacco have one of the strongest arms in the NFL, he throws one of the prettiest deep passes in the league. As a prototypical 6'6 quarterback, the Super Bowl MVP has the size to drive the ball down the field.
Ron Jaworski is not a stats guy. The game film tells him that Flacco is a top-10 quarterback with the strongest arm in the league. That's Flacco's No. 1 attribute, said Jaworski, an ESPN analyst. I get so tired of hearing how arm strength is overrated. It's far more important than people think.
In the nineties, Dave Klingler had the strongest arm in the NFL. He could throw the ball over sixty yards without winding his arm. He had the same exact mechanics for deep throws as short ones. He had an incredible arm.
