Elodea is a water plant native to Canada, often used in aquariums. It is also often used in biology labs on cell structure because it forms nice, large cells that are easily observed under the microscope.
Movement of Chloroplasts. Chloroplasts do move in a cell. Observing chloroplasts in movement in an elodea cell is like watching a busy, bustling mass of pedestrians from a building high above. They jostle and slide and scoot around the cell, often sticking near the edges of the cell but sometimes seeming to fill the cell entirely with constant motion.
They contain chlorophyll, the green pigment plants need to make their food. The plant is unable to produce its food without the help of chloroplast. Chloroplasts are scattered … throughout the cytoplasm of a plant cell. The chloroplasts give plants their green color and are used in making food.
Chloroplast is only found in plant cells and contains the green pigment. It makes food for the plant through Photosynthesis. The chloroplasts are the parts in a plant cell i … n which sunlight CO2 and water are used to make sugars and oxygen. Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis and they are in plant cells. Plant cells are Eukaryotic cells. They obtain energy from the sunlight and convert to food for the cell. Without chloroplast plants cannot make there own food and they wouldn't be called producers.
Best Answer: Cytopolasmic streaming is when the chloroplasts move around in the cytoplasm. They actually are travelling along tracks made of the microtubules from the cytoskeleton. There are motor proteins associated with these tracks that help move things around.
Answers. Best Answer: A Heat from light, causes the plant cells to warm up, causing the chloroplast to gather energy from the heat to make food. Chloroplasts also contain the cell's chlorophyll which provides the green colour of the plant.
