Protozoans and algae belong to the kindgom Protista. Algae are plant-like, and protozoa are animal-lie. There are two plural forms of protozoan: protozoa and protozoans.
The taxonomic kingdom Protista is a collection of single-celled organisms that do not fit into any other category. Protists are a group made up of protozoa, unicellular algae, and slime molds. We will concentrate on the animal portion of this group: the protozoa (proto = first, zoa = animals). Protozoa are the oldest known group of heterotrophic life that consume and transform complex food particles into energy.
2. Some protists are heterotrophs, a group of phyla called the protozoa. Heterotrophs get their energy by consuming other organisms. Protists reproduce asexually by binary fission, and a few species are capable of sexual reproduction.
PROTOZOANS: THE ANIMAL-LIKE PROTISTANS. Originally, the Kingdom Protista was splintered from the multicelled eukaryote Kingdoms because they didnt fit into them well; too many single-celled groups had abilities of animals, plants, and fungi simultaneously.
Kingdom Protista is a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms. Protists are unicellular, some are colonial or multicellular, they do not have specialized tissue organization. The simple cellular organization distinguishes the protists from other eukaryotes.
Kingdom Protista are categorized into two taxons: Protozoans-animal-like single-celled organisms. Algae-plant-like single or multi-celled organisms. Animal-like Protists-PROTOZOANS. Protists that have resemblance to animals are known as protozoans. They in moist and watery enviroments.
Protozoa are a diverse group of unicellular eukaryotic organisms, many of which are motile. Originally, protozoa had been defined as unicellular protists with animal-like behavior, e.g., movement. Protozoa were regarded as the partner group of protists to protophyta, which have plant-like behaviour, e.g. photosynthesis.
