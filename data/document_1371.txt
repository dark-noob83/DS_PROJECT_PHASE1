This article is about the mainline Delta Air Lines fleet, including the historical fleets of Delta Air Lines. For the fleet of Delta's former regional subsidiary, see Comair. As of July 2015, the Delta Air Lines mainline fleet comprises 809 aircraft in service. Prior to the merger with Northwest Airlines in 2009, Delta Air Lines operated an all-Boeing and McDonnell Douglas fleet, but incorporated Northwest's Airbus aircraft into its fleet following the merger. 
United Continental has nearly 140, 757-200s that are over 17 years old and 21, 767-300ERs that are over 18 years old. The average age of United Continental's fleet is about 12 years, by my estimate. The firm has 164, 757-200s that are about 18 years old, as well. The average age of Delta's fleet, which does include some regional jets (so the age comparison may not be completely apples-to-apples to peers presented in this article), is 15.1 years.

Fleet age data is from AirFleets.net, which only analyzes selected aircraft models, so fleet age values may apply only to a portion of an airline's fleet. The age of individual aircraft within an airline may be much higher or much lower than the average for the entire airline's fleet.

The average Air Force warplane is 23.5 years old compared with 8.5 years in 1967. In 2001, the average plane was 22 years old. The Air Force says it wants to buy new planes to lower the average age of its fleet to 15 years over the next two decades. That will cost an estimated $400billion. There are 356 A-10s in service. The plane is often used to support ground forces in close combat
First, the numbers. A retirement-age analysis using Aviation Week's Fleet database shows an average retirement age of 23.2 years in 2012, down from 26.6 in 2011 and the lowest level in more than two decades. Among widebody aircraft, Boeing 747 -400 retirements doubled to 24, at an average age below 21. Airlines are replacing 747s primarily with the more efficient Boeing 777 -300ERs. With the market for conversions of larger freighters having dried up, the prospect for a significant slowdown in 747 retirements seems slim.

The Singapore Airlines Fleet. Singapore Airlines maintains a modern fleet of 104 aircraft. As of 1 September 2015, the average age of our fleet stands at seven years and three months-making it one of the world's youngest and most fuel efficient.
The firm is also operating 15 767-200s that are 24 years old. The 737NG, which AMR does have in its fleet, and the 787 Dreamliner are significantly more fuel-efficient that these older planes. The average age of AMR's mainline fleet is 15 years. The average age of airplanes in Eagle's fleet, its regional carrier, is 10 years. The firm has 164, 757-200s that are about 18 years old, as well. The average age of Delta's fleet, which does include some regional jets (so the age comparison may not be completely apples-to-apples to peers presented in this article), is 15.1 years.
