In 2013, the total of all economic costs per acre for growing corn in Illinois averaged $1,033 in the northern section, $966 in the central section for farmland with high soil ratings, $951 in the central section for farmland with low soil ratings, and $872 in the southern section.
Non-land costs for corn are projected at $516 per acre in 2013, $4 per acre less than the $520 non-land costs for 2012 (see Table 1). Fertilizer costs are projected to be down slightly in 2013: $165 per acre in 2012 compared to $155 per acre in 2013.
Soybean costs per acre were $727, $715, $673 and $631, respectively (see Table 1). Costs were lower in southern Illinois primarily because of lower land costs. The total of all economic costs per bushel in the different sections of the state ranged from $4.90 to $5.20 for corn and from $12.32 to $12.88 for soybeans. Variations in this cost were related to weather, yields, and land quality.
Drip irrigation requires an economic investment: Drip-irrigation systems typically cost $500 - $1,200 or more per acre (Table 1). Part of the cost is a capital investment useful for several years, and another part is due to the annual cost of disposable parts.
In 2013, cash costs accounted for 49 percent of the total cost of production for corn, other nonland costs were 25 percent, and land costs were 26 percent. The average corn yield for all combined areas of the state was 192 bushels per acre resulting in a total cost of production of $5.03 per bushel.
Table 1 illustrates a sample budget, indicating a total pre-harvest cost of $2,741 per acre, or $0.17 per pound of avocados produced (on the tree). Of the total pre-harvest cost, operating costs totaled $1,596 and fixed costs were estimated at $1,145 per acre.
Total costs per acre increased in all geographic regions of the state when compared to 2012. Costs increased $42 per acre in northern Illinois, $27 per acre in central Illinois with the higher rated soils, $32 per acre in central Illinois with the lower rated soils and $56 per acre in southern Illinois.
Non-land costs for soybeans are projected at $308 per acre in 2013, $2 per acre higher than the 2012 non-land costs of $306 per acre (see Table 1). Fertilizer costs are projected to be down in 2013: $58 per acre in 2012 compared to $53 in 2013.
