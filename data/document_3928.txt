– You are tech savvy. If you have the skills to repair your Apple device yourself, AppleCare probably isn’t worth it, as you can simply buy any needed repair parts for cheaper than the cost of the AppleCare plan, and fix the device yourself. Of course, this is heavily dependent on what fails.
Mac desktops: AppleCare for desktops is relatively inexpensive, which might make it tempting, but it’s still not really worth it when you figure that you’ll probably plop your computer down in one place and keep it there for a while.
Display support: If you buy AppleCare support for your Apple display for $99, the plan will extend your support to three years. Beside the display itself, it covers the built-in camera, mic, and speakers; and the power cord. It also includes telephone assistance.
AppleCare (or AppleCare+ for iPhones, iPads, and some iPods) is an insurance policy for your devices. You pay an up-front cost to cover any potential problems. But more precisely, AppleCare plans extend the length of your hardware coverage for both repairs and support.
Extended warranties are like insurance for your electronics and devices. In some cases yes, and in some cases no. AppleCare is probably worth it for some people, while it may not be for others, but before we get to that, let’s review the details of Apple’s extended warranty, in more detail. Apple offers a free, standard warranty with every new purchase, which supplies a year of coverage on hardware.
How long it extends support: For Macs and displays, AppleCare gets you a total of three years’ support—in other words, it extends phone support by 33 months and the limited warranty by two years (for a total of three years).
On nearly all of their mainstream products, Apple offers an extended warranty program called AppleCare. From there, each AppleCare protection plan is priced accordingly based on the product that it covers, or protects.
I don't think AppleCare is worth it, when for just a little bit more you can get something like Squaretrade. That not only covers regular failures, but it will also cover me if I drop my laptop, or spill my pop on it, or any other accidental happening. AppleCare doesn't cover accidental damage at all.
