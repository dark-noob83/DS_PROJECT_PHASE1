These are the average fees charged according to the ADA's 2012 dental fee survey (not including the top or bottom 5%). Assuming there are no major problems, a check-up-including the examination, scale and clean, and a fluoride treatment-should be about $200.
For examination purposes, a full mouth series of x-rays may be needed if it has been several years since your last dental visit. The cost of this can be up to $145.00, depending on the number of x-rays required. In general, we find average cleaning/check up appointments to run in the range of $250.00 – $350.00. For new patients, this cost is usually more due to the new patient exam and probability for more x-rays.
This will give you 100 per cent of the cost of check-ups, up to a £25 annual limit. But a private dental check-up costs £47 on average, so if you had two check-ups a year you’d have to fork out £69 yourself — and spend £90 on the insurance. However, this will also give you up to 50 per cent cashback for treatment, such as fillings or crowns, up to a limit of £200 a year.
Check-Ups. Common check-up and cleaning costs vary. Dentists charge different rates depending upon your situation and where you live. In most places, an average check-up costs about $288, which covers an exam, x-rays and cleaning.
The cost of a routine check-up at an NHS dentist will more than double in the biggest shake-up for 50 years. Patients will pay £15, rather than £6, for a check-up, while the cost of a filling will rise from £17.64 to £41, the Government announced. Critics warned that higher basic fees could worsen the dental health crisis because the less well-off would be deterred from seeking treatment.
