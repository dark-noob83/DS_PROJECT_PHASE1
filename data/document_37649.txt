Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures. The range for normal human body temperatures, taken orally, is 7002309950000000000♠36.8±0.5 °C (7002309927777777777♠98.2±0.9 °F). The body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change.
37°C (98.6°F) - Normal body temperature (which varies between about 36.123-37.5°C (96.8-99.5°F) 38°C (100.4°F) - Sweating, feeling very uncomfortable, slightly hungry. 39°C (102.2°F) (Pyrexia) - Severe sweating, flushed and very red. Fast heart rate and breathlessness. There may be exhaustion accompanying this. May be a normal body temperature. 35°C (95.0°F) - (Hypothermia) is less than 35°C (95.0°F) - Intense shivering, numbness and blueish/greyness of the skin. There is the possibility of heart irritability. 34°C (93.2°F) - Severe shivering, loss of movement of fingers, blueness and confusion.
The normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). In adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 33.2–38.2 °C (91.8–100.8 °F) for normal temperatures, depending on the gender and location measured. The body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change.
The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. This is the longest and most inaccurate way of measuring body temperature, the normal temperature falls at 97.6 °F or 36.4 °C. Rectal temperatures are an internal measurement taken in the rectum, which fall at 99.6 °F or 37.6 °C.
The equivalent to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is 37 degrees Celsius. This is the average normal human body temperature, which is slightly lower in adults. The range is 36.8 degr … ees plus or minus 0.7 degrees. Normal temperature range will vary, sometimes considerably, for individuals. The average human body temperature is 98.6º F or 37º C, but it can vary somewhat. Average adult temperature is 98.2º F (36.8º C). Older people average a bit less. These values can also vary with time of day.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period.
Average human body temperature. Body temperature changes throughout the day. It is the lowest in the early morning between 4 and 6 a.m., and the highest in the early evening between 6 and 8 p.m. Normal temperature is about 37°C or 98.6°F. Normal body temperature for healthy babies is in the range of 96.8°F to 98.6°F, or 36°C to 37°C. If the baby's body temperature rises above 100.4°F to 101.3°F, then it is considered as indication of fever. If it falls below 96.8°F then the child has low temperature and needs immediate warming up.
98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius is approximately normal temperature for the human body.   The human body operates best at 98.6 degrees Fahreinheit (about 37o C). The healthy body temperature for humans is between 95 and between 99.3. The average human body temperature is 98.6º F or 37º C, but it can vary somewhat. Average adult temperature is 98.2º F (36.8º C). Older people average a bit less. These values can also vary with time of day.
