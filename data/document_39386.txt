It depends on the species, but in general tropical fish are most healthy in the range of 75-80°F (24-27°C). Cold water fish do better in temperatures well below that, some of them enjoy water well below 70°F, which is not suitable for any tropical fish.
Tropical fish are those that require heated water, generally in the range of 75-80°F (24-27°C). Because many homes are not kept in that temperature range day and night, these fish require a heated aquarium.
Aquarium Water Temperature. For the vast majority of tropical fish, an aquarium water temperature of 76 to 78º Fahrenheit will be fine. Some species like cooler water and some prefer warmer water, but as a compromise, this range works well.
Heating. Tropical fish require a normal maintenance temperature between approx. 22-29 o C (72-84 o F), with many species being kept at a 'middle value' of 24-25 o C (75-77 o F). Maintaining a stable temperature (and more importantly avoiding rapid changes) is vital to avoid stressing fish.
Not only is temperature important for your fish but also for the plants you put in your aquarium. Close attention to keeping your temperature in the right range will ensure you have a thriving freshwater aquarium. Temperature Ranges. Most tropical fish prefer a temperature range of 72 to 79 degrees. Most people who operate tropical fish aquariums will keep their tanks at a constant 77 degrees. The best thing to do is ask the sales representative at your local fish store for the best temperature for the fish you want.
