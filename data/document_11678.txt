Types of Prey. There are many types of predation and prey, and the example of the lion hunting the antelope is called carnivory. Predation can also occur as parasitism, in which the prey is a host that supports a parasite, such as a virus. In this case, the prey may be harmed but not killed outright like the antelope. When the prey is the same species as the predator, this is called cannibalism. Plants can also be prey, and this is called herbivory. When a deer eats grass the plant is the prey and animal the predator.
