T1 and t2 hyperintense lesion in left aspect of the t2 vertebral body, which loses signal on inversion recovery imaging felt to reflect a hemangioma. 3. Get help from a doctor now ›. Hemangiomas vs. cyst: Bunny: t2 lesions in the liver are typically not cancerous and represent usually hemangiomas or liver cysts. When they say did not completely fill with contrast, that hints to me that they are thinking hemangiomas.
Hyperintense lesions are bright, white spots that show up on certain types of MRI scans. Hyperintense lesions in certain parts of the brain can be a sign of dementia. Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common causes of hyperintense lesions. The radiologist or technician can view hyperintense lesions on T2 MRI images in real time from the observation room. Basic Presentation. In most cases hyperintense lesions are bright, glowing patches on MRI scans. They are all but invisible on the surface, so aren’t often detected during surgery, and they don’t usually show up on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans, either.
(a, b) Focal lesion (arrow) in the left liver lobe shows low SI on (a) T2-weighted FSE image (1800/93) and (b) T1-weighted image (680/6). The lesion has a central hypointense scar with both sequences, owing to fibrotic content and calcification. (a, b) A small nodule in the right liver lobe (arrow) is (a) hypointense on T2-weighted (1800/93) image and (b) hyperintense on T1-weighted (100/5.2) image. The low SI of the dysplastic nodule on the T2-weighted image may be related to deposition of paramagnetic substances such as iron.
Figure 28c Angiomyolipoma in a 66-year-old man. (a–c) The lesion (arrow) is (a) hypointense on T2-weighted FSE image (1800/93) and (b) hyperintense as subcutaneous fat on in-phase T1-weighted image (100/5.2). (a, b) A small nodule in the right liver lobe (arrow) is (a) hypointense on T2-weighted (1800/93) image and (b) hyperintense on T1-weighted (100/5.2) image. The low SI of the dysplastic nodule on the T2-weighted image may be related to deposition of paramagnetic substances such as iron.
Hyperintense lesions are patches of damaged cell tissue that show up as bright, white spots in certain types of specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Basic Presentation. In most cases hyperintense lesions are bright, glowing patches on MRI scans. They are all but invisible on the surface, so aren’t often detected during surgery, and they don’t usually show up on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans, either.
Another unique feature of MRI is its ability to identify masses with atypical signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted imaging. The majority of focal hepatic lesions visible on MRI are hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Atypical signal intensity of liver lesions (increased on T1-weighted MRI and decreased on T2-weighted images) is rare but may be an important diagnostic clue. Most such lesions can be characterized on ultrasound and CT in terms of their tissue character and resectability. Multislice CT, with its superb demonstration of vascular structures, is especially suitable for determining resectability. In some cases, however, the tissue character of a lesion remains problematic.
The presence of both hyperintense and hypointense lesions on fast FLAIR images of some patients with MS (25) suggests that this sequence has the potential for providing, in a single image, the information usually obtained with two separate acquisitions (ie, T1- and T2-weighted sequences). First, hypointense lesion volumes on fast FLAIR images were, on average, only 1% to 2% of the volumes obtained from the corresponding PD-weighted images, and this is of some concern when such an approach is used for detecting changes of MS lesion burden over time.
The hypointense liver lesion on T2-weighted MR images and what it means. Curvo-Semedo L, Brito JB, Seco MF, Costa JF, Marques CB, Caseiro-Alves F. The vast majority of focal liver lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. Rarely, however, hepatic nodules may appear totally or partially hypointense on those images. The aims of this work are to discuss the causes and mechanisms of hypointensity of liver lesions on T2-weighted images and proposing an algorithm for classification that may be useful as a quick reminder for the interested reader.

The total lesion load for hyperintense lesions on PD-weighted and fast FLAIR images and for hypointense lesions on T1-weighted and fast FLAIR images was measured by a single trained technician who was unaware of the patients' clinical characteristics. First, hypointense lesion volumes on fast FLAIR images were, on average, only 1% to 2% of the volumes obtained from the corresponding PD-weighted images, and this is of some concern when such an approach is used for detecting changes of MS lesion burden over time.
