Juggs is a softcore pornography adult magazine published in the United States which specializes in photographs of women with extremely large breasts. It has been called the magazine of choice for breast men.. It is published by Mavety Media Group, originally known for publishing gay pornography magazines in the United States, and distributed by Larry Flynt Publications. The magazine readership is mostly blue-collar men in the American South and Midwest. After Juggs published a review of artist John Currin's exhibition in 1998, the magazine's approval was still being used to define the artist's work 11 years later. From 1986 to 2001, Juggs was helmed by Dian Hanson who had edited multiple pornographic magazines since 1977.
