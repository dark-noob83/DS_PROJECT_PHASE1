What part of the brain distinguishes humankind from other animals? 
Confidence votes 2.8K. The cerebral cortex is highly developed in humans compared to other mammals and has a much greater volume relative to the rest of the brain. Generally, however, it is not any single part of the brain but the volume of the cranium (housing the brain) that sets humans apart from other animals. In the course of evolution when the forehead projected outwards, the inner cavity of the skull increased in volume so that more quantity of brain could be contained.
Although we share the primitive portions of our brain with animals, our cerebrum is more developed and larger. In humans, the cerebrum is the large wrinkled portion that covers other parts of the brain. In fact, it makes up about 85% of the human brain. The outer part of the cerebrum is called the cortex (bark).
