1 You need to take a distribution regardless of your age. 2  Generally, you need to take distributions over your lifetime or within five years after the original account holder passed away. 3  With an Inherited Traditional IRA, you will pay taxes on distributions.
Distributions from Traditional IRAs prior to age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty, in addition to applicable federal and state taxes. Under the following circumstances, you may be able to avoid the penalty on early withdrawals: 1  First-time home purchase. 2  Qualified education expenses. 3  Death or disability.
However, if you're 60 years old, you automatically qualify for an exception based on your age. Anyone over 59 1/2 doesn't have to pay the early withdrawal penalty on non-qualified Roth IRA withdrawals.
Also, the amount of your contribution can't exceed the amount of income you earned that year (or that your spouse earned, if you're not working anymore). In addition, you're subject to annual traditional IRA limits ($5,500 for the 2015 tax year, $6,500 if you're age 50 or older).
In most cases, you are required to take minimum distributions, or withdrawals, from your 401k, IRA, etc. after you reach a certain age. You can also withdraw more than the minimum amount. You may have to pay income tax on your retirement income.
Required minimum distributions. If you are age 70½ or older this year, you must take a 2014 required minimum distribution by December 31, 2014 (by April 1, 2015, if you turned 70½ in 2014). You can calculate the amount of your IRA required minimum distribution by using our Worksheets.
Regardless of your age, you will need to file a Form 1040 and show the amount of the IRA withdrawal. Since you took the withdrawal before you reached age 59 1/2, unless you met one of the exceptions listed in Publication 590-B, you will need to pay an additional 10% tax on early distributions on your Form 1040.
However, your distribution will be includible in your taxable income and it may be subject to a 10% additional tax if you're under age 59 1/2. The additional tax is 25% if you take a distribution from your SIMPLE-IRA in the first 2 years you participate in the SIMPLE IRA plan.
