This pot is 7 to 8 inches wide and about 8 inches deep. It is a nice size to move a band plant into. But, it is not particularly deep, so you have to make sure the roots fit into the container. This pot will produce an average plant that is about 2 feet tall. We grow a lot of palms in these pots. 
This species of Agave is shown here in 1, 5 and 15 gallon pots, each with a different price but all achieve the same size at maturity. Specialty plants such as topiaries may cost more than the average container price due to the time and labor to achieve such precise forms. Tip #1 Reduce Plant Sizes: Every plant of the same species used in landscaping today will mature at a specific height and diameter. Container size is how the industry prices nursery plants. The optimal size for a shrub on your planting plan is a 5 gallon container. Herbaceous perennials are 1 gallon containers. Trees are usually 15 gallon containers, but the next size up is considered specimen and grown in a 24 inch square wood box.
Total Costs and Returns. Total costs for garden mum production in containers and marketing added to $1.42 per pot, Table 4. Based on a typical wholesale price of $2.25 per pot, the gross revenue for 8,200 plants would be $18,450. with a net profit of $7,120. It was assumed that 75% of the plants were delivered in loads of 250 plants. Expenses included 4 hours of labor ($8.00 per hour) and 10 gallons of gasoline ($1.00 per gallon). Marketing costs were nearly $0.17 per pot or 12% of the production costs.
To determine your production cost per plant take the amount of soil you need to fill a single pot. First take your soil volume convert it into inches. 2 cubic feet of soil will be 12 x12 x12 x 2 which gives us 3456 cubic inches of soil. Now divide the cost of your soil by 128. This gives us how much it costs to fill each pot which in this example is $4 / 128 which equals about $0.03 per pot. Next we need to know how much each pot costs.
This much is known: Legal pot means higher-priced pot -- by a long shot. According to PriceOfWeed.com, a crowdsourced Internet archive of black market pot prices across the country, the national average cost of an ounce of high-quality black market marijuana is roughly $350.

They found a median planting density of 15 plants per square meter, or 1.4 plants per square foot, and an average yield of 1.2 ounces of saleable material per plant per harvest. 6 That translates to 0.105 pounds per square foot per harvest or 2.625 pounds per 25 square feet per harvest. 
Profit per pot was based on variations in the number of plants delivered and prices (Table 5). The net profit margin analysis for garden mums is presented in Table 6. Based on a price of $2.25 per pot, delivered plants had a profit margin of 36.8% and non-delivered plants had 44.2% profit margin. It was assumed that 75% of the plants were delivered in loads of 250 plants. Expenses included 4 hours of labor ($8.00 per hour) and 10 gallons of gasoline ($1.00 per gallon). Marketing costs were nearly $0.17 per pot or 12% of the production costs.
For that figure we can fill 128 3 pots. Now divide the cost of your soil by 128. This gives us how much it costs to fill each pot which in this example is $4 / 128 which equals about $0.03 per pot. Next we need to know how much each pot costs.
