Mercy is the act of not administering justice when that justice is punitive. Because of our sinfulness, we deserve death and eternal separation from God (Rom. 6:23; Isaiah 59:2), but God provided an atonement for sin and through it shows us mercy.
By the atoning sacrifice of Christ a way is open for the exercise of mercy towards the sons of men, in harmony with the demands of truth and righteousness (Gen. 19:19; Ex. 20:6; 34:6, 7; Ps. 85:10; 86:15, 16). In Christ mercy and truth meet together. Mercy is also a Christian grace (Matt. 5:7; 18:33-35).
Answer: Mercy and grace are often confused. While the terms have similar meanings, grace and mercy are not the same. To summarize the difference: mercy is God not punishing us as our sins deserve, and grace is God blessing us despite the fact that we do not deserve it. Mercy is deliverance from judgment. Grace is extending kindness to the unworthy.
In English translations of the Bible, it comes to expression in phrases such as to be merciful,  to have mercy on,  or to show mercy toward.. The corresponding term, merciful,  describes a quality of God and one that God requires of his people.
Mercy is when we are spared from judgment or harm. But when churches refuse to preach on hell and judgment, then there is less and less need to talk about mercy. It will be a word that is gradually phased out of sermons.
