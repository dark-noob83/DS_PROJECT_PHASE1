Immediately after the injury, apply pressure to the area with your hand. A bruise is a collection of blood under the skin and pressure can slow or stop the bleeding. Place ice in a plastic bag and wrap in a towel. Apply the ice to the bruised shoulder for 20 minutes. Every four to six hours, take the recommended dose of an over-the-counter pain reliever like Tylenol or Advil. If you are prone to an upset stomach, take the pain medication with food or milk. Perform range of motion exercises throughout your recovery process.
Depends on what's been injured in the thigh. A minor bruise should heal quickly as there's a lot of blood flow to the thigh. A deep contusion or bruise on the muscle may take â€¦ as much as a month to 6 weeks, if it's large and deep enough -- large muscle invovled. If the bone is bruised -- longer. The femur can take a lot of damage without breaking, but that damage would still have to heal.
A broken collarbone, or fractured clavicle, is a common injury. It usually happens after a fall or a blow to the shoulder. It takes about six to eight weeks to heal in adults, and three to six weeks in children. The collarbone, or clavicle, is a long slender bone that runs from the breastbone to each of the shoulders.
The time an injury takes to heal depends on how severe the injury is. However, it will usually take anywhere from a couple of days to several weeks. Keep cool compresses on the area to reduce swelling as well as taking Ibuprofen. Also, use warm compresses to help with pain.
