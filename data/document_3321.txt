Often the response to jazak allahu khayran is wa iyyaakum (وإياكم), which means And to you. Jazak Allah Khayr (Arabic: جزاك اللهُ خيراً‎) is an Arabic term used as an Islamic expression of gratitude meaning May Allâh reward you [with] goodne goodness So, jazaka (جزاك) means He will reward you. Allah here explicitly refers Allah as the doer (subject of the sentence or فاعل). Now He is Allah. Khair (خير) is the noun meaning, good. The full meaning becomes: Allah will reward you good. This is used as a Du'a by the Muslims and in Arabic it is: جزاك الله خيرا.
