Dry Ice will keep everything frozen in this ice chest, including extra ice, so keep non-frozen goods to be refrigerated with regular ice in a separate ice chest. Dry Ice normally comes in 10-inch squares, 2 inches thick weighing about 10 pounds each square. Plan to put one square per each 15 inches of ice chest length.
15-45 Minutes. Of course, dry ice lasts for a shorter period of time if it is not stored properly. It subliminates (turns from solid form to gas form) at a rate of about 5-10 pounds every 24 hours. So, if you need about 15 pounds of dry ice for the next day you need to buy 20-25 pounds the day before.

For larger containers and longer camping or traveling times, multiply dry ice quantities by these rates. Dry Ice, at -109.0 F or -78.5 C, will freeze and keep frozen everything in its container until it is completely sublimated.
How Long Dry Ice Lasts. Plan on using 5 to 10 pounds of dry ice for every 24-hour period depending upon the thickness of the insulated shipping container. This will keep everything frozen in a container up to 15 quarts. For larger containers and greater shipping times multiply dry ice quantities by this rate.
Three to six hours could represent two to five days of storage. For the freezer, depending on how full it is, (the more full the better) things will stay frozen from three to six hours in a refrigerator freezer and up to twelve hours for a chest freezer.
