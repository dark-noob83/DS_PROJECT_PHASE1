Even if you collect some information about customers or yourself, you can eliminate unnecessary data on a regular basis according to your written data retention policy.

A subpoena is actually a court order telling you to appear at a legal proceeding, so you must appear at the place and time designated on the subpoena. Also, if the subpoena requires you to bring certain documents or other objects, you should bring them with you. If you have not received a formal subpoena, and you are not a party to the lawsuit, you may refuse to appear at any proceeding. You are also not required to give any information to the police or any attorneys without first receiving a formal subpoena.
