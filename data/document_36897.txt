Professional Caddies are salaried at $1,000 per week plus 5% of the tournament purse, 7% of a top 10 and 10% for a victory. This amounts to a heft paycheck. Tony Navarro : $ … 442, 548 (June 2006 to June 2007) Allistair Matheson: $337,888 Damon Green started out as a pro, but became a caddy seeking an increase in pay. 
A PGA Tour caddie's salary is not connected to the organization, but is an arrangement with a specific player. Most contracts pay caddies $1000 to $1500 a week and include bonuses based on the player's success in the season, according to Golf Link. Caddies make 5 percent of any finish outside the Top 10, 7 percent for a Top 10 finish, and 10 percent for a win. I think that caddies are underpaid, and a lot of the Tour players would just go crazy to hear me say that, Kip Henley, 4-time PGA winner Brian Gay's caddie, said in an interview with Golf.com.
The Facts. A PGA tour caddy can make several arrangements with a player concerning his salary. Most PGA Tour caddies make between $1000 and $1500 per week, but they also make a percentage of what the player wins in the tournaments. This usually equates to 5 percent of any finish outside the top 10. Players breaking into the top 10, but not winning, will share 7 percent of their prize with their caddies. 
Caddies are paid on the basis of how well their player performs: a base salary of $1,000 a week plus 5% of the tournament purse, 7% of a top 10 and 10% for a victory, according to Cone. Cone estimates caddies can make $1,000 a week at the top clubs. After all, golfers paying $350 to play TPC Sawgrass or $500 to play Shadow Creek can generally spare $50 or $100 for a tip.
Another 50 golfers made between $1-$2 million, resulting in bonuses of at least $50,000. And if you were the caddie who finished 125th on the money list (the last person to guarantee a PGA Tour card for 2014), you would have received at least $30,508 in bonuses. The average PGA Tour player plays between 20-30 events per year, so it would make sense to assume that the average salary would range from $20,000-$45,000. Bonuses: The real money for caddies comes from bonuses. The PCA President also explained that caddies earn at least 5% what the golfer makes in a given week.
In a professional golf tour setting, a player often pays their caddy a percentage of their winnings, which can be as high as 10%. A common pay scale is 5% for making the cut, 7% for a top 10, and 10% for a win. The caddy also usually receives a salary, as the player is not guaranteed to win money at every tournament.
Caddies don't have an annual salary like most people do. The President of the Professional Caddies Association (PCA) recently told reporters that high end caddies typically earn a base weekly salary of somewhere between $1,000-$1,500. Again, caddies negotiate this deal with the golfer on a case by case basis. Some could make more. Some could make less. The average PGA Tour player plays between 20-30 events per year, so it would make sense to assume that the average salary would range from $20,000-$45,000. Bonuses: The real money for caddies comes from bonuses. The PCA President also explained that caddies earn at least 5% what the golfer makes in a given week.
Using the 2013 PGA Tour Money List, the minimum Tiger Woods' caddie would have received was $427,671. Because Tiger won five times in 2013, it's reasonable to assume the caddie made far more. In all, 33 golfers made more than $2 million in 2013. That means those caddies would receive a minimum of $100,000 in bonuses. The average PGA Tour player plays between 20-30 events per year, so it would make sense to assume that the average salary would range from $20,000-$45,000.

But they do get paid. A lot. At the top end, caddy pay days can be better than many players in the field. Since June 2006, Tony Navarro, Adam Scott’s caddy, has pulled in $442,548; Allistair Matheson, who walks with Geoff Ogilvy, made $337,888. Cone estimates caddies can make $1,000 a week at the top clubs. After all, golfers paying $350 to play TPC Sawgrass or $500 to play Shadow Creek can generally spare $50 or $100 for a tip.
Best Answer: On the PGA tour, the standard caddie contract pays $1000 per week plus 5% if outside the top 10, 7% in top 10, 10% for a win. That means that there are probably a lot of caddies earning $100,000 or more. However, I would doubt that many LPGA caddies earn over $100,000 since the golfers dont make nearly as much as the PGA tour players. I have a friend who is a caddy for the lpga, he claims that he makes $75,000 to $100,000 dollars a year and he only tours for 6 months. I find that hard to believe only because he still lives at home with his parents, and recently his parents bought him a car.
