Markets in the long run are at equilibrium when the price is equal to the minimum average total cost possible on the production cost curve. Also, at this point, marginal costs and the long-run average cost are equal. Further, when there is long-run equilibrium there is always short-run equilibrium.
DEFINITION of 'Short Run'. In economics, it is the concept that within a certain period of time, in the future, at least one input is fixed while others are variable. The short run is not a definite period of time, but rather varies based on the length of the firm's contracts.
A period of time in which all factors of production and costs are variable. In the long run, firms are able to adjust all costs, whereas in the short run firms are only able to influence prices through adjustments made to production levels. Additionally, whereas firms may be a monopoly in the short-term they may expect competition in the long-term. In economics, long-run models may shift away from short-turn equilibriums, in which supply and demand react to price levels with more flexibility.
The short run [in economics] is a period of time in which the quantity of at least one input is fixed and the quantities of the other inputs can be varied. The long run is a period of time in which the quantities of all
