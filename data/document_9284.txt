To keep costs low, do-it-yourself homeowners can usually install a roof on an average American ranch house for between $1,000 and $4,000, depending on the material quality used. In contrast, a professional roofer would probably cost between $2,000 and $8,500 for the same roof. The Basics of Roofing Costs. In general, the costs for shingles, labor, and other roofing materials will be quoted in terms of “squares,” each comprising 100 square feet. In other words, a 10 foot by 10 foot patch of your roof makes 1 square.

1 The cost for removing and properly disposing of existing shingles starts around $3-$5 a square foot or $510-$1,100 for a basic ranch-style home -- and costs go higher depending on the type of materials being removed, the location and the difficulty of the removal project. 1 Do-it-yourself materials to install an asphalt shingle roof on an average one-story ranch-style home (with a gently sloping roof of 1,700-2,100 square feet) can run $680-$3,700, depending on the quality of the materials.
Metal roofing is the most expensive and can cost up to $30,000-$40,000 for large roof replacements. The quality of the roofing material will also determine the cost of roof replacement. For example, asphalt shingles can cost anywhere from $50 for average quality to $150 or more for the highest quality (per square).

A square is a 10-by-10 foot area (or 100 square feet).
A one-story, single-layer roof of minimal steepness will cost between $100 and $150 per square to remove. A double-layer roof at the same height would cost more like $115 to $165, while a triple-layer roof would reach $125 to $175 per square. A steeper roof will increase these estimates, of course, as will a roof that is high off the ground. The materials being removed will also play a role. The Basics of Roofing Costs.
