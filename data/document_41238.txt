The PMDD is a protective Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care which is available from the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide. In the PMDD the signer names a trusted person to make health care decisions in the event that the signer is temporarily or permanently unable to make such decisions.
Unless a person has an advance directive, many health care providers and institutions will make critical decisions for him/her or a court may appoint a guardian who is unfamiliar with the personâ€™s values and wishes.
