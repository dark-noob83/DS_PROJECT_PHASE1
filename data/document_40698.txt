To build a 300-square-foot ground level deck made of Trex, a composite material made of reclaimed wood and plastic, a contractor will charge $7500, which includes the labor and material. The material comes in several finishes and color choices, so there’s no finishing required.
1 A composite deck can cost $25-$70 or more a square foot, or $8,000-$22,400 for 16'x20', depending on the brand, project complexity and whether construction is done by casual labor or a licensed contractor.
1 A deck should be cleaned annually ($0.25-$1.50 or more a square foot) and a wood deck might require sealing ($1-$5 a square foot) or staining ($0.50-$7 a square foot) every 1-2 years, depending on the type of wood and the deck's exposure to sunlight and weather.
$19.0 - $36.0. $37.0 - $71.0. Cost of materials estimated as a charge per square foot in the case a contractor will purchase and supply all necessary materials at his own discretion to build a standard deck.
1 Materials cost $10-$30 or more a square foot, depending on the brand and style, or $3,200-$9,600 for 16'x20'. 2  CostHelper readers report spending $8,000-$11,500 on DIY materials for a composite deck, roughly $13.91-$28.57 a square foot, with an average of $19.34.
Cost of labor calculated as a fee per square foot to build standard one level deck with minimum 140 sq. ft. of deck area on a flat surface up to 5’ above ground level excluding building stairs. Multi-level custom designed or decks smaller than 140 sq. ft. will be priced at higher rates.
But with the Trex Deck Cost Calculator, we've made it easier to estimate the cost of materials for a Trex deck. By factoring in the anticipated size of your project along with the estimated costs for material, you'll have a better idea of just how much it will cost to build a high-performance composite deck.
