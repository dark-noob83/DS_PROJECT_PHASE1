The apartment costs $800 a month and the electric and heating are both not included. Would we be able to afford all costs including food, etc. We both make about $600 dollars a month and have to pay about 200 a month for gas.
First, if you are living in an aparment building your cost will be much lower than if you are renting a … house. On average a month I pay about $30 water/sewer/trash, $200 tv/phone/internet, $100 electric, $50 summer/$150 winter for gas. If you are looking for an apartment try to find one that is heated by electric and not gas, that will save you boat loads of money.
Internet. Monthly, expect to pay about $45. Keep in mind that you can split the cost with as many other people as are using your connection, so if you have two roommates, that’s only $15 a person per month.
Further, the cost of renter's insurance depends on the insurance company selected. According to Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America (IIAB), the average cost for renter's insurance is about $12 per month for $30,000 worth of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage.
Trash. Although many apartments have an apartment complex trash can in which you can deposit your garbage, you’re still likely to be billed for pickup. If your complex follows average utility costs, you could expect to pay between $10 and $40 a month for trash pickup.
The average bill for each falls between $10 and $30 a month, although you may be billed at a flat rate for both that can cost between $20 and $60.

You have to consider the size of your apartment and the general climate. An average electric bill may be as low as $30 per month or as high as $100. Gas may cost, on average, anywhere from $40 to $150 and can fluctuate depending on the season.
