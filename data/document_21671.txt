Disacharides. Disaccharides, meaning two sugars, are commonly found in nature as sucrose, lactose and maltose. They are formed by a condensation reaction where one molecule of water condenses or is released during the joining of two monosaccharides.
Carbohydrates often get clumped together in two extreme categories: good and bad. However, carbs alone aren't bad. Everyone needs them because carbs are the body's primary source of energy. The three types of carbs -- sugar, starch and fiber -- all have a place in your diet. Even sugar is a good carb as long as the type of food from which you obtain it is healthy.
The word monosaccharide is derived from mono, meaning one, and saccharide, meaning sugar. The common monosaccharides are glucose, fructose, and galactose. Each simple sugar has a cyclic structure and is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in ratios of 1:2:1 respectively.
Common examples of disaccharides are sucrose or table sugar (glucose-fructose), maltose (glucose-glucose) and lactose (glucose-galactose). The primary function of disaccharides is as a nutritional source of monosaccharides. Many of the sugars found in foodstuffs are di
Carbohydrates are one of the four major classes of organic compounds in living cells. They are produced during photosynthesis and are the main sources of energy for plants and animals. The term carbohydrate is used when referring to a saccharide or sugar and its derivatives.
