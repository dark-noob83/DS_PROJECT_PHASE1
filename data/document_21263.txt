The regulation of transcription is a vital process in all living organisms. It is orchestrated by transcription factors and other proteins working in concert to finely tune the amount of RNA being produced through a variety of mechanisms. Much of the early understanding of transcription came from prokaryotic organisms, although the extent and complexity of transcriptional regulation is greater in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic transcription is governed by three main sequence elements:
• transcriptional regulation – controlling the rate of gene transcription for example by helping or hindering RNA polymerase binding to DNA. • transcription – the process of making RNA from a DNA template by RNA polymerase. Much of the early understanding of transcription came from prokaryotic organisms, although the extent and complexity of transcriptional regulation is greater in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic transcription is governed by three main sequence elements:
SUMMARY. Eukaryotic transcriptional control operates at three levels: modulation of the levels and/or activities of activators and repressors; changes in chromatin structure directed by activators and repressors; and direct influence of activators and repressors on assembly of initiation complexes. An obvious critical control point for cells is transcription of the genes encoding transcription factors themselves. Hepatocyte-specific expression of transthyretin provides an example: The complete set of activators required for transcription of the TTR gene are expressed only in hepatocytes.
While these means of transcriptional regulation also exist in eukaryotes, the transcriptional landscape is significantly more complicated both by the number of proteins involved as well as by the presence of introns and the packaging of DNA into histones. Much of the early understanding of transcription came from prokaryotic organisms, although the extent and complexity of transcriptional regulation is greater in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic transcription is governed by three main sequence elements:

Transcriptional regulation is a term used to describe a number of biological processes by which transcription, the process through which the genetic data stored in DNA is transcribed to RNA, is controlled. Regulation of gene expression can occur at every level of the central dogma of biology. Transcriptional regulation is a specific form of gene regulation that occurs during the transcription process by moderating the rate of transcription.
The operon is effectively the center of transcriptional control. In addition to its main structural genes, the operon houses an operator and a promoter. In front of the promoter lies a regulatory gene that produces repressor proteins. E. coli, remember, is a prokaryote; an organism whose cells lack a nucleus. Prokaryotic DNA is clustered into groups of genes called operons. When scientists first studied the lac operon found in E. coli, they observed gene regulation through transcriptional repression and induction.
Specifically, gene expression is controlled on two levels. First, transcription is controlled by limiting the amount of mRNA that is produced from a particular gene. The second level of control is through post-transcriptional events that regulate the translation of mRNA into proteins. As in prokaryotes, eukaryotic repressor molecules can sometimes bind to silencer elements in the vicinity of a gene and inhibit the binding, assembly, or activity of the transcription complex, thus turning off expression of a gene. Positive regulation by TFs that are activators is common in eukaryote
Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is a result of the combined effects of structural properties (how DNA is packaged) and the interactions of proteins called transcription factors. The most important structural difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA is the formation of chromatin in eukaryotes. As in prokaryotes, eukaryotic repressor molecules can sometimes bind to silencer elements in the vicinity of a gene and inhibit the binding, assembly, or activity of the transcription complex, thus turning off expression of a gene. Positive regulation by TFs that are activators is commo
In molecular biology and genetics, transcriptional regulation is the means by which a cell regulates the conversion of DNA to RNA (transcription), thereby orchestrating gene activity. Much of the early understanding of transcription came from prokaryotic organisms, although the extent and complexity of transcriptional regulation is greater in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic transcription is governed by three main sequence elements:
