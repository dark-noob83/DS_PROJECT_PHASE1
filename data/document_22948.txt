dexos® Licensing Program. GM Powertrain engineers developed the dexos® engine oil specification to meet the increasing demands of today’s engines. Fuel economy improvements combined with the need for engine oil robustness is driving change at an increased pace.
Confusing as it may be, dexos is not a brand or type of oil at all. Instead, dexos is a specification concocted by General Motors along with a license the auto maker sells to oil manufacturers. Oil specifications are nothing new.
In this case, GM appears to be looking to require this new dexos 1 specification for all motor oils which are to be used in ANY of their vehicles. In this way, claims GM, they will be able to consolidate the list of recommended oils for their vehicles to just 1 - any oil meeting the dexos 1 specifications.
General Motors is committed to designing, building, and selling cars that perform well and last a long time—and to making the experience of owning a GM vehicle highly rewarding. That's why GM Powertrain engineers developed the dexos ® engine oil specification. The result is engine oil designed specifically for your GM engine, with added performance in areas important to its operation. dexos ® represents a high quality, robust oil formulated to some of the most rigorous specifications in the industry.
A: Dexos is a GM specification that is designed for enhanced performance over GF-5 in fuel economy and potentially extended drain benefits. GM requires license and royalty payments to oil marketers that choose to license the dexos trademark on their branded products.
So, in those cases, if you go with a dexos 1 licensed 5w30 oil in a vehicle that calls for 5w20 or 0w20, you could cause yourself problems-even if only when dealing with service centers that will balk at your choice of viscosity. It's of little consequence, though.
