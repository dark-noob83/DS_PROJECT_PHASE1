In cases where an autopsy was not performed, a formal report is not provided. The OCME adheres to an established rule of priority for completing cases. Those that are a result of a homicide are completed within 60 days. For all other manners of death, the reports are completed within 90 days.
An autopsy is usually completed within 24 hours of receipt of the body at the Medical Examiner's Office. You may request a Medical Examiner Investigator to explain what procedures will be performed on the body and when it can be released to you for final disposition.
Preliminary autopsy reports are usually available on the next working day. Final autopsy reports are ready between 30 and 45 days later. Complex cases may take up to 90 days before a final report is complete.
An investigator and a medical examiner are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week to accept reports of death and to coordinate release of the body to the funeral director after normal business hours.
Autopsies are performed with 24 hours of death and are scheduled as soon as completed Autopsy Permission and Request Forms, in addition to patients' clinical records, are available and reviewed at the University of Florida Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine.
An average autopsy case takes about four hours. That's including all the paperwork. There is about a half an hour before and after the autopsy for doing the external examination, the dictation, the paperwork. The autopsy can take anywhere from one hour to two hours if it's an uncomplicated case. If it's a complicated case like a homicide ... it can take many hours -- 4 to 6 hours.
