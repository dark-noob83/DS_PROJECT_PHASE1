A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account to which you contribute after-tax dollars. Contributions and earnings can grow tax-free, and you can withdraw them tax-free after age 59½. Depending on your situation, a Roth IRA can be more flexible than a 401(k) or Traditional IRA.
You can contribute to a Roth at any age, even past retirement age, as long as you’re still earning taxable income. A working spouse can also contribute to a Roth IRA on behalf of a nonworking spouse. For a 401(k), the 2014 contribution limit is $17,500, unless you’re 50 or older, in which case the limit is $23,000.
For 2015, you can contribute the maximum $5,500 to a Roth IRA ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older by the end of the year) if you are single or the single head of a household and your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $164,000.
Clarifications. Although you can contribute to a Roth IRA during your retirement years, you cannot contribute unlimited amounts of money. The IRS enforces contribution limits for traditional and Roth IRAs regardless of age. In 2010, for example, you could contribute $6,000 if you are older than 50.
You can contribute up to $5,000 to your own Roth IRA (up to $6,000 if you’re 50 or older during the year) and up to $5,000 for your wife (or $6,000 if she’s 50 or older), as long as you earned at least as much for the year as the combined contributions.

You can contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA whether or not you participate in another retirement plan through your employer or business. However, you might not be able to deduct all of your traditional IRA contributions if you or your spouse participates in another retirement plan at work.
Roth vs. traditional IRA. Whether to use a Roth or a traditional IRA for those contributions depends on your individual tax situation. Hevert favors the Roth because there is no RMD, so funds can continue to grow throughout retirement and can be tapped at a later date in retirement or left to heirs in an estate.
