Everyone on SSI disability (Supplemental Security Income) is eligible for the same base amount, $733. But your actual monthly SSI payment will depend on whether you have any countable income, whether you are married, and what state you live in. 
If you and your spouse file a joint return with a combined income below $32,000, your benefits are out of reach. For income between $32,000 and $44,000, up to 50 percent of benefits may be taxable, and up to 85 percent if combined income is more than $44,000. For more information, go to Social Security's website. If income is between $25,000 and $34,000, up to 50 percent of your benefits may be subject to tax. For income of more than $34,000, up to 85 percent of your benefits may be considered taxable income. Subscribe to the AARP Money Newsletter for more on work, retirement, and finances.
The monthly payment amount for the SSI program is based on the federal benefit rate (FBR). In 2015, the FBR is $733 per month for individuals and $1,100 for couples (and the FBR increases annually if there is a Social Security cost-of-living adjustment). 
1 If your total income is more than the base amount, you might owe some tax on your Social Security benefits. 2  You can use the worksheet in the Form 1040 Instructions, or the efile.com tax preparation software, to find out exactly how much of your Social Security income is taxable. Learn more in Publication 915 - Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits. If you receive Social Security benefits, you will be sent a Form 1099-SSA, which will show the total dollar amount of your Social Security income for the year.
To qualify for SSI, you must have limited income and few assets. Social Security requires SSI recipients to have less than $2,000 in assets, for a single person, and $3,000 for a couple. The income limit is more complicated. The way Social Security counts income is different than the way we usually think of income. 
Your SSI payment will be reduced by the amount of any income that you have, except for certain amounts that Social Security may disregard. In particular, Social Security disregards the first $20 of any monthly income, and the first $65 of any earned income (wages from work or self-employment income). Then, Social Security disregards one-half of the remainder, leaving Sanjay with countable income each month of $307.50. To determine the amount of Sanjayâ€™s SSI payment, subtract $307.50 from the federal base rate of $721, and Sanjay will receive $413.50.
