the osmolality urine test measures the concentration of particles in urine osmolality particles per kilogram of water and osmolarity particles per liter of solution are sometimes confused but for dilute fluids such as urine they are essentially the same 
osmolality measures the concentration of all particles in a fluid for example a thick sugary syrup has significantly higher osmolality than a cup of water with just a pinch of sugar the urine osmolality test measures the amount of several compounds in your urine urine osmolality is measured in milliosmoles per kilogram a normal result is typically 500 to 850 milliosmoles per kilogram but may go slightly higher or lower if you have been placed on a fluid restriction for 12 to 14 hours before the test your results should be over 850 milliosmoles per kilogram
osmolality is a measure of the number of dissolved particles in a fluid the osmolality test reflects the concentration of substances such as sodium potassium chloride glucose and urea in a sample of blood urine or sometimes stool 
4 osmolarity is expressed as osm l and osmolality is expressed as osm kg 5 osmolality is used to determine medical conditions like diabetes shock and dehydration while osmolarity is used for the detection of the concentration of dissolved particles in urine 6 osmolality is the commonly used method of measurement in osmometry 
urine osmolality a measure of the number of dissolved particles per unit of water in the urine a more accurate measure of urine concentration than specific gravity urine osmolality is useful in diagnosing renal disorders of urinary concentration and dilution and in assessing status of hydration 
urine osmolarity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in a liter of urine the measurement is done in liters for reasons of scientific standardization even in countries that do not use metric measurement in a urinalysis one of the tests a lab technician will run is an osmolarity test a urine osmolarity tests looks at the concentration of urea sodium and glucose high urine osmolarity indicates that a patient s urine is too concentrated possibly as a result of dehydration or shock
definition the osmolality urine test the concentration of particles in urine osmolality particles kg water and osmolarity particles liter of solution are sometimes confused but for dilute fluids such as urine they are essentially the same a blood test may also be done to measure osmolality
urine osmolality is used to measure the number of dissolved particles per unit of water in the urine as a measure of urine concentration it is more accurate than specific gravity urine osmolality is useful in diagnosing disorders of urinary concentration such diabetes insipidous and in assessing hydration status a comparison of the urine osmolality to the serum osmolality yields additional information about water handling by the kidney or abnormalities of urine concentration or dilution as does electrolyte studies typically the ratio of urine osmolality to serum osmolality is 1 3
