Instead of trying to measure these vast distances in kilometers or AU units, you can specify them in light years. A light year -- 9,334,200,000,000 km (5,800,000,000,000 miles) -- is the distance light travels in one year. That makes Proxima Centauri's distance in light years 4.22. Its value is the average distance from Earth to the sun, or 149,600,000 kilometers (92,584,307 miles). Instead of expressing Pluto's distance in kilometers, you can simply say that it's 39.54 AU away.
Light years. We need a different unit of measurement, because at these distances, kilometres are too small to be much use. One unit for measuring very big distances is the light year. This is the distance that light travels in a year, so 1 light year is about 9 500 000 000 000 km. Using this unit, we say that the star Proxima Centauri is about 4.2 light years away. Even using this unit, numbers in space get pretty big. 1 You know what a kilometre is – you can walk that distance easily. 2  You know what 100 km is – that’s how far a car could travel in an hour at the speed limit on a main road. 3  Travel more than 100 km above the surface of the Earth, and you’re in space, at the edge of the atmosphere.
Instead, astronomers measure distances to objects which are outside our solar system in light-years. A light-year (ly) is the distance that light can travel in one year in a vacuum (empty space). The speed of light is about 186,000 miles or 300,000 kilometers per second. Parallax is a common method used to measure the distance to stars.  Suppose you look at an object (like a tree or far away building),  and measure the angle to it in referen … ce to something known. Then  you move a specific distance (say 100 meters), and take the same  angle measurement.
Numbers start getting really big when we look at distances from Earth to other planets in our Solar System. It’s 78 million kilometres (78 000 000 km) from Earth to Mars, and it’s 4350 million kilometres (4 350 000 000 km) to Neptune. 1 You know what a kilometre is – you can walk that distance easily. 2  You know what 100 km is – that’s how far a car could travel in an hour at the speed limit on a main road. 3  Travel more than 100 km above the surface of the Earth, and you’re in space, at the edge of the atmosphere.
An astronomical unit (A.U.) is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. Astronomical units are usually used to measure distances within our solar system. The speed of light is about 186,000 miles or 300,000 kilometers per second. So, in one year light travels a distance of about 5,880,000,000,000 miles or 9,460,000,000,000 kilometers or 63,240 A.U.. This distance is 1 light-year. For example, the nearest star to us is about 4.3 light-years away
Most objects in space are so far away, that using a relatively small unit of distance, such as an astronomical unit, is not practical. Instead, astronomers measure distances to objects which are outside our solar system in light-years. A light-year (ly) is the distance that light can travel in one year in a vacuum (empty space). The speed of light is about 186,000 miles or 300,000 kilometers per second. So, in one year light travels a distance of about 5,880,000,000,000 miles or 9,460,000,000,000 kilometers or 63,240 A.U.. This distance is 1 light-year. For example, the nearest star to us is about 4.3 light-years away
Report Abuse. The unit of measurement of distance in space is the distance that light could travel over a period of one year at the rate of 186000 mile per second. because distances of such immense magnitutude are very long and difficult to write and pronounce in terms of figures ,as tromers have adopted such a scale. Now if your question is how to measure a distance between object just by looking at a light coming from it, it may done by looking at half-life time of photons. Somebody technical at particle physics may give a detail answer on this.
Answer: It is not an easy thing to measure the distances to objects in the universe since these objects are usually very far away. We can't just run out there with a ruler! To measure distances in the universe, we will need to construct what is commonly referred to as a cosmic distance ladder. The links below will take you to descriptions of various common methods. 1  Radar-measuring distances in our solar system. 2  Parallax-measuring distances to nearby stars. 3  Cepheids-measuring distances in our Galaxy and to nearby galaxies.
