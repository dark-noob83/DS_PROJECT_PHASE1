Most home speakers are rated at 8 ohms impedence, while car stereo speakers are rated all over the place, generally 4 to 10 ohms. A 4 ohm speaker will require twice as much power to operate as an 8 ohm speaker and a 10 ohm speaker will require less power to operate as an 8 ohm speaker would.
I'm looking to use some car speakers and a car stereo system to make a home audio system. While I recently had BestBuy install my car speakers, I noticed that the employee had a small stereo system made of car speakers and a car stereo system. I was wondering if anyone here knew how to go about making one.
You can use the woofer drivers IF you build an appropriate box for home use. The existing car amplifiers that came with the package (if I understand you correctly) will have to be left out. There is no way that I know of to adapt them to the home stereo. The existing car boxes are probably not good for home use either.
Most speakers are interchangeable and can be used in different audio systems. For example, you can wire old radio speakers into a guitar amplifier, or use PC speakers in your car or truck. So if you have a pair of car speakers you want to use in your home audio system, you can quickly make the transition.
With home stereos and their preference for 8 ohm speakers, it's generally OK to use 4 ohm speakers, but don't expect a full volume to come from them as you would from your car. The stereo has to work about twice as hard to deliver the same volume as they would from the 8 ohm speakers.
This is especially true of speakers since they are passive devices. But you do need to make sure your home stereo unit can handle the lower impedance of most car speakers. The typical car speaker is four ohms and most home receivers are designed for eight ohms. You would either need a receiver capable of driving four ohms or you would need to wire a pair of identical drivers in series to get
