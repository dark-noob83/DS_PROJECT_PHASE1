Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together. Embedded within the heme molecule is iron that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood. The iron contained in hemoglobin is also responsible for the red color of blood. Hemoglobin also plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells.
In fetuses and infants, beta chains are not common and the hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two gamma chains. As the infant grows, the gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains, forming the adult hemoglobin structure. Embedded within the heme molecule is iron that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood. The iron contained in hemoglobin is also responsible for the red color of blood. Hemoglobin also plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells.
Normal hemoglobin values are related to the person's age and sex. Normal values may vary slightly between test systems, and which groups of doctors have determined normal values for their group of patients; however, the value ranges are close (vary by about 0.5 g/dl) for almost every group. An example of normal ranges that is widely accepted by Family Practice physicians is as follows: 1  Birth: 13.5 to 24.0 g/dl (mean 16.5 g/dl). 2  Age 1-2 months: 10.0 to 18.0 g/dl (mean 11.2 g/dl). 3  Age 2-6 months: 9.5 to 14.0 g/dl (mean 12.6 g/dl).
Hemoglobin Levels for Children. Children need optimal oxygenation for normal growth and development. According to the World Health Organization, a normal hemoglobin level for children age 6 months to 4 years is at or above 11 g/dL. A normal levels for children ages 5 to 12 years is at or above 11.5 g/dL. A normal level for adolescents ages 12 to 15 is at or above 12.0 g/dL. Any hemoglobin values below these cut-points can indicate anemia, a disorder characterized by a low red blood cell count, as well as low hemoglobin and hemocrit. Normal hemoglobin levels vary, depending on your age, sex, you health and where you live. Children need optimal oxygenation for normal growth and development. According to the World Health Organization, a normal hemoglobin level for children age 6 months to 4 years is at or above 11 g/dL.
Normal Adult Range: 80 - 100 fl Optimal Adult Reading: 90 Higher ranges are found in newborns and infants [ back to top ] MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration) - Hemoglobin concentration (hemoglobin amount relative to the size of the cell) per red blood cell. 
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter. 
Due to the postnatal decrease in oxygen affinity, the minimum acceptable hemoglobin concentration decreases by approximately 1 g/dl/week for the first 5-6 weeks until the minimum value of 6 g/dl for children and adults is reached. The calculated minimum acceptable hemoglobin concentration is 6 g/dl for children and adults, 12 g/dl for preterm infants and 11 g/dl for full-term neonates at birth.
1 Age 2 to 6 years: 11.5 to 13.5 g/dl (mean 12.5 g/dl). 2  Age 6-12 years: 11.5 to 15.5 g/dl (mean 13.5). 3  Female. 4  Age 12-18 years: 12.0 to 16.0 g/dl (mean 14.0 g/dl). An example of normal ranges that is widely accepted by Family Practice physicians is as follows: 1  Birth: 13.5 to 24.0 g/dl (mean 16.5 g/dl). 2  Age 1-2 months: 10.0 to 18.0 g/dl (mean 11.2 g/dl). 3  Age 2-6 months: 9.5 to 14.0 g/dl (mean 12.6 g/dl).
The reference ranges for hemoglobin concentration in children are as follows: Birth: mean 16.5 g/dL (-2SD: 13.5 g/dL). 1-3 days: mean 18.5 g/dL (-2SD: 14.5 g/dL). 1 week: mean 17.5 g/dL (-2SD: 13.5 g/dL). 2 weeks: mean 16.5 g/dL (-2SD: 12.5 g/dL). Hemoglobin is the main component of red blood cells and serves as the transporter for oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. Hemoglobin concentration (Hb) is usually reported as grams of hemoglobin per deciliter of blood (g/dL). Hb is commonly measured by the cyanhemoglobin (hemoglobin cyanide) method.
