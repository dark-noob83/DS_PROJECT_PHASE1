Well, those calories will all come from carbs. And, since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, you’d just need to divide this left over amount of calories by 4 to figure out exactly how many grams of carbs you’d need to eat each day. 1 First you figured out how many calories you need to eat per day for your specific goal (losing fat, building muscle, or maintaining your current weight). 2  From there you figured out where those calories should come from each day by calculating your ideal daily intake of protein, fat and just now, carbs.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs. Percent of Calories. According to the Institute of Medicine, children and adults should consume 45 to 65 percent of their calorie intake as carbohydrates, and at least 130 grams of carbs per day.
Dietary Fiber. Fiber is included in the daily intake of total carbohydrates, but it also has separate guidelines to ensure children get an adequate amount. From the ages of 1 to 3 years, all children need 19 grams of fiber daily. They should consume 25 grams daily between the ages of 4 to 8 years. At the age of 9, boys need 31 grams of fiber daily, and when they turn 14, their requirement increases to 38 grams. Girls should consume 26 grams of fiber daily from age 9 to 18. Starches are healthy complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, vegetables, beans and fruits. They break down more slowly during digestion, so they provide long-term energy and have less impact on blood sugar. Children who are 2 to 3 years old need 1 cup each of fruits and vegetables and 3 ounces of grains daily.

You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label. The Nutrition Facts label shows total carbohydrates, which includes starches, fiber, sugar alcohols, and naturally occurring and added sugars.
1 All of those 1155 calories will come from carbs. 2  And, since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, all our example person would need to do now is divide 1155 by 4 and get 288. 3  Which means, this example person would need to eat about 288 grams of carbs per day. 1 First you figured out how many calories you need to eat per day for your specific goal (losing fat, building muscle, or maintaining your current weight). 2  From there you figured out where those calories should come from each day by calculating your ideal daily intake of protein, fat and just now, carbs.
