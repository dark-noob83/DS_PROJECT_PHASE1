Because an Xtreme Lash® is an exact replica of an eyelash, it weighs about as much as a natural lash: practically nothing. You will not notice the addition of the extensions to your lashes and they will not cause your natural lashes to fall out ahead of their natural cycle as other enhancement methods can.

They are applied on to individual eyelashes, one extension at a time, for a natural, elegant look to lengthen and add fullness to the existing lashes. Xtreme Lashes® Eyelash Extensions are for professional application only.
