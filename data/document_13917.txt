Siberian Huskies can be so small and cute as puppies, but how big does a Siberian Husky get? The AKC Siberian Husky Standard quotes an acceptable range for an adult male to be between 21 and 23.5 inches tall (53 to 60cm) and weighing 45 to 60 pounds (20 to 27kg). Females are a little smaller, between 20 and 22 inches tall (51 to 56cm), and weight between 35 and 50 pounds (16 to 23kg).
