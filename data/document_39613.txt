All you have to do is remember one number: four. As in four months. Kittens can get pregnant as early as four months and puppies as early as six months, which means a litter of “uh-oh’s” can happen sooner than you think. By spaying and neutering your pet at four months, you can stop the accidents before they happen.
Kittens can be spayed as early as 6 weeks; however, ideally they should be spayed between 8 weeks to 6 months. That is called Juvenile or Early spay. The younger the kitten, the more quickly they recover and less pain they experience.

I have 5 kittens + mom that need to be fixed. (Spayed etc) and I was wondering what is the earliest age that you can do that to kittens. I know with Mama cat I can get her done when her kittens are 8 weeks old. Im asking because I dont really want to give them away until they have been fixed so that I don't have to worry about others allowing them to breed.
Congratulations on your new kitten! Male kittens are usually neutered at between 4 to 6 months of age. However, the AVMA has endorsed early age neutering of dogs and cats 8 to 16 weeks of age. You and your vet can decide what is the best time starting in a few weeks.
