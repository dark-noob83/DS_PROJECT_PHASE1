For a male OR female, drinking about 2 liters of fluid a day, the normal urine output should be 800 to 2,000 milliliters a day. Urine output below 500 milliliters a day is c â€¦ onsidered a low urine output and is a sign of disease. What is the normal daily urine output of a 4 year old? The normal daily urine output for a 4 year old child is 600-700 ml.
Normal Urinary Output. The normal range for an adult urinary output is between 400 to 2,000 mL of urine daily -- with a normal fluid intake of about 2 liters per day. Values for normal urinary output may vary slightly between laboratories. A urine output of 500 mL per day is generally considered adequate for normal function. When the kidneys aren't functioning properly, waste and fluid that are typically removed from your body in the urine can accumulate and cause disease. The normal range for an adult urinary output is between 400 to 2,000 mL of urine daily -- with a normal fluid intake of about 2 liters per day.
Background. Oliguria is defined as a urine output that is less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants, less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children, and less than 400 mL daily in adults.

Urine output in mL/kg/hr = (Total Urine Output/Weight in Kg)/# of hours Minimum acceptable output: Adult: 0.5-1.0 mL/kg/hr Child: 1.0-2.0 mL/kg/hr. Pediatric Urine Output Calculation is made easier.
Answer by Gvlalonde. Confidence votes 132. Average daily intake for an adult is 1200-1500 ml and the output should be equivalent to the intake. The partial answer of 1200-1500 ml seems to only address intake of oral fluids and output of urine fluids. A more complete answer includes fluid input from food and fluid output from stools, perspiration and respiration.
Confidence votes 334. The expected urine output for an adult is 0.5ml/kg/hr. This roughly equates to 30-40ml per hour in an average sized adult. For children, it is closer to 1ml/kg/hr. Text books recomend an adult should be 0.5 - 1 ml/kg/hr. What is the normal daily urine output of a 4 year old? The normal daily urine output for a 4 year old child is 600-700 ml.
Normal Urine Output. Normal urine output is 800-2000 mm each day if you take in around 2 liters of fluid throughout the day. However, normal values can vary in different laboratories. Some testing facilities will use different test samples or measurements to reach their conclusions. Decreased urine output or oliguria is a condition that causes the body to produce less than 400 millimeters of urine a day. This is not to be confused with conditions where people fail to urinate at all, or conditions like anuria when you produce 50 mm of urine or less.
