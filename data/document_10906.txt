Arteries. The arteries are major blood vessels connected to your heart. 1  The pulmonary artery carries blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs to pick up a fresh supply of oxygen. 2  The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left side of the heart to the body.
The pulmonary arteries transport deoxygenated blood to the left and right lungs. And interesting fact is that the pulmonary arteries are the only arteries that carry deoxygena â€¦ ted blood. All other arteries deliver blood, enriched with oxygen and other nutrients to our body's tissues.
Arteries carry blood away from the heart. Pulmonary arteries transport blood that has a low oxygen content from the right ventricle to the lungs. Systemic arteries transport oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the body tissues.

The pulmonary artery transports blood from the heart to the lungs. While most major arteries branch off from the aorta, the main pulmonary artery extends from the right ventricle of the heart and branches into left and right pulmonary arteries.
The main artery splits into the left pulmonary artery and the right pulmonary artery, each of which directs the blood to the corresponding lung. Along with the umbilical arteries, these are the sole arteries in the body that transport oxygen-depleted blood. The umbilical arteries are located in the uterus.
The pulmonary arteries are unique in that unlike most arteries which carry oxygenated blood to other parts of the body, the pulmonary arteries carry de-oxygenated blood to the lungs. After picking up oxygen, the oxygen rich blood is returned to the heart via the pulmonary veins. 1 of 1. 1.
