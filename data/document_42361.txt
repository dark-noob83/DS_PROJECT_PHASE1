The Alkali Metals are the first group in the periodic table. They include Lithium, Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium, Cesium, and Francium. The Alkali Metals have closer similarities between the elements than in any other group of
The alkali metals are a group (column) in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr).
The alkali metals are the six metals of Group 1 in the Periodic Table â€“ lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, ceasium (cesium) , and francium. Only lithium, sodium and potassium are safe enough to keep in the school lab.
alkaline-earth metals. alkaline-earth metals metals constituting Group 2 of the periodic table. Generally, they are softer than most other metals, react readily with water (especially when heated), and are powerful reducing agents, but they are exceeded in each of these properties by the corresponding alkali metal.
The alkali metals are the elements that make up Group 1 of the periodic table: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium.
The alkali metals are a group of elements in the periodic table. They are all in the first column of the periodic table. The only element in the first column that is not usually considered an alkali metal is hydrogen. Hydrogen and the alkali metals make up the group 1 elements
Alkali metals are in the first column of the periodic table, but do not include Hydrogen. The alkali metal family is composed of Lithium, Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium, Cesium and Francium. An example of an alkali metal is Sodium (Na).
Examples of alkali metals: lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), ceasium (Cs), and francium (Fr). Although Hydrogen, is a member of group sometimes exhibit the properties of alkali metals. Examples of halogens are Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br) and Iodine (I).
