Ethanol is a renewable, domestically produced alcohol fuel made from plant material, such as corn, sugar cane, or grasses. Using ethanol can reduce oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions. Ethanol fuel use in the U.S. has increased dramatically from about 1.7 billion gallons in 2001 to about 13.2 billion in 2013. Since ethanol contains about two-thirds as much energy as gasoline, vehicles will typically go 3% to 4% fewer miles per gallon on E10 and 4% to 5% fewer on E15 than on 100% gasoline.
Most of the gasoline now sold in the United States contains some ethanol, but the exact amount varies by region. In general, the ethanol content of motor gasoline does not exceed 10% by volume. Gasoline with 10% ethanol content is referred to as E10, and gasoline with 15% ethanol content is called E15. E85 is a fuel that averages 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Most of the motor gasoline with more than 10% ethanol is sold in the Midwest. All gasoline vehicles can use E10
MPG. Due to ethanol's lower energy content, FFVs operating on E85 get roughly 15% to 30% fewer miles per gallon than when operating on regular gasoline, which typically contains about 10% ethanol. 5. Cost. The cost of E85 relative to gasoline or E10 can vary due to location and fluctuations in energy markets. Since ethanol contains about two-thirds as much energy as gasoline, vehicles will typically go 3% to 4% fewer miles per gallon on E10 and 4% to 5% fewer on E15 than on 100% gasoline.
GREENHOUSE. One litre of ethanol produces 1.5kg of CO2 when you burn it. One litre of petrol emits 2.2kg of CO2. But since 1.4 litres of ethanol and 1.0 litre of petrol contain the same amount of energy, maybe that’s a better CO2 yardstick comparison. And 1.4 litres of CO2 emits 2.15kg of CO2 – so, joule-for-joule, there’s not much in it from an. emissions perspective. Car engines don’t like to start in the cold on E100. Which is why E85 is pretty much the upper limit for ethanol/petrol blends.) You need to burn 1.4 litres of ethanol to get the same energy as one litre of petrol.
Ethanol is a renewable fuel made from various plant materials collectively known as  biomass .. More than 95% of U.S. gasoline contains ethanol, typically E10 (10% ethanol, 90% gasoline), to oxygenate the fuel and reduce air pollution. Ethanol is also available as E85, or high-level ethanol blends.
E85 (Flex Fuel). E85, also called flex fuel, is an ethanol-gasoline blend containing 51% to 83% ethanol, depending on geography and season—summer blends tend to have more ethanol while winter blends have less. 4 E85 can be used in FFVs, which are specially designed to run on gasoline, E85, or any mixture of the two. Since ethanol contains about two-thirds as much energy as gasoline, vehicles will typically go 3% to 4% fewer miles per gallon on E10 and 4% to 5% fewer on E15 than on 100% gasoline.
In 2003 these limits were set at a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 25%. Since July 1, 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of anhydrous ethanol and 75% gasoline or E25 blend. The lower limit was reduced to 18% in April 2011 due to recurring ethanol supply shortages and high prices that take place between harvest seasons. There are no longer any light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline. Since 1976 the government made it mandatory to blend anhydrous ethanol with gasoline, fluctuating between 10% to 22%. and requiring just a minor adjustment on regular gasoline engines.
E10 and E15 are blends of ethanol and gasoline—the number after the E indicates the percentage of ethanol by volume. Most of the gasoline sold in the U.S. contains up to 10% ethanol—the amount varies by region—and all auto manufacturers approve blends up to E10 in their gasoline vehicles. Since ethanol contains about two-thirds as much energy as gasoline, vehicles will typically go 3% to 4% fewer miles per gallon on E10 and 4% to 5% fewer on E15 than on 100% gasoline.
