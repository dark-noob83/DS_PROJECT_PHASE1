Best Answer: There are only a couple, maybe three states that allow someone under 21 to obtain a concealed carry permit, and I don't think Ohio is one of them. However, even states that do allow it are not recognized in other states if you travel.
The fee for a new permit to carry will be determined by the county sheriff, not to exceed $100. A fee for a renewal permit (applied for before the expiration date of a current permit to carry) will be determined by the county sheriff, not to exceed $75.
During this time your past permit is not valid, and you will not be able to carry until your renewal permit has been approved and issued. 31 days after expiration, you will no longer be able to renew your permit, but will have to apply for a new gun permit.
Who can get a permit?Any Louisiana resident who is over 21 years old, who is not a convicted felon, who has had no DUI or drug related misdemeanors in the last 5 years, who has notbeen discharged from the military under other than honorable terms, and who has no violent misdemeanors in the last 5 years.
In general, every state in the U.S. issues a gun permit, concealed weapons permit, concealed handgun permit, or some variation of that, except for Wisconsin, Illinois, and the â€¦ District of Columbia. Each states sets its own requirements to obtain the permit.
Next. I'm just curious, i am 20 years old and i know in most states you have to be 21 but i was wondering if there was any other ways to get one earlier than 21 or if i just have to wait the year out. Thanks :). Follow.
Typically, it's going to be 21 - the same age you need to be in order to own a handgun in the first place. IMPROVING ANSWER: Actually, many states allow 18, 19, and 20 year olds to own and possess a handgun, even though federal law says they are too young to buy a handgun or handgun ammunition from an FFL dealer.
