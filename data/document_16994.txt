A curmudgeon with years of practice. Not only do aardvarks have teeth they have interesting teeth. The adult aardvark's teeth have no enamel (hard) coating so the teeth are worn away easily. The aardvark's teeth regrow all of its life. new born aardvarks have some conventional teeth (incisors and canines) but these fall out and are not replaced. this leaves the adult with its soft teeth and cheek teeth at the back of the jaw.
Aardvarks do have teeth; however these teeth are located at the back of the jaw and are often referred to as “cheek teeth”. The aardvark’s teeth are actually even one of its most distinctive characteristics.
One of the most distinctive characteristics of the aardvark is their teeth. Instead of having a pulp cavity in their tooth, they have a number of thin tubes of dentine (a calcified tissue of the body), each containing pulp held together by cementum (a specialized calcified substance covering the root of a tooth).
It is because of this that their teeth are easily worn away. The aardvark’s teeth continue to grow throughout its life and new born aardvarks have some conventional teeth such as incisors and canines, however these fall out and are not replaced. An aardvark’s teeth are very soft.
