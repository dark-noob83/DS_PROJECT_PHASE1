Presence of the tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibody is associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathies such as celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.
Common tests for celiac disease include: 1  Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG), IgA: detects antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, an enzyme that causes the crosslinking of certain proteins. 2  Anti-tTG, IgA is the most sensitive and specific blood test for celiac disease.
A tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA and/or IgG test is used as part of an evaluation for certain autoimmune conditions, most notably celiac disease. An autoimmune disease can occur when the body's immune system mistakenly perceives a nonthreatening substance.
The finding of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies is specific for celiac disease and possibly for dermatitis herpetiformis. For individuals with moderately to strongly positive results, a diagnosis of celiac disease is likely and the patient should undergo biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

Tissue Transglutaminase Antibody, IgA, is useful in diagnosing gluten-sensitive enteropathies, such as Celiac Sprue Disease, and an associated skin condition, dermatitis herpetiformis. The IgG test is useful in patients who are IgA-deficient.
