Echinoderms. Echinoderms are a group of invertebrates that includes starfish, sea lilies, feather stars, brittlestars, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins and many others. There are about 600 species of echinoderms alive today. 7 Articles in: Echinoderms-Animals and Wildlife-About.com. Echinoderms are a group of marine invertebrates that includes star fish, sea lilies, feather stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers and sea urchins.

Echinoderms also display radial symmetry as do the jellyfish and sea anemones. If you want to tag the one thing that echinoderms have that no other living invertebrate has, you would probably have to point to their water vascular system (see link).

Echinoderms are fairly advanced invertebrates. This is evident in their embryology, which is similar to that of the vertebrates. Most species of echinoderms are diecious, meaning there are separate male and female individuals. The most striking feature of all echinoderms is their pentamerous radial symmetry. That is, the body can be divided into five parts (or appendages) which point outward from the center of the body. Interestingly, although most mature echinoderms are radially symmetrical, the larvae usually have bilater
By Laura Klappenbach. Sea urchins and sand dollars (Echinoidea) are a group of echinoderms that are spiny, globe or disk shaped animals. Sea urchins and sand dollars are found in all the world's oceans. Like most other echinoderms, they are pentaradially symmetrical (the have five sides arranged around a central point). Sea urchins feed on algae for the most part although some species also feed occasionally on other invertebrates such as sponges, brittle stars, sea cucumbers and mussels. Although they appear to be sessile (attached to the sea floor or substrate) they are capable of moving.
Animals can be classified into two main groups: vertebrates and invertebrates. The main difference between vertebrates and invertebrates is that invertebrates, like insects and flatworms, do not have a backbone or a spinal column. Examples of vertebrates include humans, birds, and snakes.

Echinoderms are marine invertebrates, they dwell under the sea unlike that of others that mostly live in land. Echinoderms are the only invertebrates that have five sided radial symmetry. Some may only have radial symmetry for part of their lives. Some, as adults, exhibit bilateral sym … metry.
