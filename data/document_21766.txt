contribution margin ratio. This ratio indicates the percentage of each sales dollar that is available to cover a company's fixed expenses and profit. The ratio is calculated by dividing the contribution margin (sales minus all variable expenses) by sales. 
To solve for this equation, you first need to solve for the contribution margin, which is revenue minus variable expenses. If a company has $100 in revenue from sales and $30 in variable expenses, then its contribution margin is $100 - $30 = $70. In this case, the contribution margin ratio is $70 / $100 = .70. Multiply .70 by 100 to change the decimal into a percentage and you get 70 percent.
Contribution Margin Increase. The contribution margin ratio increases when sales increase. For every $1 increase in sales, profits increase by the contribution margin ratio. For example, if a company’s contribution margin ratio is 25 percent, it is earning roughly 25 cents in profit for every one dollar in sales. If the contribution margin increases to 35 percent due to increased sales, the company earns 35 cents for every one dollar in sales. If a company has $100 in revenue from sales and $30 in variable expenses, then its contribution margin is $100 - $30 = $70. In this case, the contribution margin ratio is $70 / $100 = .70. Multiply .70 by 100 to change the decimal into a percentage and you get 70 percent.
On a cash basis, divide $4,200 by the contribution margin ratio of 43.75 percent to figure your break-even weekly revenue of $9,600. When higher supply costs lower your contribution margin per car to $6, your new BEP equals $4,200 divided by $6, or 700 cars per week. On a cash basis, divide $5,460 by the new contribution margin percentage of 37.5 percent to compute the required weekly revenue of $14,560, a $2,080 increase. Calculating contribution margin percentage and the BEP tells you what you have to do.
The contribution margin, sometimes used as a ratio, is the difference between a company's total sales revenue and variable costs. In other words, the contribution margin equals the amount that sales exceed variable costs. This is the sales amount that can be used to, or contributed to, pay off fixed costs. 
Iverson’s contribution margin ratio is 60%, so if it wants to break even, it needs to either reduce its fixed expenses by $60,000 or increase its sales by $100,000 (calculated as $60,000 loss divided by 60% contribution margin ratio). To calculate the contribution margin ratio, divide the contribution margin by sales. The contribution margin is calculated by subtracting all variable costs from sales.
We use the contribution margin ratio to do this. Using the same example, variable expenses of $0.80 are 40% of sales of $2.00 per unit ($0.80/$2.00). To calculate breakeven in dollars, divide its fixed expenses by the contribution margin ratio of 60% ($60,000/.6 = $100,000). This means that the company has to make $100,000 in sales to breakeven. The contribution margin ratio is an important financial metric to calculate the profit potential for a business firm. If the dollar amount of sales increases by one dollar, in this example, the contribution margin increases by 60 cents.
Product Revenue-Product Variable Costs Product Revenue. The phrase contribution margin can also refer to a per unit measure of a product's gross operating margin, calculated simply as the product's price minus its total variable costs. 
A product line’s contribution margin ratio equals the difference between revenues and variable expenses divided by revenues. It’s the percentage of each product’s revenue that contributes to paying your fixed costs. On a cash basis, divide $5,460 by the new contribution margin percentage of 37.5 percent to compute the required weekly revenue of $14,560, a $2,080 increase. Calculating contribution margin percentage and the BEP tells you what you have to do.
Contribution Margin Ratio | Contribution Margin Formula. The contribution margin ratio is the difference between a company's sales and variable expenses, expressed as a percentage. The total margin generated by an entity represents the total earnings available to pay for fixed expenses and generate a profit. To calculate the contribution margin ratio, divide the contribution margin by sales. The contribution margin is calculated by subtracting all variable costs from sales.
