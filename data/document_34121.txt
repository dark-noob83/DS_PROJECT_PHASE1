1 A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. 2  A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. 3  If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes. 4  Oral glucose tolerance test. 1 A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal. 2  A reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours indicates diabetes.
A normal blood glucose level is less than 6.1 mmol/L, when measured after a fast. In general, a normal glucose would be less than 7.8 mmol/L if taken about 2 hours after eating. Within 3 hours of eating, the glucose should be under 6.1 again. 
A normal fasting blood glucose target range for an individual without diabetes is 70-100 mg/dL (3.9-5.6 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70–130 mg/dL (3.9-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 90-130 mg/dL (5.0-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). If your doctor feels that you are pre-diabetic it would be okay to check a fasting blood sugar at home once a week or so.
Independent of what they eat, the blood sugar of a truly normal person is: Under 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/L) one or two hours after a meal. Most normal people are under 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/L) two hours after eating. Blood sugars under 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) are considered to be hypoglycemic and should be avoided.
Between 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) and 92 mg/dl (5.0 mmol/L) . This is the finding of a considerable body of research. People whose blood sugar tests at this level do not develop diabetes over the next decade or longer. Those with supposedly normal blood sugars above 92 mg/dl often do. Under 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/L) one or two hours after a meal. Most normal people are under 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/L) two hours after eating. Blood sugars under 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) are considered to be hypoglycemic and should be avoided.
Blood sugar level (or blood sugar concentration) is the amount of glucose (a source of energy) present in your blood at any given time. A normal blood glucose level for a healthy person is somewhere between 72 mg/dL (3.8 to 4 mmol/L) and 108 mg/dL (5.8 to 6 mmol/L). It, of course, depends on every individual alone.
1 A blood sample will be taken after an overnight fast. 2  A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. 3  A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. 4  If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes. 1 A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal. 2  A reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours indicates diabetes.
Adults. A normal blood sugar level is between 72 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (4 to 6 mmol/L) for a healthy person. The concentration of glucose in the blood of a healthy person in the morning on an empty stomach is between 68 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (3.8 and 6.0 mmol/L). A normal blood glucose level for a healthy person is somewhere between 72 mg/dL (3.8 to 4 mmol/L) and 108 mg/dL (5.8 to 6 mmol/L). It, of course, depends on every individual alone.
The normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L (70 to 100 mg/dL). The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. For people with diabetes maintaining 'tight diabetes control', the American Diabetes Association recommends a post-meal glucose level of less than 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) and a fasting plasma glucose of 3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L (70–130 mg/dL). The actual amount of glucose in the blood and body fluids is very small. In a healthy adult male of 75 kg with a blood volume of 5 liters, a blood glucose level of 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) amounts to 5g, slightly less than two typical American restaurant sugar packets for coffee or tea
