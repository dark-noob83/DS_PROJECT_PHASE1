absence in phenylketonuria. phenylketonuria (PKU). ...of the body to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is normally converted in the human body to tyrosine, another amino acid, by a specific organic catalyst, or enzyme, called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is not active in individuals who have
The PAH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for the first step in processing phenylalanine, which is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) obtained through the diet. Phenylalanine is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for the conversion of phenylalanine to another amino acid, tyrosine. The enzyme works with a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to carry out this chemical reaction.
The first enzyme in the catabolic pathway for phenylalanine (Fig. 17-26), phenylalanine hydroxylase, catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. A genetic defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for the disease phenylketonuria (PKU).
