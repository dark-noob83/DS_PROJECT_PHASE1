The Munsters was one of the two creepy sitcoms that began in 1964. CBS aired The Munsters and ABC aired The Addams Family.
On October 26, 2012, NBC aired a modern reimagining of The Munsters called Mockingbird Lane as a pilot. The series failed to be picked up by NBC despite success with Munster fans and good ratings.
America is going to get a chance to see NBC's rebooted Munsters pilot Mockingbird Lane after all. Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the network has decided to air the pricey $10 million pilot, which has been in development for two years, as a Halloween special. Mockingbird Lane will air Friday, Oct. 26 at 8 p.m. before Grimm (Oct. 31 is a Wednesday). NBC declined to comment.
(Robert Pine, long before his regular series role in CHiPs, appeared in it as a suitor for Marilyn, the ugly black sheep of the family.) A second spin-off, called The Munsters' Revenge, aired on television 15 years later on February 27, 1981, but with the same three leads.
Of all of these programs, The Munsters is, to this day, the greatest of all of these series'. It manages to translate through the 50+ years it's been on the air without a scratch on it. The only things about this show that gives it's age away are the hairstyles and the facts that it's filmed in black and white.
The Munsters was an instant hit upon its debut. By the end of the first season, it was in the number eight slot. Beverly Owen, the first Marilyn, only did the pilot as a favor to her boyfriend, one of the producers (he later became her husband and produced Sesame Street).
One day Jerry Hensler, the head of creative development at Universal Studios called up Al and said that he was sending a script that he wanted Al and Fred to appear in. They did a 16 minute presentation to Grey Advertising and it was sold to sponsors. That began The Munsters. It was written primarily for Fred and Al.
