Adaptation. Flowering plants are considered by botanists to be more advanced than ferns. Seeds have enabled flowering plants to spread to different climate conditions that are not moist enough to enable fern reproduction. In moist, low-light conditions, such as a rainforest floor, ferns have the advantage over flowering plants because they can survive with less light. A fossil of an ancient fern species.
Ferns are an ancient group of plants dating back about 300 million years. They are most closely related to mosses and liverworts. They never have flowers and fruits but instead reproduce by spores typically produced on the lower side of the fronds or leaves or on specialized spore-bearing fronds.
As we know them now, most ferns are leafy plants that grow in moist areas under forest canopy. They are vascular plants with well-developed internal vein structures that promote the flow of water and nutrients.
1. Flowering plants (including trees) produce seeds, while ferns produce spores. A chief difference between spores and seeds is that spores have very little stored food resources compared with seeds, and thus require more favorable conditions in order to successfully germinate.
The first is that ferns are (relatively) delicate plants that only grow in areas where there are suitably moist conditions. They favour sheltered areas under the forest canopy, along creeks and streams and other sources of permanent moisture. They cannot grow readily in hot dry areas like flowering plants and conifers.
Vascular plants are a foundation of life on Earth. Both ferns and flowering plants turn sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into food and oxygen. The fern family is ancient, whereas the flowering plant family, called angiosperms, is a more recent evolutionary development.
