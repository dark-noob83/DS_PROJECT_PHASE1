This will create a paste that the rub will stick to. Here is a recipe for the rub I use on pork shoulders. After you apply a layer of mustard to the pork shoulder, completely coat the shoulder with a good BBQ rub. I have found that it helps to pat the rub into the shoulder to make it stick better. Make sure you have some brown sugar in your rub to add flavor. This also creates a nice bark on the pork shoulder. 3.Wrap the shoulder in plastic wrap, and refrigerate over night. 4. Take the pork shoulder out of the fridge about 1 hour before you are going to put it on the smoker.
1 Place pork shoulder in a large pot and add enough apple cider to cover. 2  Combine white sugar, brown sugar, salt, paprika, onion powder, black pepper, and garlic powder in a bowl. 3  Mix about 1/4 cup sugar rub into cider; reserve remaining rub. 4  Cover pot and refrigerate for 12 hours.
When I get ready to do my favorite pork shoulder recipe which is basically a nice pork butt rubbed down real good with my own proprietary rub recipe and smoked with a good dose of oak and some apricot or peach or some other fruit wood, I like to find a piece of meat that has lots of good fat marbling.
Give it a stir and mix it up well. And here's the star of the show: a pork shoulder roast. Sometimes pork shoulder is also called pork butt and it's going to have a little bit of shoulder blade bone here, but mostly it's boneless, this one's about 5 1/2 lbs. I like to use 1 Tablespoon of dry rub per 2 lbs. of meat. So I have about 3 Tablespoons of dry rub that I'm sprinkling on.
I always rub the pork shoulder down with a light layer of Frenchâ€™s yellow mustard to help the rub to stick better throughout the smoke and apply about 1/2 to 3/4 cups of my rub to the outside of the meat being careful to massage it into every nick and cranny.
