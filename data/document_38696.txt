1 Zesting with a grater will give you a zest that is slightly coarser than a microplane. 2  Using a microplane will give you a very fine zest. 3  Wash the orange thoroughly before zesting. 4  Use soap and water to remove pesticides, waxes and dyes. 5  Using a vegetable peeler or knife will leave you with larger strips of zest.
Orange zest is the top layer of an orange's peel. It contains the fruit's oils and adds a bright citrus flavor to a variety of dishes. There are several kitchen utensils you can use to zest an orange, including a microplane, grater, vegetable peeler or knife. See Step 1 to start making fresh orange zest.

It is valued for the strong citrus flavor it imparts to food, thanks to an abundance of perfumy, aromatic oils in the rind. To remove the zest from the fruit, use a utensil called a zester or a sharp paring knife or vegetable peeler. Peel off only the colored portion of the rind; the white pith can be bitter rather than flavorful. Then mince or leave it in strips as the recipe dictates. Some recipes call for grated zest.
Four Methods: Zesting with a Microplane or Grater Zesting with a Cocktail Zester Zesting with a Vegetable Peeler Zesting with a Paring Knife. Your poor ancestors had to skin the hide of the might lemon with nothing but stone knives.
A kitchen zester is approximately four inches long, with a handle and a curved metal end, the top of which is perforated with a row of round holes with sharpened rims. To operate, the zester is pressed with moderate force against the fruit and drawn across its peel. The rims cut the zest from the pith underneath.
On a lemon, zest is the yellow part of the peel (skin) on the outside of a lemon. The zest is shiny, brightly colored, and textured; it is the outer surface of the fruit which consumers can directly see.
