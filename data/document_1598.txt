Nucleosome-simplest packaging structure of DNA that is found in all eukaryotic chromosomes; DNA is wrapped around an octamer of small basic proteins called histones; 146 bp is wrapped around the core and the remaining bases link to the next nucleosome; this structure causes negative supercoiling.
Histone chaperones and the nucleosome assembly processes [edit]. Histones are proteins that allow DNA to be tightly packaged into units called nucleosomes. The DNA wraps itself around the histones. Chromatin is made of DNA and proteins (Histones). Chromatin is used to give structure to a chromosome.
DNA packaging. Each chromosome consists of one continuous thread-like molecule of DNA coiled tightly around proteins, and contains a portion of the 6,400,000,000 basepairs (DNA building blocks) that make up your DNA. The way DNA is packaged into chromatin is a factor in how protein production is controlled.
This protein-DNA structure is called chromatin. There are four kinds of histones attached to the DNA: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. All these proteins form an octamer protein complex called a nucleosome core around which the DNA wraps two turns and then links to another nucleosome (10 nm diameter). This kind of arrangement condenses the DNA. There is another kind of histone protein called H1 that takes part in the DNA packaging.
All rights reserved. The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes shortens the fiber length about sevenfold. In other words, a piece of DNA that is 1 meter long will become a string-of-beads chromatin fiber just 14 centimeters (about 6 inches) long.
The answer to this question lies in the fact that certain proteins compact chromosomal DNA into the microscopic space of the eukaryotic nucleus. These proteins are called histones, and the resulting DNA-protein complex is called chromatin.
