Strain Strain is the response of a system to an applied stress. When a material is loaded with a force, it produces a stress, which then causes a material to deform. Engineering strain is defined as the amount of deformation in the direction of the applied force divided by the initial length of the material.
The stress or force distribution in the cross section of the bar is not necessarily uniform. Nevertheless, an average shear stress is a reasonable approximation. Stress is the force per unit area on a body that tends to cause it to change shape. Stress is a measure of the internal forces in a body between its particles. These internal forces are a reaction to the external forces applied on the body that cause it to separate, compress or slide. External forces are either surface forces or body forces.
In continuum mechanics, stress is a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighboring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the deformation of the material.
Mechanical stress: physical condition which exists within any material because of strain or deformation by external forces or by non-uniform thermal expansion.
Stress, Mechanical. a measure of internal forces that arise in a body being deformed as a result of external forces. When studying the stress at any point, a section is cut through the point (Figure 1).
Tensile stress (or tension) is the stress state leading to expansion; that is, the length of a material tends to increase in the tensile direction. The volume of the material stays constant. When equal and opposite forces are applied on a body, then the stress due to this force is called tensile stress.
Definition. Stress is defined as an organism's total response to environmental demands or pressures. When stress was first studied in the 1950s, the term was used to denote both the causes and the experienced effects of these
