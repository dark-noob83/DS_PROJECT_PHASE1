Water Boston ferns occasionally during the winter to keep the soil slightly moist. Fertilize with a weak solution of liquid houseplant fertilizer once a month. For example, add 4 drops of a 10-15-10 solution to 1 quart of water.
Winter care for Boston fern starts with finding the right location for overwintering Boston ferns. The plant needs cool nighttime temps and lots of bright, indirect light like that from a south window not blocked by trees or buildings. Daytime temperatures should not be over 75 F. (24 C.).
Culture. U.D. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones for the Boston fern are 9, 10 and 11, all of which have average low temperatures of 20 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Ideally, the temperature for outdoor ferns is between 65 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but the Boston fern will tolerate much colder temperatures.
Boston ferns prefer daytime temperatures that range from 65 to 75 degrees F. Evening temperatures should be a little cooler. Cooler temperatures reduce the chance of fungus developing. Temperatures ranging between 55 and 65 are ideal.
Boston ferns die if exposed to lower temperatures. The best indoor temperature range for these voluptuous plants is between 68 and 78 F, notes Colorado State University Extension. Outdoors, the plants can take considerably higher temperatures as long as you grow them in shade and give them enough water.
In low humidity, Boston ferns turn yellow. Boston ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata) aren't from Boston, but are native to Florida, Central America and other tropical areas. The plants became wildly popular during the Victorian era after a florist, F.C. Becker, began propagating them in 1894.
