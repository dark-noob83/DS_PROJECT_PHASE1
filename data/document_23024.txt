About 95.4% of the population will have an IQ score between 70 and 130, which is everyone within two standard deviations. Scores that are between 70 and 85 may be labeled below average, while scores between 115 and 130 could be labeled above average.
A standard deviation in IQ points is 15, so 68.2% of the population will have scores between 85 and 115. This is labeled an average IQ, which is just a name for a group of people scoring around the average score. This name for a group helps make it easier to group test takers together.
50% of IQ scores fall between 90 and 110. 70% of IQ scores fall between 85 and 115. 95% of IQ scores fall between 70 and 130. 99.5% of IQ scores fall between 60 and 140. Low IQ & Mental Retardation. An IQ under 70 is considered as mental retardation or limited mental ability. 5% of the population falls below 70 on IQ tests.
Last 10 results of this IQ Test : The bell curve (also called a normal curve or normal distribution) is a graph that shows approximately how much of the population falls into each IQ range. In theory, if we tested everyone in the world with a traditional IQ test, most people would score in the  Average range.
An IQ test score is calculated based on a norm group with an average score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The standard deviation is a measure of spread, in this case of IQ scores. A standard devation of 15 means 68% of the norm group has scored between 85 (100 – 15) and 115 (100 + 15). In other words, 68% of the norm group has a score within one standard deviation of the average (100).
Einstein was considered to only have an IQ of about 160. Mensa is a society for people with high IQ, in the top 2% (1 in 50). In 1926, psychologist Catherine Morris Cox published a study of the most eminent men and women who had lived between 1450 and 1850 to estimate what their IQs might have been.
Also, 95% of the norm group has an IQ score within two standard deviations of the average. So, 95% of the norm group has a score between 70 (100 – 30) and 130 (100 + 30). This means scores of over 130 only occur in 2,5% of cases.
About 2% of the population has an IQ score lower than 69. Such a low IQ score often is hard to measure using a regular intelligence test. Very high IQ scores are also hard to determine accurately. This is because you need a lot of reference measurements to determine a specific score reliably.
