Flu, or influenza, is a contagious respiratory in fection caused by a variety of flu viruses. Symptoms of flu involve muscle aches and soreness, headache, and fever.
Type A Influenza: Introduction. Type A Influenza: Type A influenza is a subtype of the influenza virus that can cause cause serious illness and result in pandemics. Influenza is viral respiratory infection.
There are three types of flu viruses: A, B, and C. Type A and B cause the annual influenza epidemics that have up to 20% of the population sniffling, aching, coughing, and running high fevers. Type C also causes flu; however, type C flu symptoms are much less severe.
Unlike type A flu viruses, type B flu is found only in humans. Type B flu may cause a less severe reaction than type A flu virus, but occasionally, type B flu can still be extremely harmful. Influenza type B viruses are not classified by subtype and do not cause pandemics.
Influenza, or the the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by an airborne virus. Influenza viruses are divided into three types: A, B and C. Type A and B viruses are the most serious and are responsible for the flu epidemics experienced nearly every winter. Type C viruses typically cause a very minor respiratory illness and may result in no symptoms at all.
Although initially symptoms of influenza may mimic those of a cold, influenza is more debilitating with symptoms of fatigue, fever, and respiratory congestion. Colds can be caused by over 100 different virus types, but only influenza viruses (and subtypes) A, B, and C cause the flu.
Type A flu is the most common type of influenza. Type A influenza symptoms include respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing and a runny nose, as well as influenza symptoms like headache, muscle aches, and fever.
