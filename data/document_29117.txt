Cars and motorcycles MUST normally pass an MOT test three years from the date of the first registration and every year after that. You MUST NOT drive a vehicle without an MOT certificate, when it should have one.
Best Answer: About an hour with a 2 man MOT Test Bay, however many MOT Test Stations have the new-ATL-Automated Test Lanes which can complete a full mot test in 40 minutes.
On average an MOT test takes between 45 - 60 minutes. It's always best to allow an hour to be sure your car is ready when you go to collect it. Time may vary if repairs are required.
An MOT lasts for a year. The date it runs out is printed on the last pass certificate. You can get an MOT up to a month (minus a day) before it runs out and keep the same renewal date. Example If your MOT runs out on 15 May, the earliest you can get an MOT to keep the same renewal date for next year is 16 April.

RE: how long after MOT expires to get it done? 2008/08/05 11:42:24 (permalink). You get a 13 month MOT now. i.e. you can book a up to a month before its due and the MOT centre will still issue the certificate for 12 months to expire on the date your old one would have expired so you do not lose out.
