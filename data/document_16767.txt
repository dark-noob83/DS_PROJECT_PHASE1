To determine your RDA for protein, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, or use this online protein calculator. For a 50-year-old woman who weighs 140 pounds woman and who is sedentary (doesn’t exercise), that translates into 53 grams of protein a day.
I consume around 300 grams protein per day and it is working well with my weight training/body building program. I eat 6 meals per day and shoot for 40-50 grams of protein per each meal. On my work out days, I consume around 150-200 grams of carbs and on my non-work out days I drop the carbs to around 100 grams. I’m staying lean and building muscle! Thanks, Max.
Adults in the U.S. are encouraged to get 10% to 35% of their day's calories from protein foods. That's about 46 grams of protein for women, and 56 grams of protein for men.
