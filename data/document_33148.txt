Functions of Muscular System: Muscular system has the following important functions in human body; 1  MOVEMENTS OF BODY PARTS: Skeletal muscles are responsible for all voluntary movements of human body parts. 2  They provide the force by contracting actively at the expense of energy. 1
Voluntary muscles can be strengthened with exercise, and will atrophy without it. Photo Credit my muscles image by Frenk_Danielle Kaufmann from Fotolia.com. Voluntary muscles are one of three types of muscle in the body; smooth and cardiac are the other two types. There are more than 600 muscles in the body, and each falls into one of these categories. Smooth muscles are involuntary; cardiac muscles make up the muscles in the heart; voluntary muscles are controllable by your brain &mdash; and these are the muscles you use to perform activities. The muscles of the chest, back, shoulders, abdominals, arms, and legs make up the body&#039;s major muscle groups.
The muscular system is responsible for the movement of the human body. Attached to the bones of the skeletal system are about 700 named muscles that make up roughly half of a personâ€™s body weight. Each of these muscles is a discrete organ constructed of skeletal muscle tissue, blood vessels, tendons, and nerves. Muscle tissue is also found inside of the heart, digestive organs, and blood vessels. In these organs, muscles serve to move substances throughout the body....
Answers. Relevance. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Voluntary muscle contraction is used to move the body, and can be finely controlled, like movements of the eye, or gross movements like the quadriceps muscle of the thigh. There are two broad types of voluntary muscle fibres, slow twitch and fast twitch
These muscles are not as free as the voluntary muscles such as those in the arms, legs, fingers, toes, etc. Examples: Cardiac muscle: a type of striated muscle found exclusively in the heart, can be called an involuntary muscle, although it may be classified separately due to its structural differences.

Three types of muscles. The muscular system can be broken down into three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiac, according to the NIH. Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscle tissue in the human body and control every action that a person consciously performs. Most skeletal muscles are attached to two bones across a joint, so the muscle serves to move parts of those bones closer to each other, according to The Merck Manual.
Muscular system is the system of Human Body that provides motor power for all movements of body parts. Muscular system is composed of special tissue called muscular tissue. Muscles have the ability to contract actvely to provide the force for movements of body parts. 1 MOVEMENTS OF BODY PARTS: Skeletal muscles are responsible for all voluntary movements of human body parts. 2  They provide the force by contracting actively at the expense of energy.
Muscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis. There are three types of muscle, skeletal or striated, cardiac, and smooth. Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary. Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell.
