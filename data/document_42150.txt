Professors in the United States are often veterans in their line of work, with close to four-fifths bringing more than 10 years of experience to the table. Salaries slide in at $88K annually on average but can range from $50K to $158K per year. Compensation for this group is mainly affected by the company, but experience level and geographic location are influential factors as well. More than half of Professors (63 percent) survey respondents are men. For many Professors, more experience generally translates to higher pay. Those who have worked for fewer than five years take home a median salary of $58K, and workers with five to 10 years of experience earn a higher $70K on average.
