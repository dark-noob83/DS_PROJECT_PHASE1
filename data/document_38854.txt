The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The recommended maintenance dose of NEURONTIN is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated. Administer NEURONTIN three times a day using 300 mg or 400 mg capsules, or 600 mg or 800 mg tablets. The maximum time between doses should not exceed 12 hours.
The starting dose range is 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The effective dose of NEURONTIN in patients 3 to 4 years of age is 40 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. Effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The effective dose of NEURONTIN is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies.
In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, NEURONTIN may be initiated on Day 1 as a single 300 mg dose, on Day 2 as 600 mg/day (300 mg two times a day), and on Day 3 as 900 mg/day (300 mg three times a day). Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated. Administer NEURONTIN three times a day using 300 mg or 400 mg capsules, or 600 mg or 800 mg tablets. The maximum time between doses should not exceed 12 hours.

Treatment of Epilepsy. The recommended initial dosage of Gabapentin (Neurontin) for adults being treated for epilepsy is 300 mg taken once up to three times a day. The usual maintenance dose is 900 mg per day given in 3 divided doses. Children (aged 3 to 12 years old) should be given individualized dosage of gabapentin based on childâ€™s body weight. The recommended initial dose ranges from 10-15 mg/kg/day given in three divided doses, then titrated until the effective dose is reached.

Posted 7/31/2008 6:22 PM (GMT -6). Afterglo, the starting dose is usually 300 mg 3x a day, just as your doctor prescribed. Here is a link to Neurontin. Gabapentin is the generic of this so the information should fit. Maybe it is interacting with something else you are taking. 
Gabapentin can be initiated at doses of 100 to 300 mg at bedtime or 100 to 300 mg three times daily. The dose should be titrated by 100 to 300 mg every 3 to 7 days as tolerated to a maximum dose of 3600 mg per day. The usual effective dose is 1800 mg to 3600 mg per day, which may take several weeks to achieve. A recent crossover design study compared nortriptyline (maximum dose of 100 mg daily), gabapentin (maximum dose of 3600 mg daily), and a combination of both in 56 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy or PHN.
Patients 12 years of age and above. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The effective dose of NEURONTIN is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The effective dose of NEURONTIN is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies.
