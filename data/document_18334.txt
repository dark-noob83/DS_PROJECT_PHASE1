tundra introduction the word tundra derives from the finnish word for barren or treeless land the tundra is the simplest biome in terms of species composition and food chains vegetation lichens mosses sedges perennial forbs and dwarfed shrubs often heaths but also birches and willows growthforms typical are ground hugging and other warmth preserving forms including tussock forming graminoids distribution the tundra biome is restricted to the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere in a belt around the arctic ocean many of its species both plant and animal have circumpolar distribution areas
a level or rolling treeless plain that is characteristic of arctic and subarctic regions consists of black mucky soil with a permanently frozen subsoil and has a dominant vegetation of mosses lichens herbs and dwarf shrubs also a similar region confined to mountainous areas above timberline 
the word tundra usually refers only to the areas where the subsoil is permafrost or permanently frozen soil it may also refer to the treeless plain in general so that northern sapmi sápmi would be included permafrost tundra includes vast areas of northern russia and canada arctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year the soil there is frozen from 25 90 cm 10 35 in down and it is impossible for trees to grow
in physical geography tundra is type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons the term tundra comes through russian тундра from the kildin sami word tūndar tūndâr uplands treeless mountain tract there are three types of tundra arctic tundra alpine tundra and antarctic tundra in tundra the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs sedges and grasses mosses and lichens scattered trees grow in some tundra regions arctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year the soil there is frozen from 25 90 cm 10 35 in down and it is impossible for trees to grow
weather the tundra is the coldest and the driest of all the biomes on earth there is very little rainfall in the tundra it rains less than ten inches a year winters here are long and summers short sometimes they last for only 6 10 weeks in the winter the temperature can reach 50 f 45 5 c because animals of the tundra are generally migratory this biome s population is constantly changing resident animals have to change what they are hunting and eating as the seasons change the food chain in the arctic tundra consists of predators such as owls foxes wolves and polar bears at the top of the chain
many lichens mosses and small shrubs flourish in the arctic tundra the plants that live in the harsh permafrost soil usually adapt to the weather by being short and grouped together to resist winds and to be protected the growing season in the tundra is short and lasts up to 60 days tundra plants get their energy from the sun through photosynthesis like all other plants but have adapted to low temperatures and low light intensities compared to plants in other biomes they use a minimal amount of energy because animals of the tundra are generally migratory this biome s population is constantly changing resident animals have to change what they are hunting and eating as the seasons change the food chain in the arctic tundra consists of predators such as owls foxes wolves and polar bears at the top of the chain
the tundra biome tundra is the coldest of all the biomes tundra comes from the finnish word tunturi meaning treeless plain it is noted for its frost molded landscapes extremely low temperatures little precipitation poor nutrients and short growing seasons dead organic material functions as a nutrient pool characteristics of tundra include extremely cold climate low biotic diversity simple vegetation structure limitation of drainage short season of growth and reproduction energy and nutrients in the form of dead organic material large population oscillations
