A typical floating raft (30 x 30 x 15 m) can be used to rear 25 000 amberjack with an average body weight of about 2 kg. The stocking density is also dependent on cage-site conditions, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, mesh size and water exchange rates.
The Amberjack refers to three species of Atlantic fish of the Carangidae family, which includes the jacks and the pompanos. The Lesser Amberjack is found near and offshore in depths of commonly 180 to 400 feet. Usual size is up to 10lbs in weight. Fish seldom reaches a size greater than 12 inches. The Greater Amberjack is found inshore in waters less than 30 feet deep usually amongst floating objects. Usual size for this fish inshore is from 3kg to 7kg. Offshore this species is found in rocky reefs and wrecks typically in water from 60 to 240 feet and the most common size is form 7kg to 27kg.
Its upper body is blue, the belly is silver, and the fins are yellowish-gray. The common amberjack can reach five to six feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) in length and more than 100 pounds (45 kg) in weight. The average weight, however, is 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg).
Our methods for fishing Amberjack off the coast off Port Canaveral are twofold. We fish live bait at the bottom and jig fishing around reefs and wrecks. We fish deep sea wrecks out to 35 miles and 300 feet of water. One of the jacks is called lesser Amberjack which grows an average weight of 10lbs in the Atlantic.
This Amberjack is native to the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Hawaii and Baja California. For culinary purposes the most abundant form of the fish on the market is farmed with an average weight of 6 1/2 to 11 pounds.
