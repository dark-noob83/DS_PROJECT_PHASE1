Only the costs of raw materials and direct labor are used in the prime cost formula. In the above example, the raw materials are the lumber and hardware used for assembly. The total cost of raw materials is $5,000 + $1,500, or $6,500. The total cost of labor is $15 * 50, or $750. Prime Cost = Raw Materials + Direct Labor. The prime cost of a single bed frame is ($6,500 + $750) / 10, or $72.50. In order to generate a profit, the company must sell each frame for more than $72.50. The company likely also incurred several other expenses that would not be included in the calculation of the prime cost.
In order to make money in the restaurant business, prime costs should generally be in the 60 percent to 65 percent range. How that breaks down between food and labor is less important than achieving a prime cost maximum that produces a satisfactory profit.
How Food and Labor Costs are Calculated. Food and labor costs are calculated as a percentage of the total volume of sales. If a restaurant does $20,000 per week and the total cost of food and beverages is $7,000 for that week, then the food cost is considered 35 percent. If, at the same restaurant, labor (including payroll taxes and benefits) equal $5,000 for the week, then the labor cost is 25 percent.
A business's expenses for the materials and labor it uses in production. Prime cost is a way of measuring the total cost of the production inputs needed to create a given output.
