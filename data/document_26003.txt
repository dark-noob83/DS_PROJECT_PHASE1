A stroopwafel (. [ˈstroːpʋaːfəl]. ; English translation: syrup waffle or treacle waffle) is a waffle made from two thin layers of baked dough with a caramel-like syrup filling in the middle. It is popular in the Netherlands. They were first made in the Dutch city of Gouda. One story ascribes the invention of the stroopwafel to the baker Gerard Kamphuisen, which would date the first stroopwafels somewhere between 1810, the year when he opened his bakery, and 1840, the year of the oldest known recipe for syrup waffles.
