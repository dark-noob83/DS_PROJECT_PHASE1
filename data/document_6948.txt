DNA profiling (also called DNA fingerprinting, DNA testing, or DNA typing) is a forensic technique used to identify individuals by characteristics of their DNA. Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are monozygotic (identical) twins.
The process is called TRANSCRIPTION TRANSCRIPTION-is the process of constructing a messenger RNA molecule using a DNA molecule as a template with resulting transfer of gene … tic information to the messenger RNA. JD Heyl. Since DNA contains all the instructions for cells to function properly, DNA replication has to be accurate so that the instructions are copied correctly. If not, your cells … may be mutated or not function. 12 people found this useful.

Report Abuse. PCR The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique widely used in molecular biology. It derives its name from one of its key components, a DNA polymerase used to amplify a piece of DNA by in vitro enzymatic replication. As PCR progresses, the DNA thus generated is itself used as template for replication. This sets in motion a chain reaction in which the DNA template is exponentially amplified. With PCR it is possible to amplify a single or few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating millions or more copies of the DNA piece.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia DNA profiling (also called DNA testing, DNA typing, or genetic fingerprinting) is a technique employed byforensic scientists to assist in the identification of individuals by their respective DNA profiles. 
DNA replication is the process of producing two identical replicas from one original DNA molecule. This biological process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for biological inheritance. DNA is made up of two strands and each strand of the original DNA molecule serves as a template for the production of the complementary strand, a process referred to as semiconservative replication. Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication.
