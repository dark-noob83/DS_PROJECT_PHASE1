Best Answer: If you mean freezing in a second or less, that is probably not possible, even if we dunk a human into a tub of cold liquid nitrogen. Heat transfer takes time, and depends on thickness and surface area. Since humans are pretty thick and we are quite large, it will take some time to freeze a body.
Report Abuse. It is impossible to freeze the human body instantly. Flesh does not conduct heat infinitely fast so regardless of the temperature, the heat can not leave your body instantly. Dry Ice is certainly cold enough to give you a burn (freeze your skin) if you hold on to it for very long.
And frostbite is more common at pretty low temperatures, well below freezing. It takes a wind chill temperature of around minus 15 degrees [F] where you start to see an increase in the incident of frostbite, Castellani said.

You might think that boiling water would be harder to instantly freeze than a pot of cold water. In fact, Holthaus tried cold water immediately afterward, and it stayed in liquid form.
At this air temperature, or its windchill equivalent, skin can freeze almost instantly. On the Kelvin scale this would be approximately - 233.20. http://users.tpg.com.au/doktormj/kelvin2Fahrenheit.htm. At a temperature of minus 28oC (minus 18oF), flesh will freeze in 15 minutes or less.
What's Happening: Most people believe water always freezes at exactly 32°F or 0°C. While it is true that pure water ice always begins to melt at 0°C, liquid water-even pure water-does not necessarily freeze at this temperature, and can remain a liquid at much colder temperatures (see the link below). This is called supercooled water.
