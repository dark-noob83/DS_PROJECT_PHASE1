NOTE: Strict adherence to reefer weights. Limit of tare weight shown on container may never be exceeded. In the U.S. March 1 - May 1 Suggested Weight Maximum Weight Spring Thaw 20' dry container 39,500 lbs. (17.92MT) Maximum varies by state N/A 40' dry container 44,500 lbs.
When comparing the maximum weights allowed in ocean containers, with the maximum weights allowed on California Highways, the maximum weight allowed on the California highways, is less in most cases, than the maximum weight allowed in a specific container. 
Shippers must spread the weight evenly throughout the container or the container can be subject to an axle weight violation. The maximum weight that US railroads will accept or deliver for rail car movement is (including container weight) 52,900 lbs (23,995kg) in the case of a 20” container, and 67,200 lbs. (30,481kg) in the case of a 40” container. 
Road Weight Limitation in Japan: Maximum permissible weight for containers (20' and 40') including tare weight and including reefer equipment is 30.480 Kilo tons with conditions: A) Use Tri-Axle chasses for transport. 
Allowing for the tare mass of the container, the maximum payload mass is therefore reduced to approximately 22,000 kg (49,000 lb) for 20 ft (6.10 m), and 27,000 kg (60,000 lb) for 40 ft (12.19 m) containers. The maximum gross mass for a 20 ft (6.10 m) dry cargo container is 24,000 kg (53,000 lb), and for a 40 ft (12.19 m) container (including the 9 ft 6 in or 2.90 m high cube) it is 30,480 kg (67,200 lb).
Payload is the maximum permitted weight of the payload, including the dunnage etc placed in the container. Therefore, Payload = Rating-Tare Mass. If the Tare Mass of a 20' dry cargo container is 2,400 kgs. and a 40' is 3,900 kgs., the Payload of a 20' is 21,600 kgs.
These are marked on the container wall, usually on the door in the case of an end-loading dry cargo container. Rating is the maximum permissible weight of a container plus its contents. The Rating of a 20' dry cargo container is 24,000 kgs. (52,900 lbs.) and a 40' - standard or high cube-is 30,480 kgs. (67,200 lbs.). Tare Mass is the weight of the empty container. If the Tare Mass of a 20' dry cargo container is 2,400 kgs. and a 40' is 3,900 kgs., the Payload of a 20' is 21,600 kgs.
The maximum gross mass for a 20-foot (6.1 m) dry cargo container is 24,000 kilograms (53,000 lb). Subtracting the tare mass of the container itself, the maximum amount of cargo per TEU is reduced to approximately 21,600 kilograms (47,600 lb). Similarly, the maximum gross mass for a 40-foot (12.2 m) dry cargo container (including the 9-foot-6-inch-high (2.90 m) cube container) is 30,480 kilograms (67,200 lb). After correcting for tare weight, this gives a cargo capacity of 26,500 kilograms (58,400 lb). There is a lack of standardisation in regard to height, ranging between 4 feet 3 inches (1.30 m) and 9 feet 6 inches (2.90 m), with the most common height being 8 feet 6 inches (2.59 m). Also, it is common to designate 45-foot (13.7 m) containers as 2 TEU, rather than 2.25 TEU.
