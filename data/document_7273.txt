A chalupa is a kind of tostada platter in Mexican cuisine. It is a specialty of south-central regions of Mexico, such as the states of Puebla, Guerrero and Oaxaca. It is made by pressing a thin layer of masa dough around the outside of a small mold and then deep frying it to produce a crisp shallow corn cup.
This version of shells are not chalupas but in fact soft taco shells. The chalupa is a harden flat shell served with refried pinto beans melted cheddar, finely shredded lettuce and petite diced tomato. At times topped with guacamole, sour cream and spicey hot sauce. A crispy Mexican style pizza so to speak.
Smaller versions of the chalupa, called chalupitas, can also be made. These little snacks are often served as appetizers. To make a chalupita, prepare a smaller chalupa crust, and fill it with beans, pepper, and sour cream. This treat is comparable to nachos.
A chicken chalupa, for example, is typically a blend of shredded chicken marinated in a flavorful sauce, combined with vegetables such as chopped onions or peppers. Various salsas can be added to the filling as well, such as red and green varieties.
