There’s also a new TV spot: BLACK MASS Based on the true story of the unholy union between the FBI and gangster Whitey Bulger. Based on the true story.
Black Mass is a 2015 American crime film directed by Scott Cooper and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, based on the 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill.
The film sticks closely to its source material, Black Mass: Whitey Bulger, the FBI and a Devil’s Deal, a book written by former Boston Globe reporters Gerard O’Neill and Dick Lehr. Here’s what is fact and what is added Hollywood drama in the new film.
Black Mass, a Bulger biopic directed by Scott Cooper, is based on an all-too-true story about a decidedly unfanciful world: the grim streets of South Boston during Bulger’s criminal reign, which ran from the mid-’70s to the mid-’90s.
Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton and Guy Pearce star in the biopic crime drama Black Mass, based on the book “Whitey” by Dick Lehr and Gerard O’Neill. Watch the movie trailers and see the photos and poster in the gallery below.
More. Black Mass, the new Johnny Depp film based on the life of Boston mobster Whitey Bulger, who stood just behind Osama bin Laden on the FBI’s most-wanted list for years, hardly needs to diverge from the crazy true story upon which it is based.
Set during the 1970s, Black Mass tells the almost too-weird-to-be-true story of how Bulger maintained a criminal empire for decades with the tacit, and sometimes explicit, help of the FBI.
