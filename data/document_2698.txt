Mitral (MI-tral) valve prolapse (MVP) is a condition in which the heart's mitral valve doesn't work well. The flaps of the valve are floppy and don't close tightly. These flaps normally help seal or open the valve. Much of the time, MVP doesn't cause any problems.

Vaginal Prolapse Overview. The network of muscles, ligaments, and skin in and around a woman's vagina acts as a complex support structure that holds pelvic organs, and tissues in place. This support network includes the skin and muscles of the vagina walls (a network of tissues called the fascia).
Uterine prolapse may be incomplete or complete. An incomplete prolapse occurs when the uterus is only partly sagging into the vagina. A complete prolapse describes a situation in which the uterus falls so far down that some tissue rests outside
