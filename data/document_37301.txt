Overview. When you plant an herb garden and put your time, dedication and heart into it, it's a shame to let pests such as rabbits turn it into a wasteland. Rabbits love to roam into herb gardens and munch on your herbs, as well as trample other plants. Take a few precautions with your herb garden to help repel rabbits so you can enjoy the rewards of your work. Step 1. Use garden or anti-animal netting and drape it over the herb garden. To prevent a rabbit from moving it, pin the netting down on the sides with wooden or metal stakes, or place rocks on top of the netting.
