The internal combustion engine is a form of machinery in which the combustion of fuel and, in this case, a fossil fuel takes place with an oxidizer i.e. air. This process takes place inside the protective walls of a combustion chamber. The Inventor of the Internal Combustion Engine. Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir was the creator and inventor of the internal combustion engine. A Belgian engineer, Lenoir was born in Mussy-La-Ville, a part of Belgium in 1822. By the time he was 28, he had moved to France where he started to show a keen interest towards electroplating
The steam engine was an external combustion engine as the fuel was burnt outside the engine. The first internal combustion engine where fuel is burnt inside the cylinder to force a piston to move was invented in 1856 by the Italians Barsanti and Matteucci. The internal combustion engine could only be invented because of certain properties of gases and vacuums. Gases expand when heated and that a piston will move to reduce a vacuum are properties of gases and vacuums which allowed the invention of the internal combustion engine.
In 1893, he published a paper describing an engine with combustion within a cylinder, the internal combustion engine. In Augsburg, Germany on August 10, 1893, Rudolf Diesel's prime model, a single 10-foot iron cylinder with a flywheel at its base, ran on its own power for the first time. That same year he published a paper describing the internal combustion engine to the world.
Different from an internal combustion engine, the external combustion engine makes use of the natural resources such as air or hot water in such a manner that the energy created is delivered to a working fluid that is free from the contaminating products of the combustion process.

In an internal combustion engine the expansion of the high-temperature and high-pressure gases produced by combustion apply direct force to some component of the engine. An example of this type of engine is the Waertsilae-Wärtsilä SULZER-Rta96 c turbocharged-2 Stroke, diesel used in large container. Ships it is the most efficient and powerful internal combustion engine in the world with a thermal efficiency over %. 50
1 1823: Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially. 2  It was compressionless and based on what Hardenberg calls the Leonardo cycle, which, as the name implies, was already out of date at that time. Although various forms of internal combustion engines were developed before the 19th century, their use was hindered until the commercial drilling and production of petroleum began in the mid-1850s. By the late 19th century, engineering advances led to their widespread adoption in a variety of applications
The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. An example of this type of engine is the Waertsilae-Wärtsilä SULZER-Rta96 c turbocharged-2 Stroke, diesel used in large container. Ships it is the most efficient and powerful internal combustion engine in the world with a thermal efficiency over %. 50
Gottlieb Daimler invented the internal combustion engine. I am sorry to say but it was not Daimler who invented the first internal combustion engine it was in fact Christian Huygens, who invented it in 1680, however the first gasoline engine was not created till 1859 by J. J. Étienne étienne, lenoir a french. engineer He patented it in 1860. Nicolaus Otto invented a gas motor engine in 1876. He built the first practical four-stroke internal combustion engine, called the Otto Cycle Engine, and built it into a motorcycle. Otto's patent was later revoked when it was contested by Beau de Rochas.
