1 Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. 2  Cook until rib roast reaches an internal temperature of 120°F Remove from oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 20 minutes. 3  The roast will continue to cook as it sits. Cook to internal temperature, not elapsed time. Time is approximate for a 5-pound roast. Any size roast will do, just cook to the correct internal temperature. Add 20 minutes for resting time.
How long and at what temperature should I cook a beef roast in the oven? Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast. Sirloin-tip, rump, rolled-rump, eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice. Cooking at a constant oven temperature of 300°F (160°C), a 5- to 8-lb standing rib roast will take 17-19 minutes per pound for rare, 20-22 for medium rare, 23-25 minutes for medium, and 27-30 minutes for well done.
Place in the oven and reduce the temperature to 170 degrees. Cook for 2 1/2 hours per pound (for medium-rare). Transfer the roast to a platter or cutting board, tent loosely with aluminum foil and allow to rest for at least 15 to 20 minutes before carving. In general, roasts cooked using the slow-low method will follow the doneness temperature guidelines of 125 for rare, 130-135 for medium-rare and 140 for medium; that is particularly true of roasts from the rib or loin, especially the tenderloin.
1 Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 2  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 3  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Cook to internal temperature, not elapsed time. Time is approximate for a 5-pound roast. Any size roast will do, just cook to the correct internal temperature. Add 20 minutes for resting time.
1 Reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees F and continue cooking covered for another 2 hours. 2  Remove from oven and turn the roast over, place back in oven for another 1-2 hours or until roast is tender (could take longer than 2 hours, as you are cooking at a low temperature). 1 Cover and cook at 350 degrees F for about 1 hour. 2  Uncover and place the carrots and potatoes around the roast. 3 
A beef roast cooked to medium-rare should have an internal temperature of 145°F - 150ºF after the resting period, and a roast cooked to medium should have an internal temperature of 150°F to 160ºF. (See the note below). See Beef Doneness for more information on proper cooking temperatures. Allow the beef to roast at 450°F for 45 minutes and then begin checking the internal temperature of the meat with a meat thermometer. Continue roasting the meat until the internal temperature has reached 5 or 10 degrees below the desired doneness.
1 Cook the roast for about 10 to 15 minutes and then turn it over in the pan. 2  Continue to cook it for another 10 to 15 minutes for every pound. 3  Remove the tenderloin from the oven when the internal temperature of the meat reaches 140°F, as indicated on a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the roast. Allow the beef to roast at 450°F for 45 minutes and then begin checking the internal temperature of the meat with a meat thermometer. Continue roasting the meat until the internal temperature has reached 5 or 10 degrees below the desired doneness.
1 Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 2  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 3  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 4  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Cook to internal temperature, not elapsed time. Time is approximate for a 5-pound roast. Any size roast will do, just cook to the correct internal temperature. Add 20 minutes for resting time.
WIth a roast, you generally want to cook to an internal temperature, not a time. But, when you lay it out butterflied, it’s thinner and more of the meat is exposed to heat, so if you were to cook it at 350 degrees at a 1/2 hour/lb. a 6 lb roast would end up ruinously overdone. Continue cooking about 50-80 minutes or until the meat registers 145 degrees on a meat thermometer. Some roasts are long and thin and others are short and fat, consequently the cooking times will vary depending on the shape of your roast. The meat thermometer is the best way to judge the right amount of cooking time.
