the mcl is usually injured when the outside of the knee joint is struck causing the outside of the knee to buckle and the inside to widen when the mcl is stretched too far it may tear a mcl injury may be an isolated injury or it may be part of a complex injury to the knee mcl the mcl is another one of the four ligaments in the knee the mcl is on the inside of the knee joint and spans the distance from the end of the femur thigh bone to the top of the tibia shin bone the mcl resists widening of the inside of the joint or prevents opening up
medial knee ligament injury a medial ligament sprain or mcl injury is a tear of the ligament on the inside of the knee usually a result of twisting or direct impact medial ligament injuries are common in contact sports such as football and rugby as well as martial arts 
mcl injury is also part of the unhappy triad or the common injury of the mcl acl and meniscus all together usually through a pivot shift type of mechanism the most obvious sypmtom of mcl injury is pain following the injury you will experience pain in the knee usually along the iside of the joint the mcl blends in with the knee joint capsule along the medial side and portions of this ligament are found both inside and outside of the knee joint it is also sometimes called the tibial collateral ligament
these ligaments provide stability and strength to the knee joint the medial collateral ligament of the knee is on the inner side of the joint as indicated here the meniscus is a c shaped cartilage pad between the two joints formed by the femur and tibia the meniscus acts as a smooth surface for the joint to move on 
swelling is common with mcl injury and is usually located over the inside of the knee directly over the position of the mcl there may be some swelling inside of the knee joint but this is not always true you can feel the swelling when you touch your knee and it feels puffy or full to the touch the mcl blends in with the knee joint capsule along the medial side and portions of this ligament are found both inside and outside of the knee joint it is also sometimes called the tibial collateral ligament
injuries to the mcl commonly occur as a result of a strong force hitting the outside of the knee that causes the mcl and possibly other ligaments on the inside of the knee such as the anterior cruciate ligament acl to stretch or tear 
there are four ligaments in the knee that are prone to injury mentioned above the anterior cruciate ligament acl is one of the two major ligaments in the knee it connects the thigh bone to the shin bone in the knee acl injuries are a common cause of disability in the knee two important ligaments in the knee the acl and posterior cruciate ligament pcl connect the femur or thigh bone with the tibia one of the bones of the lower leg
the medial collateral ligament mcl is located on the inside of the knee ligaments hold bones together the mcl connects the top of the shinbone tibia to the bottom of the thighbone femur ligaments also add stability and strength to a joint injury to the mcl is often called an mcl sprain ligament injuries can either stretch the ligament or tear it mcl injury of the knee is usually caused by a direct blow to the knee this type of injury is common in contact sports and it is usually the result of a hit to the outer knee that stretches the mcl
