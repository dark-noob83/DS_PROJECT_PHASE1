One and a half hours is much too long to cook the chicken at 350 degrees F. The time your chicken will bake in the oven does depend on the internal temperature and the size of your chicken or chicken pieces. Generally I bake chicken at 350 degrees F. for 30 to 40 minutes.
Step 2: Bake the chicken pieces. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the chicken pieces, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes or until no longer pink (internal temperature should be 170 degrees F for chicken breasts, 180 degrees F for thighs and drumsticks). To store: Let the baked chicken stand for 30 minutes to cool.
Our government says that you should cook a whole chicken until the temperature measured in the thigh is 180°F (82°C). If you cook chicken pieces, the government says, the thigh, wings, and drumsticks should be 180°F, while the breast should reach 170°F (77°C).
If you decide to grill your chicken breasts, they should be done in 10 to 15 minutes per side for bone-in, and 6 to 8 minutes for boneless. If you use an oven bag, the bone-in breasts should cook for 40 to 45 minutes, and boneless breasts in 25 to 30 minutes.
For cooking chicken breasts, the following times are appropriate in a 350-degree oven. When roasting bone-in chicken breasts, they should be fully cooked in 30 to 40 minutes, while boneless breasts will be done in 20 to 30 minutes.
Whole Chicken. If you are roasting a whole chicken at 350 degrees in the oven, it should take about 75 to 90 minutes for a 3- to 4-pound chicken to cook thoroughly and closer to 2 hours to 2 hours and 15 minutes for a 5- to 7-pound chicken.
4. Place the chicken breast in a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. 5. Bake for approximately 30-40 minutes or until the internal temperature is 160 degrees, depending on how hot and even your oven cooks will determine the amount of time it takes. 6.
Bake for a short time at a high temperature. Baking for 30 minutes at 350 degrees will yield dry meat. But baking for just 20 minutes at 450 degrees will result in delightfully juicy baked chicken breast, every time.
