The Red Blood Cells in the blood carry oxygen to the cells and carbon dioxide away from the cells. The plasma carries proteins, electrolytes, glucose, clotting factors and Whi … te Blood Cells.
­­The cellular portion of blood contains red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets. The RBCs carry oxygen from the lungs; the WBCs help to fight infection; and platelets are parts of cells that the body uses for clotting. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow.
Three types of blood vessels carry blood from your lungs to every cell in your body. 1  Arteries-Arteries have muscular walls that pump oxygen-filled blood away from your heart to the tissues and organs, like the brain, kidneys and liver. 2  Arteries get smaller as they get further from your heart.
Red blood cells at work. Hemoglobin is the protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide from your body, transporting it to the lungs for you to exhale. Red blood cells are made inside your bones, in the bone marrow.
1 Red blood cells carry oxygen. 2  Of the 3 types of blood cells, red blood cells are the most plentiful. 3  In fact, a healthy adult has about 35 trillion of them. 4  The body creates these cells at a rate of about 2.4 million a second, and they each have a life span of about 120 days.
The primary function of red blood cells is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the cells of the body. RBCs contain a protein called hemoglobin that actually carries the oxygen. In the capillaries, the oxygen is released to be used by the cells of the body. Ninety-seven percent of the oxygen that is carried by the blood from the lungs is carried by hemoglobin; the other three percent is dissolved in the plasma.
