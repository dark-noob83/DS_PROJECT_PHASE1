A binomial is the sum of two monomials, for example x + 3, or 55 x 2 – 33 y 2, or. A trinomial is the sum of three monomials. A polynomial is the sum of n monomials, for some whole number n. So monomials, binomials and trinomials are all special cases of polynomials. A polynomial can have as many terms as you want
(bi implies two) 3x + 1, x - 4x, 2x + y, or y-y A trinomial is the sum of three monomials. It has three unlike terms. (tri implies three) x2 + 2x + 1, 3x - 4x + 10, 2x + 3y + 2 A polynomial is the sum of one or more terms. (poly implies many) x2 + 2x, 3x3 + x + 5x + 6, 4x - 6y + 8. Constants like 13 are monomials since they can be written as 13x0 = 13 1 = 13 where the variable is x0.
A monomial is the product of non-negative integer powers of variables. Consequently, a monomial has NO variable in its denominator. It has one term. (mono implies one) 13, 3x, -57, x, 4y, -2xy, or 520x y (notice: no negative exponents, no fractional exponents) A binomial is the sum of two monomials. It has two unlike terms. (tri implies three) x2 + 2x + 1, 3x - 4x + 10, 2x + 3y + 2 A polynomial is the sum of one or more terms. (poly implies many) x2 + 2x, 3x3 + x + 5x + 6, 4x - 6y + 8. Constants like 13 are monomials since they can be written as 13x0 = 13 1 = 13 where the variable is x0.
Well, a binomial is a polynomial that consists of two terms (bi means two). Ex: 3x+2. And a trinomial is a polynomial that consists of three terms (tri means three). Ex: 3x^2+2x+1 (The ^ means to the power of) Hope this helps :).
Best Answer: This is actually a good question :) A binomial and a trinomial are two different types of polynomials but they are both polynomials. Ex: 3x+2. And a trinomial is a polynomial that consists of three terms (tri means three). Ex: 3x^2+2x+1 (The ^ means to the power of) Hope this helps :).
Monomial: 1  An expression containing only one term is called a monomial. 2  Example: 7, x, 7x, -6x, ab, etc. 3  A monomial is a number, a variable, or the product of a number and one or more variables with whole number exponents. 4  monomial is a single term which has no plus sign (+) or minus sign (-). 1
monomial is not a polynomial. by: cupid. a monomial is an algebraic expression of one term a polynomial is an algebraic expression of more than one term, a binomial and trinomial is an example of polynomials. both monomial and polynomial are algebraic expression of positive exponent.

A monomial is an expression which consists of exclusively one term, having a leading coefficient, a variable, and an exponent to which the variable is raised as a base. For example, 3*x^2 is a monomial, 3 is its leading coefficient, x is its variable, and 2 is its exponent. A binomial is an expression consisting the sum of two monomial terms which cannot be simplified to be the same term, either due to a different variable or due to a different exponents of the variable(s). A trinomial is an expression consisting the sum of three monomial terms which cannot be simplified to be fewer terms, either due to different variables or due to
A monomial is a polynomial with only one term (like 5x). A binomial is a polynomial with two terms (like 6xz+3). A trinomial is a polynomial with three terms (like 5x^2+11x-8). A coefficient is the number in front of a variable (a variable is an unknown, or basically a letter. The coefficient of 5xy is 5, the coefficient of 65w is 65. If the variable stand by itself, like z, then the coefficient is 1.).
A single term of the polynomial is a monomial. In other words, a summand of a polynomial can be considered as a monomial. It has the form an x. An expression with two monomials is known as a binomial, and with three terms is known as a trinomial [binomials ⇒ an x + bn y, trinomial ⇒ an x + bn y + cn z ]. Polynomial are a special case of the mathematical expression and has a wide range of important properties. Sum of polynomials is a polynomial.
