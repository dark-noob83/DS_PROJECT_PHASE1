To qualify for the Child Tax Credit, you must have a child or dependent who meets all of the following requirements: Age: The child must have been 16 or younger on December 31. Citizenship: The child must be a United States citizen, a United States national, or a resident alien.
Amount-With the Child Tax Credit, you may be able to reduce your federal income tax by up to $1,000 for each qualifying child under the age of 17. Qualification-A qualifying child for this credit is someone who meets the qualifying criteria of six tests: age, relationship, support, dependent, citizenship, and residence.
The Child Tax Credit can be worth as much as $1,000 per child for 2014 and later Tax Years. For 2014, the Child Tax Credit is at least partially refundable if you had an earned income of more than $3,000 (see the Additional Child Tax Credit). This refundable portion of the credit will expire at the beginning of 2017.
Qualifying Relative. For qualifying relatives, there is a strict limit on how much income they could make during the year. A qualifying relative cannot make more than $3,700 of gross income during the year. If he makes more than $3,700, then he cannot be a dependent.
Child’s income (if any). In terms of a child’s income, a child may not earn more than $1,000.00 per month from employment and still qualify to receive SSI benefits (in 2011; the limit on a child’s total monthly income changes every year).
Other Child-Related Tax Savings: Exemptions: You will be able to claim a standard exemption for each qualifying child. Child and Dependent Care Credit: You may be able to deduct up to $3,000 for one dependent, or up to $6,000 for more than one dependent with the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit.
