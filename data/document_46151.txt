Meldonium is clinically used to treat angina and myocardial infarction. The first clinical trial testing the efficacy of using a combination of meldonium and lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat chronic heart failure was reported in 2005. The chemical name of meldonium is 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydraziniumyl)propionate, a structural analogue of γ-butyrobetaine, with a NH group replacing the CH 2 at the C-4 position of γ-butyrobetaine.
Meldonium is an example of a non-peptidyl substrate mimic inhibitor for human 2OG oxygenase. Meldonium has also been shown by NMR to bind to carnitine acetyltransferase. Carnitine acetyltransferase belongs to a family of ubiquitous enzymes that play pivotal roles in cellular energy metabolism. The chemical name of meldonium is 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydraziniumyl)propionate, a structural analogue of γ-butyrobetaine, with a NH group replacing the CH 2 at the C-4 position of γ-butyrobetaine.
Meldonium may also be beneficial for the treatment of seizures and alcohol intoxication. Recent reports also suggest that meldonium may improve the ability of learning and memory, as the drug changes the expression of hippocampal proteins related to synaptic plasticity using rat model. The chemical name of meldonium is 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydraziniumyl)propionate, a structural analogue of γ-butyrobetaine, with a NH group replacing the CH 2 at the C-4 position of γ-butyrobetaine.
Meldonium (also known as Mildronate, THP, MET-88, Mildronāts or Quaterine) is a clinically used anti-ischemic drug that is currently manufactured and marketed by Grindeks, a pharmaceutical company based in Latvia. The chemical name of meldonium is 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydraziniumyl)propionate, a structural analogue of γ-butyrobetaine, with a NH group replacing the CH 2 at the C-4 position of γ-butyrobetaine.
