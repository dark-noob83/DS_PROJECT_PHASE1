Answer   There are two valves in your heart. Between the Right atrium and ventricle there lies an AV-valve (A=atrium) (V=ventricle) hence the name AV-valve. It's al … so called like tricuspid valve... but i learned it the AV-valve. The two atrioventricular (AV) valves, which are between the atria and the ventricles, are the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve.The two semilunar (SL) valves, which are in … the arteries leaving the heart, are the aortic valve and the pulmonary valve.

Best Answer: The heart is held in place principally by its attachment to the great arteries and veins, and by its confinement in the pericardium. The pericardium is a double-walled sac with one layer enveloping the heart and the other attached to the breastbone, the diaphragm, and the membranes of the thorax. They let blood flow from the atria to the ventricles. The other two are called the aortic (say: ay-or-tik) valve and pulmonary (say: pul-muh-ner-ee) valve, and they're in charge of controlling the flow as the blood leaves the heart.
The heart is made up of four different blood-filled areas, and each of these areas is called a chamber. There are two chambers on each side of the heart. One chamber is on the top and one chamber is on the bottom. The two chambers on top are called the atria (say: ay-tree-uh). They let blood flow from the atria to the ventricles. The other two are called the aortic (say: ay-or-tik) valve and pulmonary (say: pul-muh-ner-ee) valve, and they're in charge of controlling the flow as the blood leaves
There are two Atrioventricular Valves in the heart. The first one, on the right side of the heart, is called the Tricuspid Valve (it has three 'flaps'). On the left side, the … Atrioventricular Valve is called the Bicuspid or Mitral Valve (it has two 'flaps'). 20 people found this useful.
The mitral valve and the aortic valve are in the left heart; the tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve are in the right heart. There are also the coronary sinus and the inferior vena cava valves. 1 The two atrioventricular (AV) valves, the mitral valve (bicuspid valve), and the tricuspid valve, which are between the upper atria and the lower ventricles. 2  The two semilunar (SL) valves, the aortic valve and the pulmonary valve, which are in the arteries leaving the heart.
1 The semilunar valve on the left side of the heart is the aortic valve, named for the fact that it prevents the aorta from regurgitating blood back into the left ventricle. 2  The semilunar valves are smaller than the AV valves and do not have chordae tendineae to hold them in place. The heart functions by pumping blood both to the lungs and to the systems of the body. To prevent blood from flowing backwards or “regurgitating” back into the heart, a system of one-way valves are present in the heart.
There are two valves in the heart. They are tricuspid valve and bicuspid valve.There is a possibility of the blood going back into the atria. This is prevented by these two … valves, the tricuspid valve on the right side and the bicuspid valve on the left side.

A heart valve normally allows blood to flow in only one direction through the heart. The four valves commonly represented in a mammalian heart determine the pathway of blood flow through the heart. A heart valve opens or closes incumbent on differential blood pressure on each side. The four main valves in the heart are: 1 The two atrioventricular (AV) valves, the mitral valve (bicuspid valve), and the tricuspid valve, which are between the upper atria and the lower ventricles. 2  The two semilunar (SL) valves, the aortic valve and the pulmonary valve, which are in the arteries leaving the heart.
