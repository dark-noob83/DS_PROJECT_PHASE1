Pricing a sealcoating job is a simple process of multiplying the square footage in the lot by a price per square foot. This price per square foot will range from .12 cents to .20 cents depending on a few factors. The first factor is your market. If it is very competitive that will push the price per square foot down. If there is very little competition the price will go up. Second, the condition of the lot affects the price. It is better for you to have efficient equipment and this will help you to make much more per hour of your time but it should not change the customers price. Here is how I would price a job. Lot size – 100 x 200 = 20,000 square feet.
Take a look at the graph below. Over 31 years, you would spend just a total of $3.00 per square foot to sealcoat your asphalt. That's $0.50 per square foot once every 5 years. The alternative to sealcoating is to let your asphalt degrade until it needs to be repaved. Repaving can cost about $5.00 per square foot. That's 10 times as much as sealcoating! Thus, over a 31 year span, you'd need to repave twice, for a cost of $10.00 per square foot. 
1 Sealcoat that is brushed on will usually cost anywhere from $.07 – $.10 per square foot, depending on the condition of the driveway, and will last 1-2 years. 2  Asphalt that has never been sealcoated or has not been done in many years will absorb much more sealer and will therefore cost a little more. 1 Sealcoat that is sprayed on will usually cost $.04 – $.05 per square foot, depending on the company. 2  While this is the cheapest option, the sealcoat does not last as long because water must be added to the sealer in order for it to spray through a nozzle without getting clogged.
Now of course there are variables that go into this figure including actual sealcoating material, labor, and area preparation that are the main cost-driving factors. Water-based sealcoat currently runs at about 15-cents per square foot. Oil-based sealcoat is about 20-cents per square foot. Measure the width times the length, times the price per square foot and you have your estimated price. Example 20 foot wide parking area by 50 feet long is 1000 square feet. Times $.20 per square feet and you have $200
How much does it cost to sealcoat an asphalt parking lot? The average sealcoating cost for an asphalt parking lot with either asphalt or coal tar emulsion pavement sealer ranges from $0.14 - $0.25 per square foot. With the rising cost of coal tar and asphalt emulsion raw materials, fuel, insurance rates etc., if you are receiving prices for sealcoating for a 100,000 square foot / 11,111 square yard project under $0.14 square feet / $1.26 square yard, you are most likely going to receive a sub-standard project when complete.
Ignoring any maintenance costs, asphalt is generally much cheaper to install than concrete. On average, the cost per square foot for asphalt will run between $2.50 to $4.00. Fluctuations in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in asphalt prices but the price will remain around this range. Concrete, on the other hand, can run between $4.00 to $6.00 per square foot for basic installation and can cost more depending on different finishes and detail. It’s not unheard of to have a stained concrete driveway with a smooth finish cost over $15.00 per square foot.
Bearing in mind these factors, professional asphalt driveway sealing can cost $.10 - $.30 per square foot or as much as $.50 - $1.00 per square foot. Doing the job yourself might yield savings of $100 - $200 per 1,000 square feet of driveway. According to the website Do it Yourself or Not, DIY costs for sealing a 20 x 50 foot drive run $80 compared to $240 for professional sealing. © 2015 CostOwl.com. All rights reserved.
