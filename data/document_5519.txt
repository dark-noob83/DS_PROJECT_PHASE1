Asia countries have successfu lly put hot fill process of PET bottles in production of shelf stable low-acid tea drinks, especially Woo-long and green tea.  Other sensitive low-acid products would become main stream products by using implemented hot fill technology. Preheating of glass bottles is necessary before filling in order to reduce the risk of glass splintering.  Prior to closure the bottle beck is flushed with steam. Steam injection keeps foaming to redu ces the oxygen content of the neck space and lowers the recontamination risk.
Hot Fill, Cold Fill and Flash Pasteurization. Hot-fill is a common process for liquid sampling that sterilizes the product prior to being poured into the bottle. The hot-fill process creates vacuum after fiiling, which along with the high filling temperatures requires a very sturdy container. EliteFill™ has in depth experience at both Hot Fill and Cold Fill applications, as well as Flash Pasteurization techniques, thereby allowing you to offer modern sampling packaging for your liquids and juice products without loss of quality, taste or flavoring.
Cold-fill is a filling process used for many fresh products such as milk and fresh juices, using containers that don’t interfere with the flavor or taste of the product. Cold fill also allows a great deal of flexibility in terms of design freedom with package, as well as providing tast and flavor protection. EliteFill™ has in depth experience at both Hot Fill and Cold Fill applications, as well as Flash Pasteurization techniques, thereby allowing you to offer modern sampling packaging for your liquids and juice products without loss of quality, taste or flavoring.
A cold-aseptic filling system can replace hot-filling processes, or bottle and can filling systems that use tunnel pasteurisers. There must always be an integrated approach in which equal attention is paid to filling safety, operating costs and operating safety, and which factors these aspects in during implementation. The process involves bottling a product at ambient temperatures without tunnel pasteurisation or hot filling and without the use of preservatives or cold sterilising agents. The products are only briefly heated before filling.
Hot Fill Bottling Lines in the Beverage Industry. * * * *. The hot fill packaging process has become very popular in the beverage industry for several reasons. Firstly, the heat is an effective method to sterilize the container and prevent bacteria growth. Many consumers are becoming aware of the ill effects of chemicals and preservatives in the packaging process and hot fill offers bottlers an alternative to incorporating these into their process. Hot fill can be suitable for multiple different types of drinks and can significantly extend the shelf life of a product.
Cold-aseptic filling is now a widely used process that is consistently being adapted to new demands. For example, rising energy prices are having an effect on energy efficiency in mechanical and plant engineering, and thus companies are focusing on economic efficiency. The process involves bottling a product at ambient temperatures without tunnel pasteurisation or hot filling and without the use of preservatives or cold sterilising agents. The products are only briefly heated before filling.
Beverage Production. Bottling facilities differ in the types of bottling lines they operate and the types of products they can run. There are Cans vs. Bottles, Hot-Fill vs. Cold-Fill and Natural vs. Conventional packaging. It is critical to understand the requirements of the beverage brand before you begin the production process. Demand for non-alcoholic beverages has been the catalyst for innovations in drink production in recent years, including beverage plants, processing and, packaging. No two-beverage plants are alike
Drinks cartons have been filled aseptically for decades. Cold-aseptics is the state-of-the-art process, but with relatively low throughput volumes and a firm commitment to the suppliers of the packaging material. Aseptic filling is ‘relatively’ new to PET containers, but has been undergoing practical testing for over a decade. The process involves bottling a product at ambient temperatures without tunnel pasteurisation or hot filling and without the use of preservatives or cold sterilising agents. The products are only briefly heated before filling.
