Permeable tarmacadam systems can be designed to collect or harvest rainwater for later use, or allow the surface rainwater simply to infiltrate the ground.
Ideally, permeable tarmac should be considered as being a tool that is environmentally friendly in so far as storm water management goes. These tools are there to help in mitigating the impact that a built environment has on natural hydrology.
This is a porous paving system that comprises an advanced membrane and underground cavity-it is designed to capture surface water, before either releasing it immediately into the sub-grade, performing a controlled release into the existing drainage (infiltration), or storing it for recycling (attenuation).
Topmix Permeable is a fast draining concrete pavement solution that rapidly directs stormwater off streets, parking surfaces, driveways and walkways. This minimises the cost and long-term maintenance for local authorities and developers of stormwater management.
This is a video demonstration of Lafarge Tarmac's Topmix permeable concrete drinking up 4,000 liters of water poured onto it. That is impressive.
The reduced fines in the permeable tarmacadam mix provides interconnected but stable air pockets within the layers of tarmacadam which allow rainwater to flow through it. To be effective however, permeable tarmacadam relies on the aggregate sub-base layers also being porous whilst still supporting the tarmacadam. Properly installed permeable tarmacadam will reduce both the rainwater run-off volume and run-off rate, and also reduce pollutants entering storm water drainage systems.
