Ranges. A normal range for the fasting blood test is 70-100 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) or less than 5.5 mmol/L (millimoles per liter). For the two-hour postprandial blood sugar test, the results should be in the 70-145 mg/dL range, or less than 7.9 mmol/L.
65-99 (mg/dl) is considered normal fasting blood sugar range. 100-125 is considered pre-diabetic. Two fasting blood sugar tests of 126 or above is confirmed diabetic. ----------------------------------------------------. The normal amount in a non-diabetic person should be between 90 and 120.

Nevertheless, most doctors consider any fasting blood sugar below 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/L) as completely normal. Independent of what they eat, the blood sugar of a truly normal person is: Under 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/L) one or two hours after a meal. Most normal people are under 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/L) two hours after eating. Blood sugars under 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) are considered to be hypoglycemic and should be avoided.
Answer: Now, in a normal individual we measure blood sugar under different circumstances. What we call fasting blood sugar or blood glucose levels is usually done six to eight hours after the last meal. So it's most commonly done before breakfast in the morning; and the normal range there is 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter.
Adults. A normal blood sugar level is between 72 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (4 to 6 mmol/L) for a healthy person. The concentration of glucose in the blood of a healthy person in the morning on an empty stomach is between 68 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (3.8 and 6.0 mmol/L).
Between 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) and 92 mg/dl (5.0 mmol/L) . This is the finding of a considerable body of research. People whose blood sugar tests at this level do not develop diabetes over the next decade or longer. Those with supposedly normal blood sugars above 92 mg/dl often do.
