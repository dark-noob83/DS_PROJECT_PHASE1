Breeding Chinchillas. Most females mature at about 7 months of age and may be put into breeding at this time. Males should be placed into breeding when they are approximately 7 or 8 months old. Chinchillas should be placed into breeding before they turn 2 years old for optimum ability to breed. A chinchilla s gestation period is 111 days
Overseas the average breeding chinchilla will weigh over 650 grams for a male and 700+ grams for a female. In New Zealand breeders should try to get breeding chinchillas as big, and healthy, as possible but over 550 grams for males and over 600 grams for females. It is widely accepted that most chinchillas have stopped growing and have matured to a point where they are capable of bearing young successfully and well by 12 months of age, though in the case of some mutations, namely Velvets, they may not mature until 18 months of age.

Some will wait even a bit longer. What You Need To Know Before Breeding Chinchillas. Breeding chinchillas involves a lot more than simple putting a male and female together in the same cage.
Chinchillas can reach sexual maturity as young as 4 â€“ 5 months of age. However, females should not be exposed to a breeding situation until they are at least one year plus and you are confident that they have reached full size. 
If the female is not in heat you certainly can (and should) let them have supervised play time together. On the other end of the age issue is the fact that if a chinchilla has not reproduced by the time it is 2 years old, it probably never will.
