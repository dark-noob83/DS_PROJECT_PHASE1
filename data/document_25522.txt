Summary. Armstrong Creek Bison Company is a family run farm with approximately 150 purebred American bison. All of our bison are 100% grass fed on 200 acres of strip grazed pasture. In the spring, our honey bees are pollinating our vegetables in the greenhouse and apples and pears in the orchard.
Buffalo/Bison Meat is not covered by The Mandatory Federal Meat Inspection Act and does not have to be USDA inspected. However, meat purchased at the Wooden Nickel Buffalo Farm has undergone this inspection voluntarily through McDonald’s Meats in Girard PA and has been given the USDA triangle stamp of approval. Our Bison Meat cuts are 100% pure Bison with no additives, except for the fully cooked processed cuts.
Contents. Bison, commonly referred to as the American Plains Buffalo, are native not only to the Great Plains and the Midwest. They once roamed the mountain slopes and valleys of Pennsylvania. The state's last native bison was shot in 1801.
