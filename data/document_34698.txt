Microsoft is holding the pricing of Visual Studio 2015 Professional with MSDN constant with the current price of the 2013 version at $1,200 for a one year subscription per user, and $800 for a renewal. From a retail perspective, Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate with MSDN currently costs $13,300 for a new subscription and $4,250 for a renewal subscription per user per year. And Visual Studio Premium with MSDN currently goes for $6,120 for a new subscription and $2,570 for a renewal (again, per user, per year). Comparatively, the new combined Visual Studio Enterprise with MSDN will cost $6,000 for a new subscription, and $2,570 for a renewal subscription per user per year
So for small sized teams it was very cheap to work with TFS. However when the company grows to 6+ people, you had to buy the Full Edition. The Full Edition costs $2700, and for every user that makes use of TFS you need a CAL, which is $500. In a MSDN subscription a CAL is included.
OTOH, VS2010 Pro with MSDN is USD732 for the upgrade price. Each sub includes TFS with 1 CAL. Since CALs can be used to access an unlimited number of TFS deployments, you can install one copy of TFS on a server, and have all clients access the same TFS deployment. We can't get a straight answer to this question from Microsoft or any vendors. We have TFS 2005 (about 10 CALs) and want to move to 2010, but no one can tell us how much this will cost! All we're getting so far is a wall of silence.
It will cost you $500 to purchase TFS. When you want to make use of the Full Edition, you can now buy it for $500, and it includes 5 CALâ€™s. For every other user, you need to buy an addition CAL of $500 or you need to have a MSDN subscription. So lets go back to our example shop of 5 developers and 7 other persons. However when the company grows to 6+ people, you had to buy the Full Edition. The Full Edition costs $2700, and for every user that makes use of TFS you need a CAL, which is $500. In a MSDN subscription a CAL is included.
To grow to more than five users, you will need to have CALs for additional users beyond five users. This enables small teams of five or fewer to get up and running on Team Foundation Server for as little as $500 USD. We can't get a straight answer to this question from Microsoft or any vendors. We have TFS 2005 (about 10 CALs) and want to move to 2010, but no one can tell us how much this will cost! All we're getting so far is a wall of silence.
According to this blog post, 5 CALs are included with TFS. Team Foundation Server will also be available in retail for around $500 USD and will include a license term allowing up to five (5) named users without CALs to use Team Foundation Server.

MSDN Licensing. MSDN subscriptions are licensed on a per-user basis. One person can use the software to design, develop, test, or demonstrate his or her programs on any number of devices. When software development projects are nearing completion, an MSDN subscription license also allows your end users to access the software to perform acceptance tests on your programs. With Visual Studio 2012, your end users can also provide feedback on your programs using the Feedback Client for TFS.
Currently I'm decide move my projects from SVN to TFS, and first idea was buy TFS hosting. But when I was review many hosting providers I was shocked their prices politic. Hosting TFS price begin with 20$ per user/month! I was found price of TFS 2010 and on Microsoft Store it's price 499$. VDS hosting can get with price about 10$ per month. You're right that the minimum cost is around $15-$20/user/month. The reason for this is that the hosting providers have to use SPLA licensing from Microsoft. In addition to a Windows SAL (subscriber access license), they also need to charge for the TFS SAL.
