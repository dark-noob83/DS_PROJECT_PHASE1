A typical residential solar PV panel system in the U.S. costs $3.60/watt after installation, and the solar panels typically save the customer over $20,000 (net) over the course of 20 years. Learn more about the many advantages of solar energy. 
Solar Panels. The solar panels themselves usually account for about 30% of total costs. Residential solar panels with a combined capacity of 3-8kW typically cost between $4,000-$16,000. The best solar panels are not necessarily the most expensive. This metric indicates costs relative to electrical power output. The cost of solar panels have decreased significantly over the last decade and are currently selling for under $0.70/W in industrial quantities. For homeowners, this translates to about $1.5/W.

1 Solar-powered home water heaters cost $1,000-$3,500 (including installation) but have extremely low monthly operating costs and can be used in any climate, according to the US Department of Energy. 2  The cost for a solar heating system can vary widely. 1 The most cost-effective solar heating systems usually provide 40-80% of a home's heating needs; it's often impractical to supply 100 percent of the heat needed and most building codes and mortgage lenders require a back-up heating system
Solar electricity costs about $10 to $12 a watt installed, though you may be eligible for state incentives. Check your utility bill to see your monthly usage. A robust solar electric system will cost about $20,000. A solar energy system big enough to power a computer and a few other small items might cost you about $700 to $1000. These are also well suited for RVs, boats and camping. Learn more about portable solar energy units.
Inverters convert direct current (DC) from your solar panels into alternating current (AC), which is used by home appliances and enables you to grid-tie your system. Inverters typically account for 10% ($1,000-$4,000) of total costs. This metric indicates costs relative to electrical power output. The cost of solar panels have decreased significantly over the last decade and are currently selling for under $0.70/W in industrial quantities. For homeowners, this translates to about $1.5/W.
The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.72/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. “Common residential system prices ranged from less than $3.00/W to just above $7.00/W,” the Solar Energy Industries Association writes.
For premade solar panels, a single panel can cost about $900, or $12 per watt. A medium sized system to provide power to a small or very energy efficient house might cost $25,000 and a solar system to power a large house could cost $50,000+. The average installed system will cost $7-9 per watt. So, multiply the average hourly watt hours you need to generate that you got from the last step by something between $7 and $9 and that is what it will cost for solar panels with enough capacity to power your house.

Figuring out exactly how much your solar system will cost can take a little detective work. Electricity rates vary, and each state has different rebates that may affect the overall price of your system. The average system costs a little over $10,000. With Wholesale Solar’s current pricing (Jan. 2015), a medium sized gridtie system that generates about 815 kWh a month would cost about $10,500 BEFORE the 30% federal tax credit and rebates offered by your state or utility company.
