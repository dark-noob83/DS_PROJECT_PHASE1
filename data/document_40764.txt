introduction magnetic resonance imaging mri is a type of scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body an mri scanner is a large tube that contains powerful magnets you lie inside the tube during the sca
description of a neck or back mri magnetic resonance imaging mri is a diagnostic tool images are created using a very strong magnet the images obtained are based on water content of tissues a neck or back mri does not involve radiation it is used to image many parts of the spine such as discs facet joints spinal nerves tumors infections cysts and other structures a neck or back mri provides more images from more views than traditional x rays
magnetic resonance imaging mri is a diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of a large magnet radiofrequencies and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body unlike x rays or computed tomography ct scans mri does not use ionizing radiation 
mri scans are a non invasive and painless procedure unlike x rays and ct scans mri does not ionize radiation which is potentially harmful to the patient mri is an acronym for magnetic resonance imaging 
the length of the exam depends on the type of study being performed mri of the brain 20 45 minute scan time mri of the orbits 20 35 minute scan time mri of the tmj 45 60 minute scan time mri of the soft tissue neck 25 35 minute scan time mri of the cervical spine 20 35 minute scan time mri of the upper extremity 20 45 minute scan time mri of the thoracic spine 25 45 minute scan time mri of the chest 25 45 minute scan time mri of the abdomen 25 45
magnetic resonance imaging mri of the head is done to look for the cause of headaches help diagnose a stroke or blood vessel problems in the head problems with blood vessels may include an aneurysm or abnormal twisted blood vessels that are present at birth this is called an arteriovenous av malformation magnetic resonance imaging mri is a test that uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to take pictures of the head in many cases mri gives information that can t be seen on an x ray ultrasound or computed tomography ct scan
magnetic resonance imaging mri is a noninvasive medical test that physicians use to diagnose and treat medical conditions mri uses a powerful magnetic field radio frequency pulses and a computer to produce detailed pictures of organs soft tissues bone and virtually all other internal body structures magnetic resonance imaging mri of the shoulder uses a powerful magnetic field radio waves and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the bones tendons muscles and blood vessels within the shoulder joint it is primarily used to assess injuri
magnetic resonance imaging mri is a noninvasive imaging technique a cervical mri scans the soft tissues of the neck and cervical spine the cervical spine is the portion of the spine that runs through the neck a cervical spine mri is used to help diagnose tumors bulging herniated discs
