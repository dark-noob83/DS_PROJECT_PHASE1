Instructions. Use a comma to separate numbers. When the day of the month and the year appear side by side, a comma is used to separate them. For example, in July 21, 2008, a comma separates 21 and 2008.. Use a comma to separate words. When the day of the week and the month appear side by side, a comma is used to separate them: Monday, July 21, 2008. Use a comma after the date in a sentence.
Answer: No comma after June, since no day is expressed. There is a comma after 1990, but not because it s a date. That comma is there because the phrase after one year of employment is not restrictive. It doesn t tell which June 1990; it gives extra information about that June 1990.
@AnWulf. You state: “The commas may not be “required”, but I prefer them because I often pause, ever so slightly, between the month and year when speaking.”. This is a good example of the risk of using the “put a comma where you pause” strategy. You pause at that point; I do not.
When you indicate month, day, and year, put a comma after the day and after the year (unless some other punctuation mark, like a period or question mark, follows the year). Include these commas even if the month-day-year expression serves as an adjective: On July 1, 2006, the committee dismissed the employee.
