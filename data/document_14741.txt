Over England the mean annual temperature at low altitudes varies from about 8.5 °C to 11 °C, with the highest values occurring around or near to the coasts of Cornwall (in the south west). Winter temperatures average 4.4 °C (40 °F). Summer temperatures average about 15.6 °C (60 °F ().
A map of average annual rainfall therefore looks similar to a topographic map. Rainfall in Wales varies widely, with the highest average annual totals being recorded in the central upland spine from Snowdonia to the Brecon Beacons. Snowdonia is the wettest area with average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm, comparable to those in the English Lake District or the western Highlands of Scotland.
Snowdonia is the wettest part of Wales with average annual totals exceeding 3,000 mm, but coastal areas and the east receive less than 1,000 mm a year. Over Wales the mean annual temperature at low altitudes varies from about 9.5 °C to 10.5 °C, with the higher values occurring around or near to the coasts.
Below the tables there's a map that allows you to visually compare the annual average temperatures among states. State-wide averages of annual temperatures range from a high of 70.7 degrees Fahrenheit (21.5 degrees Celsius) in Florida to a low of 26.6 °F (-3.0 °C) in Alaska. For the entire United States, excluding Hawaii and Alaska, the year averages 52.7 °F (11.5 °C).
Wales: climate. Wales is a mainly mountainous country with much of the land being over 150 metres. In the north, Snowdon is the highest mountain in England and Wales, at 1085 metres, and in the south the Brecon Beacons rise to 885 metres.
The mean annual temperature decreases by approximately 0.5 °C for each 100 metres increase in height so that, for example, a location at 400 metres would have a mean annual temperature of about 7.5 °C. On this basis, Snowdon (at 1085 metres) would have an annual mean of about 5 °C.
Snowdonia is the wettest part of Wales with average annual totals exceeding 3,000 mm, but coastal areas and the east receive less than 1,000 mm a year. Over Wales the mean annual temperature at low altitudes varies from about 9.5 °C to 10.5 °C, with the higher values occurring around or near to the coasts.
