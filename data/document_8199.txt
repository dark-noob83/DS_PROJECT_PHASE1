A personal loan is not the same as car loan or a home loan. You can only use a car loan to buy a car and a home loan or mortgage to buy a house. The loan is actually backed by the car or home and you can only get approved if you buy the home or car the loan is for. If your credit is not that good, you can still apply for a credit card (which is a type of personal loan), or a payday loan or cash advance. The catch is you will pay more for the credit (interest rate and fees). In the case of payday loans or cash advances, you will have to pay the money back fast
