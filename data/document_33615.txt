Laying out a set of Stairs doesn't need to be scary!! 10/02 Shot GlassDisplay Case Free PirateChest Plans Bink's Horse Stable Bink's Lil Wheelbarrow But i was a little scared planing the entrance to our new porch. I wanted wide steps, that means more stringers. I also wanted a shorter riser, that means more steps.
Laying out winder stairs. Here's an easy, accurate way to lay out stairs that have wedge-shaped treads where the stair makes a 90° turn. This type of stair is called a winder, and it can bail you out of a situation where there isn't enough headroom for a standard landing.
The essence of laying out stair stringers is straightforward. You use a framing square to draw the stair’s notches on the stringer, then you cut them out. If you’ve done the math (it’s gradeschool stuff) and the layout right, the tread cuts will be level and the riser cuts plumb.
Determining Rise and Run. To lay out your stringers, you need to know your precise step rise and run, which varies depending on the height of your deck. First, the distance from deck to ground -- the total rise -- is measured. The result is divided by 7 inches to determine the number of steps needed.
You don’t have to lay out the upper riser; just make a mark so you know exactly where the tread ends. 6. Mark the plumb cut at the top of the stringer. Flip the square around to the bottom of the stringer, and mark a cutline from the back of the top tread to the bottom
Sure, building deck stairs can be tricky. But in this story, we'll make it easy by showing you how to estimate step dimensions, layout and cut stair stringers, and assemble the stair parts. And you won't have to do any hard math to figure it all out (but your calculations will have to be accurate!).
1 Measure out that distance from the deck to find the exact landing point. 2  From this point, you can measure the exact stair height and determine the stringer and skirt length. 3  Measure the exact total rise (Photo 1). 4  Divide the height (X) by your estimated number of risers to find the exact riser height.
