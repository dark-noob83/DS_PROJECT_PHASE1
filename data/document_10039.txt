It will vary because some clubs are better off than others. You get a team like Peterborough or MK Dons who will probably be able to pay some of their players over £1,000 a week compared to a club like Mansfield or Rochdale will probably only able to afford to offer like £500 a week or less. 1  Reply.

Some colleges are going to pay athletes. The NCAA voted Thursday to allow 65 teams from the so-called Big 5 power conferences—the ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac 12, and SEC, plus Notre Dame, a football independent that is now a member of the ACC in other sports—to make their own rules.
A popular belief is that OHL players get paid a salary or wage. While players do receive a stipend for a certain amount of money, they do not receive a salary in full. Often this myth circulates because the fact that OHL players do receive some perks, including the money they make, renders them ineligible for an NCAA scholarship.
No, how much a federations pay their players is totaly their own decision. FIFA has nothing to do with it.

Players on the 53-man roster and injured reserve at game time receive payment for Wild Card and Divisional playoff games.

Again somewhere like Aldershot, Stevenage and Cambridge could probably pay their players pretty much football league salaries, but somewhere like Droyslden or Northwich wouldn't probably pay much more than around £200 or £300 a week.

Players are paid much differently in the playoffs than during the regular season. Most players take a significant pay cut in the playoffs because their salaries have no bearing on what they make in the postseason. Playoff money comes from a league pool instead of from NFL teams.
