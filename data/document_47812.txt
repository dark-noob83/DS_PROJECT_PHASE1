A capnograph is a device that measures the concentration of CO2 in exhaled air. It is used to monitor patient status for different types of illnesses. The device graphs partial pressure of CO2 vs. Time. This graph can be analyzed to determine types and severity of various diseases.
A capnograph provides a picture of the patients cardio-respiratory system in the form of the CO 2 waveform which provides clinicians invaluable information. Viewing a numerical End Tidal CO 2 value without the waveform is analogous to viewing the heart rate without the ECG trace.
A capnograph measures how much carbon dioxide is present in the patients breath. They are an essential piece of monitoring and you can find them in areas such as operating rooms, recovery, critical care, wards, and ambulances.
Capnography is becoming an integral part of the monitoring done in the prehospital environment. A capnograph is used to monitor/measure the amount of carbon dioxide in respiratory gases. It provides information about the effectiveness of respiration’s, and end-tidal carbon dioxide values.
A capnometer or capnograph is a medical instrument which measures the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the expired breath of patients.
