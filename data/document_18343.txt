I came across this reasonably interesting puzzle in one of the newspapers a couple of months ago (can't remember which sorry) that I'm pretty sure was called tatami. The aim of the puzzle was to place certain numbers in the grid, based on the shapes of thick regions that joined together to make the grid. So for instance there might be a 6x6 grid and two regions of 3x1 in a row, you would then need to place 1,2,3 once in each of the regions. Re: What about tatami. Just found one example of this on another website... took me a while to work out just how it worked and I didn't find it particularly interesting, but perhaps it's one of those puzzles that takes a while to get into.

I worked on my first crossword puzzle when I was about 6-years-old, sitting on my Dad's knee. He let me help him with his puzzle almost every day as I was growing up. Over the years, Dad passed on to me his addiction to crosswords. Now in my early 50s, I work on my Irish Times and New York Times puzzles every day. 1 0330-15 New York Times Crossword Answers 30 Mar 15... 2  0329-15 New York Times Crossword Answers 29 Mar 15... 3  0328-15 New York Times Crossword Answers 28 Mar 15... 4  0327-15 New York Times Crossword Answers 27 Mar 15...

THEME: N-Less … unusually, we have a themed Saturday puzzle. Four of the answers explain what is going on i.e. EACH CLUE IN THE PUZZLE IS MISSING THE LETTER N, so I’ve rewritten each of the clues (below) with the Ns added back in: 17A. First part of a hit (hint) for this crossword: EACH CLUE IN 32A. Hit (hint), part 2: THE PUZZLE 46A. Hit (hint), part 3: IS MISSING 62A. It took me a long time to discover the no-N-clues theme in this puzzle. I would have found it a little more rewarding if there was a deeper level to the theme relating the clues/answers for those clues that were missing two Ns or two consecutive Ns. If there is such a deeper theme, I have missed it.
