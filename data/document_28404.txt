The survey shows that the average home was built on 14,359 square feet of land, had 2,607 square feet of finished area, and sold for $399,532. The average share of the homeâ€™s sales price which goes to the construction costs jumped from 59 percent in both 2009 and 2011 to 62 percent in 2013. Finished lot costs, accounting for the second largest share of the sales price, dropped from 22 percent in 2011 to 19
For instance, if your county assessed your home at $140,000 and the land at $31,000 for a total assessed value of of $171,000, you would divide $140,000 into $171,000 to find that the house represents 81.87 percent of the total value of your property.
Step 3. Multiply your cost basis by the percentage share of the house to find the value of the house. With a house that represents 81.87 percent of the total property's value of $179,100, the house would be worth $146,629.
1 The real estate's total cost of $220,000 is 88% of the total appraised value of $250,000. 2  We can multiply the land's appraised value of $50,000 times 88% in order to get the cost of the land at $44,000. 3  The building's appraised value of $200,000 times the 88% cost ratio equals the cost of land at $176,000.
1 When the value of land is estimated to be less than 5 percent of home value, which happens with some frequency, the value of land is set to 5 percent of home value and the replacement cost of structures is set to 95 percent of home value. 2  Land Share.
1 We can multiply the land's appraised value of $50,000 times 88% in order to get the cost of the land at $44,000. 2  The building's appraised value of $200,000 times the 88% cost ratio equals the cost of land at $176,000.
The problem is that opinions vary greatly on what that ratio is. The most frequently heard is 3:1, that is, the house should be at least 3 times the cost of the land so that a $50,000 lot damands a $150,000 home.
1 The land share is Land Value as a percent of Home Value. 2  Home Price Index. 3  The Home Price Index is based on the adjusted FHFA indexes used to compute the Home Value series. 4  The second quarter of 1990 is defined as 100.
