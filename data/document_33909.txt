The International Space Station (ISS) is a research facility that is being built in low orbit around the Earth. The space station is so large that it can actually be seen with the naked eye and is the largest space station built to date.
The mission of the International Space Station is to enable long-term exploration of space and provide benefits to people on Earth. With six state-of-the-art laboratories, the Space Station will be the premiere research facility in space, four times larger and more capable than any previous space station.
The International Space Station (ISS) is an internationally developed research facility currently being assembled in low Earth Orbit, orbiting at an altitude between 320 km (199 mi) to 345 km (214 mi).
The main purpose of the International Space Station is to provide an international laboratory for experiments within the space environment. Which, despite all our technological advances, is nearly impossible to replicate here on Earth.
