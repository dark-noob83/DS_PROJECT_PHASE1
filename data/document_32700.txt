An ATM surcharge is an extra charge levied by a bank for using its ATM machine. This could come from a bank with which a person is affiliated (the bank the issues the card). Alternately, it may come from a different bank or ATM machine that charges for use.
At the top 10 U.S. banks, the average out-of-network ATM fee is $2.45, up from $2.25 in November. Then, don’t forget that ATM operator also has the right to slap on a surcharge, usually around $3 to $5.
If First Megabank -- the ATM owner in this example -- imposes a $1.50 surcharge, then your $20 withdrawal will appear on your receipt as $21.50, even though all you get is $20.

The data come from surveying 10 banks and thrifts in each of 25 large U.S. markets from July 9 to Aug. 5, 2015. 1  Share this story.
Some bank ATMs will charge an additional surcharge fee to use their ATM. Avoid ATM surcharge fees by using ATM locations that show these brand marks. Always read ATM messages carefully. Press the cancel key if you wish to avoid the fee.
