Before you put the pork chops in the oven, brown them first to seal in the juices and improve flavor. Coat a 12-inch skillet with cooking spray. Heat the skillet on medium high, then add the pork chops. Cook the chops on each side for 4 to 5 minutes until the outsides are golden brown. Transfer the chops to a baking dish along with any juices, then bake them.
Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, then set aside on a plate. Heat canola oil over medium to medium-high heat. Add butter. When butter is melted and butter/oil mixture is hot, cook 3 pork chops at a time, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side; 1 to 2 minutes on the other side. (Make sure no pink juices remain.) Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining porch chops.
Grill over direct medium-high heat 4 minutes per side with lid down. If chops are thicker (1 1/2), grill for about 10 minutes per side. Can brush with sauce in last few minutes of grilling. Any type of cooking of pork chops... The idea would be to get the internal temperature of the pork to be around 160 degrees.
Heat the canola oil over medium to medium-high heat. Add the butter. When the butter is melted and the butter/oil mixture is hot, cook 3 pork chops at a time, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook until the chops are golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes (make sure no pink juices remain).
