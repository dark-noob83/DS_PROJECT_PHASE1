The initial ICD implantation costs range from $28,500 to $55,200*, with an annual follow-up cost from $4,800 to $17,000. Most insurance companies will cover these fees. *Systematic Review of ICD Costs and Outcomes (2006, Peter W. Groeneveld, MD, MS).
In 2008 the predicted cost to implement ICD-10 ranged from $83,290 for a small practice, $285,195 for a medium practice and $2,728,780 for a large practice. Based on new information, the 2014 study found the following cost ranges for each practice size based on variable factors such as specialty, vendor and software.
Hi all, I am curious as to how much your ICD has cost you. If your insurance picked up some of the cost and if you had a large balance. I just read that it could cost $45,000.

Much higher annual costs ($16,000-$17,000) were found in the 2 U.S. clinical trials of ICDs. 3,4 Using unpublished data from Medicare and Kaiser Permanente, Owens et al., 5 Hsu et al., 8 and Weiss et al.

I just read an interesting item out of the HFMA conference in Las Vegas this week. A couple panelists shared their ICD-10 implementation costs. The North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, New York, a 14-hospital system, expects to pay about $50 million for IT, training and other upgrades. Sutter Health, California, a 24 hospital system, estimates it will cost more than $100 million. That includes $60 for IT and $25 million for a computer assisted coding (CAC) program. Does that mean only about $15 million for training? I'm hearing that training is going to be a much bigger part of the budget.
