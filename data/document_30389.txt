In the last few months, a movement has begun to take shape. It's a movement of people who think it's time for change in the IT industry-time to stop wasting money, time to start delivering great software, and building systems that scale and last. This movement is being called Devops. 
1 DevOps (a portmanteau of development and operations) is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and Information Technology(IT) professionals. 2  DevOps is a response to the interdependence of software development and IT operations. DevOps is the blending of tasks performed by a company's application development and systems operations teams. The term DevOps is being used in several ways.
This is the latest accepted revision, reviewed on 12 October 2015. DevOps (a clipped compound of development and operations) is a software development method that emphasizes the roles of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals. DevOps integration targets product delivery, quality testing, feature development, and maintenance releases in order to improve reliability and security and provide faster development and deployment cycles.
DevOps – a combination of Development & Operations – is a software development methodology which looks to integrate all the software development functions from development to operations within the same cycle. QA changes for DevOps: 1  QA are required to align their efforts in the DevOps cycle. 2  They have to make sure that all their test cases are automated and achieve near 100% code coverage. 3  They need to make sure that their environments are standardized and deployment on their QA boxes is automated.
DevOps is agile IT operations delivery, required to match the cadence of agile IT development. DevOps is a philosophy, not a method, or framework, or body of knowledge, or *shudder* vendor's tool. DevOps is the philosophy of unifying Development and Operations at the culture, practice, and tool levels, to achieve accelerated and more frequent deployment of changes to Production. DevOps is the blending of tasks performed by a company's application development and systems operations teams. The term DevOps is being used in several ways.
– Why you need a DevOps model. DevOps is a movement in the software world that focuses on collaboration between developers and operations, customer empathy and infrastructure automation. In traditional models, developers write code and then hand it to operations teams to deploy and and run in a production environment. As the pace of development and business continues to scale, teams need an agile and collaborative work environment to succeed. Moving to a DevOps model is a critical part of setting your engineering teams up to succeed, but making the transition can be challenging for many companies.
DevOps is a software development method that emphasizes communication, collaboration (information sharing and web service usage), integration, automation, and measurement of cooperation between software developers and other IT professionals. DevOps integration targets product delivery, quality testing, feature development, and maintenance releases in order to improve reliability and security and provide faster development and deployment cycles.
Bringing development and operations together. Devops is a cultural and professional movement in response to the mistakes commonly made by large organisations. Often organisations will have very separate units for: 1  development. 2  quality assurance. 3  operations business. 
The latest trend in software development is the culture of DevOps, in which developers partner with operations staff to assure that software runs with a minimum of problems. DevOps is good for developers. There are three principal reasons a developer would want to work in a DevOps-oriented organization: 1  A better quality of life. 2  Developers working in DevOps-mode receive fewer calls in the middle of the night to resolve production issues.
