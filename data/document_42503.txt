Given in the paragraphs below are the reasons why and how the heart rate increases with an increase in temperature. When you are roaming in the hot sun, the body temperature also increases. However, the core temperature of the body has to be maintained, despite the hot environment. The heart rate starts climbing as the body temperature rises.

Hence, the heart beats faster, which actually helps to increase the rate of heat loss from the body. Also, the dilation of blood vessels lowers the blood pressure. Hence, in order to restore normal blood pressure, the heart beats faster and pushes more blood through the blood vessels. The heart rate starts climbing as the body temperature rises.

Dehydration causes heart rate to increase. In heat loss, heart rate decreases as adjustments result in improved exercise capacity to heat exposure but minimally to cold stress. This generally takes about 10 days. Shivering can increase the heart rate significantly to increase core temperature. Heart rates tend to be lower in the morning. Heart rate increases  at high temperatures. Dehydration causes an increase in heart rate.  Heart rate during running varies by a … few beats from day-to-day.  Training heart rate does not predict racing
Cardiac output can be increased by increasing the heart rate. Thus an increase in temperature, through the vasodilation of blood vessels causes a drop in blood pressure, which is compensated for by increasing the cardiac output, which can be achieved through increasing the heart rate. 
A normal heat rate varies anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute. There are several factors that affect the heart rate, the most common being exercise and noise. However, a little unknown factor that has shown to influence heart rate is temperature. The heart rate starts climbing as the body temperature rises.

Best Answer: In heat gain, heart rate increases as the result of changes in the core body temperature. Dressing appropriately is the most important consideration to maintain the bodies core temperature. Dehydration causes heart rate to increase. In heat loss, heart rate decreases as adjustments result in improved exercise capacity to heat exposure but minimally to cold stress. This generally takes about 10 days. Shivering can increase the heart rate significantly to increase core temperature. Report Abuse. Unless the temperature is so hot or so cold that it is shocking or painful, temperature really doesn't affect your heart rate directly Oxygen content in the air is affected by temperature sometimes. For example, room temperature atmosphere usually holds 22% oxygen.

A normal human body temperature should measure 98.6 F, according to Medline Plus, a service of the National Library of Medicine. Medline Plus also states a normal pulse should be 60 to 100 beats per minute for adults. Each beat of the human heart circulates blood through the vessels, carrying oxygen and nutrients to the rest of the body.
How Other Factors Affect Heart Rate. 1  Air temperature: When temperatures (and the humidity) soar, the heart pumps a little more blood, so your pulse rate may increase, but usually no more than five to 10 beats a minute. 1 Air temperature: When temperatures (and the humidity) soar, the heart pumps a little more blood, so your pulse rate may increase, but usually no more than five to 10 beats a minute. 2  Body position: Resting, sitting or standing, your pulse is usually the same.
