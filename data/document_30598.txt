The Marianas (or Mariana) Trench is formed by the subduction of the Pacific Plate as it is forced under the smaller Mariana Plate at the bottom of the ocean between Japan and New Guinea.
Two oceanic plates converging forminga trench between the plates, USGS. Mariana Trench Trenches form in some areas when two oceanic plates converge forming a subduction zone. The Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Mariana Plate forming Mariana Trench. The Pacific Plate is older and colder than the Mariana Plate.
The Northwestern Pacific Ocean region is made up of a succession of three tectonic plates. From the most western, moderately-sized and roughly equant Philippine Sea plate, to the small crescent-shaped Marianas Plate and lastly, to the east, the vast Pacific Plate.
By Jennifer Kennedy. The Mariana Trench (also called the Marianas Trench) is the deepest part of the ocean. This trench lies in an area where two of the Earth's plates-the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Plate-come together.
In the case of a convergent boundary between two oceanic plates, one is usually subducted under the other, and in the process a trench is formed. The Marianas Trench (paralleling the Mariana Islands), for example, marks where the fast-moving Pacific Plate converges against the slower moving Philippine Plate.
The Mariana's Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans. It was created when the pacific plate was subducted beneath the Mariana plate. It was formed because of divergent plates.
