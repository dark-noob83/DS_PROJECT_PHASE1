Step 1. Remove the tops, place the radishes in a plastic bag and put them in the refrigerator. Do not clean them first. Winter radishes will stay fresh in the refrigerator this way for up to two weeks. Summer radishes will stay fresh for up to a week. The leaves cause moisture and nutrient loss which is why you remove the tops first.
Instructions. Cut off the green end of the radish with a knife. Be sure not to cut into the radish, and do not remove the tip. Do not wash the radishes before storage. The excess moisture will cause spoilage. Place the greens into plastic storage bags, and the radishes into separate storage bags. The moisture in the greens causes the radishes to spoil at a faster rate. Put the bags into the refrigerator crisper. The greens will remain fresh for two to three days. Summer radishes need to be used within five to seven days.
Hereâ€™s a trick to keep any type of radish crisp as the day you bought it for up to a week. Trim the leaves, stem, and root off of the radishes. The leaves draw water from the radish, causing it to dry out faster. Thoroughly wash the radishes to remove any dirt. In a large jar, add the radishes and cover with cold water.
