Irregular time signatures are straightforward: here we have 5 crotchets (quarter notes), so the time signature is 5/4. Remember that the top number tells you how many to count, and the lower number tells you the type of note. Irregular time signatures have any number of beats per bar which is not divisible by 2, 3 or 4. In the bar above, you can count six crotchets (quarter notes). Six is divisible by 2 or 3, so it will be a regular time signature.

Again, the rhythms in each bar can be anything as long as they add to 3 quarter notes. The top number of the time signature tells you how many beats to count. This could be any number. Most often the number of beats will fall between 2 and 12. The bottom number tells you what kind of note to count.
4/4 Time Signature Example: A time signature of 4/4 means count 4 (top number) quarter notes (bottom number) to each bar. So the pulse, or beat, is counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. That means all the notes in each bar must add up to 4 quarter notes. The top number of the time signature tells you how many beats to count. This could be any number. Most often the number of beats will fall between 2 and 12. The bottom number tells you what kind of note to count.
In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or 3 4 (read common time and three-four time, respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. Compound time signatures are named as if they were simple time signatures, in which the one-third part of the beat unit is the beat, so the top number is commonly 6, 9 or 12 (multiples of 3). The lower number is most commonly an 8 (an eighth-note): as in 9 8 or 12 8.
Report Abuse. What note counts as a beat For instance, a piece in the 4/4 time signature would mean that there are 4 beats per measure and that every quarter note is equal to one beat. The bottom number gives the type of note as a fraction of a whole note (a whole note is called a 'semibreve' in UK English) that is the beat unit; e.g., 4 on the bottom means quarter-note (crotchet) counts and 8 on the bottom mean eighth-note (quaver) counts.
