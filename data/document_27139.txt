this is because the higher you go the lower the temperature at which water boils at sea level water boils at around 212 degrees fahrenheit about 5000 feet above sea level water boils at about 203 degrees these numbers apply to pure water if you add salt the water will boil at a slightly higher temperature
this calculator takes altitude into consideration in the boiling point temperature of water as well as the atmospheric pressure involved in the calculation our base version calculator does not at a barometric pressure of 29 92 inches of mercury standard pressure at sea level water boils at about 212 0 f 1 
100 212 2nd answer water boils at 212 degrees on the fahrenheit scale which is 100 degrees on the celsius scale but only at sea level at a specific air pressure if you boil water say half way up mount everest the boiling point temperature is so low that it is very difficult to cook food 100 degrees celsius or 212 degrees fahrenheit at sea level as your height above sea level increases the temperature at which water boils becomes lower in denver colorado at 5280 ft water boils at 94 6 c or 202 f 100 degree celsius 100 degrees c 100 212
100 c 212 f or 373 15 kelvin water boils at 100 degrees celsius 212 degrees fahrenheit or 373 15 kelvin under standard conditions at sea level at one atmosphere of pressure the boiling point of water and any other substance depends on the atmospheric pressure which changes with elevation 100 degrees celsius or 212 degrees fahrenheit at sea level as your height above sea level increases the temperature at which water boils becomes lower in denver colorado at 5280 ft water boils at 94 6 c or 202 f 100 degree celsius 100 degrees c 100 212
therefore hard water boils at a higher temperature the difference in the boiling point between typical supplies of hard and soft water is about a degree or two alcohol alcohol has a lower boiling point that water about 175 deg f as compared with 212 deg f high altitude water boils at less than 212 f approximately 96 f each 500 foot increase in altitude causes a drop of about 1 in the boiling point sea level water boils at 212 f and simmers at 190 f tepid water 85 to 105 f the water is comparable to the temperature of the human body warm water 115 to 120 f the water is touchable but not hot hot water 130 to 135 f the water is too hot to touch without injury
here s the answer to this common question answer short answer the boiling point of water is 100 c or 212 f at 1 atmosphere of pressure sea level but water boils at a lower temperature as you gain altitude e g on a mountain and boils at a higher temperature if you increase atmospheric pressure lived below sea level 
as atmospheric pressure decreases water boils at lower temperatures at sea level water boils at 212 f with each 500 feet increase in elevation the boiling point of water is lowered by just under 1 f at 7500 feet for example water boils at about 198 f because water boils at a lower temperature at higher elevations foods that are prepared by boiling or simmering will cook at a lower temperature and it will take longer to cook
best answer water boils at 212 f that means what ever food is in said water will never go above 212f once water hits 212 it turns into gas vapor the water in the pot is 212f it does not matter how high the temp of the stove is this is from high school chemistry this is one reason for adouble boiler a pot ontop of a pot of boiling water the food can not burn since the temperature will never go above 212f the boiling point of water is always 100 c 212 f the differences in the boiling point of water depends on the altitude extra ingredients in the water salt sugar alcohol and water hardness due to the mineral contents ldatm 5 years ago thumbs up
