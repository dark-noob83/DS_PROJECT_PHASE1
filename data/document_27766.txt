Net-generation from renewable energy sources in the German electricity sector has increased from 6.3% in 2000 to about 30% in 2014. For the first time ever, wind, biogas, and solar combined accounted for a larger portion of net electricity production than brown coal. The German Government reported, in 2011, renewable energy (mainly wind turbines and biomass plants) generated more than 123 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, providing nearly 20% of the 603 TWh of electricity supplied.
BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government approved legislation on Tuesday revamping Germany’s sweeping plan to generate more than 40 percent of its energy needs through renewable resources by 2025 by slowing the rapid expansion of solar and wind parks in an effort to hold down spiraling prices. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that about 11% of world marketed energy consumption is from renewable energy sources (biofuels, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, and wind) with a projection for 15% by 2040. 
The new record of 50 percent of Germany’s energy demand being produced by solar means that 74 percent of all the energy produced in the country comes from renewable resources; wind power being a close second. During the record breaking afternoon, energy prices dipped into the negative for a period of time. 
FRANKFURT— Germany is one of the top producers of renewable energy in the world. Since the year 2000 the country’s production of clean electricity jumped from a modest 6 percent to 25 percent last year in an effort to shift the German economy from nuclear power and fossil fuels towards wind and solar energy. 
While peak-generation from combined wind and solar reached a new all-time high of 74% in April 2014, wind power saw its best day ever on December 12, 2014, generating 562 GWh. Germany has been called the world's first major renewable energy economy. The German Government reported, in 2011, renewable energy (mainly wind turbines and biomass plants) generated more than 123 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, providing nearly 20% of the 603 TWh of electricity supplied.
More than 23,000 wind turbines and 1.4 million solar PV systems are distributed all over the country's area of 357,000 square kilometers. As of 2011, Germany's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. The German Government reported, in 2011, renewable energy (mainly wind turbines and biomass plants) generated more than 123 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, providing nearly 20% of the 603 TWh of electricity supplied.

And on some peak days in 2014, solar and wind supplied close to 80% of peak power demand at specific times of the day. In the future, Germany is targeting a 35% average share by 2020 and a 50% average share by 2030. 
Biomass used for the production of biogas and biofuels are some of Germany's most important sources of renewable energy. In 2010, biomass accounted for 30% of renewable electricity generation and for 70% of all renewable energy (mostly wood). The German Government reported, in 2011, renewable energy (mainly wind turbines and biomass plants) generated more than 123 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, providing nearly 20% of the 603 TWh of electricity supplied.
