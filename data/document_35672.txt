Neptune. Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the fourth largest (by diameter). Neptune is smaller in diameter but larger in mass than Uranus. In Roman mythology Neptune (Greek:Poseidon) was the god of the Sea. Neptune has many moons and one big one named Triton. It also has Rings.
Neptune is the fourth largest planet in our Solar System and it is the smallest of the giant gas planets. Neptune has a diameter of 34,503 miles (55,528) kilometers. Its volume is 57.7 times the volume of Earth which means that 57 Earths could fit inside of Neptune with a little room left over.

1 Neptune has the second largest gravity of any planet in the solar system â€“ second only to Jupiter. 2  The orbit path of Neptune is approximately 30 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. 3  This means it is around 30 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
Radius, diameter, and circumference. Neptune is the fourth largest planet in terms of diameter, making it the smallest in physical size of the gas giants. The average distance from the center of the planet to its surface is 15,299 miles (24,622 kilometers). But like most spinning bodies, Neptune's rotation causes it to bulge slightly around the equator.
