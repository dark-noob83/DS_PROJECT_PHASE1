Hypodermis layer-Function of hypodermis. Hypodermis, also known as subcutaneous tissue, has important functions. Hypodermis layer lies immediately below the dermis. It is the lowermost layer of our integumentary system. Though hypodermis is not part of the skin, it is very essential for anchoring the skin to the body. 
In addition to adipocytes, adipose tissue contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and a variety of immune cells (i.e., adipose tissue macrophages [ATMs]). Adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes. Adipose tissue is one of the main types of connective tissue. In biology, adipose tissue /ˈaedɨˌpoʊs/ ˈædɨˌpoʊs or body fat or just fat is loose connective tissue composed mostly of.

Advertisement Upgrade to remove ads. The hypodermis is a subcutaneous (below the skin) fatty layer of adipose and areolar connective tissues lying under the dermis. The most common cells are fibroblasts, adipose cells, and macrophage
The types of cells found in the hypodermis are fibroblasts, adipose cells, and macrophages. The hypodermis is derived from the mesoderm, but unlike the dermis, it is not derived from the dermatome region of the mesoderm. In arthropods, the hypodermis is an epidermal layer of cells that secretes the chitinous cuticle. A layer of tissue lies immediately below the dermis of vertebrate skin. It is often referred to as subcutaneous tissue though this is a less precise and anatomically inaccurate term. The hypodermis consists primarily of loose connective tissue and lobules of fat.
The hypodermis is the innermost and thickest layer of the skin. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibres. It is essentially composed of a type of cells specialised in accumulating and storing fats, known as adipocytes.

The lower layer of your skin is the hypodermis. It contains fat  tissue that provides mechanical protection and insulation for your  body.   . Edit. Share to: Answered. In Health.
The subcutaneous tissue (from Latin subcutaneous, meaning beneath the skin), also called the hypodermis, hypoderm (from Greek, meaning beneath the skin), subcutis, or superficial fascia, is the lowermost layer of the integumentary system in vertebrates. A layer of tissue lies immediately below the dermis of vertebrate skin. It is often referred to as subcutaneous tissue though this is a less precise and anatomically inaccurate term. The hypodermis consists primarily of loose connective tissue and lobules of fat.
The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer) lies beneath the dermis. Loose connective tissue such as adipose tissue (fat) insulates the body, conserving heat. It also contains blood vessels, lymph vessels, and the bases of hair follicles and sweat glands. The fat distribution in this layer gives the female form its characteristic curves.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The hypodermis (subcutaneous layer, or superficial fascia) lies between the dermis and underlying tissues and organs. It consists of mostly adipose tissue and is the storage site of most body fat. composed of adipose and areolar  connective tissue.
