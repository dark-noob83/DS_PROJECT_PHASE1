Use the horizontal line test to determine if a function is a one-to-one function. If ANY horizontal line intersects your original function in ONLY ONE location, your function will be a one-to-one function and its inverse will also be a function.
In the book that is on the table is mine, the clause that is on the table is used to distinguish one particular book (the one on the table) from another or others (which may be anywhere, but not on the table). In the book, which is on the table, is mine, the which clause is merely descriptive or incidental.
(Remember that the vertical line test is used to show that a relation is a function.) Definition: The inverse of a function is the set of ordered pairs obtained by interchanging the first and second elements of each pair in the original function. Should the inverse of function f (x) also be a function, this inverse function is denoted by f -1(x).
Note: If the original function is a one-to-one function, the inverse will be a function. Definition: The inverse of a function is the set of ordered pairs obtained by interchanging the first and second elements of each pair in the original function. Should the inverse of function f (x) also be a function, this inverse function is denoted by f -1(x).
The inverse of a function may not always be a function! The original function must be a one-to-one function to guarantee that its inverse will also be a function. Definition: A function is a one-to-one function if and only if each second element corresponds to one and only one first element.
