Total: $1,440. New fridge (Energy Star). Initial cost: $674. 5 years of electricity to operate it: $450. Total: $1,124. When shopping for a new fridge, keep in mind that top and bottom freezer models use 10 to 25 percent less electricity than side-by-side models (energystar.gov).
According to Consumer Reports testing, annual operating costs for the most efficient 4.4-cubic-foot mini fridge can be as low as $27, while a much larger 20.6-cubic-foot refrigerator costs just $47 per year.
A 3.1-4.1 cubic foot, Energy Star Certified mini fridge uses an average of 250-300 kilowatt hours per year and costs about $28.00-$36.00 to run.
2) Run it for a month and see how much your bill increases. 3) Find out your electric rate. Typically it's 9 or 10 cents per kWh (Kilowatts per hour). That means if it's 1000 Watts and running all the time it would cost 10 cents times 24 = $2.40 per day.
To better understand the energy consumed, consider that running a compact refrigerator is about the cost of running a standard light bulb. For reference, a computer and monitor use 394 kWh per year or $43.34. Sample Models with Kilowatt Usage: 1  Frigidaire 3.3 cubic foot (model#: BFPH33M4LM) 267kWh/$29.
Cutting that in half with a new, modestly sized, energy efficient refrigerator could save you $80 a year at that electricity price â€“ and with new fridge prices in the $500 to $1,200 range, the savings would pay for the new refrigerator somewhere between 6 and 15 years after purchase.
At 15 kWh, trading in a pre-1986 fridge for a new efficient one would save about $158 a year in electricity costs. And some older fridges are even worse than the average. One reader estimates her savings to be $238 per year for trading in her 1979 fridge for a 2004 model.
On average, a standard model mini fridge uses roughly 230 kilowatt-hours per year, as much as many Energy Star rated full-sized refrigerators. The amount of energy a mini fridge consumes is due in large part to poor insulation and lack of cooling features.
