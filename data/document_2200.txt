GMAT Scores. The maximum scaled score for the test is 800: verbal and quantitative sections are each worth 800 points. The final score is an average of these two scores. The student can get the results at the test center immediately after the GMAT-CAT. This is not an official score as the results of the writing section come later. These are ball-park figures: it is easy enough to find the average GMAT scores for the intake in a given year to individual business schools. Note that as well as an overall score and a percentile, the test report includes the scores and percentiles for both the verbal and quantitative sections of the test.
The total score is a scaled combination of the verbal and quantitative scaled scores, and thus reflects a student’s overall performance on the multiple-choice sections of the test. 0. While total scaled scores range from 200 to 800, approximately half of all test takers score between 400 and 600. The verbal and quantitative scaled scores are also assigned percentile rankings.
Hi everyone! First, let’s just review some GMAT 101. When you take a GMAT, you get a whole collection of scores: (a) an AWA score (1-6); (b) an Integrated Reasoning score (1-8), (c) a raw Quant score, and (d) a raw Verbal score. These last two (and not the first two) contribute to the overall 200-800 GMAT score. All scores are reported to B-school, but at the moment, it seems the overall GMAT score is considerably more important in admissions than any of the other scores
The Quant and Verbal sections determine your GMAT Score out of 800. The median test score (i.e. 50th percentile) is around 550. The 90th percentile is a 700. The Quant Section Score ranges from 0-60. How to use the above chart*: For example, if you got a Quant Score of 48 (82%) and a Verbal Score of 37 (80%), then from the above chart you would have a score close to a 700. From the chart below, a 700 would be in the 90th percentile.
1 The Verbal Score has a long tail. 2  The highest quant score, 51, is only the 98th percentile. 3  On the other hand, the 99th percentile for verbal starts at a 46. 4  This means verbal raw scores of 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51 are all 99th percentile. How to use the above chart*: For example, if you got a Quant Score of 48 (82%) and a Verbal Score of 37 (80%), then from the above chart you would have a score close to a 700. From the chart below, a 700 would be in the 90
Your Total, Verbal, and Quantitative Scores Total GMAT scores range from 200 to 800; two-thirds of test takers score between 400 and 600. Verbal and Quantitative scores range from 0 to 60; scores below 9 and above 44 for the Verbal section and below 7 and above 50 for the Quantitative section are rare. 
Let's take a look at what happens at the highest levels of the exam: 700+. A recent test-taker received a scaled score of 45 in verbal (98th percentile) and 40 in quant (66th percentile) and an overall score of 700 (93rd percentile). Notice how much closer the overall percentile is to the excellent verbal percentile. 
The total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.). 
An official GMAT score report consists of five parts: 1  Verbal Scaled Score (on a scale from 0 to 60). 2  Quantitative Scaled Score (on a scale from 0 to 60). 3  Total Scaled Score (on a scale from 200 to 800). 4  Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) Score (on a scale from 0 to 6). 5  Integrated Reasoning Score (on a scale from 1 to 8). 0. While total scaled scores range from 200 to 800, approximately half of all test takers score between 400 and 600. The verbal and quantitative scaled scores are also assigned percentile rankings.
