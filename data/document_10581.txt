78 Followers. A. Platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. A normal platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter, abbreviated mcL). The average platelet count is 237,000 per mcL in men and 266,000 per mcL in women. Platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50,000 per mcL (assuming no other problems are present). Spontaneous bleeding doesn’t usually occur unless the platelet count falls to 10,000 or 20,000 per mcL.
Platelets are important elements in the blood that are important for blood coagulation (clotting and prevention of bleeding). The normal platelet count ranges between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter (one-millionth of a liter). Although the number of platelets is decreased, their function may remain intact in most cases of thrombocytopenia. All blood cells (white cells, red cells, and platelets) are made in the bone marrow. Thrombocytopenia means a lower platelet count in the blood compared to the normal range. Thrombocytosis refers to a greater number of platelets
In case of a healthy individual, the normal platelet level ranges between 150,000 and 450,000 per μl (micro liter) of blood. According to statistics, almost 95% of healthy people have platelet values within this range. Even though the normal platelet level of all healthy human beings are said to be within the range of 150,000 and 450,000 per μl (micro liter) of blood, slight variations are considered normal in some people.
High platelets is a condition in which the blood contains more platelets than normal. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that assist in blood clotting. In a healthy person, there are usually 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A high platelet count can be identified through routine blood tests. The occurrence of high platelets is divided into two medical categories: primary thrombocythemia and secondary thrombocytosis
The normal range (99% of population analyzed) for platelets in healthy Caucasians is 150,000 to 400,000 per cubic millimeter (a mm 3 equals a microliter). or 150–400 × 10 9 per liter. The normal range has been confirmed to be the same in the elderly and Spanish populations. On a stained blood smear, platelets appear as dark purple spots, about 20% the diameter of red blood cells. The smear is used to examine platelets for size, shape, qualitative number, and clumping. The ratio of platelets to red blood cells in a healthy adult is 1:10 to 1:20.
A platelet count above 1,00,000 platelets per microliter (mcL) is considered normal. So your count is normal even though the range is usually 1,50,000-4,00,000. You should not have any problems in carrying the pregnancy forward. blood. For me, male and little older, the normal range is 150-450. So at 470, or so, it's not big out of the range. I have read that that the absence of a spleen can be a possible reason for increased platelets in the blood since the spleen is a storge facility for platelets.
A platelet count below 150,000 per mcL is called thrombocytopenia, while a platelet count over 450,000 is called thrombocytosis. Platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50,000 per mcL (assuming no other problems are present). Spontaneous bleeding doesn’t usually occur unless the platelet count falls to 10,000 or 20,000 per mcL.
In many cases, the patients can also get abnormal platelet count due to certain medications. You need to take be wary to what kind of medications you are taking. The normal platelet count range is between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A drop below normal platelets range can lead to abnormal bleeding. An increase above this normal range for platelets can lead to abnormal blood clotting. Platelets are also known as thrombocytes. A low platelet count is a condition that is known as thrombocytopenia. It happens when platelets drop to a level lower than the normal range. On the other hand, when the amount goes above platelets normal range, it is referred to a condition called thrombocytosis.
A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Having more than 450,000 platelets is a condition called thrombocytosis; having less than 150,000 is known as thrombocytopenia. You get your platelet number from a routine blood test called a complete blood count (CBC). 
Normally, a person's platelet count is 150,000 to 400,000 per μl (microlitre). But the normal platelet count range in children is between 150,000-450,000 per μl. There is a slight decrease in the platelet count in pregnancy as there is an increase in the blood produced while the number of platelets remain the same.
