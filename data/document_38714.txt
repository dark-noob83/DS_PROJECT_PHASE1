My two 16 week old kittens (approx 5 lb cats) always have dry food available. I also feed them twice daily wet food-Science Diet Kitten - 1/4 can per meal (so each cat gets 1/2 can daily).
How much you feed your cat depends on his activity level and age as well as if you are giving wet or dry food. I feed my active adult male 3/4 of a cup of high protein dry food every morning-which he grazes on all day, and does not always finish-as well as half a can of a premium wet which I remove after 30 minutes.
Dry foods are filled with carbs that make your cat fat. You can't make a dry food without carbs, so there are no dry diet foods. The proper amount to feed per cat/per day should be about 5.5 ounces of wet (high quality grain free canned or Raw Meat/Bones/Organ) food. The calories in that amount of food are sufficient for most normal sized cats.
How Much to Feed Your Kitten. If you are feeding a dry cat food, you can put out a whole dayâ€™s supply in the morning or feed half in the morning and half at night. For a proper feeding schedule, follow the feeding instructions on the cat food package and always measure.
According to the Animal Medical Center in New York, a healthy, active 8-pound adult cat requires about 30 calories per pound per day. So, the average 8-pound cat requires about 240 calories per day. Typically, dry food contains about 300 calories per cup, and canned food contains about 250 calories in each 6 oz can. (or, 125 per 3-ounce can). Using these counts as a guide, an 8-pound cat would need 4/5 of a cup of dry food or just less than a full 6-oz can (or two 3-ounce cans) of wet food per day. You can adjust the proportions based on whether your cat prefers more or less dry or wet food.
