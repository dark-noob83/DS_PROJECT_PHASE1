The best-studied epigenetic modification is the methylation of DNA at cytosine bases. Cytosine methylation indicates gene silencing: methylated genes are not transcribed. Histone modifications also play an important role in epigenetic regulation. 
Examples of epigenetics. Epigenetic changes alter the physical structure of DNA. One example of an epigenetic change is DNA methylation â€” the addition of a methyl group, or a chemical cap, to part of the DNA molecule, which prevents certain genes from being expressed. Another example is histone modification. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around
Epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics is the study, in the field of genetics, of cellular and physiological phenotypic trait variations that are caused by external or environmental factors that switch genes on and off and affect how cells read genes instead of being caused by changes in the DNA sequence. One example of an epigenetic change in eukaryotic biology is the process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells.
DNA methylation is a chemical process that adds a methyl group to DNA. It is highly specific and always happens in a region in which a cytosine nucleotide is located next to a guanine nucleotide that is linked by a phosphate; this is called a CpG site (Egger et al. DNA methylation is used in some genes to differentiate which gene copy is inherited from the father and which gene copy is inherited from the mother, a phenomenon known as imprinting. Histones are proteins that are the primary components of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes.
5-methylcytosine-based DNA methylation occurs by the covalent addition of a methyl (CH 3) group at the 5-carbon of the cytosine ring resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). When a CpG island in the promoter region of a gene is methylated, expression of the gene is repressed (it is turned off). The addition of methyl groups is controlled at several different levels in cells and is carried out by a family of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).
Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are DNA methylation and histone modification, each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA. One example of an epigenetic change in eukaryotic biology is the process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells.
Equally important and coupled with DNA methylation is DNA demethylation, the removal of a methyl group. The demethylation process is necessary for epigenetic reprogramming of genes and is also directly involved in many important disease mechanisms such as tumor progression. When a CpG island in the promoter region of a gene is methylated, expression of the gene is repressed (it is turned off). The addition of methyl groups is controlled at several different levels in cells and is carried out by a family of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).
In the chemical sciences, methylation denotes the addition of a methyl group to a substrate or the substitution of an atom or group by a methyl group. Methylation is a form of alkylation with a methyl group, rather than a larger carbon chain, replacing a hydrogen atom. DNA methylation in vertebrates typically occurs at CpG sites (cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites, that is, where a cytosine is directly followed by a guanine in the DNA sequence).
There are many ways that gene expression is controlled in eukaryotes, but methylation of DNA (not to be confused with histone methylation) is a common epigenetic signaling tool that cells use to lock genes in the off position. , 2002), H3-K9 methylation (methylation of a specific lysine residue in the histone H3) is required in order for DNA methylation to take place.
In biological systems, methylation is catalyzed by enzymes; such methylation can be involved in modification of heavy metals, regulation of gene expression, regulation of protein function, and RNA processing. Methylation of heavy metals can also occur outside of biological systems. DNA methylation in vertebrates typically occurs at CpG sites (cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites, that is, where a cytosine is directly followed by a guanine in the DNA sequence).
