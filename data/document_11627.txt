Serenite Gemstone. We are incredibly proud and excited to be presenting to the world Serenite – the name we’re using for exceptionally high quality Oregon Sunstone mined in the USA. Sunstone is the state gemstone of Oregon and has been mined here for well over 100 years. Serenite is beautifully clear and appears to exude a magic glow from within – an inner shine that stands it above other gemstones in pure unrivalled beauty.
Peach Selenite. In addition to the properties of white selenite, peach selenite is a transformation stone. It helps to heal old emotional wounds and transforms this negative energy to healing, forgiveness and accceptance.
The gem is pleochroic and just like copper bearing Paraiba Tourmaline, the gem has a slight neon appearance. Serenite is so special because it contains copper inclusions (platelets) within the gem, which make it glow like a Paraiba Tourmaline, which also attributes its beauty to copper platelets.
