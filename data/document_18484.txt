Stress fractures are some of the most common sports injuries. They are tiny breaks in the bone, usually caused by repetitive stress from activities like running. Although they can be quite painful, they usually heal themselves if rested for a few months. Many different sports raise the risk of stress fractures. Stress fractures seem to be more common in women. Other risk factors for stress fractures include: drinking more than10 alcoholic drinks a week, smoking, running more than 25 miles a week, osteoporosis, eating disorders and low levels of vitamin D.
Fractures. A fracture is a break in a bone. There are many different types of fracture and contrary to popular belief, there is no difference between a 'break' and a 'fracture'.
Common fractures in sport. Fractures are common in sport, particularly in contact sports such as football and rugby. The most common injuries include fractured wrists, hands, collarbones and bones in the ankle and feet. 1 Impacted: this involves the fractured portion of bone being forced into another section of bone. 2  Spiral: this affects the area surrounding the bone. 3  Compression: this is a complete breakdown of the bone; it is most common in the spine.
1 Oblique: a tilted or diagonal fracture. 2  Hairline: this is a partial break and often affects only a small portion of the bone; these can be difficult to identify. 3  Impacted: this involves the fractured portion of bone being forced into another section of bone. 1 Impacted: this involves the fractured portion of bone being forced into another section of bone. 2  Spiral: this affects the area surrounding the bone. 3  Compression: this is a complete breakdown of the bone; it is most common in the spine.
A stress fracture is a crack in a bone caused by repeated stresses which are individually insufficient to fracture it. Stress fractures are not full thickness breaks (although without correct management they may progress to become full thickness breaks). History and examination are often enough to make the diagnosis. Stress fractures are seen in otherwise healthy individuals, and whilst osteoporosis is a risk factor, they are not generally considered fragility fractures. Stress fractures account for 0.7% to 20% of all sports medicine clinic injuries.
A fracture is usually a very severe injury and the athlete will know about it due to the pain, tenderness, bruising and swelling. In displaced fractures, there may be some deformity present. Dependent on the position of the fracture, there may be some restriction of movement. A fracture is a break in a bone. There are many different types of fracture and contrary to popular belief, there is no difference between a 'break' and a 'fracture'.
Skull fractures (also known as cranial fractures) can occur in any sport in which hard objects are flying at high speeds. Fractures to the skull can occur in the anterior skull (facial fractures), top, sides, or in the back of the skull (basilar fractures). Reducing the risk of skull fractures in sports will vary with the sport. In sports that require helmets, it is important that the athlete maintain a properly fitted helmet and that it is secured correctly.
Fractures are commonly categorised as open (compound) or closed (simple); an open fracture is a clean break where only the bone is affected, while a closed fracture also affects the tissue and skin around the bone. 1 Impacted: this involves the fractured portion of bone being forced into another section of bone. 2  Spiral: this affects the area surrounding the bone. 3  Compression: this is a complete breakdown of the bone; it is most common in the spine.
Fractures usually occur as a result of a traumatic injury such as a fall or a car accident. They can also occur over a period of time due to repetitive stresses, this is classed as a stress fracture and is treated slightly differently. The first classification of a fracture is whether it is open (compound) or closed. A fracture is a break in a bone. There are many different types of fracture and contrary to popular belief, there is no difference between a 'break' and a 'fracture'.
A rib stress fracture is not common, but they have been reported in many sports that have repetitive vigorous shoulder motions. These sports include baseball (especially pitching), dancing, tennis, golf, rowing, backpacking, wind surfing, and other sports. They have also been seen in people that do a lot of shoveling.
