Find your total gross earnings, before deductions, on your pay stub. Multiply this amount by the number of paychecks you receive each year to calculate your total annual salary. 1  Suppose you are paid biweekly, and your total gross salary is $1,900. 2  Calculate your annual salary with the equation $1,900 x 26 = $49,400. 1 Calculate your average regular weekly salary with the equation $19 x 40 = $760. 2  Calculate your average weekly overtime pay with the equation $28.5 x 6 = $171. 3  Add these two totals to get your total weekly salary $760 + $171 = $931.
The majority of bail bond companies do not pay their bounty hunters a salary; instead, they earn a percentage of the bond, which is usually between 10 and 20 percent. According to a recent job posting by a large bail bond company in Las Vegas, new bounty hunters are paid at a rate of three percent of fugitive bonds after completing 200 hours of unpaid training, although the posting also states that other pay incentives are available, as well.

As the aim is to get annual income of £10,000, the oneyear bond offered by NS&I has to be chosen, given the fact that interest on the threeyear bond is rolled up and not paid annually.

“If you have a 20-year bond of R500k at an interest rate of 12,5%, and you increase your bond repayment by just R300 a month, you could pay off your bond almost four years earlier and save more than R200k in interest,” says Adrian Goslett, CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa. “A lower interest rate will not only significantly reduce the interest payable over the term of the bond, but it will also allow you the opportunity to pay extra into your home loan account every month.
Although you are already paying 10% extra, also increase the payment in line with your salary increases. “In other words if your bond repayment is 10% of your take home pay, keep it consistently at that 10%,” he says. And finally, make sure that the debit order is paid on the same day as your salary. Brown says typically people pay their bonds on the first or the last day of the month
