A popular objection to eating liver is the belief that the liver is a storage organ for toxins in the body. While it is true that one of the liverâ€™s role is to neutralize toxins (such as drugs, chemical agents and poisons), it does not store these toxins. Speaking of vitamin A: I have learned that cod liver oil and liver itself are both high in vitamin A, so much so that it seems that you can easily overdose and end up with vitamin A toxicity (details on Wikipedia etc.) so caution is advised. Perhaps best not to take both for any extended period of time.

Best Answer: In a way, the liver which a filter for the blood but it doesn't hold the toxins for long.. besides cooking burns off toxins. Reality, liver is good for you only because it contains alot of Iron.. Which your body needs. Food rich in iron is a good thing, iron suppliments bad! I actually think that it is bad for you.
