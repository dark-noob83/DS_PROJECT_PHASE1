The ice giant Uranus is certainly different from other gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn, which are both mostly composed of helium and hydrogen. Uranus is composed, mostly of various ices such as methane and ammonia.
While Jupiter and Saturn are mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, the ice giant Uranus is much different. Instead, it is mostly composed of various ices, like water, ammonia and methane. The mass of Uranus is roughly 14.5 times the mass of the Earth.
Far, far from the sun, Uranus has a blue-green atmosphere that hints at its makeup. One of the two ice giants, the planets composition differs somewhat from Jupiter and Saturn in that it is made up of more ice than gas.
The other planets are not solid. Jupiter, for instance, is made up mostly of trapped helium, hydrogen, and water. In our solar system, the four gas giants are Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. Planets with their relative sizes to scale. The tiny bluish dot at the lower left is Earth. The tiny red dots to either side are Venus and Mars.
The rocky planets are mostly made up of rock and metal. These planets are very heavy and move slowly. They also do not have rings and very few moons. GAS PLANETS (Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune). The gas planets are mostly made up of gases (hydrogen and helium).
Uranus is the second least dense planet in the solar system, indicating that it is made up mostly of ices. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, which are composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium, Uranus contains only a small portion of these light elements.
