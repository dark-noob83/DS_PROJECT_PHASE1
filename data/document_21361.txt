Proponents of saliva testing cite its ease of collection, safety, non-invasiveness, affordability, accuracy, and capacity to circumvent venipuncture as the primary advantages when compared to blood testing and other types of diagnostic testing. As with other diagnostic testing methods, one drawback of saliva testing is the variability that exists among diagnostic devices and laboratory analysis techniques, especially for measuring hormones.
1 SOS Mouthwash has been providing the leading solution to pass a saliva drug test for almost 15 years. 2  We have helped literally tens of thousands of people pass their saliva drug tests. 3  This is the only sure way to pass a saliva drug test in the short-term. 4  Donâ€™t Do Drugs.

Saliva testing is not helpful, however, to monitor women who are taking hormones in a sublingual (drops or spray) or tansmucosal (lozenge or troche) format. These forms of hormone delivery concentrate the hormones in the salivary glands and the resulting saliva levels are too high to be useful. Saliva testing has been used in clinical research, including studies conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for more than 30 years. Saliva testing has been available to physicians for over a decade, and Medicare and many insurance companies provide reimbursement.
Testing the acidity of saliva occurred at least as early as 1808. The testing of salivation by the use of mercury was performed at least as early as 1685. More recent studies have focused on detection of steroid hormones and antibodies in the saliva. As with other diagnostic testing methods, one drawback of saliva testing is the variability that exists among diagnostic devices and laboratory analysis techniques, especially for measuring hormones.
Saliva test provide results similar to the results of a blood test and is favorite for detecting on-the-job drug use or in post-accident testing. Detection in saliva tests begins almost immediately after smoking and can be detected in the system for 12-24 hours after use. Compare this to other common drugs: Saliva (oral fluid-based) drug tests can are set up to detect use during the previous few days. Saliva tests, for the most part, are very difficult to adulterate. On-site oral based tests in enable the employer to randomly test employees, which is recognized to be the most effective type of drug screening.
Saliva testing is a diagnostic technique that involves laboratory analysis of saliva to identify markers of endocrine, immunologic, inflammatory, infectious, and other types of conditions. As with other diagnostic testing methods, one drawback of saliva testing is the variability that exists among diagnostic devices and laboratory analysis techniques, especially for measuring hormones.
Saliva testing is an easy and noninvasive way of assessing your patients hormone balancing needs, and is proving to be the most reliable medium for measuring hormone levels. Unlike serum tests, saliva testing represents only hormones actively delivered to receptors in the body. Only the unbound hormones pass through and into the saliva. Saliva testing measures the bioavailable hormone-the clinically relevant portion delivered to the receptors in the tissues of the body. Salivary hormone levels are expected to be much lower than serum levels, as only the unbound hormones are being measured.
HORMONE TESTING FOR WOMEN AND FOR MEN. This page provides products and information to help you measure your hormone levels. While laboratories measure hormones in several ways, research indicates that the most accurate way to do so is through saliva. To learn why we recommend saliva hormone testing, read the article by John R. Lee, M.D. about this matter.
It is these metabolites a Urine Drug Test or Saliva Drug Test looks for to determine if you will pass or fail your saliva drug test. The saliva drug test CAN NOT tell exactly when or how much of a drug has been consumed as can the Hair Drug Test. The information, strategies and techniques discussed will help you understand the ways to pass a saliva drug test. The general information on saliva drug testing will help you understand the process which in turn will put your mind at ease.
