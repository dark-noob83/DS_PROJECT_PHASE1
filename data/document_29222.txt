Microdermal hip piercings are done using a dermal punch and are positioned just above the pelvic bone. Hip piercings are contemporary and are considered bold and stylish. While you may get a surface hip piercing, it may be prone to rejection. Instead, a microdermal piercing would be safer and stable too. The microdermal piercing of the hip involves using a tiny metal piece having a flat surface and a perpendicular post (an L-shaped metal). One side of the metal piece goes inside the hip surface, while the other side of the metal sticks out. A jewelry can be screwed onto the stud and fixed.
Definition: Microdermals are the newest and most popular form of dermal piercing. Dermal implants used to be reserved for only the most extreme body modifier--spikes, horns, and other protruding metal objects could be worn almost anywhere on the body, including the head.
Dermal piercing, also known as microdermal piercing, is a form of body piercing where the dermis, i.e., the layer of skin underneath the epidermis, the outer layer of skin, is punctured or cut in order to place body jewelry. Dermal piercings can be made on almost all skin surfaces of the body.
