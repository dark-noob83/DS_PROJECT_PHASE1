Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse estimate that between 1984 and 1991, life expectancy after a heart attack rose by eight months (from 5 years and 2 months to 5 years and 10 months). In that same period, the cost of treating heart attack patients rose from about $11,000 to about $15,000. Total heart attack spending in the same period rose from $2.6 billion to $3.4 billion.
MONDAY, Sept. 23 (HealthDay News) -- Medicare costs for treating U.S. heart attack patients have swollen significantly, with much of the additional expenses accrued in the year after hospital discharge, according to a new 10-year analysis.
The average cost to traditional health insurers for the first 90 days following a heart attack is $38,501. Medicare spends over $14,000 per patient on hospital bills in the year after a heart attack, plus additional amounts for physicians and outpatient care.
1 According to theAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the average length of hospitalization and related costs for heart attack patients is 5.3 days at $21,500 per stay.
For example, the average bill for treatment for a heart attack without major complications at a hospital in Danville, Ark., was $3,334. Across the country in Modesto, Calif., the same diagnosis incurred an average bill of $92,057. Even within the same region, costs can run to opposite extremes.
