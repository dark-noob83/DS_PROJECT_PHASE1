Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by high blood pressure (hypertension) in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary artery) for no apparent reason. The pulmonary arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from the right side of the heart through the lungs.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare but severe disease with an estimated five-year survival rate of only 57% after diagnosis, according to the Registry to Evaluate Early And Long-term PAH disease management (REVEAL), which registers data from patients in the United States.
Glossary | Site map. search box. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease caused by narrowing or tightening (constriction) of the pulmonary arteries, which connect the right side of the heart to the lungs. Untreated, PAH is a disease with a very poor prognosis.
Scleroderma is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease (primarily of the skin) characterized by fibrosis (or hardening), vascular alterations, and auto-antibodies. One of the serious complications of this rare disease is PAH, which can occur in up to a third of scleroderma patients.
