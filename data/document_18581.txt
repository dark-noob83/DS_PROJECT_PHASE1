1 Fees can also be based on 5 to 15 percent of a project's construction expenses. 2  Designing a 25x25-foot room addition that costs $165,000-$200,000 to build could generate an architect's bill of $8,250-$30,000; using this pricing method, the fee for a $750,000 custom-built new home could be $37,500-$112,500. 1 Or an architect might agree to design a 25x25-foot room addition for $5,000-$10,000, or a 3,000-square-foot custom home for $50,000-$75,000 or more, no matter what the final construction price is.
Average CAD Service Costs. A typical drafting company will charge $100 to $120 per hour. Architects charge slightly more, averaging around $130 per hour. A typical A0 drawing of one type of a house will take about 8 hours to complete, which would cost between $800 and $1,040. Larger structures, such as a municipal building or an office complex, may take up to 24 hours to complete. CAD Architect Prices. A draftsperson, or architect, is typically hired when you need to design something with a personal touch. They are the people to see if you need a set of plans for an airplane, vehicle engine, or other complex mechanical system.
1 Architect's fees depend a great deal on the project and the location, and can vary in both amount and type: 2  Hourly charges may start at $50-$150 but can go up depending on the type of work (from creating drawings to inspecting a construction site), location, and the architect's training, experience and reputation. 1 Or an architect might agree to design a 25x25-foot room addition for $5,000-$10,000, or a 3,000-square-foot custom home for $50,000-$75,000 or more, no matter what the final construction price is.

An architect`s rate is negotiable, most of the times, and they usually charge by the hour. The average price charged by an architect to draw a house plan is from $80 to $200 per hour, more if the project is big sized. To this, you need to add the architect`s visits to the construction site, ion order to make proper drawings. 
Percentage of construction cost. Architectural fees usually run between 8 and 15 percent of the cost of construction. Thus, on a project that costs $100,000 to build, the architectural fees would fall in the range of $8,000 to $15,000. 
How much does it cost and how much time is involved to get architectural drawings made (plumbing, electrical, etc) for a 1500 square foot retail space that would be used for a restaurant. Thank you. Follow. 1 answer 1. 
To give you an idea of costs I will tell you what my firm charges. If the project is done on an hourly basis it is $125/hr for me the architect and $85/hr for my CAD technicians. We usually charge a lump sum fee for a project based on my budgeting how much time I believe the project will take based on the rates above.
1 A negotiated flat fee can be as low as $700-$1,000 for up to a specified number of hours spent creating a concept design. 2  Or an architect might agree to design a 25x25-foot room addition for $5,000-$10,000, or a 3,000-square-foot custom home for $50,000-$75,000 or more, no matter what the final construction price is. 1 Or an architect might agree to design a 25x25-foot room addition for $5,000-$10,000, or a 3,000-square-foot custom home for $50,000-$75,000 or more, no matter what the final construction price is.
