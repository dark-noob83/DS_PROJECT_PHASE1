There are also a number of proteins that are produced by the immune cells that are released and serve to signal other cells in the body that something bad is happening. These include cytokines and chemokines. 1 The Thyroid and the Immune System When a person catches a cold or the flu or develops an infection, his or her body has a system that allows the body to fight it off and allows it to return to full health.
3. A/An __________ is a disease-fighting protein created by the immune system in response to the presence of a specific antigen. antibody. 4. A/An __________ is any substance that the body regards as being foreign and includes viruses, bacteria, toxins, and transplanted tissues. The group of proteins that normally circulate in the blood in an inactive form and are activated by contact with nonspecific antigens such as foreign blood cells or bacteria are known as __________. complement. 19.
If this happens, your doctor may make adjustments to your treatment plan to help increase your neutrophils. Albumin A protein made by your liver. Albumin is the largest protein component of the serum (the watery part of your blood that contains disease-fighting antibodies). Measuring the amount of albumin in your blood may help your doctor determine the stage of your MM and can provide information about your overall health. A protein made by malignant (cancerous) myeloma cells that can help to show how much cancer is in your body. By measuring the amount of B2M (also called beta-microglobulin) in your blood, your doctor can help to determine how advanced your MM is.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A protein that is found in many tissues in your body, including your heart, liver, kidneys, muscles, brain, blood cells, and lungs. Your doctor may check the levels of LDH in your blood to help assess the stage of your disease. A protein made by malignant (cancerous) myeloma cells that can help to show how much cancer is in your body. By measuring the amount of B2M (also called beta-microglobulin) in your blood, your doctor can help to determine how advanced your MM is.
ELISA. 3. A/An __________ is a disease-fighting protein created by the immune system in response to the presence of a specific antigen. antibody. 4. A/An __________ is any substance that the body regards as being foreign and includes viruses, bacteria, toxins, and transplanted tissues. Swelling caused by an abnormal accumulation of lymph within the tissues is known as __________. lymphedema. 17. A/An __________ is a large white blood cell that can destroy substances such as cell debris, dust, pollen, and pathogens by the process of phagocytosis.
Hemoglobin. A protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs in the body and carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Leukocytes (White Blood Cells). A type of immune cell. Most white blood cells are made in the bone marrow and are found in the blood and lymph tissue. White blood cells help the body fight infections and other diseases. Granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes are white blood cells.
After a white blood cell consumes a virus, it communicates with the rest of the immune system to generate proteins known as antibodies. These antibodies lock themselves onto a â€¦ virus and disable it. Although a white blood cell does destroy the virus, there aren't enough white blood cells to combat viral infections. It is the antibodies that actually destroy the infection. The white blood cell just gets the process started. 1 The Thyroid and the Immune System When a person catches a cold or the flu or develops an infection, his or her body has a system that allows the body to fight it off and allows it to return to full health.
