Whole wheat grains serve as a good source of minerals, including magnesium and iron. You need both iron and magnesium for energy production so that your cells can access the fuel they need to function. Iron also helps provide your tissues with fresh oxygen, while magnesium nourishes your cell membranes.
Whole grains are loaded with vitamins and minerals, especially in the bran and germ, but these components are often removed when some grain products are processed, such as when wheat is processed into the white flour that is favored in Western cultures. The bran is also loaded with soluble and insoluble fiber.
About Vitamins and Minerals in Whole Grains. Whole grains serve as a good source of vitamins and minerals. Grain, often referred to as cereal grain, describes the fruit seed of oats, wheat, barley, rice, maize and rye. Grains serve as a good source of carbohydrates, the type of macronutrient the body uses for energy.
Refined grains are mainly composed of only the endosperm portion of the grain. The milling process removes most of the bran and some germ, along with the majority of fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals. As much as 75% of phytochemicals (phytonutrients) are lost in the refining process.
1 -Outer layer of the grain that contains fiber, antioxidants, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and 50-80% of minerals in grains like iron, copper, zinc, magnesium. - 2  middle largest layer containing mostly carbohydrates, protein, and small amounts of some B vitamins and minerals.
The front of a package may say, “multi-grain”, “7-grain”, “100% wheat”, “bran”, or “cracked wheat”, but may not contain any or only small amount of whole grains. These products may have “unbleached enriched wheat flour” as the first (main) ingredient, which is the same as refined flour.
