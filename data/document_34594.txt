Vitamin D helps immune and muscle function, and is associated with muscle strength and performance. Vitamin D also increases the efficiency of the body's absorption of calcium up to 30 to 40 percent, and phosphorus-which is needed for bone strength-by up to 80 percent. This is one reason that milk is often advertised as being “enriched with vitamin D.”.
The current recommendation is a roughly 2:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium, usually 1000mg of calcium and 400-500mg of magnesium in the U.S. Bones and teeth contain 99 percent of the body’s calcium, while roughly 55-60 percent of magnesium is in bone with 20-25% in soft tissues. It is my stance that a 1:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium is optimal when vitamin D status, K2 consumption and trace minerals are adequate. Vitamin D levels should be above 40-50 ng/ml based on a blood test.
Vitamin D is actually a hormone, not a vitamin. Your body can make its own vitamin D with enough sun exposure. Vitamin D is important for bone health; athletes in weight-sensitive sports — such as gymnastics, running or cycling — should take care to get enough. A physician may suggest vitamin D and/or calcium supplements for some athletes. 1  DRI: 600IU (1-70 years old), 800IU (71 years and over). 2  Good sources: Fortified milk and cereals, cod-liver oil, seafood and eggs.
Some experts suggest that men and women over fifty take 800 IU of vitamin D year-round. Check with your VA doctor to see how much vitamin D you need. The usual recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is 400 IU. We recommend that you take at least 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D each day. Most multivitamins contain only 400 IU. There are two forms: D2 (ergocalciferol), which is created during plant photosynthesis, and D3 (cholecalciferol), which is made when human skin is exposed to the UVB rays from sunlight.
The safe upper limit for vitamin D is 1,000 to 1,500 international units (IU) per day for infants. For children aged one to eight years, the safe upper limit is 2,500 to 3,000 IU/day, and 4,000 IU/day for children nine years and older, adults and pregnant and lactating teens and women. We recommend that you take at least 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D each day. Most multivitamins contain only 400 IU. There are two forms: D2 (ergocalciferol), which is created during plant photosynthesis, and D3 (cholecalciferol), which is made when human skin is exposed to the UVB rays from sunlight.
Whether you supplement or not, consume foods rich in vitamin D from fortified milk, cheese, fatty fish, fortified cereal, and eggs. With my kids, I do not take chances and supplement using a high quality children’s/ teenager multi-vitamin containing 1000 IU of vitamin D. Calcium is critical for athletic functions. Vitamin D also increases the efficiency of the body's absorption of calcium up to 30 to 40 percent, and phosphorus-which is needed for bone strength-by up to 80 percent. This is one reason that milk is often advertised as being “enriched with vitamin D.”.
Infants from birth to 12 months need less: 400 IU (10 mcg). After the age of 70, adults need 800 IU (20 mcg). People can get vitamin D from foods that are naturally rich in the vitamin, fortified foods, supplements and exposure to the sun. We recommend that you take at least 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D each day. Most multivitamins contain only 400 IU. There are two forms: D2 (ergocalciferol), which is created during plant photosynthesis, and D3 (cholecalciferol), which is made when human skin is exposed to the UVB rays from sunlight.
Whether you’re an athlete or not, have your vitamin D levels checked the next time you visit your doctor. Your doctor can then provide you with some appropriate next steps. Current guidelines suggest that you should consume 600 IU of dietary vitamin D if you are between the ages 1-70 and 800 IU if you are over 70 (8). But since no one actually checked the dancers’ serum vitamin D concentrations (4), it’s unclear whether the supplements were responsible for the improvement. Meanwhile, in another study (5) recreational athletes took high doses of vitamin D (20,000 and 40,000 IU) for twelve weeks. Researchers found no improvement in their performance measures (leg press and vertical jump
