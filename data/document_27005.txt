Here are some examples for recharging times: With a single onboard charger plugged into a standard 110-volt outlet, Tesla says you will get 5 miles of range for every hour of charging. From zero to 300 miles would take about 52 hours at that rate. With a single charger connected to a 240-volt outlet, which Tesla recommends, the pace speeds up to 31 miles of range for each hour of charging, and a full 300-mile charge takes less than 9.5 hours. Tesla says the 60-kwh battery provides a range of up to 232 miles (the EPA pegs it at 208 miles), and the 85-kwh battery (a $10,000 option) provides up to 300 miles (the EPA puts it at 265 miles).
I predict that the week Tesla opens up the Model 3 reservation queue, there will be 40,000 cars reserved that week with a $2500 refundable deposit (similar to current reservation system). We'll likely have 4 of those in my extended family alone. Tesla is installing superchargers at a rate of about one new station a day around the world to keep up with sales that have reached 60,000 vehicles since it launched three years ago. The company’s pipeline includes a sport-utility vehicle launching this fall, and ambitions to sharply increase annual sales through 2020.
This will make the Tesla Model S go for at least 800 miles. With 800 miles I would not even think of where to recharge it or how long it will take since I can not drive more that 5 hours after which I need to rest if not have a good sleep. While sleeping and only sleeping the car can be charged. As we all know, the Model S claims 300 miles on a charge, but Max Range charging is a big part of that, because it allows the battery 15 percent more capacity, extending the range. But that shouldn’t be something owners do routinely.
- The Nissan LEAF uses lithium-ion batteries, just like your laptop and your cell phone, but it uses a lot more of them. It can charge overnight (8 hours) at a 220/240-volt Nissan charging dock that's installed in your garage. It can also charge at a 110/120-volt outlet, the kind you plug your laptop and cell phone into, but it'll take far, far longer.
Electric vehicles take too long to recharge. To charge a Tesla Model S just halfway takes five hours at a typical home or public charging station. But in its effort to make electric vehicles more practical, Tesla Motors is quickly reducing the charging times. Last September, it unveiled a network of “supercharging” stations —designed exclusively for its Model S and future electric vehicles—that could charge a battery halfway in 30 minutes. Even though these fast-charging breakthroughs would be useful only on Tesla’s cars, they still could be important for expanding the EV market. Tesla plans to introduce cars in the $30,000 to $35,000 range in the next few years.
Mar 25, 2015 at 9:37AM. If you're following electric-car maker Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), you've probably heard of its Superchargers. This rapidly expanding network of charging locations is enabling long-distance travel in the Model S in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, China, and Japan. 
In the end, our Tesla battery reached a full charge (normal range mode) in 59 minutes, during which time 193 miles of range were added. That's an overall average charge rate of 196 miles per hour, and we pulled out of the parking lot with 231 miles on the range meter. Here's what my data looks like graphed out. 
The Model S offers a choice of lithium-ion battery packs, a standard 60 kilowatt-hour battery or a more expensive, more powerful 85-kwh unit. How long it takes to recharge a depleted battery depends on whether the Model S has one or two onboard chargers and the source of the electricity. Tesla says the 60-kwh battery provides a range of up to 232 miles (the EPA pegs it at 208 miles), and the 85-kwh battery (a $10,000 option) provides up to 300 miles (the EPA puts it at 265 miles).
