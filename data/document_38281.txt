219. Is it a barclays cheque you are putting into a barclays account-if so Yes(if the funds are in their account) if not it can take up to 5 working days and be returned at any time of upto 8 days. 28-02-09, 12:31 #3.
Depending on where the cheque is paid in and at what time of day, this timing may be rejigged. For example, Barclays says if you pay in cash or cheques at the Post Office to your Barclays account, it takes two working days longer to process than if you did it at a Barclays branch.
How it works. WHEN you pay a cheque into your account, it will take three days to switch between the cheque writer's bank and yours-unless you and the cheque writer bank at the same branch. It works like this: Day One: The cheque is sent to your bank's clearing centre.
When you pay a cheque into a building society savings account it can take up to 12 days to clear. The fastest. THE normal way to get your hands on your money the same day is through the clearing house automated payment system (Chaps). You'll have to pay Â£25 for the privilege of drawing on your cheque the same day.
At Barclays, the process is known as the central cheque clearing cycle and normally takes three working days. It also need an extra days for an unpaid cheque.
It depends on a lot of things, but typically if the check is a local check, then it should clear the first time within 6 days, 9 if it is out of state; however, since banks will try to clear checks twice before they return them as NSF, it can take up to 3 weeks.
