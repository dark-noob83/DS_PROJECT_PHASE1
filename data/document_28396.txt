Album Notes. My name is Tony Yardley. I've been at this guitar thing for about 40 years (to tell you the truth, I've lost count). I'm just another one of those countless old hippy guitar players who saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show and was hooked for life.
Tony Yardley is a national treasure living in Jacksonville, Alabama. Way back in the early 70s, I was fortunate to play in an acoustic group along with Tony called Woodfork. He was fabulous then and he just keeps getting better!
