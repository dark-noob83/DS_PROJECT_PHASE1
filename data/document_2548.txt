I love my dog. That’s why I have a Gunner Kennel. I have been using my Gunner Kennel everyday since the day it was delivered, I can not find anything bad to say about it. I have yet to see the kennel move even a half of an inch in my truckbed. This is the last dog kennel you will need to buy.
Really enhanced my room---and I feel good that my dog is going to have a lovely crate to chill out in. It's a lot of money---but if you are going to have the crate for a decade or so---it really is worth owning something nice.
We ship to all lower U.S. 48 States. K9 Kennels are designed not only to keep your dog confined within the area you need, but also to keep other animals from entering the dog kennel to cause injury to your pet. Safety and security of your pet should always be considered when purchasing a dog enclosure.
Tater sleeps all night in his crate with the door closed. When I get up in the morning I let him out to eat and go to the bathroom and to play for a little while. When I leave to go to work he goes back into his crate (his own doing). I do not lock the crate door and leave it wide open so he can see it. He stays in there all day until I get home at 5. My boyfriend has been home (laid-off) and can attest that Tater stays in there the entire day. I feel bad for Tater, he has the opporunity to come out and walk around but he doesn't.
