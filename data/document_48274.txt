Diarrhoea or constipation. After bowel surgery you may have loose stools or diarrhoea for some time. Diarrhoea is more likely if you have had a large part of your bowel removed. You may also have diarrhoea alternating with constipation. Your doctor or nurse can advise you on how to manage changes in your bowel habits.
Usually, patients begin to take some liquids the first day after surgery and advance to a regular diet over a course of two to three days. 24 to 48 hours. After surgery you will feel tired from anesthesia and depending upon the type of operation your body may not be ready for food or drink by mouth.
If your staples/stitches are still in place, the nursing staff on the ward will refer you to your District Nurse or Practice Nurse who will remove these 7-12 days following surgery. In some patients the would is closed with stitches under the skin which dissolve away on their own.
Introduction. Surgery on the bowel is a major physiological insult to your body and as such is no wonder you will not feel 'yourself' immediately after it. It typically takes between 2 and 6-weeks to fully recover after a bowel operation. The exact time depends on the type of surgery performed, your individual characteristics, other medical problems you may have, your 'outlook' on recovery and whether or not you have any complications after surgery.
The recovery period is usually shorter for this operation. A patient stays in the hospital for 3 to 7 days with the average of 4 days. You will begin to have bowel movements 2 to 5 days after this operation. Initially the movements are liquid and may occur 10 or more times a day. As you eat solid food, the bowel movements become more firm and the frequency decreases.
Following major bowel surgery, you should expect to be in hospital for seven to ten days. The actual time will depend on how you have progressed. Before you leave hospital, you must be eating and drinking, and your bowels must be working.
