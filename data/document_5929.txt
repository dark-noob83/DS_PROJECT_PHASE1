Noun. 1. enthalpy - (thermodynamics) a thermodynamic quantity equal to the internal energy of a system plus the product of its volume and pressure; enthalpy is the amount of energy in a system capable of doing mechanical work. heat content, total heat, H.
Definition of ENTHALPY. : the sum of the internal energy of a body or system and the product of its volume multiplied by the pressure. ADVERTISEMENT. en- + Greek thalpein to heat.
The hydrogen ion is also defined to have H + = 0. The (molar) enthalpy of formation is the heat released () or absorbed () in a chemical reaction at constant pressure when simple substances combine into a more complex substance.
By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Definition: Enthalpy is a thermodynamic property of a system. It is the sum of the internal energy added to the product of the pressure and volume of the system. It reflects the capacity to do non-mechanical work and the capacity to release heat.
