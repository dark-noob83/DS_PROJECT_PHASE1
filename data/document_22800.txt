Save. The average asphalt road, parking lot or driveway is designed to last for anywhere between 10 and 30 years. However, with the regular application of a seal coating, an asphalt surface can last for decades beyond this. Without sealant, an asphalt surface is likely to crack or deform.
Average Cost for Asphalt Paving. The average cost of an asphalt paving project is $6,393. The final cost of a project will depend on the square footage that needs to be paved, whether or not permits are required, and whether any obstructions like trees need to be removed before the project can begin.
The average cost to line stripe a parking lot depends on the quantity of pavement markings and whether the parking lot is being re-striped or a brand new layout after the parking lot has been paved or sealcoated.
If your parking lot was very small and only required 10 parking spaces to be restriped @ $4.00 per line, 2 arrows @ $20.00 and 1 handicap space @ $35.00, the minimum cost would be $350.00 - $500.00, not $115.00. The reason for the minimum mobilization is to cover fuel, labor, paint, equipment costs and overhead.
How much does it cost to sealcoat an asphalt parking lot? The average sealcoating cost for an asphalt parking lot with either asphalt or coal tar emulsion pavement sealer ranges from $0.14 - $0.25 per square foot.
