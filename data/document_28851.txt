I think there is a big variation in how many chromosomes a butterfly can have, like it says in the Nature article. So I think you and your teacher are both wrong! Butterflies don't have ~380 chromosomes, and they don't all have 20-40 chromosomes either!
The karyotype is the set of chromosomes, both autosomes and sex chromosomes, in an organism. The karyotype found in 90% of the large family of short-horned grasshoppers, Acrididae, is usually given as 2n d- = 23 [22 + X (or XO)], the female karyotype, 23 (22 + XX), being usually inferred from the male.
The genome is made up of every single piece of DNA a butterfly has.Therefore, once we know the sequence of all the DNA we will know how much there is and since chromosomes are made of DNA we will eventually know how many chromosomes the butterflies have. Butterflies are insects in the Phylum Arthropoda.
They have a different number of chromosomes only because one of the human chromosomes is essentially the same as two chimpanzee chromosomes. Chimps and humans started out with exactly the same chromosomes. Then, about 5 million years ago, the two started to drift apart in evolution.
The number of chromosomes that a butterfly has varies widely. The  wood white butterfly can have anywhere from 56 to 106 chromosomes.  Some butterflies have as many as 380.
