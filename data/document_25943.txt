the difference between a chromosome and a dna molecule is that a chromosome is a single dna molecule associated with proteins and a dna molecule is a long thin molecule that s tores genetic information
before we start to learn what is the difference between gene mutation and chorosomal mutation it is often easier to know first a few facts about genes and chromosomes and their specific functions most cells in the human body contains a nucleus and in the nucleus are very tiny threadlike units calle
gene mutation vs chromosome mutation mutations are the changes that occur in the genetic material of organisms and those take place due to various reasons gene mutations and chromosome mutations are the two basic types of mutations and those vary from each other mainly in the magnitude of the alteration
chromatins are just a combination of dna histones a type of proteins and rna strands of dna are considered as chromatins and when these strands combine this forms the chromosome chromatin is untangled and unfolded dna while chromosome is condensed dna
the difference between dna and a chromosome has to deal with an intermediary genes dna is deoxyribonucleic acid which is a nucleic acid it is made up of four bases adenin e cytosine guanine and thymine when these four bases are arranged in a segment it is called a gene
genes are made up of dna each chromosome contains many genes a gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity genes which are made up of dna act as instructions to make molecules called proteins in humans genes vary in size from a few hundred dna bases to more than 2 million bases
a chromosome is therefore nothing but a chain of dna that has been made compact enough to fit into a cell summary 1 both chromosomes and dna make up an important part of a person s genes 2 a chromosome is a subpart of a person s genes while dna is a part of the
