That is for tangent track laid with new industrial grade crossties, new spikes, bolts, and anchors, used plates, used relay quality 100 lb rail, and includes ballast, lining, and tamping. $125 per FOOT price is for track installed on pre-graded sub grade-any grading and earthwork is extra. If you figure 3000 ties per mile AND using relay quality (USED) 115 lb rail, you are looking at $330,000 MINIMUM for just the ties and rails. You'll easily eat up another $70,000 in OTM (plates, spikes, angle bars, anchors, bolts).
