How the body reacts to certain foods is what determines what foods are alkaline-forming and what foods are acid-forming. For example lemons are acidic in nature, but have an alkalizing effect on the body once they are digested. Similarly, milk is alkaline outside the body, but acidic upon digestion.
Pineapple, along with many of the tropical fruits, contain a high level of fruit sugar or fructose. Sugars are acid-forming in the body. The reason you’ll note on non-researched websites (there are hundreds!), that pineapple and most other fruits are alkaline, is due to their citric acid content. Remember the lemon, very high in citric acid…yet alkaline
According to the FDA, pineapple juice falls at 3.5 on the pH scale, right in the middle between most acid and neutral, or moderately acidic. In contrast, the fresh fruit itself ranges from 3.5 to 5.2 pH, making pineapple potentially less acidic than its juice.
The pH Factor. Food can be tested for its acid-alkaline balance and measured using a pH scale. On this scale, which ranges from 0 to 14, 0 is the most acid, and 14 the most alkaline; a pH of 7 is neutral.
According to the Journal of Environmental and Public Health, the measure of whether a food is acid or alkaline doesn't rely on its pH balance, but on its PRAL score, or how it responds in the body. Therefore, pineapple juice can be considered either acidic or alkaline.
Generally, alkaline foods (alkaline forming foods) include: most fruits, green vegetables, peas, beans, lentils, spices, herbs and seasonings, and seeds and nuts. Generally, acid forming foods include: meat, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs, grains, and legumes.
To maintain healthy diet, it should consist of 60% alkaline foods i.e. alkaline forming foods and 40% acid forming foods. To restore health, the diet should consist of 80% alkaline forming foods and 2
