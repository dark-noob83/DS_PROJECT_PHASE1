In vitiligo, the immune system may destroy the melanocytes in the skin. It is also possible that one or more genes may make a person more likely to get the disorder. Some researchers think that the melanocytes destroy themselves. Others think that a single event such as sunburn or emotional distress can cause vitiligo. 
Vitiligo is generally considered to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with vitiligo the immune system appears to attack the pigment cells (melanocytes) in the skin. Generalized vitiligo (also called nonsegmental vitiligo), which is the most common form, involves loss of pigment (depigmentation) in patches of skin all over the body.

Vitiligo is a skin disorder that causes the skin to lose its color. Smooth lighter or white areas (called macules or patches) appear on a personâ€™s skin. If vitiligo occurs in a hair-baring area, the hair in those areas may turn white as well. Vitiligo can be segmental, which is restricted to one side of the body or one area, such as the hands or face. Vitiligo can also be generalized, which is the most common type, when macules appear in various places on the body.

As a result, white patches appear on the skin in different parts of the body. Similar patches also appear on both the mucous membranes (tissues that line the inside of the mouth and nose) and the retina (inner layer of the eyeball).
