The connection between cholera and fecal bacteria in drinking water was discovered in London by John Snow in 1854 when he discovered that a particularly intense outbreak had a certain water-pump at its center. In 1853-4, London's epidemic claimed 10,738 lives. * 1854 - Outbreak of cholera in Chicago took the lives of 5.5 per cent of the population [2] * 1863-1875 - Fourth pandemic spread mostly in Europe and Africa. * 1866 - Outbreak in North America.
Cholera was originally endemic to the Indian subcontinent, with the Ganges River likely serving as a contamination reservoir. The disease spread by trade routes (land and sea) to Russia, then to Western Europe, and from Europe to North America during the Irish immigration period. Cholera is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, which affects the intestinal system of the body.    Ok so firstly a Cholera bacterium en … ters the body, most of the vibrio cholerae are killed off by acidic conditions in the stomach.
The world continued to suffer the effects of cholera with a fifth pandemic in many parts of continental Europe, the whole of the North African coast and various areas in Asia and the Americas form 1881-96. Asia suffered immensely from a large outbreak from 1899-1923 and currently many developing nations in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia suffer in the seventh pandemic of cholera. This current pandemic began in South Asia in 1961, touched Africa in 1971 and then the Americas in 1991.
Cholera outbreaks in recorded history have indeed been explosive and the global proliferation of the disease is seen by most scholars to have occurred in six separate pandemics, with the seventh pandemic still rampant in many developing countries around the world. Asia suffered immensely from a large outbreak from 1899-1923 and currently many developing nations in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia suffer in the seventh pandemic of cholera. This current pandemic began in South Asia in 1961, touched Africa in 1971 and then the Americas in 1991.
Every year 3-5 million people around the world are infected with cholera and 100,000- 120,000 people die from the infectious disease, according to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asia suffered immensely from a large outbreak from 1899-1923 and currently many developing nations in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia suffer in the seventh pandemic of cholera. This current pandemic began in South Asia in 1961, touched Africa in 1971 and then the Americas in 1991.
Cholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe. The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria. The diarrhea is frequently described as rice water in nature and may have a fishy odor.
Cholera in the United States. Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is very rare in the U.S. Cholera was common domestically in the 1800s but water-related spread has been eliminated by modern water and sewage treatment systems.

One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist John Snow (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water. Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria. The diarrhea is frequently described as rice water in nature and may have a fishy odor.
Since 1961, there have been seven major cholera pandemics (The global spread of cholera during the seventh pandemic, 1961-1971 [ source ]), affectingmillions of people living in South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. How did Vibrio acquire its enterobacteriaciae-like toxin? Since not all varieties of the cholera bacteria have the toxin, it was hypothesized that the gene encoding it might be the result of a latent phage infecting only a few of them (01 and 0139).
The first pandemic occurred in 1817 hitting India, China, Japan, parts of Southeast Asia, much of the Middle East, and Madagascar and the East African Coast opposite Zanzibar; however, it died down in 1823 in Anatolia and the Caucuses before it reached Europe. Asia suffered immensely from a large outbreak from 1899-1923 and currently many developing nations in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia suffer in the seventh pandemic of cholera. This current pandemic began in South Asia in 1961, touched Africa in 1971 and then the Americas in 1991.
