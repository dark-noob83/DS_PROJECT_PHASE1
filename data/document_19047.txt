Semiconductors are materials that have properties in between normal conductors (materials that allow electric current to pass, e.g. aluminium) and insulators (which block electric current, e.g. sulphur).
Conduction [edit]. electron mobility: When an electric field is applied to a semiconductor, the electrons experience a force and are accelerated in the opposite direction of the electric field. This acceleration is inhibited by what we term 'collisions' [1].
Part of the Electronics glossary: A semiconductor is a substance, usually a solid chemical element or compound, that can conduct electricity under some conditions but not others, making it a good medium for the control of electrical current.
The conduction band is the band above the valence band. Electrons in the conduction band are free to move about in the lattice, and can therefore conduct current. The energy gap between the valence and conduction band is called the band gap. Every material has associated with it a Fermi energy.
In a semiconductor material, the flow of holes occurs in a direction opposite to the flow of electrons. Elemental semiconductors include antimony, arsenic, boron, carbon, germanium, selenium, silicon, sulfur, and tellurium. Silicon is the best-known of these, forming the basis of most integrated circuits (IC s).

You may have heard expressions like Silicon Valley and the silicon economy, and that's why -- silicon is the heart of any electronic device. A diode is the simplest possible semiconductor device, and is therefore an excellent beginning point if you want to understand how semiconductors work.
