If you are paid annually you get paid once per year, if you are paid semi-annually that means twice per year. Monthly you would be paid 12 times a year. Semi-monthly you would receive 24 checks per year. You would be paid 26 times a year if you are paid bi-weekly (which is every 2 weeks).
A semi-monthly paying structure occurs when employees receive paychecks twice each month, often on the 15th and 30th days of each month. Calculate hourly wages from a semi-monthly pay period to break down earnings for your employees.
Answer by Alec Stevenson. Confidence votes 119. There are normally 26 pay periods per year when you get paid biweekly. Since you get paid every 14 days it is possible to have 27 (26 x 14 = 364) and a year has 365 or 366 days). This occurs every 11 or 12 years. Years are never shorter, so you will not have a 25 pay period year.
1 Semi-monthly (or Bi-monthly): Semi-monthly paychecks are issued twice a month, often on the 1st and the 15th of the month. 2  Thus there are 24 semi-monthly pay periods in a year.
If you are paid on a monthly basis, you are paid once a month. Your pay date is usually at the end of the month, and you are paid 12 times per year. This pay structure is usually the least preferred among hourly employees.
In a biweekly pay cycle, employees are paid and taxes are withheld 26 times a year, typically on every other Friday. The biweekly cycle should not be confused with a semimonthly pay cycle, in which employees are paid twice each month and a total of 24 times each year.
2. It will always be two, because there are 12 months. If you get paid twice a month, that's 24 pay checks, which is 2 shy of 26 pay checks-what we would expect if we were paid every two weeks. That means those 2 extra pay checks need to fall somewhere, and they will be on the months where your pay day is hit 5 times.
