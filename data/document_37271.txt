Let us examine the slope of the phase portrait. The slope of the phase trajectory passing through a point (x1, x 2) is determined by (,)(,)1 1 22 1 212f x xf x xdxdx = (2.5) where f1, f 2 are assumed to be single valued functions. This implies that the phase trajectories will not intersect.
The solution of (2.1) with time varies from zero to infinity can be represented as a curve in the phase plane. Such a curve is called a phase plane trajectory. A family of phase plane trajectories is called a phase portrait of a system. Example 2.1 Phase portrait of a mass-spring system_______ k =1 m =1 0(a) (b) xx&Fig. 2.1 A mass-spring system and its phase portrait The governing equation of the mass-spring system in Fig.
Although the phase plane method is developed primarily for second-order systems, it can also be applied to the analysis of first-order systems of the form x&+f (x) =0 The difference now is that the phase portrait is composed of a single trajectory.
(3.22). which can be plotted as a vector field in the phase plane. Here = d u /d t is given by (3.2) and = d w /d t by (3.3). The flow field is also called the phase portrait of the system. An important tool in the construction of the phase portrait are the nullclines which are introduced now.
An equilibrium solution is a constant solution of the system, and is usually called a critical point. For a linear system x ′ = Ax, an equilibrium solution occurs at each solution of the system (of homogeneous algebraic equations) Ax = 0.
This gives us a point in the x1-x2 or phase plane that we can plot. Doing this for many values of t will then give us a sketch of what the solution will be doing in the phase plane. A sketch of a particular solution in the phase plane is called the trajectory of the solution. Once we have the trajectory of a solution sketched we can then ask whether or not the solution will approach the equilibrium solution as t increases.
To do so, we draw a grid on the phase plane. Then, at each grid point x = (α, β), we can calculate the solution trajectory’s instantaneous direction of motion at that point by using the given system of equations to compute the tangent / velocity vector, x ′. Namely plug in x = (α, β) to compute x ′ = Ax.
