Definition. A total loss car is generally recognized as a car that would cost more to repair than it is worth. If a car is currently worth $4000, and the cost of repairing the damage is $6000, the car is considered totaled.
The criteria for deciding when a car is a total loss and when it can be repaired vary from insurance company to insurance company and might even be dictated and controlled by state statute or regulation.
And in some states, a vehicle may be a total loss if the repair costs would exceed a percentage (e.g., 80 percent) of the vehicle’s value. We consider many things—in addition to comparing the cost to fix your vehicle with how much it’s worth—when determining whether it is a total loss.
Typically, cars are considered to be “totaled” when the cost to repair the vehicle is higher than the actual cash value (ACV) of the vehicle. Practically speaking, however, it is not always practical to repair a vehicle, even if the cost of repair is less than its ACV. A vehicle worth $4,000 requiring $3,000 in repairs might be considered “totaled” by an insurer even though the cost of repair is less than its value before the accident.
When and whether a vehicle involved in a collision is considered to be “totaled” for first-party insurance purposes is an issue of great angst and confusion for most consumers.
A totaled car is a car which is considered to be a total loss after an accident. This usually means that it is damaged to the extent that it is not worth repairing. For example, if the car is worth $10,000 and needs $7000 worth of work, it's not worth it and will generally be labeled as a total loss.
