Cellular Respiration. Cellular respiration is the process through which our cells get the energy to perform their functions. Since all living things are made of cells, and all cells need energy to perform life's functions, cellular respiration is necessary for all living things.
Leadership. Aerobic cellular respiration is the process in which our cells break down food and turn it into energy that cells need to perform their life functions. This lesson goes through the process, formula, and end results of aerobic cellular respiration.
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells get their energy in the form of ATP. There are two types of cellular respiration, aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic respiration is more efficient and can be utilized in the presence of oxygen, while anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen.
Cellular respiration is the process that cells use to break down food to use as an energy. Aerobic cellular respiration uses oxygen and yields many more ATP molecules than anaerobic cellular respiration, which does not use oxygen and yields only two ATP molecules. There are three stages in the process of transforming glucose to ATP: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.
The equation that describes aerobic cellular respiration is Glucose  plus Oxygen which equals Carbon Dioxide plus water plus energy.  Respiration is the gas exchange and cel … lular respiration produces  ATP. Alexander Rowan.
The equation that describes aerobic cellular respiration is Glucose plus Oxygen which equals Carbon Dioxide plus water plus energy.
Glucose (sugar) + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (as ATP). Cellular respiration is what cells do to break up sugars into a form that the cell can use as energy. This happens in all forms of life. Cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create ATP, a chemical which the cell uses for energy.
