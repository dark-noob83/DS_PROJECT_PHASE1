Characteristics of Nematoda. * The body is bilateral symmetrical and triploblastic (or triblastic). * The body is provided with a tongue cuticle, which is highly resistant to digestive enzymes of the host, in case of parasites.
By Phil Myers. Roundworms (nematodes) are bilaterally symmetrical, worm-like organisms that are surrounded by a strong, flexible noncellular layer called a cuticle. Their body plan is simple. The cuticle is secreted by and covers a layer of epidermal cells.
Nematodes are the most speciose phylum after the arthropods, they occur in nearly every habitat including as parasites in all sorts of plants and animals, (they don't like dry places however).
Nematoda (nematodes, eelworms, threadworms, roundworms; phylum Aschelminthes) Class of aschelminth worms (a phylum in some classifications) which vary greatly in size, from about 1 mm to 5 cm. The cuticle has flanges, and may also have ridges or spines.
Roundworms (nematodes) are bilaterally symmetrical, worm-like organisms that are surrounded by a strong, flexible noncellular layer called a cuticle. Their body plan is simple. The cuticle is secreted by and covers a layer of epidermal cells.
1)Bilaterally symmetrical, and vermiform. 2)Body has more than two cell layers, tissues and organs. 3)Body cavity is a pseudocoel, body fluid under high pressure. 4)Body possesses a through gut with a subterminal anus.
The characteristics of phylum nematoda are usually pseudocoelomates, they may be monoecious or even dioecious.
Nematode. Nematodes, also called roundworms, are members of the animal phylum Nematoda. These worms have a complete digestive system and are more complex than the flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) but lack a circulatory system and other advanced features found in the annelids (segmented worms).
