Cost of Resurfacing. Resurfacing usually costs anywhere from $1 to $2 per square foot. The price varies based on factors such as your geographic location, local competition, the season and the condition of your driveway. So the cost to resurface a 3,000 square foot driveway would be anywhere from $3,000 to $6,000. Repaving is more expensive than resurfacing because the job requires significantly more time, materials and labor. The cost is usually at least one-third more than resurfacing, and sometimes double the cost. Budget anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000.
