ROAD DISPATCH (VISA). If you have a roadside emergency, call 1-800-VISA-TOW 24/7 to dispatch the help you need – anything from a tow or jumpstart to a tire change, lockout service, winching or gas delivery – at a cost of $59.95 per service call. (Additional fees may apply.)*.

¹ Roadside Assistance Hotline is a 24-hour dispatch hotline that can send a tow operator or locksmith to assist in an emergency situation. While Roadside Assistance Hotline is available at no additional charge, the Card Member will be charged for any services or goods provided.
