Hourly Fees. Hiring a private investigator is much like hiring a professional service provider like a lawyer, accountant or a marketing consultant. Hourly rates are the most common fee arrangement. A professional service provider gets paid an agreed-upon hourly rate for the hours worked and within an agreed upon budget. Our background investigations start at $1000. Most background checks merely scratch the surface of a personâ€™s character profile history. We dig deep to find historical issues, identify and review court cases, scour news archives, public records and archives.
