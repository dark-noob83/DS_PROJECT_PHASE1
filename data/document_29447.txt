The unemployment rate serves as a good example of when you should not average multiple rates since the rate is a calculation itself (unemployed divided by labor force). Table 1 shows the counties comprising the Lafayette metro area. Average those three rates together and you get 7.0 percent. 
The average of the averages is: $$\frac{1}{3}a_1 + \frac{1}{3}a_2 + \frac{1}{3}a_3$$. These two values will be exactly the same if each school has exactly the same number of students, and will tend to be close if the schools are relatively close in size and/or the scores for the two schools are close. For example: the average of $ \{ 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\} $ is 2 and the average of $\{4\}$ is 4. The average of the averages is 3.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In colloquial language, an average is the sum of a list of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the list. In mathematics and statistics, this would be called the arithmetic mean. However, the word average may also refer to the median, mode, or other central or typical value. In statistics, these are all known as measures of central tendency. If n numbers are given, each number denoted by ai (where i = 1,2, …, n), the arithmetic mean is the sum of the a s divided by n or. The arithmetic mean, often simply called the mean, of two numbers, such as 2 and 8, is obtained by finding a value A such that 2 + 8 = A + A. One may find that A = (2 + 8)/2 = 5.
Statistically speaking, an average of averages within a sample is said to very closely approximate the population average. However, where the sample size is under 30, there needs to be an adjustment for size. Let's say you're trying to calculate your overall average grade for all the tests you've taken in school, and let's say you are taking only math, English, and science. Let's say your average in math is 80, English is 85, and science is 90. The average of those averages is, of course, 85.
Now…let’s say order volume in NY is 10 orders, and volume in PA is 2 orders. Taking the average of the two averages would give us $75 as the overall average cost. (($100+$50 = $150)/2) = $75 However, if we take volume into account, as we should, the average is $91.67. 10 NY orders at $100 = $1,000 + 2 PA orders at $50 = $100, for a total cost of $1,100, divided by all 12 orders = $91.67. These numbers rarely match because taking an average of averages is wrong. The reason an average of averages is wrong is that it doesn’t take into account how many units went into each average. For example: Let’s say we only have orders in 2 states, New York and Pennsylvania. The average cost of the product in NY is $100, and the average cost in PA is $50
Average of percentages is not calculated this way suppose we have score 10/10 = 100% and we have another one 50/100=50% Their average 75% id WRONG the correct average is 54.5% it reflects weight-age second score. 
When one of the numbers is 0, you must count it to the numbers of data. For example, 1, 0, 3, and 8. To find the average, or the mean, add the four numbers together an … d divide their sum by 4. (1 + 0 + 3 + 8)/4= 12/4 = 3 The average is 3. Four students pick apples: one has 3, one has 4, one has 5, and one has 8. To evenly divide the apples, you would find the average (sum/number of values). 3 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 20, divided by 4 students is 20/4 = 5 apples. 1  Add up all the items in the group. 2  Divide the sum by the number of
