Viral reproduction, on the other hand, can be blocked by antiviral agents. Viruses cause such respiratory infections as the common cold (rhinovirus), the flu (influenza), some pneumonias and bronchiolitis (respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV). It can be difficult to determine whether you have a viral or bacterial infection because the symptoms are often similar. 
Bacterial and viral infections can cause similar symptoms such as coughing and sneezing, fever, inflammation, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and cramping -- all of which are ways the immune system tries to rid the body of infectious organisms. The Differences Between Bacteria and Viruses. Although bacteria and viruses are both too small to be seen without a microscope, they're as different as giraffes and goldfish. Bacteria are relatively complex, single-celled creatures with a rigid wall and a thin, rubbery membrane surrounding the fluid inside the cell.
The flu and the common cold are both respiratory illnesses but they are caused by different viruses.

In this article. Bacterial and viral infections have many things in common. Both types of infections are caused by microbes -- bacteria and viruses, respectively -- and spread by things such as: 1  Coughing and sneezing. 2  Contact with infected people, especially through kissing and sex. 3  Contact with contaminated surfaces, food, and water. The Differences Between Bacteria and Viruses. Although bacteria and viruses are both too small to be seen without a microscope, they're as different as giraffes and goldfish.

Article Body. It is often difficult to tell if an illness is just a viral cold or if it is complicated by a bacterial infection of the sinuses.
