Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the potatoes in half or quarters and place in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic; toss until the potatoes are well coated. Transfer the potatoes to a sheet pan and spread out into 1 layer. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until browned and crisp. Flip twice with a spatula during cooking in order to ensure even browning. Remove the potatoes from the oven, toss with parsley, season to taste, and serve hot.

How long do you cook potatoes?   Boiling potatoes takes approximately 20mins to roast them it takes approximately 45 mins-1 hour at 180o in hot fat in the oven (make sure the potatoes are coated in the â€¦ hot fat this will make them go chrispy).   To boil, about 15-20 minutes. To bake, similar, maybe a bit longer.
(Always use a baking sheet with sides for roasting vegetables.). Place the baking sheet in the oven. Roast the potatoes for about 20 minutes. Then turn them over using a spatula or a pair of tongs. Roast for an additional 20-30 minutes, depending how browned and crispy you like them. Sometimes I leave them in the oven even longer.
