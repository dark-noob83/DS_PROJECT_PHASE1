Teams get seven minutes to make picks in the second round and five minutes in rounds 3-6. Starting in 2015, teams will only have four minutes for their seventh round and compensatory draft picks.
In the 2014 NFL draft, teams will have 10 minutes to make their first-round draft picks. In the second round, NFL teams get seven minutes to make a selection. For rounds three through seven, teams can take up to five minutes per pick. The draft starts at 5 p.m. Arizona time on Thursday, May 8. Only the first round will be held that day.
NFL Draft Basics: Time Limits by Round. Each round of the NFL Draft has a limit of time each team may use to make their selection. If a team fails to make their selection in the allotted time, the team that is scheduled to select next may move ahead of the tardy team by turning in their draft pick first.
Draft Rules and Process. The NFL Draft takes place over three days (Thursday through Saturday) each spring; this year the draft will be April 30 to May 2 in Chicago. Only the first round is held on Thursday. It starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and each team has 10 minutes to make its pick.
