If a person has taken opioids and is then given Narcan™ (naloxone), the opioids will be knocked out of the opiate receptors in the brain. Narcan™ (naloxone) can help even if opioids are taken with alcohol or other drugs. In Illinois, Narcan™ (naloxone) is prescribed for use as an IM injection. Nasal spray use is less common, but some large cities in the U.S. use the nasal spray version and it can be prescribed.
Narcan™ (naloxone) is an opiate antidote. Opioids include heroin and prescription pain pills like morphine, codeine, oxycodone, methadone and Vicodin.

According to drug maker Alkermes, about 10,000 patients per year currently use Vivitrol to treat alcohol dependence, a treatment strategy approved in April 2006. The drug has not had widespread uptake for that indication for a number of reasons, the company said. Addiction is a serious problem in this country, and can have devastating effects on individuals who are drug-dependent, and on their family members and society, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given the go-ahead to a once-monthly injection to treat opioid dependence, the agency said Tuesday. Addiction is a serious problem in this country, and can have devastating effects on individuals who are drug-dependent, and on their family members and society, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.
Called Vivitrol and made by Boston-based biotech Alkermes, it has been on the market for alcoholism since 2006 and for opiate addiction since 2010. It is not, however, a new drug. It is a new injectable formulation of an old drug called naltrexone, a once-a-day pill prescribed since the mid-‘90s for addiction. In a better world, alcoholics and addicts could control their addictions medically via a one-a-day pill or, better yet, a monthly shot.
Vivitrol, a long-acting formulation of naltrexone (ReVia), is already approved as a monthly shot to treat alcohol dependence. The new indication puts Vivitrol on a list of pharmacologic treatments for addiction -- a list that already includes methadone and buprenorphine.

The Food and Drug Administration just approved the use of a once-a-month drug that shows promise for weaning some people addicted to heroin and other opiates. The medicine Vivitrol blocks the effect of opiates on brain cells. The FDA approved Vivitrol for treating alcohol dependence four years ago. It costs $1,100 a shot that lasts a month. But some claim it saves money in the long run by cutting treatment of alcoholism and its collateral damage. With all the enthusiasm about the new approval, for opiate abuse, experts say that Vivitrol won't be an addiction panacea
