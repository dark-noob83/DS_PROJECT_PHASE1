There are numerous features for the celestial bodies in our Solar System which define the way we look at their structure and formation. According to astronomers and space scientists, it is likely that any other planetary system capable of supporting life will have a relatively similar structure.ypes of Celestial Bodies. According to the accepted modern theory, the objects in the Solar System are segmented into three distinct classifications: planets, dwarf planets and other small bodies. Each of these are defined by the International Astronomical Union.
The term celestial bodies refers to all of the objects in space that are identified by name or location: comets, asteroids, moons, rings, planets, stars, nebulas, galaxies, … and any other material structure seen or detected in space.
The celestial bodies in our Solar System are divided into different sections: the inner planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars separated by the asteroid belt from the outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Each celestial body is made of a different type of material: rock, gas or ice. slide 1 of 4. Types of Celestial Bodies.

Composition of Celestial Bodies. Celestial bodies in our Solar System are composed of three classes of material: ice, gas and rock. The inner part of the Solar System is principally rock material, usually remaining solid no matter the environmental conditions caused by the Sun.ypes of Celestial Bodies.

The term celestial body is as expansive as the entire universe, both known and unknown. By definition a celestial body is any natural body outside of the Earth’s atmosphere. Easy examples are the Moon, Sun, and the other planets of our solar system. The celestial body Achernar is a bright, blue, B3-type star of six to eight solar masses lying approximately 144 light years away. It is classified as a dwarf, but it is 3,000 times more luminous than our Sun. It is in the deep southern sky and never rises above 33°N.
Image credit: NASA. Ceres is a celestial body that is by far the largest and most massive asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. It is approximately the size of Texas or 975km x 909 km with a mass of 9.5×10 20. It actually represents 1/3 of all of the mass of the asteroid belt.he celestial body Achernar is a bright, blue, B3-type star of six to eight solar masses lying approximately 144 light years away.
The term astronomical object is sometimes used interchangeably with astronomical body. Typically, an astronomical (celestial) body refers to a single, cohesive structure that is bound together by gravity (and sometimes by electromagnetism). Examples include the asteroids, moons, planets and the stars. These objects range from single planets to star clusters, nebulae or entire galaxies. A comet may be described as a body, in reference to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust, or as an object, when describing the nucleus with its diffuse coma and tail.

(Doctrines of Salvation, 2:33) In the resurrection there will be different kinds of bodies; they will not all be alike. The body a man receives will determine his place hereafter. There will be celestial bodies, terrestrial bodies, and telestial bodies, and these bodies will differ as distinctly as do bodies here.… Some will gain celestial bodies with all the powers of exaltation and eternal increase.
