This information was summarized from the GVP/USGS Weekly Volcanic Activity Report. Pinatubo is a stratovolcano on the island of Luzon. Its eruptive history is divided into two distinct parts. The first part of this history involves an ancestral volcano to Pinatubo. This period includes all eruptions to about 35 thousand years ago. Ancestral Pinatubo was a stratovolcano made of andesite and dacite. 
The 1991 eruption of Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines created a new caldera with an average diameter of 2.5 km. Caldera collapse, which lowered the height of the volcano about 300 m, occurred following the ejection of nearly 10 cu km of tephra in one of the world's largest eruptions of the 20th century. Lahars have occurred during every rainy season since the eruption of 15 June 1991. Pinatubo's last reported lahars were triggered by the heavy rainfalls of July 1995, when 30 x 10 6 m 3 of debris, deposited over a 12 km 2 area, forced mass evacuation of Porac and Bacalor (BGVN 20:07).

It injected more particulate into the stratosphere than any eruption since Krakatoa in 1883. Over the following months, the aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. Global temperatures dropped by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) in the years 1991-93, and ozone depletion temporarily increased substantially. Near Mount Pinatubo, the United States maintained two large military bases in the region. The U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay was 37 km (23 mi) south of Pinatubo, and the extent of Clark Air Base was just 14 km (8.7 mi) east of the volcano's summit.
Mount Pinatubo is situated in the southern part of Luzon. It is one of the biggest volcanoes in the Philippines. In 1991, the Pinatubo became in a few months one of the most known volcanoes in the world. In that year the Pinatubo erupted violently. 
Mount Pinatubo (Filipino: Bundok Pinatubo) is an active stratovolcano in the Cabusilan Mountains on the island of Luzon, near the tripoint of the Philippine provinces of Zambales, Tarlac, and Pampanga. Before the volcanic activities of 1991, its eruptive history was unknown to most people. Near Mount Pinatubo, the United States maintained two large military bases in the region. The U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay was 37 km (23 mi) south of Pinatubo, and the extent of Clark Air Base was just 14 km (8.7 mi) east of the volcano's summit.
The effects of the eruption were felt worldwide. It ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes (1.1 × 10 10 short tons) or 10 km 3 (2.4 cu mi) of magma, and 20,000,000 tonnes (22,000,000 short tons) SO 2, bringing vast quantities of minerals and metals to the surface environment.

Mount Pinatubo is a volcano on the island of Luzon in the  Philippines. It is best known for its enormous eruption on June 15,  1991. This eruption was the second largest of … the twentieth  century. 1 person found this useful. 
Today, ancestral Pinatubo is exposed in relict walls of an old 3.5x4.5-km caldera, recognized by Delfin (1983, 1984) and named here the Tayawan caldera (fig. 3). Prominent points on the relict rim of that caldera include Mount Donald Macdonald (southeast caldera rim) and Mount Tayawan (north-northeast caldera rim). Radiocarbon ages suggest that eruptions from the modern Pinatubo have been clustered in at least six and possibly as many as a dozen eruptive periods. Each eruptive period is short in relation to intervening repose periods (table 1, fig. 5). Each of these six eruptive periods of modern Mount Pinatubo is described below.
