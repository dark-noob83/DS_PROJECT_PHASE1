Ocean water, with an average salinity of 35 psu, freezes at -1.94 degrees Celsius (28.5 degrees Fahrenheit). That means at high latitudes sea ice can form. The average temperature of the ocean surface waters is about 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 90 % of the total volume of ocean is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean. The deep ocean is not well mixed. The deep ocean is made up of horizontal layers of equal density.
The average temperature of the ocean's surface is from 30 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit in customary units.
August 31, 2001. The average temperature of the ocean surface water is about 17 °C (62.6 F).. 17 °C. So even though surface waters can be a comfortable 20 degrees Celsius (good for swimming in!), the majority of our ocean water has a temperature between 0-3 degrees Celsius (32-37.5 degrees Fahrenheit).. 0-3 °C.
Average ocean temperatures along the New Jersey coast are listed below for each month in degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius. The Atlantic ocean off New Jersey gets quite chilly during winter. The water temperature averages just 35 °F (2 °C) in February at Atlantic City. But come spring, the sea warms up rapidly. By summer, the ocean at New Jersey beaches is hot enough for an enjoyable swim. The temperature usually reaches 74 °F (23 °C) at Cape May in late July and early August.
Much of this deep ocean water is between 0-3 degrees Celsius (32-37.5 degrees Fahrenheit)! It's really, really cold down there! There is a neat program that is measuring the temperature and salinity of ocean surface waters around the world.
