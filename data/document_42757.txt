Answers. Relevance. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Australia's immigration policy is that apart from humanitarian entrants and family (e.g. partner, child, parent) visas, immigration is restricted to skilled workers with qualifications and experience in occupations listed as being in need of workers.
Australia has a shortage of skilled workers and it is only because of skilled immigration that employers are able to fill vacancies and meet rising demand for their goods and services.
SYDNEY, Australia — The lower house of Australia’s Parliament passed sweeping changes in immigration policy on Wednesday that are meant to deter asylum seekers who try to reach the country by the thousands each year on rickety, overcrowded ships and boats.
This is now called the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA). DIMIA still has considerable independence in the development of policy under the Migration Act (Cth) (1958). It currently has immigration programs that allow people to live permanently in Australia on various grounds. These include the Migration Program and Humanitarian Program.
Look it up on the Australian Department of Immigration website. There is a long list of preferred immigrants, mainly tradespeople and some professionals. Unemployment is an issue here at the moment, so expect not to have a job for the first 6 months. Also in Sydney anyway, housing is expensive.
