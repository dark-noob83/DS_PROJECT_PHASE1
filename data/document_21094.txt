The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides interesting information about the average expenses of American households. The following table shows the annual expenses and percentages for the average household. The information is taken from the 2009 Consumer Expenditure Survey.
At a cost of $7,677, transportation is the 2 nd largest category for the average family budget. While spending on gas each month tends to be painful, it is not actually the largest cost of owning a vehicle. According to the BLS, the average family spends $2,715 on gasoline. That’s about one third of the overall budget.
Smaller expenses make up the remainder of the average household budget. Americans spend nearly the same, about 3.8 percent, on cash contributions and apparel. Entertainment takes up 5.4 percent. Education costs average 1.9 percent. Many people's favorite category, miscellaneous, totals 1.6 percent of gross income.
Overall Income and Expenses. According to a 2009 United States Department of Labor survey of consumer expenditures, the average American household has 2.5 residents and a household gross income of $62,857. Annual spending totals $49,067.
The family also budgets 20% of their income each month for food — that’s another $700. As you can see, the money goes quickly with a family of four! The chart here shows the family spends 30% on housing costs, which includes their monthly home payment, called a mortgage, and home insurance. That totals $1,050 a month.
Beating the average family budget can actually be a challenge. The average family spends only $1,379.75 on housing per month. That includes mortgage/rent, utilities, cleaning and maintenance. The average grocery bill is only $302.
Although you could call this an “average family budget” because it is comprised of the average expenses of Americans, it isn’t necessarily a typical budget for a family. That is because the information is actually based on spending habits of people in vastly different situations.
