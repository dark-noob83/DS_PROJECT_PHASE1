1 Put these classifications in the correct order: Order, Species, Kingdom, Class, Genus, Phylum, Family. 2  Come up with a way to remember the order of these classifications, for example: “King Phillip Came Over For Great Sandwiches”. Biological classification represents how organisms are related with species being the most specific part. Biologists arrange organisms into a hierarchy of groups and subgroups based on similarities and differences, which have to do with how closely related they are.
Organisms are grouped together into taxa (singular: taxon) and given a taxonomic rank; groups of a given rank can be aggregated to form a super group of higher rank and thus create a taxonomic hierarchy. The Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus is regarded as the father of taxonomy, as he developed a system known as Linnaean classification for categorization of organisms and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms.
The Six Kingdoms. When Linnaeus developed his system of classification, there were only two kingdoms, Plants and Animals. But the use of the microscope led to the discovery of new organisms and the identification of differences in cells. A two-kingdom system was no longer useful. Today the system of classification includes six kingdoms. 
* TAXONOMY--the branch of science that classifies and names living things. * NOMENCLATURE--a system for naming things. In biology there is a two-word system that is used to name organisms. It is called BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE (a two named--naming system). Organisms are groups among these five kingdoms by: * the presence or absence of a nuclear membrane * unicellular (one cell) or multicellular (many cells) * the type of nutrition used by the organism (heterotrophic or autotrophic). We will also go into the main phyla (next subgroup) for each kingdom.
Classification of living things is called Taxonomy.. This is when scientists put organisms into groups when they have things in common. The first groups they use are the Kingdoms. There are five kingdoms: As you explore the website, you can see an organism's classification at the bottom of each Species Page. This way you can compare organisms to see which ones are in the same groups, and you can try to figure out why scientists put them together.
Moneran Kingdom. Each Kingdom is then split into smaller groups, called Phyla. Each Phylum is split into smaller groups called Classes, each Class is split into Orders, each Order is split into Families, each Family is split into Genera, and each Genus is split into Species. A Species is a single organism, not a group. As you explore the website, you can see an organism's classification at the bottom of each Species Page. This way you can compare organisms to see which ones are in the same groups, and you can try to figure out why scientists put them together.
Genus. Species. As each group is split into smaller groups, the organisms are more and more alike. For instance, a White-tailed Deer, an Eastern Gray Squirrel, and an Eastern Chipmunk are all in the Mammal Class together. As you explore the website, you can see an organism's classification at the bottom of each Species Page. This way you can compare organisms to see which ones are in the same groups, and you can try to figure out why scientists put them together.
1 Systematics : The study of the identification, taxonomy and nomenclature of organisms, including the classification of living things with regard to their natural relationships and the study of variation and the evolution of taxa. The Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus is regarded as the father of taxonomy, as he developed a system known as Linnaean classification for categorization of organisms and binomial nomenclature for naming organisms.
Explain why each of the following characteristics of a classification system is important: a) It assigns a single, universally accepted name to each organism. b) It places organisms into groups that are biologically related. c) It divides organisms into small groups.
