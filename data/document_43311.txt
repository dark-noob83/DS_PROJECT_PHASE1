There are 1,00 … 0 liters per cubic meter, so the density of seawater can also be expressed as 1.027 kg/liter (for surface seawater). Thus 1 liter of seawater will weigh 1.027 kg.
I found a table that gives the density in pounds per cubic foot (lb. per cf-)for various materials. Look in the table under Earth for various kinds of topsoil. I then used Google to convert 22 liters to cubic feet. I typed 22 litres in cubic feet into Google and got the response 22 litres = 0.776922668

How much does a liter of Mercury weigh?   Mercury has a density of 13.55 grams per cu cm, so 1 liter (1,000 cu cm) weighs 13,550 grams or 13.55 kg.
How much does a yard of product weigh? Weights for products will vary due to moisture content. Typically, mulch products weigh between 400-800 lbs. per cubic yard; Compost weighs between 1000 – 1600 lbs and soil blends weigh between 2200-2700 lbs. A full size ¾ or 1 ton pickup can hold 2-3 cubic yards, slightly rounded, but weight must be considered.
