The usefulness of negative feedback inhibition is that it results in hormonal homeostasis , that is the maintenance of hormone levels within a particular appropriate physiological range. Consider a case where one adrenal gland is damaged.
In male mammals, a double negative feedback loop has evolved allowing separate regulation of testosterone biosynthesis and sperm production. A dual system allows an organism to better conserve energy while still remaining optimally functional.
In addition to the testosterone negative feedback loops, there is also an inhibin negative feedback loop to control spermatogenesis.
Negative Feedback. One distinctive feature of hormones whose secretion is regulated through the hypothalamus and pituitary is that they regulate their own secretion through negative feedback inhibition.
The hypothalamo-pituitary-testicular axis of the male rhesus monkey and ram. In both species, the negative feedback regulation of LH secretion is controlled by testosterone, which is produced by the Leydig cells and acts at the level of the central nervous system to inhibit GnRH neurons.
The level of testosterone is under negative-feedback control: a rising level of testosterone suppresses the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. This is exactly parallel to the control of estrogen secretion in females.
As testosterone levels rise, they have a direct negative feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. In the arcuate and preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, testosterone will decrease the release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).
Testosterone is a steroid sex hormone that is produced by the testes and the adrenal gland and is responsible for the development of the male reproductive tissues. Testosterone also promotes muscle, bone and hair growth. High levels of testosterone are usually a good indicator of overall health in men.
