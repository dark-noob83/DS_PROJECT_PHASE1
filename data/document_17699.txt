The dry wood is a store of chemical energy. As it burns in the fireplace, chemical energy is released and converted to thermal energy (heat) and light energy. Notice that the wood now turns into ashes (a new substance). Food is also a good example of stored chemical energy. This energy is released during digestion. Molecules in our food are broken down into smaller pieces. As the bonds between these atoms loosen or break, a chemical reaction will occur, and new compounds are created.
Chemical energy. Chemical Energy is energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds (atoms and molecules). It is released in a chemical reaction, often producing heat as a by product (exothermic reaction) . Batteries, biomass, petroleum, natural gas, and coal are examples of stored chemical energy. Usually, once chemical energy is released from a substance, that substance is transformed into an entirely new substance.
Chemical Energy to Thermal Energy. Chemical energy is a potential form of energy that is stored in the chemical bonds that hold atoms together. If bonds are broken, the energy is released, and if bonds are formed, energy is absorbed. Thermal energy is often referred to as heat energy.
Chemical energy is the energy stored within chemicals, which makes it energy inside atoms and molecules. Most often, it's considered energy of chemical bonds, but the term also includes energy stored in the electron arrangement of atoms and ions.
Basically, any compound contains chemical energy that can be released when its chemical bonds are broken. Any substance that can be used as a fuel contains chemical energy. Examples of matter containing chemical energy include: 1  coal-combustion reaction converts chemical energy into light and heat.
