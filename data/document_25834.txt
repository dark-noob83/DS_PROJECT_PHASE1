But how much do the riders earn? As stated by a representative of the Jockey’s Guild, the average salary for a professional horse jockey is $24,000.

Jerry Bailey, for example, set a record in yearly winnings with $23,354,960, earning him $1.63 million.
Most disc jockeys earn between $5,000 and $40,000 per year. Lots of things can factor into that dollar amount.

The vast majority of jockeys are middle class or below.

The top 10 jockeys all earned more than $750,000 in 2012.
