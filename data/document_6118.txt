Operating Costs. It costs 6-7 times more to operate a Gas Heater versus a heat pump. For example, to heat an average size residential pool, in South Florida to 88 degrees and keep it heated to that degree consistently throughout one year will cost approx $700. To heat the same pool with a gas heater will cost the homeowner approximately $4000 to $5000. $800. *Based on an electric resistance heated pool, which costs $1,000 per year at an electric cost of $.085/kwh, and using a natural gas cost 0f $.80/therm. A seasonal average COP of 5.0 was used to determine heat pump savings.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, heating a pool with 1,000 square feet of surface area with an electric resistance or gas heater costs around $500 per month, compared with the much lower expenditure of roughly $100 for a heat pump. Heat pumps can cost up to $5,000, while the majority of gas and electric resistance heaters are available for around $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. The cost for installing heat pumps and gas heaters averages about $300 to $500, including labor and materials.
Heat Pump Swimming Pool Heaters. How a heat pump works. How They Work. Heat pumps use electricity to capture heat and move it from one place to another. They don't generate heat. As the pool pump circulates the swimming pool's water, the water drawn from the pool passes through a filter and the heat pump heater. *Based on an electric resistance heated pool, which costs $1,000 per year at an electric cost of $.085/kwh, and using a natural gas cost 0f $.80/therm. A seasonal average COP of 5.0 was used to determine heat pump savings.
Selecting a Heat Pump Pool Heater. Heat pump pool heaters cost more than gas pool heaters, but they typically have much lower annual operating costs because of their higher efficiencies. With proper maintenance, heat pump pool heaters typically last longer than gas pool heaters. *Based on an electric resistance heated pool, which costs $1,000 per year at an electric cost of $.085/kwh, and using a natural gas cost 0f $.80/therm. A seasonal average COP of 5.0 was used to determine heat pump savings.
Anotherway of looking at this is if an electric pool heater costs $300.00 per month to heat aparticular swimming pool, a heat pump with a C.O.P. of 4 would only cost $75.00 permonth to heat the same swimming pool. It is typical for pool heat pumps toaverage $125.00 - 150.00 per month in electrical operating costs. Pool Heat Pumps Page 8 of 18. Monthly Operating Costs Heat Pump High$ Heat Pump Low$ PCS1$10.69 $324.00 $81.00 So far, youâ€™ve learned. . . 1. CFC chemicals used in heat pumps are scheduled to cease production.2. To date, there is no effective replacement CFC chemical for heat pumps.3
60-65%. The following chart shows what you can save with a heat pump compared to a gas or electric resistance heater for every $1000 in current annual pool heating costs by installing a high efficiency heat pump pool heater. These calculations are based on an electric cost of $.085/kwh and a natural gas cost of $.50/ccf. 
Pool heat pumps are an efficient, environmentally friendly way to heat a pool. Heat pumps can save pool owners money in the long run as they typically have a much lower annual operating costs than gas heaters and with proper maintenance, can last up to 10 years or more. This method of heating is environmentally friendly as they use less energy than other heating methods. For pools, this method is one of the most expensive methods of heating, and can cost up to 5 or 6 times more to run than a heat pump. Electric pool heaters are ideal for spa heaters, but cost too much to run and heat a swimming pool.
Upfront Costs. Though they are less expensive to operate, electric heat pump pool heaters cost more upfront than both gas and electric resistance heaters. Heat pumps can cost up to $5,000, while the majority of gas and electric resistance heaters are available for around $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. The cost for installing heat pumps and gas heaters averages about $300 to $500, including labor and materials.
The cost to install a swimming pool heat pump is approximately $2500 to $4000. Reliability. Pool heat pumps have provided safe, reliable pool heating for decades. Heat pump technology is similar to the way a refrigerator, or air conditioner operates, which may help you understand why they are so reliable. $800. *Based on an electric resistance heated pool, which costs $1,000 per year at an electric cost of $.085/kwh, and using a natural gas cost 0f $.80/therm.
