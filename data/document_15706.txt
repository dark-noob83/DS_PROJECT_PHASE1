As a general rule, between 10 percent and 15 percent of your total calories should come from protein. So, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, at least 200 should come from protein, or about 50 grams. You should try to eat around one gram of protein per one kilogram of body weight, or around 0.4 grams per pound. An easier way to figure this out in your head is to take your weight, divide it in half, and subtract 10. 
You need protein for your muscles, bones, and the rest of your body. Exactly how much you need changes with age: 1  Babies need about 10 grams a day. 2  School-age kids need 19-34 grams a day. 3  Teenage boys need up to 52 grams a day. 4  Teenage girls need 46 grams a day. 5  Adult men need about 56 grams a day. 
Boys of the same age need an average of 2,000 calories each day, so protein should account for 200 to 600 of their calories. Boys and girls 9 to 13 need the same .95 grams of protein for each kilogram of body weight, making the recommended dietary allowance for kids in this range 34 grams per day. For a moderately active child who averages 1,200 calories per day, between 60 and 240 of those calories should come from protein sources. More specifically, kids between 1 and 3 should consume 1.1 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight each day. The recommended dietary allowance, the amount necessary to meet the needs of 97 to 98 percent of healthy kids in this age group, is 13
If you’re 11-13 years old: Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.455; this gives you about how many grams of protein you need each day. For example, a 12 year-old who weighs 100 lbs would need about 45.5 grams of protein (100 lbs x 0.455 = 45.5). If you’re 15-18 years old: Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36 to estimate how many grams of protein you need each day. For example, a 16 year-old female who weighs 120 lbs would need about 43 grams of protein (120 lbs x 0.36 = 43.2). Keep in mind that this is just an estimate. The amount of protein that you need daily, or the recommended daily allowance (RDA), depends on your age and body size, but most teens need between 40 and 60 grams of protein each day. To figure out exactly how much you need, you’ll need to do a little math.
For example, a 13-year-old girl who weighs 110 pounds needs about 47 grams of protein per day, and a 125-pound, 16-year-old girl requires about 49 grams of protein each day. The Institute of Medicine established recommended dietary allowances, or RDAs, for protein. RDAs are general requirements estimated to meet the needs of most girls in each age group. RDAs include 34 grams of protein per day for girls ages 9 to 13 and 46 grams of protein each day for teen girls ages 14 to 18.
To figure out exactly how much you need, you’ll need to do a little math. If you’re 11-13 years old: Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.43; this gives you about how many grams of protein you need each day. For example, a 13 year-old who weighs 119 lbs would need about 51 grams of protein (119 lbs x 0.43 = 51.1). If you’re 14-18 years old: Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.39 to estimate how many grams of protein you need each day. For example, a 15 year-old male who weighs 130 lbs would need about 51 grams of protein (130 lbs x 0.39 = 50.7). Keep in mind that this is just an estimate.
Using a teenage girl’s body weight can help estimate her individualized protein needs. Protein RDAs are calculated using 0.43 grams of protein per pound of body weight for girls ages 9 to 13 and 0.39 grams of protein per pound of body weight for teen girls ages 14 to 18. The Institute of Medicine established recommended dietary allowances, or RDAs, for protein. RDAs are general requirements estimated to meet the needs of most girls in each age group. RDAs include 34 grams of protein per day for girls ages 9 to 13 and 46 grams of protein each day for teen girls ages 14 to 18.
According to Drugs.com, 12- to 14-year-olds should consume approximately 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. Girls aged 15 to 18 need slightly less protein, or 0.9 grams per kilogram of body weight. Find out how many kg your teenager weighs by dividing her weight in pounds by 2.2. For example, if your 13-year-old weighs 100 pounds, she weighs 45.5 kilograms, and should consume about 45 grams of protein each day. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that 13-year-olds consume about 34 grams of protein each day, and 14- to 18-year-olds, about 46 grams.
