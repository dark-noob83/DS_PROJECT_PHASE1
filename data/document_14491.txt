A morphogen is a substance governing the pattern of tissue development in the process of morphogenesis, and the positions of the various specialized cell types within a tissue. Since morphogens diffuse through the tissues of an embryo during early development, concentration gradients are set up. These gradients drive the process of differentiation of unspecialised (stem) cells into different cell types, ultimately forming all the tissues and organs of the body.
Cell signaling isn't just central to tissue architecture and function: It also plays an important role in the balance between cell growth and death. Although it sounds like a bad thing, apoptosis — or the process of programmed cell death — is an essential aspect of development. Within tissues, adhesive molecules allow cells to maintain contact with one another and with structures in the extracellular matrix. One especially important class of adhesive molecules is the integrins.
Cell signaling has been most extensively studied in the context of human diseases and signaling between cells of a single organism. However, cell signaling may also occur between the cells of two different organisms. In many mammals, early embryo cells exchange signals with cells of the uterus. In the human gastrointestinal tract, bacteria exchange signals with each other and with human epithelial and immune system cells. Such networks are complex systems in their organization and may exhibit a number of emergent properties including bistability and ultrasensitivity. Analysis of cell signaling networks requires a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches including the development and analysis of simulations and modeling.

Overview [edit]. Cell Signaling is an important facet of biological life. It allows cells to perceive and respond to the extracellular environment allowing development, growth, immunity, etc. Additionally, errors in cell signaling may result in cancer growth, diabetes. In the third type, the signal is transmitted directly from the cytoplasm of one cell through small conduits into the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell. Paracrine signaling is a form of cell signaling in which the target cell is near the signal-releasing cell. Some signaling molecules degrade very quickly, limiting the scope of their effectiveness to the immediate surrounding
The notch signaling mechanism is an example of juxtacrine signaling (also known as contact-dependent signaling) in which two adjacent cells must make physical contact in order to communicate. This requirement for direct contact allows for very precise control of cell differentiation during embryonic development. Such networks are complex systems in their organization and may exhibit a number of emergent properties including bistability and ultrasensitivity. Analysis of cell signaling networks requires a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches including the development and analysis of simulations and modeling.
More specifically, a morphogen is a signaling molecule that acts directly on cells to produce specific cellular responses depending on its local concentration. Since morphogens diffuse through the tissues of an embryo during early development, concentration gradients are set up. These gradients drive the process of differentiation of unspecialised (stem) cells into different cell types, ultimately forming all the tissues and organs of the body.
Cells receive information from their environment through a class of proteins known as receptors. The information is then processed through signaling pathways and decoded in the nucleus and other areas of the cell. To understand cell signaling, we need to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of both receptors and the components of signaling pathways. Cell nuclei are labeled blue. All living cells sense and respond to their environment by a set of mechanisms known as cell signaling – part of a complex system of communication that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions. To understand cell behavior, we must understand cell signaling.
Indeed, cell communication is necessary for the existence of multicellular organisms. The ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment is the basis of development, tissue repair, and immunity as well as normal tissue homeostasis.
