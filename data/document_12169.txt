The income limit for Roth IRAs for 2010 was $167,000 for individuals that filed married filing joint taxes. If your income was normally around $150,000 per year you wouldn't need to worry about hitting the limit. But this year you received a bonus at the end of the tax year and you've pushed over the edge.
Like a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $5,000 per year, although if you earn less than $5,000 in a year you’re allowed to contibute 100% of your earned income (whichever is less). If you’re over the age of 50, you can make catch-up contributions of $1,000 for years 2009 and 2010.
You can contribute to a Roth in 2013 only if your income is less than $127,000 if single or $188,000 if married filing jointly (the amount starts to phase out if you earn more than $112,000 if single or $178,000 if married filing jointly).
A common example is contributing too much to a Roth IRA based on your income level; the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA begins to phase out at higher income levels. Contribution limits decrease once your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) rises above $105,000 for single filers and $167,000 for joint tax filers.
If you put too much money in your Roth IRA this year, the IRS will hit you with a tax penalty. Your Roth contribution limit depends on your income. If your income is substantially more than you expect, it may reduce the amount you can put in your Roth.
Combined IRA, Roth Excess. Your combined contribution to a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA determines whether you reach the annual contribution limit. If your overall contribution limit is $5,000, and you put $2,000 in a traditional IRA and $4,000 in a Roth IRA, you've contributed $1,000 too much. The IRS does not allow you to choose which contribution to fix. Contributions first are applied to traditional IRAs, so the excess must be withdrawn from the Roth IRA.
The maximum contribution limit for IRAs in 2011 is $5,000 if you are below age 50, or $6,000 if you are age 50 or over. If you determined you have contributed excessive money to your IRA, you need correct the miscalculation by the tax deadline (April 18, 2011 for 2010 tax year), much like the 401k.
