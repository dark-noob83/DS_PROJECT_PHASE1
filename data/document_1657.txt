In addition to more traditional foods, there are few oddball food choices to add to your list of high-calorie, high-protein foods: beef jerky or meat sticks, pork skins, turkey bacon, soy chips, peanuts and meatless fish sticks. Soy chips, for example, have 109 calories and 7.5 grams of protein per ounce.
Cheese is an obvious choice as a high-calorie, high-protein food. It's nutritious, hearty and convenient, while packing a lot of calories and protein into a small package. Cheeses have an average of 100 calories and 6 to 8 grams of protein in every ounce, and come in dozens of varieties.
Peanut Butter. It's rich in protein and healthy fats, and low in cholesterol. Peanut Butter has been linked to improved fat burning, muscle mass buildup and even cardiovascular health. At 100 calories per tablespoon, it should be consumed in moderation.
Due to their high oil content, most nuts, seeds and their butters fall into the high-calorie, high-protein category with 60 or more calories and at least 6 grams of protein in every ounce. These foods are also especially convenient, given that they stay fresh for long periods of time without refrigeration.
Choose protein sources that are nutrient-rich and lower in saturated fat and calories, such as: 1  Lean meats. 2  Seafood. 3  Beans. 4  Soy. 5  Low-fat dairy. 6  Eggs. 7  Nuts and seeds.
High protein foods include meat, fish, cheese, tofu, beans, lentils, yogurt, nuts, and seeds.
