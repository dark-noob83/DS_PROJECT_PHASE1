For a Canadian trademark application the government fee to file the application will always be $250. There are no classes in Canadian trademark practice (learn more about descriptions of goods/services in Canadian trademarks here) and accordingly, the filing fee is always this same amount of $250.
Standard Patent Fees. As of 2011, the standard patent application fee is $400 Canadian dollars. Additional fees will need to be paid if the inventor requests an examination of the patent. The fee for this is CA$800. Applicants who have previously filed patent applications can request priority status.
There are higher fees for non-Canadian entities that wish to file for patent protection in Canada. As of 2011, the transmittal fee is CA$300. This fee is for receiving and checking the international application to ensure it is complete. The search fee, to ensure there are no similar patents, is CA$1,600.
Fees. The initial application fee required to apply for patent is $100 (Canadian). However, patents also require a yearly maintenance fee. Maintenance fees may increase with the anniversaries of a patent's filing date so the longer the patent is maintained, the higher the maintenance fees. These may range from $50 CAD for the first few years up to $650 CAD toward the end of the patent's term.
The cost to draft and file a first patent application in Canada or the US depends on the complexity of the invention, but generally the cost for filing in the US starts at about $5000 for a very simple apparatus.
The total cost of securing a Canadian trademark registration, from application to registration including government fees, is usually $1225-$2000 for an uncontentious application (no opposition, etc.), incurred over 12-18 months (this estimate includes the $600 on filing, plus $625-$1250 incurred later).
