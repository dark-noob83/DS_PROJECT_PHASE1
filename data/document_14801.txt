There are three types of flu viruses: A, B, and C. Type A and B cause the annual influenza epidemics that have up to 20% of the population sniffling, aching, coughing, and running high fevers. Type C also causes flu; however, type C flu symptoms are much less severe.
Type B Influenza facts and comparison with Type A influenza viruses: 1  Type B Influenzavirus is an infectious virus in the the Genera of Orthomyxoviridae (flu viruses). 2  It is an RNA virus.
The flu is caused by influenza virus types A, B, and C. Both type A and type B flu viruses are responsible for the seasonal outbreaks of flu. Type A flu viruses are found in many different animals, including ducks, chickens, pigs, and horses. Influenza B viruses circulate widely only among humans.
There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B and C. Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease almost every winter in the United States. The emergence of a new and very different influenza virus to infect people can cause an influenza pandemic.
Type B Influenza: Type B influenza is a subtype of the influenza virus that tends to occur sporadically-can cause epidemics but not pandemics. Influenza is viral respiratory infection.
Save. Influenza is caused by three different types of viruses: influenza A, influenza B and influenza C. All three of these flu viruses have similar symptoms, yet influenza B is the most common flu virus during the winter and the one that leads to the most localized outbreaks of the flu.
Unlike type A flu viruses, type B flu is found only in humans. Type B flu may cause a less severe reaction than type A flu virus, but occasionally, type B flu can still be extremely harmful. Influenza type B viruses are not classified by subtype and do not cause pandemics.
