If you feel pain when the spider bites, this is likely the culprit. by James Hubbard, MD, MPH. I’ve seen a lot of spider bites in my day, and more often than not, the spider is never seen. Over the years I’ve developed several tricks for how to identify the spider by the bite.
Identify the spider. Most spider bites aren't from dangerous spiders-in fact, many supposed spider bites are actually insect bites that are easily treated. If you suspect that you were bitten by a dangerous spider, go to the sub-sections below to confirm identity and administer proper first aid.
I have no idea what kind of a spider it could have been but at first it looked like a large mosquito bite then with in a few hours a large blister formed (about the size of a pea). The blister broke open and I don't know how to treat it. My son is 17months and the bite is on his lower leg.
Most spider bites cause only minor injury. A few spiders can be dangerous. In the United States, these include the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider. To take care of a spider bite: 1  Clean the wound. 2  Use mild soap and water and apply an antibiotic ointment. 3  Apply a cool compress. 4  Use a cloth dampened with cold water or filled with ice. 5  This helps reduce pain and swelling. 6  If the bite is on an arm or leg, elevate it. 7  Use over-the-counter medications.
If you feel pain when the spider bites, it’s likely a black widow, whose bite is often but not always painful. You may also develop severe body aches and fever. A brown recluse spider bite is a slight sting at best. Most of the time you feel nothing. They hide in or under boxes, under your bed sheets, in your clothes.
