In this calculation we’ll use an ethane heat content of 66,500 BTU per gallon. The top boxes in Figure #1 show the conversion of the ethane price per gallon to dollars per MMbtu. So if the price of ethane is 22 cents, divide by 66,500 and multiply by 1,000,000 to yield an equivalent gas price of $3.31/MMbtu. That is $1.05/MMbtu cheaper than gas which settled yesterday at $4.36/MMbtu. The ratio of Mont Belvieu ethane prices to the price of natural gas at the Henry Hub on a BTU equivalent basis has been below 100% since March. That means ethane is worth more as gas than as liquid ethane, which was bad enough for ethane producers
Ethane in Mont Belvieu posted at 22.5 cnts/gal on Friday, continuing the NGL’s descent into the abyss that started mid-2012. The last time we saw ethane at this level was back in 2002. With natural gas prices hanging in there above $3.00/MMbtu, there is no doubt about it. 
Essentially, domestic ethane price in the US is less than $4 per mmBtu and we estimate that landed cost of imports would work out to less than $12 per mmBtu. This will substitute propane or naphtha being consumed at a price ranging between $19-23 per mmBtu, said Jal Irani from Edelweiss Securities limited. Shale boom in the US has led ethane prices to plunge by 70 per cent over past four years to less than $4 per mmBtu, Irani added. Given the US' large shale reserves, its oil and gas production over the next decade might rise to exceed Saudi Arabia's production shortly and could reach twice that of Saudi's.
In short, the spot price of natural gas sets a floor in the US for ethane prices. With the spot price of ethane in Mont Belvieu hovering near the equivalent price of natural gas at the Henry Hub, processing plants are rejecting about 250,000 barrels of NGL per day. 
EIA projects residential prices overall in the United States to average $9.51 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) this winter, which is 40&cent lower than the per-unit price last winter. EIA forecast that consumers in all four census regions (West, Northeast, South, and Midwest) will see lower natural gas bills this winter. 1 The Henry Hub spot price began the week at $2.47 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) last Wednesday then closed the week down by 1¢ at $2.46/MMBtu yesterday. 2  At the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), the November near-month contract decreased from $2.524/MMBtu last Wednesday to $2.474
At the time, natural-gas prices ranged between $4.00 and $5.00 per million British thermal units (mmBtu)–well off the high of $13.69 per mmBtu in 2008 and $6.24 per mmBtu in 2009. In short, the spot price of natural gas sets a floor US for ethane prices. With the spot price of ethane in Mont Belvieu hovering near the equivalent price of natural gas at the Henry Hub, processing plants are rejecting about 250 million barrels of the NGL per day.
For instance, ethane currently trades at $0.26/gallon, but it trades at $0.26/0.0657 per MMBtu or $3.99/MMBtu. Line C represents the current natural gas price per MMBtu, which is currently $3.65. Line D represents the “natural gas shrink”, which is Line B multiplied by Line C. Let us use ethane as an example to explain what the significance of the natural gas shrink is. Natural gas is currently trading at $3.65/MMBtu. To get the energy equivalent basis per gallon of ethane we multiply that by the conversion factor of 0.0657 to get $0.24/gallon. Line E represents the margin per gallon. Since the value of ethane is $0.26/gallon and for the same amount of MMBtu’s the value of natural gas is $0.24 per gallon of ethane, the margin is $0.26 minus $0.24 or $0.02. Line F represents what a sample mix of NGLs might look like within a raw gas stream
The price then rose to close at $2.46/MMBtu yesterday. Prices in most markets, except the Northeast, followed a similar pattern, ending down for the week, after reaching weekly lows on Friday. Chicago Citygate spot prices started at $2.56/MMBtu last Wednesday and closed yesterday at $2.46/MMBtu. 1 The Henry Hub spot price began the week at $2.47 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) last Wednesday then closed the week down by 1¢ at $2.46/MMBtu yesterday. 2  At the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), the November near-month contract decreased from $2.524/MMBtu last Wednesday to $2.474
Recall from Part III that ethane has about 66,500 BTU/gallon. If we multiply by 42 to get BTU/Bbl, that yields the BTU factor in the above table. (2,790,000 BTU/Barrel or 2.79). If we divide the price of ethane on a per barrel basis by the BTU factor, we’ll get the price of ethane on an MMBTU basis. (0.46 * 42) / 2.79 = $6.92/MMbtu. Obviously that’s a lot higher than the price of natural gas at $2.00 /MMbtu. But that number pales against natural gasoline
