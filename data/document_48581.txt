The first symptom of urticarial vasculitis is an urticarial eruption that is often painful or has a burning sensation. In some cases there may be pruritus (itching). Lesions are red patches that may have a white centre and petechiae (small spots of bleeding under the skin) may appear.
Urticarial vasculitis is a variant of cutaneous vasculitis. It is characterised by inflamed and reddened patches or weals on the skin that appear to resemble urticaria, but when the skin is examined closely under a microscope, vasculitis is found (inflamed blood vessels).
Urticaria and Angioedema. Urticaria is also known as 'nettlerash' or 'hives'. It consists of wheals-spots or patches of raised red or white skin-each of which usually clears away in a few hours, to be replaced by other fresh wheals. The wheals are usually itchy, painful or cause a burning sensation.
Urticarial Vasculitis DevineDesign 2013-02-18T18:47:31+00:00. Urticarial vasculitis is a form of vasculitis that affects the skin, causing wheals or hives and/or red patches due to swelling of the small blood vessels.
Symptoms. The most common symptoms are hives that cause itching, pain and a burning feeling. Skin patches often are red-rimmed with white centers, and unlike common hives may have petechia, or bleeding under the skin. The patches can be present for days and result in skin discoloration as they heal. Some patients may also have fevers, joint and abdominal pain, shortness of breath and swollen lymph glands. Sometimes urticarial vasculitis even causes injury to vital organs including the gut, lungs and kidneys.
