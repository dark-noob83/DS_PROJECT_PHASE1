Often called Earth's sister planet, Venus is the closest in size, with a mass of more than 80 percent that of our planet and a diameter of only a few miles less. It is also the closest planet to our own in terms of location. The planet's surface area is 90 percent that of Earth's, covering 178 million square miles (460 million square km). The planet boasts two land masses, Ishtar Terra and Aphrodite Terra, which make up about 8 percent of its surface area (as compared to the 25 percent of continent-covered surface on Earth).
The Sun is 864,400 miles (1,391,000 kilometers) across. This is about 109 times the diameter of Earth. The Sun weighs about 333,000 times as much as Earth. It is so large that about 1,300,000 planet Earths can fit inside of it. Earth is about the size of an average sunspot! 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmo
Retrograde. Venus compared to Earth shows a planet of extremes. Yes, a few physical characteristics are similar, but there are many more differences. Looking at the chart above you can see how the temperature and atmospheric pressure would combine to crush your smoldering body. There are enough similarities between Earth and Venus that many scientists consider the two to be near twin planets that happened to evolve in different directions. Below is a chart showing the characteristics of Venus compared to Earth attributes.
Density, mass, and volume. Venus is a rocky, terrestrial planet like Earth, and likely formed the same way at the same time. It has a mass of 4.87 trillion trillion kilograms, about 82 percent that of its sister planet. Like its size, its density is comparable to Earth at 5.243 grams per cubic centimeter. The planet's surface area is 90 percent that of Earth's, covering 178 million square miles (460 million square km). The planet boasts two land masses, Ishtar Terra and Aphrodite Terra, which make up about 8 percent of its surface area (as compared to the 25 percent of continent-covered surface on Earth).
Venus and Earth Compared Venus, the second planet from the Sun, lies, on average, 108 million km from the Sun, about 30% closer than the Earth. Venus is often referred to as our sister planet because of similarities in size, mass, density and volume. 
It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis. The planet’s orbit around the Sun takes 225 Earth days, compared to the Earth’s 365. Venus is often called the Earth’s sister planet: The Earth and Venus are very similar in size with only a 638 km difference in diameter, Venus having 81.5% of the Earth’s mass. Both also have a central core, a molten mantle and a crust.
Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, and its mass is about 81.5% of Earth's. Mars is much smaller, just over half (53%) of Earth's diameter and a mass only 10.7% of Earth's. 11 people found this useful. Edit. Earth's diameter is 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers). Venus's diameter is 7,257 miles (11,677 kilometers). It has a volume of 9.38×1011 km3 and a mass of 4.868 X1024 kg. It has a surface area of 4.60 × 108 km2.
1 The atmosphere of Venus is 90 times more dense than that on Earth and it is made of 96.5% of CO2 and a 3% of nitrogen. 2  This means that both planets have the same amount of Nitrogen on their atmospheres. 1 Whereas Earth rotates in about 24 hours Venus rotates in the contrary sense (retrograde rotation) in 243 days. 2  The orbital period of Venus is 225 days so that a Venus year takes less than a full day.
