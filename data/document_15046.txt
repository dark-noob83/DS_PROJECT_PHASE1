The average cost of master cylinder repair is usually between $200 and $300, but it can be more, again, depending on the scope of the fix. If individual wheel cylinders need to be replaced, the cost will go up. The repair price for an entire brake job—rotors, calipers, drums, pads, cylinders—can run you $750 or more. Therefore, it's best to stay on top of brake repair and get the pads replaced when you hear squeaking. Components like master cylinders wear down after time, so eventually it will have to be replaced.
The brake master cylinder contains brake fluid and is connected to the brakes through the brake pipes and hoses. When you step on the brake pedal, brake fluid flows from the master cylinder to the braking unit at each wheel, creating enough friction to slow down and/or stop the car.
