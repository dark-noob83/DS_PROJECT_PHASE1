Synonym Discussion of VERTICAL. vertical, perpendicular, plumb mean being at right angles to a base line. vertical suggests a line or direction rising straight upward toward a zenith. perpendicular may stress the straightness of a line making a right angle with any other line, not necessarily a horizontal one.

Best Answer: Horizontal and vertical are simply directions relative to some reference frame. Typically the reference frame in HS and early college physics is Earth's surface. In which case horizontal means parallel to Earth's surface and vertical means perpendicular to Earth's surface. In advanced math and physics, the terms horizontal and vertical will be replaced by unit vectors i, j, and k; where i dot i = 1 etc. And Ay = A, which means the A vector is pointing straight up the vertical axis. In this case, there is no Ax component. In higher trig you will learn about transformations where we rotate the axes some degrees with the result sometimes of simplifying an otherwise difficult problem.
