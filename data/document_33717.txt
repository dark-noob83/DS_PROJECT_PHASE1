There is no conversion from kilograms to liters or vice versa. The kilogram is a unit of weight or mass, whereas the liter is a unit of volume or capacity. In order to determine the weight of a liter of something, you must know what that something is.
Best Answer: Kg is a measure of weight. Litre is a measure of volume. The only way to convert between the two is if you know the density of the object you want to measure, where:- density = mass / volume (note: 1L = 0.001m^3) However, 1kg of water = 1 litre of water.
liter = kilograms 6.0 = 6.0 7.0 = 7.0 8.0 = 8.0 9.0 = 9.0 10 = 10.0. kg = l 1.0 = 1.0 2.0 = 2.0 3.0 = 3.0 4.0 = 4.0 5.0 = 5.0. kilograms = liters 6.0 = 6.0 7.0 = 7.0 8.0 = 8.0 9.0 = 9.0 10 = 10.0. Weight of 1 liter (l) of pure water at temperature 4 Â°C = 1 kilogram (kg). A liter is defined as one cubic decimetre (1 l = 1 cubic dm). 1 l = 1kg of water = 0.001 cubic m = 0.264172052 US gallons = 1.05668821 US quarts.
The number of liters in 1 kilogram depends on the density of the substance being measured. The liter is a unit of volume, and the kilogram a unit of mass. One kilogram of shaving cream takes up several liters, while 1 kilogram of steel takes up less than a liter.
The answer is 1. We assume you are converting between liter and kilogram [water] . You can view more details on each measurement unit: liter or kilogram [water]. The SI derived unit for volume is the cubic meter. 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liter, or 1000
One kilogram of concrete converted to liter equals to 0.42 L. How many liters of concrete are in 1 kilogram? The answer is: The change of 1 kg-kilo (kilogram) unit of concrete measure equals = to 0.42 L (liter) as the equivalent measure for the same concrete type.
