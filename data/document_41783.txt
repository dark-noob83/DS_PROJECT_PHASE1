Then you can strategize your distributions to minimize your tax liability. You can also contribute to a traditional IRA even if you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, but in some cases not all of your traditional IRA contributions will be tax deductible. 
In order to figure out how much you can contribute, and deduct, for your Simple IRA and Traditional IRA, see the link in @mhoran_psprep's answer money.stackexchange.com/a/13495/3361 It is valid for the tax year 2011. You can definitely contribute to a Roth IRA too. However, according to the IRS for the 2011 tax year : Contributions to a traditional IRA reduce your limit for contributions to a Roth IRA.
Contribution Limits. The contribution limits for SIMPLE IRAs are lower than 401(k) plans, so your SIMPLE IRA contribution cannot exceed the lower limit and your total contributions can't exceed the higher, 401(k) plan limit. In 2012, the limit for a SIMPLE IRA is $11,500 and the limit for a 401(k) plan is $17,000. For example, if you contributed $2,000 more than your contribution limit to the two plans, you have to report $2,000 more in taxable income for the year. Worse, you get taxed on that money a second time when you take the money out.
4. Employees can contribute 100% of income into a SIMPLE IRA. You are allowed to contribute up to $12,000 (2013 and 2014) per year in a SIMPLE IRA. If you’re over the age of 50, you’re allowed a catch-up contribution, which is 2,500 (2014). 
Ultimate guide to retirement. To set up a SIMPLE IRA an employer must have 100 or fewer employees earning more than $5,000 each-including all employees who have worked at any point in the calendar year. And the employer cannot have any other retirement plan besides the SIMPLE IRA. If your employer offers a SIMPLE IRA, you qualify to contribute if you earned at least $5,000 a year during any two years before the plan was set up, and if you expect to earn at least $5,000 this year. 
Employers must make matching contributions to your SIMPLE IRA each year. However, they have the option of either matching your contributions, up to 3 percent of your salary, or simply contributing 2 percent of your salary no matter how much you contribute. If you take money out of your SIMPLE IRA before age 59 1/2, you'll owe an extra 10 percent tax penalty. SIMPLE IRAs also increase the early withdrawal penalty to 25 percent instead of 10 percent if you take a distribution within two years of starting your SIMPLE IRA.
If your employer offers a savings incentive match plan for employees — a SIMPLE IRA, for short — you're in luck because you can sock away more money each year for retirement. Simple IRAs are tax-deferred plans created by your employer. Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred savings, but you set them up yourself. Contribution Processes. You can only make Simple IRA contributions through salary reduction agreements -- you tell your employer how much to withhold from your paycheck and your employer takes it out before paying you. So, you usually make the contributions over the course of the year.
As a result, if you put $11,500 in your SIMPLE IRA, you can't put more than $5,500 in your 401(k) plan. If your total contributions to your 401(k) plan and SIMPLE IRA exceed the annual limits, the IRS penalizes you by disallowing the deduction for your contribution. For example, if you contributed $2,000 more than your contribution limit to the two plans, you have to report $2,000 more in taxable income for the year. Worse, you get taxed on that money a second time when you take the money out.
