Measles is the most deadly of all childhood rash/fever illnesses. The disease spreads very easily, so it is important to protect against infection. To prevent measles, children (and some adults) should be vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of this vaccine are needed for complete protection. Children should be given the first dose of MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age. The second dose can be given 4 weeks later, but is usually given before the start of kindergarten at 4 to 6 years of age.
Children typically receive their first dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine on or after their first birthday, with the second dose given at 4-6 years of age. Adults born before 1957, or who have already received an MMR vaccination likely do not need to be vaccinated again.
