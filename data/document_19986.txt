Process: In anatomy, a projection from a structure. For example, the process of the mandible is the part of the lower jaw that projects forward.
alveolar process the part of the bone in either the maxilla or mandible that surrounds and supports the teeth. basilar process a quadrilateral plate of the occipital bone projecting superiorly and anteriorly from the foramen magnum.
uncinate process any hooklike process, as of vertebrae, the lacrimal bone, or the pancreas. xiphoid process the pointed process of cartilage, supported by a core of bone, connected with the lower end of the sternum; called also xiphoid. The xiphoid process.
Free Trial. Process Structure is a framework of identifiable and measurable process elements (steps, activities, tasks, procedures, actions) that create a process hierarchy and determine how the process will be performed.
alveolar process the part of the bone in either the maxilla or mandible surrounding and supporting the teeth. basilar process a quadrilateral plate of the occipital bone projecting superiorly and anteriorly from the foramen magnum. caudate process the right of the two processes on the caudate lobe of the liver.
The mastoid process is located in the posterior portion of the temporal bone. It is one of the two projections situated behind the ear. The mastoid process provides an attachment for certain muscles of the neck.
When characterized by its flow structure, a process broadly can be classified either as a job shop or a flow shop. A job shop process uses general purpose resources and is highly flexible. A flow shop process uses specialized resources and the work follows a fixed path.
For instance, in a vertebra, a process may serve for muscle attachment and leverage (as in the case of the transverse and spinous processes), or to fit (forming a synovial joint), with another vertebra (as in the case of the articular processes).
