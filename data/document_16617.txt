Granite is a light-colored igneous rock with grains large enough to be visible with the unaided eye. It forms from the slow crystallization of magma below Earth’s surface. Granite is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor amounts of mica, amphiboles and other minerals. This mineral composition usually gives granite a red, pink, gray or white color with dark mineral grains visible throughout the rock. Granite is the best-known igneous rock.
MINERALS. CRYSTALS. GEMSTONES. FIND OUT MORE. Earth’s crust is made of rock, and rock is made of natural substances called MINERALS. There are three main types of rock—sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock. Each type is produced in different ways. The oldest rocks on Earth were formed about 3.8 billion years ago
An igneous rock is a rock that is made from heat, and the different types of igneous rocks are Obsidian, Granite, Basalt, Pumice and Gabbro. 1 person found this useful. Edit. Share to: 1  Identifying Plagioclase Feldspar Plagioclase feldspar is a common mineral found in the Earth's crust. All rocks are made of minerals. Igneous rocks are formed from molten and magma eg. basalt and granite, Sedimentary rocks are mechanically or organically formed eg. sandstone, … limestone and shale and Metamorphic rocks are formed from igneous or sedimentary rocks altered by heat or pressure eg. slate and graphite.
Granite is a coarse-grained, light-colored igneous rock composed mainly of feldspars and quartz with minor amounts of mica and amphibole minerals. This simple definition enables students to easily identify the rock based upon a visual inspection. Granite is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor amounts of mica, amphiboles and other minerals. This mineral composition usually gives granite a red, pink, gray or white color with dark mineral grains visible throughout the rock. Granite is the best-known igneous rock.

Extrusive igneous rock. Extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rock is produced when magma ex its and cools outside of, or very near the Earth's surface. These are the rocks that form at erupting volcanoes and oozing fissures. What a rock is made of, the shapes of the grains or crystals within the rock, and how the grains or crystals fit together all provide valuable clues to help us unlock the rock's history hidden within.
FIND OUT MORE. The Earth is covered in a layer of solid rock called the crust. Rocks are either SEDIMENTARY, IGNEOUS, or METAMORPHIC. Almost all rocks made of minerals, but different rocks contain different mixtures of minerals. Granite, for example, consists of quartz, feldspar, and mica
