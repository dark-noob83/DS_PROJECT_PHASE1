The breakdown products provide nutrients to the algae and bacteria upon which the shrimp feed. The manufacturer states that shrimp live in the EcoSphere for an average of 2 to 3 years, and are known to live over 10 years. A magnetic scrubber is enclosed in each EcoSphere. By passing another magnet over the outside of the glass, the owner can manipulate the scrubber to clean the inside of the EcoSphere. They are sold worldwide as scientific novelties and decorative objects. The EcoSphere's main visual appeal is provided by tiny red-pink shrimp, Halocaridina rubra, between 1/4 and 3/8 inch (or approximately a centimeter) in length.
Please notice the amount of green algae in your EcoSphere. This initial quantity is the inoculant required to produce sufficient oxygen for the shrimp. Do not allow the algae to grow more than this or the chemical balance will change. You can control the growth of algae by controlling the light level. This is a good gauge as to how much visible algae should be in the system. DO. keep your EcoSphere at temperatures between 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15C) and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (25C). Temperatures above 85 degrees put excess stress on the shrimp in the EcoSphere. Temperatures below 60 degrees slowdown the metabolism of the shrimp. Do not let the temperatures flux erratically from 60 degrees to 85 degrees. The temperature needs to be consistent
The tiny worlds are called EcoSpheres® . Tiny red shrimp that live in the EcoSphere® . The EcoSphere contains water, air, tiny shrimp, algae (a green plant), and bacteria. It also contains tiny branches, shells, and rocks so the shrimp have places to hide and the bacteria have surfaces to cling to. Every part of Earth's ecosphere depends on every other part. For example, if some of the seaweed in the oceans dies, fish will have less oxygen, because seaweed produces oxygen. If a volcano erupts and puts a lot of soot into the atmosphere, the wind could spread the particles for thousands of miles.
I do have the larger oval size ecosphere, it's the shrimp that is less than a quarter inch in size. The sphere is very thick and I'm afraid if I shatter it in a towel the tiny shrimp will end up stuck to the towel and killed. Ecosphere with one shrimp left, how to free it. Post by DatDamWuf » Sat Feb 17, 2007 10:11 pm. Before I joined this forum I got one of the larger oval ones for Christmas. My husband thought all the shrimps had died and put the sphere in our office a couple of years ago (actually the junk room).
We do not know how long your EcoSphere will live due to different light and temperature conditions throughout the country; and we do not know the exact age of the shrimp when we make an EcoSphere. The oldest EcoSphere we know of is now over 14 years old and the one remaining shrimp still going strong. This is a good gauge as to how much visible algae should be in the system. DO. keep your EcoSphere at temperatures between 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15C) and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (25C). Temperatures above 85 degrees put excess stress on the shrimp in the EcoSphere. Temperatures below 60 degrees slowdown the metabolism of the shrimp. Do not let the temperatures flux erratically from 60 degrees to 85 degrees. The temperature needs to be consistent

This brand new EcoSphere contains 6 shrimp and at 4.75 in diameter it fits right between the Small Sphere and Medium Sphere. Available for the extraordinary price of $110 plus shipping, this limited edition EcoSphere is sure to be gone soon! Get it here
An Ecosphere is a self contained world with everything it needs inside to create a life cycle. Nasa first created Ecospheres to recreate conditions of a miniature Earth. The Ecosphere in this video contains water, algae and shrimp. The algae creates oxygen through photosynthesis. All that is needed is the right amount of sunlight. The balance within the Ecosphere will continue to create life providing there isn't too much or too little sunlight. Update: ALL my shrimp were dead within 6 months.
