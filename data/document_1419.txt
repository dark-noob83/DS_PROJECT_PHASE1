From a low down payment mortgage to using your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) as a source of funds, buying a home has never been easier. The down payment is that portion of the purchase price you furnish yourself. The balance is obtained from a financial institution in the form of a mortgage. The withdrawal is not taxable as long as you repay it within a 15-year period. To qualify, the RRSP funds you plan to use must have been in your RRSP for at least 90 days. Even if you already have enough money for your down payment, it may make sense to access your RRSP savings through the Home Buyers' Plan.
