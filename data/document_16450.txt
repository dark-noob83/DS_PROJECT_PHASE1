Unbaked Lasagna. To prepare unbaked lasagna for freezing, line a 13-by-9-inch baking pan or casserole dish with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Use pieces of foil long enough to hang several inches over each side of the pan. Prepare the recipe in the foil-lined pan and freeze until firm, uncovered. Carefully lift the frozen lasagna out of the pan and fold and seal the foil to tightly enclose it. Freeze it the same way as uncooked lasagna and, if possible, defrost it first for quicker reheating. To bake it from a frozen state, preheat the oven to 250 F and check it after an hour and a half of baking to monitor the progress.

Bake frozen lasagna at a medium-high temperature. If you use a conventional oven, set it to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. To cook the lasagna in the same amount of time in a convection oven, you only need to set it to 350 F because the fan circulates the oven's heat more efficiently. 
Add the 1lb of ground meat to the pan and cook until browned. Mix the meat in with the onions and garlic, stirring well, and cook on medium heat until completely browned. Add salt and crushed black pepper, to taste, as it cooks.
