Johns said North Texas might not need a new reservoir if residents could reduce their water consumption. They could push it back at a minimum a couple of decades and possibly avoid it, he said. That approach has worked in San Antonio, which gets its water from the Edwards Aquifer, Finch said. North Texans consume more water -- and do less to conserve it -- than residents of any other urban area in the state, according to the Texas Water Development Board and government records. Utility officials say they're doing their best to promote conservation.
