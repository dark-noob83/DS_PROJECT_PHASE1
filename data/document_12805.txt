FIR and IIR are digital filters that are commonly used in digital signal processing. There are only a few components that make up these filters, but these components can be arranged in various ways to make complicated filters for use
IIR vs FIR Filters. IIR filters are difficult to control and have no particular phase, whereas FIR filters make a linear phase always possible. IIR can be unstable, whereas FIR is always stable. IIR, when compared to FIR, can have limited cycles, but FIR has no limited cycles. IIR is derived from analog, whereas FIR has no analog history.
An IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter is a foundation element in Digital Signal Processing (DSP).
In this application note, we will explain the difference between FIR (finite impulse response) and IIR (infinite impulse response) filtering.
IIR Filter. An IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter is a foundation element in Digital Signal Processing (DSP). It is one of two types of digital filters used in DSP applications and is an alternative to Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters.
Where the system response is infinite, we use IIR filters, and where the system response is zero, we use FIR filters. FIR filters are also preferred over IIR filters because they have a linear phase response and are non recursive, whereas IIR filters are recursive, and feedback is also involved.
An important difference between IIR and FIR filters is the potential for the IIR filter to be unstable. An FIR filter will be stable no matter how it is synthesized or implemented (it has no feedback). On the other hand, an IIR filter with improperly placed poles can't be made stable no matter how it is implemented.
Infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. IIR filters are the most efficient type of filter to implement in DSP (digital signal processing). They are usually provided as biquad filters. For example, in the parametric EQ block of a miniDSP plugin, each peak/notch or shelving filter is a single biquad.
