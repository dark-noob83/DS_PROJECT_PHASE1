A beta particle (also written as β-particle) is the same as an electron. It is often called a high energy electron because it is very fast moving. A beta particle comes from the nucleus of an atom! It has a charge of -1 and very little mass (only 1 ÷ 1840 as big as a proton). The e shows that the particle is an electron. A beta particle is given a mass number of zero because the mass is very small compared to a proton or a neutron. 1. A beta particle has a negative charge because it is an electron. 2. A beta particle has less mass than an alpha particle but more mass than a gamma ray. See the three types of radioactivity.
A beta particle is either an electron or a positron emitted by an atomic nucleus in beta decay, which is a type of radioactive decay. The phenomenon of beta decay involves a c … hange within the atomic nucleus of an atom. Beta particles are actually electrons (-e) or can be  positrons.The mass of one electron or beta particle is  9.1095*10-31 kilograms or  0.000548597 AMU which is about 1/20 … 00 times the mass of a  proton or neutron.

A beta particle is two particles emitted in the form of radioactive decay called beta decay. It is either an electron and an electron anti neutrino, which is emitted in beta-decay, or a positron and an electron neutrino, which is emitted in beta+ decay.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. the mass of a beta particle is that of an electron which is 0.000544662309 amu (atomic mass units) or in kilograms that's 9.10938188 × 10-31 kilograms. Beta particles are actually electrons (-e) or can be  positrons.The mass of one electron or beta particle is  9.1095*10-31 kilograms or  0.000548597 AMU which is about 1/20 … 00 times the mass of a  proton or neutron.
The beta particle is an electron, which has too small a mass to be part of the mass number. The mass number therefore remains unchanged when a nucleus emits a beta particle, b … ut the atomic number goes up by one, because one of the neutrons in the original nucleus is replaced by a proton. 1 person found this useful.

Positively charged particle emitted by various radioactive materials during decay. It consists of two neutrons and two protons, and is thus identical to the nucleus of a helium atom. The rest mass of the alpha particle amounts to 6.64424·10 -27 kg, or 3.7273·10 9 eV. Alpha radiation is the radiation with the lowest penetration potential of the three radiation types (alpha, beta, gamma radiation).
After a radioactive nucleus has emitted a beta particle, the mass number stays the same and the atomic number goes up by 1. A neutron in the nucleus has changed into a proton plus an electron. The proton stays inside the nucleus but the electron is emitted as a beta particle. 
Gamma radiation is damped by lead. Beta particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by certain types of radioactive nuclei, such as potassium-40. The beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation also known as beta rays. The production of beta particles is termed beta decay. They are designated by the Greek letter beta (β). There are two forms of beta decay, β − and β + , which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron.
