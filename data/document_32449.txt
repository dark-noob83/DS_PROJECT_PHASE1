Patent applications involve lots of text and drawings, even for simpler inventions. The first step in the patent application process is to file a non provisional patent application, which involves paying attorney fees in the range of $5000 to $15,000 or more, depending on the intricacies of the invention. The amount you spend on a patent application will also depend on the market opportunities. Filing for patents can be an expensive time consuming process so small companies should be highly selective about what patents they file for. In the case of a biotech company, for example, they can easily spend between $10,000 and $20,000 filing for patents.
Patent Application Fees. For utility patents, the small entity fees include a $165 filing fee ($82 if filing electronically), as well as a search fee of $270 and an examination fee of $110. For large entities, the filing fees are a $330 filing fee, a search fee of $540, and an examination fee of $220. The PPA currently costs $110 to file ($220 for large entities), which means an inventor can now afford to get an invention registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and have a year to show the invention to potential developers before filing a regular patent application.

Some firms are willing to assist inventors in filing provisional applications, in which case the total cost of the provisional filing includes the attorney's fees. The cost for patent filings varies greatly from one country to the next. For someone who has already filed a patent application in the U.S., the cost to file in Canada, to give one example, is typically under $1,000. In contrast, a filing in Japan, which requires translations, might cost $12,000.
The filing fee is $130 for a small entity and drawings typically cost $100 to $125 per page, so a high quality provisional patent application for a mechanical or electrical device can typically be prepared and filed for $2,500 to $3,000. The costs can add up quickly no doubt, and there will be post-filing costs once the Patent Examiner starts to examine the application filed, but those will be the subject of a future article. Still, you should budget at least another $5,000 to $7,500 for prosecution and issue fees to the Patent Office.
The patent application filing fee for a basic utility patent is $330, which is in addition to a $540 utility patent search fee and a $220 examination fee, plus patent maintenance fees of $980 after three years.

A fairly typical quote for a provisional patent application (through filing) for a moderately complex mechanical innovation is $2,5000 for attorneys fees plus the cost of the provisional filing fee (typically $130) and the cost of any professional illustrations desired (typically $200 to $300). If we did the provisional the client has already paid $2,500 in attorneys fees, so the attorneys fees for the nonprovisional preparation and filing would be $6,000. Thus the total attorney fee does not change at all whether you start with a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application.
A fairly typical quote for a nonprovisional patent application (through filing) for a software innovation is $8,500 for attorneys fees plus the cost of the nonprovisional filing fee (typically $800) and the cost of any professional illustrations desired (typically $300 to $500). If we did the provisional the client has already paid $2,500 in attorneys fees, so the attorneys fees for the nonprovisional preparation and filing would be $6,000. Thus the total attorney fee does not change at all whether you start with a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application.
Congress gives inventors another approach: File a provisional patent application (PPA) on the invention. Filing a PPA allows an inventor to claim patent pending status for the invention for 12 months, but involves only a small fraction of the work and cost of a regular patent application.

1 Filing fee to the USPTO for provisional patent application = $130 (small entity). 2  Nonprovisional patent application based off provisional filing = $10,000 to $12,000. 3  Filing fee to the USPTO for nonprovisional patent application = $800 to $1,250 (small entity). The costs can add up quickly no doubt, and there will be post-filing costs once the Patent Examiner starts to examine the application filed, but those will be the subject of a future article. Still, you should budget at least another $5,000 to $7,500 for prosecution and issue fees to the Patent Office.
