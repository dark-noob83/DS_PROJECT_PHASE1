Here's a breakdown of LDL cholesterol levels and health: Less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) – this is your goal if you're at very high risk for a heart attack. Less than 100 mg/dL – the goal for people with heart disease or diabetes. 100 to 129 mg/dL – near or above the ideal level.
The normal range for cholesterol is less than 200 total cholesterol, with less than 150 levels of triglycerides, greater than 40 HDL...
Your total cholesterol level is in the Desirable range, but your level of bad LDL cholesterol is Very High. This may mean that your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, is too low.
Target Range. Healthy LDL levels fall within the optimal target range, which is less than 100 mg/dL. If you have a history of heart disease, your target range is under 70 mg/dL. Near optimal is between 100 and 129. Levels between 130 and 159 mg/dL are considered borderline high, while over 160 mg/dL is considered high.
Your LDL is most often considered to be too high if it is 190 mg/dL or higher. Levels between 70 and 189 mg/dL are most often considered too high if: 1  You have diabetes and are between ages 40 and 75. 2  You have diabetes and a high risk of heart disease.
Your total cholesterol level is in the Desirable range, but your level of bad LDL cholesterol is borderline high. If your LDL goes higher, your total cholesterol level could become Borderline High. Consider reducing the amount of foods you eat with saturated fats and increasing physical activity.
Your total cholesterol level is in the Desirable range, but your level of bad LDL cholesterol is High. This may mean that your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, is too low. It is best to have a high level of good HDL and a low level of bad LDL.
