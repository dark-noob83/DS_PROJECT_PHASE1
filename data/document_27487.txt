A fridge will use anywhere from 100 to 400 watts depending on size, an average modern fridge will use 180 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a refrigerator using 180 Watts for 24 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Cost Per Hour: 
(Wattage x eight) ÷ 1000 = kWh per day. Where eight represents our presumed eight hours active time per day. Thus a 600 Watt unit – typical of older, larger refrigerators – would use 4.8 kilowatt hours daily, or 1750 per year; where a more modern 140 watt unit uses about 1.1 kWh daily, or approximately 400 per year. This is how many watts does a refrigerator use. No information is provided by the author. 
About $21. If you’re trying to compare the watts consumed by a refrigerator you already own, to that of a refrigerator you plan to buy, the best approach is to buy a Kill A Watt meter or other electricity usage monitor and use it to measure your current refrigerator energy consumption. For example, I plugged my Kill A Watt meter into my Maytag 18.5 refrigerator and left it in for about 3 days. After 74 hours and 53 minutes the Kill A Watt meter registered 3.96 kwh. Here’s how I determined the watts consumed by my refrigerator per year:
The mini-fridge I have states the following as it's maximum power usage: 120 Volts @ 60Hz, and 0.75A The formula for power (watts) is: W = V * I However this is an AC system so you are actually computing VA (volt-amperes), but the difference in this case is negligible. 
Refrigerators are a big chunk of home energy use. In most homes the refrigerator is the second-largest user of electricity (13.7%), right after the air conditioner (14.1%). (Dept. of Energy) With most appliances you save energy by using them less, but you can't very well do that with your fridge. A 1986-era 18 c.f. fridge uses 1400 kWh a year, while a modern energy-efficient model uses only 350 kWh — a whopping 75% reduction. At 15 kWh, trading in a pre-1986 fridge for a new efficient one would save about $158 a year in electricity costs.
Reasons for High Energy Use. On average, a standard model mini fridge uses roughly 230 kilowatt-hours per year, as much as many Energy Star rated full-sized refrigerators. The amount of energy a mini fridge consumes is due in large part to poor insulation and lack of cooling features. With the number of variables that factor into appliance energy consumption, it is difficult to predict how much energy a mini fridge may use. However, there are ways to estimate energy use and cost based on the wattage ratings of appliances.
My refrigerator has a 500 watt compressor that runs about one fifth of the time. I am paying $0.13 per kilowatt hour. For example, I plugged my Kill A Watt meter into my Maytag 18.5 refrigerator and left it in for about 3 days. After 74 hours and 53 minutes the Kill A Watt meter registered 3.96 kwh. Here’s how I determined the watts consumed by my refrigerator per year:
