Each product has it's own set of ingredients, so you have to check to see if it has these items in it. I can't remember if jelly beans have actual gelatin, if so most vegans won't eat is, as gelatin is made from an animal product. I think twizzlers are fine, as are most candies. Rice-yes.

Protein is an important nutrient for skin, bone, muscle, and organ health. Since vegans do not eat meat, eggs, or dairy products that are rich in protein, they must eat a variety of plant-based foods to meet their daily protein requirements.
Vegan diets can obtain all the essential nutrients by eating plant-based foods. Veganism is a strict type of vegetarianism that excludes meat and all animal products. Vegans do not eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, or any foods containing them.
Vegans eat a wide variety of plant-based foods, including vegetables, fruits, grains, beans, nuts and seeds. These foods can include the obvious (salads, hummus, veggie burgers, pasta) and the not-so-obvious (vegan mac & cheese, Creole style seitan, tofu satay in coconut sauce, vegan chocolate chip bacon cookies).
A vegan diet relies on plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. A vegan diet can be a healthful and nutritionally adequate diet; however, a vegan must make sure they eat enough foods with protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids.
It's true. Calcium from animals is not as digestible as calcium from plants, so you don't absorb as much calcium from milk and dairy as from vegetables, beans, grains, and fruits. Healthy vegans eat a variety of different types of food, and therefore, they definitely can eat enough calcium.
vegetarians can eat any chocolate, unless it's some crazy type I've never heard of that contains gelatin. vegans can eat dairy-free chocolate which is very easy to get. A lot of dark chocolate is vegan, and there are some brands of soy milk chocolate or rice milk chocolate.
Veganism is a type of vegetarian diet that excludes meat, eggs, dairy products and all other animal-derived ingredients. Many vegans also do not eat foods that are processed using animal products, such as refined white sugar and some wines.
Some vegan foods that are high in protein include soybeans, soy-based meat substitutes, soy milk, tofu, black beans, chickpeas, lentils, almonds, peanut butter, other nuts and seeds, and whole grain products.
