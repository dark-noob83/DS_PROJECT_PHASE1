Table of Equivalence of Calcium ions in DBL ™ Calcium Gluconate Injection BP mmol mEq mg per mL 0.22 0.45 8.9 per 10 mL 2.2 4.5 89 The dose of calcium is dependent on the requirements of the individual patient. The usual initial dose for elevating serum calcium is 7 to 14 mEq for adults. Doses may be repeated every one to three days if necessary. In hypocalcaemic tetany, doses of 4.5 to 16 mEq may be administered until response occurs. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 15g of calcium gluconate (67.5 mEq of calcium ion). For children and infants, initial doses of 1 to 7 mEq and less than 1 mEq respectively, are usually used to elevate serum calcium. If needed, doses may be repeated every one to three day
1 IV: 1-2 g over 2 hours. 2  Without seizure or tetany: 0.5 mg/kg/hr IV; may be increased to 2 mg/kg/hr; not to exceed 3-4 g IV over 4 hours. 3  Hypocalcemic tetany: 100-300 mg elemental calcium (~3 g calcium gluconate) IV over 5-10 minutes, followed by continuous IV infusion at 0.5 mg/kg/hr (may be increased to 2 mg/kg/hr). Hydrofluoric Acid Burn (Off-label). Topical: Use 2.5% gel, placing in glove to apply to hand; if gel unavailable, prepare with 10% calcium gluconate solution in 3 times volume of KY gel. Subcutaneous: 10% calcium gluconate, no more than 0.5 mL/cm² of skin; do not use in digits. If topical and/or subcutaneous do not work, consider intra-arterial
1 Hypocalcemic tetany: 100-300 mg elemental calcium (~3 g calcium gluconate) IV over 5-10 minutes, followed by continuous IV infusion at 0.5 mg/kg/hr (may be increased to 2 mg/kg/hr). 2  Monitor serum calcium q4-6hr to maintain serum calcium levels. Hydrofluoric Acid Burn (Off-label). Topical: Use 2.5% gel, placing in glove to apply to hand; if gel unavailable, prepare with 10% calcium gluconate solution in 3 times volume of KY gel. Subcutaneous: 10% calcium gluconate, no more than 0.5 mL/cm² of skin; do not use in digits. If topical and/or subcutaneous do not work, consider intra-arterial

Guidelines for the Use of Calcium Gluconate 10% (1ml = 0.46 mEq elemental Ca = 9.3 mg elemental Ca) Recommended Neonatal Dose, Route, and Interval 1. Maintenance IV drip: 2 - 4 mEq/kg/day 2. Treatment for hyperkalemia with significant EKG changes: 0.5 mEq/kg/dose (~1 ml/kg/dose) over IV 5-10 minutes 4. Exchange Transfusion: If signs of citrate toxicity occur, give 100 mg (1ml) IV for each 100 ml of blood exchanged.
Calcium gluconate is a calcium supplement listed in the 2004 WHO Model Formulary as a complementary drug for the treatment of hypocalcaemic tetany. No other calcium supplements are listed for this (or any other) indication. Product and Dosage Calcium gluconate is listed as a solution for intravenous injection. Adult dosage for the treatment of hypocalcaemic tetany is 1 g (2.2 mmol) by slow intravenous injection, followed about 4 g (8.8 mmol) daily by continuous intravenous infusion. 1 Supplementation should be continued till serum calcium is within the normal range. No dosage is given for children.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. Calcium Gluconate should be administered intravenously either directly or by infusion. The dose is dependent upon the individual requirements of the patient. Calcium Gluconate may also be administered by intermittent infusion at a rate not exceeding 200 mg/min, or by continuous infusion.
