Neurochemical Factors in Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar disorder is primarily a biological disorder that occurs in a specific area of the brain and is due to the dysfunction of certain neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers, in the brain.
And while the causes of bipolar disorder are still unknown, there are a number of factors that are believed to play a role, including genetics, brain chemicals, environmental factors and sometimes medical illnesses.
The cause of bipolar disorder is unclear but hereditary, biological. and psychological factors may playa part. For example, the incidence of bipolar disorder among relatives of affected patients is higher than in the general population, and highest among maternal relatives.
Researchers have discovered that some people with bipolar disorder have: 1  biochemical imbalances of hormones and certain neurotransmitters in the brain; especially dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. 2  1. 3  an over-secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone.
The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: 1  Biological differences. 2  People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. 3  The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. 4  Neurotransmitters.
Experts believe bipolar disorder is partly caused by an underlying problem with specific brain circuits and the balance of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Three brain chemicals -- noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine -- are involved in both brain and bodily functions.
There may be no single cause of bipolar disorder (aka manic depression). Instead, research indicates the causes of bipolar disorder are probably a combination of biochemical, genetic and environmental factors that may trigger and perpetuate the chemical imbalances in the brain.
