Enjoy grilled cheese without the bread -- it's the best way to eat it in the summertime. And not just any cheese, but halloumi. Halloumi is a semi-hard cheese made from a mixture of sheep, goat and cow's milk that's popular in Cypriot cuisine. (Cypriot is a blend of Greek, Turkish, Italian and Middle Eastern foods.).
Halloumi is a Cypriot, semi-hard, unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk. It is a versatile kind of cheese because it has a high melting point. For this reason, it can be grilled or fried, or, in addition, it can be eaten fresh with fruits or vegetables, or served grated on pasta.
Halloumi. Halloumi is a Cypriot firm, brined, slightly springy white cheese, traditionally made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk, although these days cowâ€™s milk is also used. Its texture is similar to that of mozzarella or thick feta, except that it has a strong, salty flavour imbibed from the brine preserve.
How to cook Halloumi cheese: Try Halloumi grilled, pan-fried or thinly sliced. Try it instead of mozzarella in a caprese salad, or serve it with watermelon, as is traditional in Cyprus.
