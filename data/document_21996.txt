The cost of long term care varies greatly, depending on the type of care, the place provided, and the region where you receive your care. For instance, the average hourly cost of home care ranges from $15 per hour in Montgomery, Alabama, to $24 per hour in Hartford, Connecticut. Nursing home care costs vary from $148 per day in Shreveport, Louisiana, to $462 in New York City for a semiprivate room.
Although the average cost is more than $50,000 a year and climbing, it can vary widely depending on where you live. Employee health insurance does not pay for nursing home care. About a third of nursing home residents pay all of their nursing home costs from their own funds.
The cost of living at a nursing home has soared to a new high of more than $80,000 per year. Over the past five years, the median annual cost of private nursing home care has jumped 24% from $67,527 to $83,950, according to Genworth's 2013 Cost of Care Survey, based on data from nearly 15,000 long-term care providers. From 2012 to 2013 alone, the price climbed 4%.
The cost of at-home care, such as home health aides or homemakers, is rising at a much slower pace. Hiring a homemaker, who typically assists seniors with cleaning, cooking and transportation, currently costs a median $41,756 per year -- up just 1% from last year and a mere 4% increase from five years ago.
The average cost of a nursing home private room tops $83,000 a year. With nursing home costs rising about 4 percent a year and 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day, it is clear the future costs to Medicaid will rise significantly.
