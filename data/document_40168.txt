Alfred Wegener was the scientist who proposed the Continental Drift Theory in the early twentieth century. Simply put, his hypothesis proposed that the continents had once been joined, and over time had drifted apart.
Evidence for continental drift. A map of the continents inspired Wegener's quest to explain Earth's geologic history. Trained as a meteorologist, he was intrigued by the interlocking fit of Africa's and South America's shorelines.
Continental Drift-Evidence. The evidence which gave rise to the theory of continental drift -- more correctly called plate tectonics -- includes the following: ► The coasts of the continents surrounding the Atlantic ocean could, if the continents were moved closer, fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Reconstruction of previous position continents created with TimeTrek. ► Living animals in widely separated lands are similar.
The theory of continental drift simply stated that continents drifted from one location to another over time. Wegener noticed that the coasts of South America and Africa seemed to fit together like a puzzle. Upon further investigation he noticed the following clues that he used to support his hypothesis.
The fist reason for continental drift is that the continents fit together like a puzzle. The second reason is the that on other continents there are the same plants and animal … s. The third reason is that the rocks are the same on each continent. The fouth reason is that the same ice is found on other continents.
