Gabapentin can be initiated at doses of 100 to 300 mg at bedtime or 100 to 300 mg three times daily. The dose should be titrated by 100 to 300 mg every 3 to 7 days as tolerated to a maximum dose of 3600 mg per day. The usual effective dose is 1800 mg to 3600 mg per day, which may take several weeks to achieve. A recent crossover design study compared nortriptyline (maximum dose of 100 mg daily), gabapentin (maximum dose of 3600 mg daily), and a combination of both in 56 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy or PHN. Participants received each treatment for 6 weeks followed by a one week taper and a one-week washout phase.
