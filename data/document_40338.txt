I just got a quote on a 1999 Accord: Timing Kit $222.10 (Belt Only $18.10) Water Pump $58.66 Anti Freeze $12.95 Labor $292.50. Total including water pump: $630.00 from Tilden Car Care. Most recommend replacing water pump because it has to be removed to do the timing belt anyway. It should cost about 75 dollars to replace a timing belt.
