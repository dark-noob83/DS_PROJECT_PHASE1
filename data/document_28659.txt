Annelids are segmented worms. The well developed coelom (fluid filled body cavity) acts as a hydrostatic skeleton with muscles of the body walls acting on it. The body segments of an annelid are partitioned by internal divisions called septa, giving independence of movement to each of them.
There are about 15,000 species in this phylum. The phylum includes earthworms, leeches, and marine worms known as polychaetes. Species in this phylum have metameric bodies. Metameric bodies are divided into segments called annuli. The annuli are covered in tiny hairs called setae. Setae help the worms move.
Body segmentation, a hallmark of annelids, was a major step in the evolution of animals. Annelids are protosomes, meaning they have a coelom made from cell masses. This coelom is divided into a series of repeated parts. This repetition is called metamerism, and each segment is called a metamere.
Annelids are of the three major phyla of protostomes. The name annelidia derives from annellus, which means little ring in Latin. The body of annelids is divided into segments that are separated by septa, and in many annelids, bristles called satae are attached to each segment. Respiration. Aquatic annelids often breathe through gills. Land-dwelling annelids, such as earthworms, take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide through their moist skin.
Annelida. The animals in the Annelida are segmented worms. They have no legs, and no hard skeleton. Unlike mollusks, annelid bodies are divided into many little segments, like rings joined together. There are many other kinds of worms, but only annelids are segmented this way.
