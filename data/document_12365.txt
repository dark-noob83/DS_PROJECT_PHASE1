Arizona has 3,666 species of native and naturalized plants in 1,003 genera and 145 families (Lehr and Pinkava, 1980). This rich variety of flora is equalled by few other regions of the United States. The composites, the grasses, and the legumes constitute the three largest families.
The pinyon-juniper woodland is a characteristic woodland community formed by Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma). In this community, Utah juniper often extends to lower elevations without the Colorado pinyon component, while Colorado pinyon grows at elevations above Utah juniper.
Singleleaf pinyon grows locally intermixed with Utah juniper, mostly in northwestern Arizona. Junipers commonly are dominant below 1,820 [...] 1,970 m (6,000 to 6,500 ft), while pinyon attain greatest size and density above 1,970 m (6,500 ft) (Lowe and Brown, 1973).
The city of Cedar City, UT and Cedar Breaks National Monument got their names because of these trees, which grow abundantly in Utah and do well in its alkaline soils. It is also the juniper that you are most likely to run into in Arizona, as well as finding it growing throughout the rest of the western United States. 1  Scientific Name: Juniperus osteosperma. 2  Synonyms include Juniperus utahensis and Sabina
Utah junipers grow less than 26.4 feet (8 m) and are often as short as 9.9 to 14.85 feet (3-4.5 m), with a trunk 4 to 7.5 inches (10-30 cm) thick. Sometimes the tree has multiple stems. In Arizona, Utah juniper occurs at 3,000 to 7,500 feet (909-2273 m), more commonly above 5,000 feet (1515 m).
Use medium-sized juniper shrubs as foundation plants or to form low or medium-tall hedges. Nick's Compact (Juniperus chinensis Nick's Compact) grows 2 1/2 feet high and spreads to about 6 feet in USDA zones 5 through 9.
