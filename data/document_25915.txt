Under this agreement, the regular rate will vary in overtime weeks. If the employee works 50 hours, the regular rate is $9.60 ($480 divided by 50 hours). In addition to the salary, half the regular rate, or $4.80, is due for each of the 10 overtime hours, for a total of $528 for the week. If the employee works 60 hours, the regular rate is $8.00 ($480 divided by 60 hours).
A. The average rate of pay is used to compute overtime. EXAMPLE: If an employee worked 16 hours at $10.00 per hour and 30 hours at $12.00 per hour the total straight time amount earned is $520.00. That amount is divided by total hours-worked (46), and the average hourly rate is $11.30.
Example: A non-exempt employee is paid a salary of $500 per week, and works 50 hours in a given week. Since the agreement is just that the employee will be paid a $500 salary, that sum would cover any number of hours worked. The regular rate for this week is the salary ($500) divided by the 50 hours worked, or $10.00. To pay overtime, the employer would divide the regular rate in half ($10.00 divided by 2, or $5.00), and then multiply that result by the 10 overtime hours. The overtime due for this week would be $50. The employee's gross wages for the week, including overtime, would be $550 (the $500 salary plus $50 in overtime pay).
The regular rate of pay for that week is $405 divided by 45, or $9.00 an hour. In addition to the straight-time pay, the employee is also entitled to $4.50 (half the regular rate) for each hour over 40 - an additional $22.50 for the 5 overtime hours-for a total of $427.50.
In the case of salaried employees, the maximum hours to be divided by, for most cases, is 40 hours. I will work a couple samples here to illustrate: The Simple Case: Let us say that an employee makes $70,000 a year and works 50 hours a week.
