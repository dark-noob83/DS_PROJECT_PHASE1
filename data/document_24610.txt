Warning. 1  When the prime rate is at 3.25 percent, that is the effective floor of the rate--unless the major banks change the way they calculate the prime rate. 2  From the 3.25 percent level, the prime rate can only stay level or go up.
Prime rate (or prime interest rate). The prime rate used to be defined as the interest rate at which banks lend to their most creditworthy (prime) customers. Now, it is simply an index that is 3 percentage points above the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve. Banks set their own rates, but tend to move in unison.
In the second, if the prime rate was 3.5 percent, your rate would be 7 percent. LIBOR rates are the most widely used in the world, with hundreds of trillions of dollars' worth of securities and loans indexed to them. LIBOR rates and the prime rate tend to move in the same direction -- but not always.
