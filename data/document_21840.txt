Best Answer: Here are some numbers. Since you can't compare a KFC chicken leg with the leg from a one-pound chicken, I also got the numbers for how many calories each would have in 100 grams.
A raw turkey leg, skin and meat, has 144 calories per 100 grams, which is roughly a 3 1/2-ounce serving. Roasted, each 100 grams measured after cooking, has 170 calories, meat and skin. If you remove the skin, a 100 gram serving has 159 calories, according to the USDA nutrient database.

One ounce of chicken skin alone has 90 calories, of which 73 are from fat. Meanwhile, one cup of broiled, skinless chicken breast meat contains only 220 total calories, with only 43 of those calories being from fat.
