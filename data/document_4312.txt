Motion Sensors. Honeywell’s field-proven wireless technology is an exciting new advance in security that provides the most reliable, convenient and cost effectivesolutions for security protection. 5800PIR-OD-Outdoor Wireless Motion Detector. 5800PIR Series-Wireless Motion Detectors.
The Motion Detector is used to measure position, velocity, and acceleration of moving objects.
Motion detection devices, such as PIR motion detectors, have a sensor that detects a disturbance in the infrared spectrum. Once detected, a signal can activate an alarm or a camera that can capture an image or video of the motioner.
The motion sensing feature on most lights (and security systems) is a passive system that detects infrared energy. These sensors are therefore known as PIR (passive infrared) detectors or pyroelectric sensors.
A motion detector is basically designed to detect motion or movement in a designated area and may instantly send a signal to the security alarm system.
Motion detectors are perhaps best recognized for their alarm system applications. They cover various “zones” throughout your home and subsequently trigger the alarm when movement is detected. But this is the 21st century, and motion detection has come a long way in recent years.
A motion detector is a device that detects moving objects, particularly people. A motion detector is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. Motion detectors form a vital component of security, automated lighting control, home control, energy efficiency, and other useful systems.
An electronic motion detector contains an optical, microwave, or acoustic sensor, and in many cases a transmitter for illumination. However, a passive sensor only senses a signal emitted by the moving object itself.
