Operating Costs. It costs 6-7 times more to operate a Gas Heater versus a heat pump. For example, to heat an average size residential pool, in South Florida to 88 degrees and keep it heated to that degree consistently throughout one year will cost approx $700.
Today, you'll find some gas pool heaters with 89%–95% efficiency. The following table shows how much you can save for every $1,000 in annual pool heating costs by installing a gas pool heater that's 95% efficient.
Pool heat pumps are an efficient, environmentally friendly way to heat a pool. Heat pumps can save pool owners money in the long run as they typically have a much lower annual operating costs than gas heaters and with proper maintenance, can last up to 10 years or more.
Upfront Costs. Though they are less expensive to operate, electric heat pump pool heaters cost more upfront than both gas and electric resistance heaters. Heat pumps can cost up to $5,000, while the majority of gas and electric resistance heaters are available for around $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. The cost for installing heat pumps and gas heaters averages about $300 to $500, including labor and materials.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, heating a pool with 1,000 square feet of surface area with an electric resistance or gas heater costs around $500 per month, compared with the much lower expenditure of roughly $100 for a heat pump.
You can figure about 1 gallon per hour per 100,000 BTU’s to operate a propane pool heater. For a typical 400,000 BTU heater, that’s 4 gallons per hour. Currently Propane runs about $2.50 per gallon, propane prices do fluctuate so keep an eye on this website updating the National Average Cost of Propane.
The low efficiency of gas heaters result in a high cost of operation. $1.00 worth of heat requires $1.20 or more of fuel. The typical pool averages $1000 to $1500 per year for heat with propane. Natural gas is approximately 50% less.
