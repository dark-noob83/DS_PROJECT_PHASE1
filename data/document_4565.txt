Asthma as a paradigm for autoimmune disease. Rottem M(1), Shoenfeld Y. Author information: (1)Division of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel. Allergy and autoimmunity result from dysregulation of the immune system.
Autoimmune disease is a last stage adaptation to an over active immune response. When the immune system is over stimulated in the initial stages it manifests with allergies.
Overview of Asthma. Asthma is a chronic lung disease where inflammation causes your airways to narrow. Even though asthma is not considered an autoimmune disease, it is a chronic illness which requires the same attention as any other chronic illness. If you have asthma and an autoimmune disease, it is important to keep both under control to prevent one disease from affecting the other.
Autoimmune diseases and allergies occur when the immune system attacks the body, as is the case in food allergies, asthma and celiac disease.
Asthma is usually treated with bronchodilators, allergies with antihistamines, and autoimmune diseases with drugs that are targeted to whatever organ system or systems are involved. Often the treatments have harsh side effects and do little to affect the underlying cause of the disorder.
1 Allergy and asthma-immune responses to substances that are usually not harmful. 2  Immune deficiency diseases-disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its parts. 3  Autoimmune diseases-diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body's cells and tissues by mistake.
Lupus. Systemic lupus erythematosis is an autoimmune disease that attacks body tissues, including the lungs, kidneys, and skin. Many types of auto-antibodies are found in the blood of people with lupus. No one knows exactly what causes autoimmune diseases, but many factors seem to be involved.
