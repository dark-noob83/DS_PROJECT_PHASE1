Sclerenchyma Mature sclerenchyma cells are dead and have secondary cell walls thickened with cellulose and usually impregnated with lignin. In contrast to collenchyma, which is pliable, sclerenchyma is elastic. The cell cavity or lumen is very small or it may disappear completely.
The sclerenchyma cells are usually elongated, with tapering ends. Such cells are commonly described as sclerenchyma fibres. In some cases, the cells are shorter and irregular in shape. Such cells are commonly described as sclereids or stone cells. Sclerenchyma is commonly described as a simple, dead, mechanical tissue. Sclerenchyma Fibres. The sclerenchyma cells are characterised by the presence of a thick cell wall. It is composed of a primary wall and a secondary wall. The primary wall is made up of cellulose while the secondary wall is made up of a very hard polysaccharide called lignin.
Definition of Sclerenchyma Cells. Plants are very different from the animals, humans, and other organisms we encounter on a daily basis. As humans, we depend on our skeletons for support and flexibility as well as our complex organs to perform life functions.
n. A supportive plant tissue that consists of thick-walled, usually lignified cells. Sclerenchyma cells are either fibers or sclereids. scle′ren·chym′a·tous (sklir′sklîr-ən′kĭm-ə, -təs′kī-) mə. adj
Plants, on the other hand, depend on their cells to be extremely specialized to perform their life functions. For example, since plants do not have bones for structure and support they must have cell walls around all of their cells. This leads to the need for very unique cells in plants.
Since plants do not have skeletons, they require cells that are bound together and have a strong outer layer known as a cell wall. Sclerenchyma cells are strong, thick, cells that provide most of the support in a plant. They are known to have extremely thick cell walls to provide structure for the growing plant.
