The lymphatic system includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels (a network of thin tubes that carry lymph and white blood cells, or leukocytes). Lymphatic vessels branch, like blood vessels, into all the tissues of the body. The lymphatic system has three main functions.
Nutrient Absorption. Most fats and fatty acids are actually absorbed in the lymphatic system first before being transported into the blood. The lining of your small intestine consists of villi, tiny, finger-shaped structures that project out. In the middle of each villi are tiny lymph vessels called lymph capillaries, or lacteals.
The second function of the lymphatic system is the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system and the subsequent transport of these substances to the venous circulation. The mucosa that lines the small intestine is covered with fingerlike projections called villi.
The second function of the lymphatic system is the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system, followed by transport of these fats to your blood circulation. The third function, and the most well-known function of the lymphatic system, is defense against disease.
After the fluid enters the lymph capillaries, it is called lymph. The second function of the lymphatic system is the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system and the subsequent transport of these substances to the venous circulation.
