The aging of the baby boomers is creating a dramatic shift in the age composition of the U.S. population. Projections of the entire older population (which includes the pre-baby-boom cohorts born before 1946) suggest that 71.4 million people will be age 65 or older in 2029.

Posted: 02/21/2012 10:52:58 AM MST. It's time to start planning about what to do when we Baby Boomers die off. That may seem distant, but it is not. For the past 20 years, the conversation has been about what society will do when the Baby Boom generation hits retirement age -- and that day is here. Each day, more than 10,000 of that generation reaches 65, and our systems are straining to keep up. If we planned for this retirement for 20 years, it is best to plan for the loss of this large segment of society over the next 20 years.
