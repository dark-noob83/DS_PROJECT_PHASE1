Incubation Period. Following the infective bite by the Anopheles mosquito, a period of time (the incubation period) goes by before the first symptoms appear. The incubation period in most cases varies from 7 to 30 days.
ANSWER: That depends on the species of malaria. Plasmodium falciparum has the shortest incubation time, typically 10 to 14 days. For P. vivax, incubation is usually between 10 to 17 days, but can be much longer (up to a year; the longest incubation time recorded for this species was 30 years!). P. ovale has an incubation period similar to that of P. vivax, and can also be dormant for many months or even years.
The time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) typically ranges from: 1  9 to 14 days for Plasmodium (P.) falciparum. 2  12 to 18 days for P. vivax and P. ovale. 3  18 to 40 days for P. malariae.
The infected person may feel normal from seven days to several years after infection; however, inside his or her body, the malaria parasites are multiplying. The period between infection with the parasites that cause the disease and the beginning of malaria symptoms is called the malaria incubation period.

Generally, the incubation period ranges from nine to 14 days for P. falciparum, 12-18 days for P. vivax, and 18-40 days for P. ovale.
