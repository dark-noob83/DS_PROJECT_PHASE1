Acral lentiginous melanoma becomes invasive when the melanoma cells cross the basement membrane of the epidermis and malignant cells enter the dermis. A rapidly-growing nodular melanoma can also arise within acral lentiginous melanoma and proliferate more deeply within the skin.
Though the specific cause of acral lentiginous melanoma is unknown, it's thought that melanoma develops when there are problems with the DNA that controls certain skin cells. In people with acral lentiginous melanoma, DNA is damaged and causes an overgrowth of the skin cells that produce skin pigment.
The cause of acral lentiginous melanoma is thought to be tied to the overproduction of certain skin cells called melanocytes, which are the cells that produce skin pigment. This cell overgrowth usually starts as a new skin lesion that's usually irregularly-shaped and may be tan, brown, or black.
