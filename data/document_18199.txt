the three types of rocks igneous sedimentary and metamorphic are all subject to processes that change one rock type into another the images below show several types of rocks undergoing these processes 
there are three basic types of rocks that planet earth is composed of igneous sedimentary and metamorphic follow these simple guidelines to determine the three types of rocks when looking at various types of rocks in the field metamorphic rocks metamorphic rocks are types of existing rocks that have been altered in form as a result of changes in heat and pressure in mountainous regions for example where rock matter is pressed and altered by plate tectonic activity metamorphic rocks are very common
rocks are categorized into three distinct types based on their method of formation the three types are igneous sedimentary and metamorphic early in earth s history all rock was igneous having formed from the cooling of melt on the surface an igneous rock is simply a rock that has solidified from magma or lava upon cooling a sedimentary rock is one that is formed by the accumulation of small to large sediment particles derived from all three types of rock and in some cases organic material and undergoes compaction cementation or evaporation from precipitation from a saturated mineral solution
sedimentary rocks are formed by the accumulation of sediments there are three basic types of sedimentary rocks clastic sedimentary rocks such as breccia conglomerate sandstone siltstone and shale are formed from mechanical weathering debris sedimentary rocks picture gallery of the most common rock types breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of large over two millimeter diameter angular fragments the spaces between the large fragments can be filled with a matrix of smaller particles or a mineral cement which binds the rock together
written for the kidsknowit network by brandon guymon there are three main types of rocks igneous sedimentary and metamorphic each of these types of rocks are formed in different ways and each type of rock can be changed into each of the other types of rock geologists call this process the rock cycle essentially the rock cycle is the process that makes and recycles rocks 
this fun lesson features three characters meta the metamorphic rock iggy the igneous rock and sid the sedimentary rock students explore characteristic of each type of rock play games fill out graphic organizers and answer interactive questions to learn about types of rock and the rock cycle 
igneous rocks igneous rocks form as a result of the cooling of magma when magma cools and solidifies underground the resulting igneous rock is plutonic these types of rocks may be surfaced through weathering processes or the movement of plate tectonics metamorphic rocks metamorphic rocks are types of existing rocks that have been altered in form as a result of changes in heat and pressure in mountainous regions for example where rock matter is pressed and altered by plate tectonic activity metamorphic rocks are very common
rocks can be put into three fundamentally different types igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rock igneous rocks are crystalline solids that form directly from cooling magma where magma is molten rock made by partial melting of rocks in the earth s interior sedimentary rocks are secondary rocks as they are formed from the accumulation of small pieces of pre existing rock that is parent rock there are two main types of sedimentary rocks based on the source of the sediment sedimentary rock can form as solid particles from weathered rocks
