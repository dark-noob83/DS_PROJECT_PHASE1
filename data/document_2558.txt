Top 10 facts about the world. Grappa is an Italian alcohol which is made by distilling pomace, the leftovers of winemaking. The name is in fact a reference to this, as it means “grape stems” in an Italian dialect. Many winemaking nations have their own versions of this drink, and they tend to be very strong, fiery, and incredibly diverse. Grappa is traditionally served at a cool temperature, with many people erring on the side of serving it too cold, because it can always be warmed with the hands until it releases its rich aroma. Typically, it is offered in a tulip shaped glass, and it may be drunk alone, or consumed with fruits, cheeses, and desserts.
Grappa is an alcoholic beverage, a fragrant, grape-based pomace brandy of Italian origin that contains 35 to 60 percent alcohol by volume (70 to 120 US proof).

The flavour of grappa, like that of wine, depends on the type and quality of the grapes used, as well as the specifics of the distillation process. Grappa is made by distilling the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems (i.e., the pomace) left over from winemaking after pressing the grapes. It was originally made to prevent waste by using these leftovers. A similar drink, known as acquavite d'uva, is made by distilling whole must.

Best Answer: A simple analogy...if brandy were the same as a steak, grappa would be like sausage. Not that this is bad, just different. Brandy is distilled wine. Grappa is distilled from all the bits that are taken out of wine after the first part of fermentation...the stems, seeds, skins, pulp, etc (called pomace). Kind of like how sausage is made from all the cuts of meat and other bits that are trimmed from steak. Some of which are on par (quality wise) with a find brandy. Grappa is usually not aged so it's clear and colorless. It is a strong spirit that, because of being distilled from the pomace, carries more intense flavors from the grapes. To many, this tastes harsh when compared to vodka or even brandy.
a monovitigno grappa from Nonino. The main ingredient of grappa is pomace, which consists of the grape skins, seeds and stalks that are left over from the winemaking process. These are taken through a second process of distillation, which extracts the remaining flavours from the pomace before the waste is discarded. The grappa is then either bottled at once, which creates white grappa (grappa bianca), or aged in wooden casks to create the yellow or brown-hued grappa known as riserva. Grappa can either be made from a mixture of pomaces from different sources, or from one grape variety.
Grappa is made by heating the pomace, causing it to produce steam, and then forcing the steam through a distillation column. Freshly distilled grappa is colorless, with a strong odor of alcohol, and the alcohol content can vary from around 40 to 80% alcohol by volume. Grappa is traditionally served at a cool temperature, with many people erring on the side of serving it too cold, because it can always be warmed with the hands until it releases its rich aroma. Typically, it is offered in a tulip shaped glass, and it may be drunk alone, or consumed with fruits, cheeses, and desserts.
Grappa is a uniquely Italian drink. Traditionally made from pomace, the discarded grape seeds, stalks and stems that are a by-product of the winemaking process, Grappa has been around since the Middle Ages. Grappa's popularity has spread all around the globe. Once unknown outside of Italy, today Grappa is being produced all over the world, from Oregon to South Africa. These outposts use the indigenous grapes of their regions, such as Oregon's Pinot Noir, creating unique and tasty variations on the Italian theme.
Grappa is a crystal clear distilled liquid that packs a punch made from the leftovers of the winemaking process. After the grapes are pressed and the juice is drained off to ferment into wine, the leftover skins and seeds, called pomace, are made into Grappa.
