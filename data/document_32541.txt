Maltese Yorkie puppies have a very soft coat that is hypoallergenic and non-shedding. Because they are a cross between a white dog (Maltese) and a black and tan dog (Yorkshire), their colors vary greatly.
This hybrid was originally called the Yorktese, but is now more commonly called the Morkie. The Morkie is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Yorkie and the Maltese.
The term “teacup” simply refers to Yorkies that are smaller than normal. Biewer Terriers are considered by some breeders to be a separate breed from Yorkshire Terriers.

Maltese Yorkie puppies are half Maltese and half Yorkshire terrier. They are most commonly referred to as Morkies, though they have also been called Yorkteses. If you are thinking of adding this new furry companion to your life, this information will be helpful in making your decision.
