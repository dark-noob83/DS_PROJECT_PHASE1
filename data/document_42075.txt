If your puppy wants to sleep, let him sleep. Your puppy needs 18 to 20 hours of sleep a day. He'll get some of this sleep during the day in the form of short naps. You should establish a bedtime routine, however, so that as your puppy grows into an adult dog he learns to get most of his sleep at night.

Re: How much should a puppy sleep. Dogs 'need' an average of 10.8 hours of sleep a day but will usually sleep 16-18 hours out of 24. That of course varies slightly day to day.
Something to remember about puppies is that they need sleep-lots of it, just like babies. Your puppy will need about 18-19 hours sleep in every 24. So only expect 4 to 5 hours of being awake and only about an hour at a time. If they're kept awake and playing, you could both be heading for a stressful time.
How much should a puppy sleep. I adopted a Eskimo Spitz/Collie mix who is now 3m old. I am wondering what the average amount a puppy sleeps in a 24 hour time period. We get up about 7am and I walk her she plays for a few hours then sleeps about 2 or 3 hours in the early afternoon she is up from approx 5p until we got to bed between 10 and 11.
