The length of your stride depends on your height, your fitness level and your body's individual biomechanics. Regardless of the length of your stride, a faster stride rate of 180 to 200 steps per minute may be the best way to improve your running performance. Men also had a longer average stride during shorter distances, covering an average of 7 feet 9 inches with each stride in the 800 meters and an average of 6 feet 8 inches in the 10k. Additional analysis of stride length in sprinters found average length was dependent on height.
While averages can be useful, it's fairly simple to find your own stride length. One way is to walk 10 steps, measure the distance from the starting and stopping point, then divide the number by 10. For example, if you travel 290 inches in 10 steps, you average 29 inches per step, which is about 2.4 feet. Another method is to step in a puddle of water, walk 10 steps and measure the stride length between three wet steps. Average those distances to find your average stride rate.
If you are an average American woman of 5 feet, 4 inches in height, or 64 inches, you can anticipate that your length per stride will be in the range of 73 to 86 inches. They found a slightly shorter stride length associated with faster times in the 100 meters. The competitors measured right around 2 meters -- 80 inches or so -- or longer in terms of stride length. The height of the competitors ranged from 160 to 164 cm in height, or 5 feet, 3 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches tall.
Stride length is measured from heel to heel and determines how far you walk with each step. On average, a man's walking stride length is 2.5 feet, or 30 inches, according to Arizona State University Extension. A woman's average stride length is 2.2 feet, or 26.4 inches, reports the school. In general, people with longer legs have a greater stride length than those with shorter legs. For example, if you travel 290 inches in 10 steps, you average 29 inches per step, which is about 2.4 feet. Another method is to step in a puddle of water, walk 10 steps and measure the stride length between three wet steps. Average those distances to find your average stride rate.
In this activity you should have found this hypothesis to be pretty accurate. On average, adults have a step length of about 2.2 to 2.5 feet. In general, if you divide a person's step length by their height, the ratio value you get is about 0.4 (with a range from about 0.41 to 0.45). 
Average stride length: 2.2 feet for women and 2.5 feet for man or you can estimate stride length relative to your height (females: height x .413 equals your stride length; males: height x .415 equals your stride length). The average stride length for men is 0.78 m and 0.7 m for women. An approximation to your personal walking stride is multiplying your height with 0.415 (or 0.413 for women).
Step 2. Determine your stride length using your height. While this is not as accurate as some other methods, it can give you a close estimate of your stride length. For women, simply multiply 0.413 by your height in centimeters. Men should multiply 0.415 by their height in centimeters. Some models ask for users to input their height and weight, which will determine your estimated stride length for you. Step 4. Determine your estimated stride by using the average stride lengths for men and women. An average man's stride length is 78 centimeters, while a woman's average stride length is 70 centimeters. Step 5. Measure your stride length by marking off a 50-foot-long area on a sidewalk or in your driveway, using a piece of chalk. Walk from one end of this area to the other, while counting your step
This means that for the average person, the approximate distance from the initial point of contact of your left heel and the initial point of contact of your right heel is about 32 inches. The average stride length, or two steps, is about 62 inches, or a little more than 5 feet. The American College of Sports Medicine reports that there are approximately 2,000 steps in one mile, so the average step length is 2.6 feet or about 31 inches.
Multiply your height in inches by 0.413. This is a predetermined number that figures out average stride length. Then convert your stride length back to feet for the next step. (63 inches x 0.413 = 26.019 inches per stride. 26.019 inches/12 inches per foot = 2.16825 feet per stride.). 3. Find How Many Steps You Walk In A Mile. Divide 5,280 by your average stride length in feet. (5,280/2.16825 feet = 2,435 steps per mile.). Remember, stride length changes based on speed, but both of these ways provide approximate calculations to help you figure out the number of steps you take in a mile. Since there are 5,280 feet in a mile, divide 5,280 by your average stride length in feet. (5,280/Average Stride Length In Feet = Your Number of Steps Per Mile.). Option 2: Use the Formula. This method may not be as accurate as measuring your exact steps. Iâ€™ll use my height as an example.
