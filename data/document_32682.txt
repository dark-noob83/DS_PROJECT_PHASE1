Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). A person who has hearing within the normal range can hear sounds that have frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz. The most important sounds we hear every day are in the 250 to 6,000 Hz range. Speech includes a mix of low and high frequency sounds:
For a person with normal hearing, when it comes to pitch the human hearing range starts low at about 20 Hz. That’s about the same as the lowest pedal on a pipe organ. On the other side of the human hearing range, the highest possible frequency heard without discomfort is 20,000Hz. While 20 to 20,000Hz forms the absolute borders of the human hearing range, our hearing is most sensitive in the 2000 - 5000 Hz frequency range. As far as loudness is concerned, humans can typically hear starting at 0 dB.
The human range is commonly given as 20 to 20,000 Hz, though there is considerable variation between individuals, especially at high frequencies, and a gradual loss of sensitivity to higher frequencies with age is considered normal. Sensitivity also varies with frequency, as shown by equal-loudness contours. Their hearing range varies by species; at the lowest it can be 1 kHz for some species and for other species the highest reaches up to 200 kHz. Bats that can detect 200 kHz cannot hear very well below 10 kHz. In any case, the most sensitive range of bat hearing is narrower: about 15 kHz to 90 kHz.
The human voice and the human ear are a precisely tuned set of instruments. Theoretically, the human ear can hear from 20 hertz (Hz) to 20,000 Hz, but is most sensitive in the range of 300 Hz and 3000 Hz; a person with normal hearing should be able to distinguish more than 250,000 separate sounds. 
Humans cannot hear sounds of every frequency. The range of hearing for a healthy young person is 20 to 20,000 hertz. The hearing range of humans gets worse with age. People lose the ability to hear sounds of high frequency as they get older.
Audible Range of Human Hearing – The average person has a normal hearing range that falls between 20Hz on the low side and approximately 20,000 Hz on the high side. As we age the overall perceivable range of sound decreases especially in the higher frequencies. Frequency is measured using the Hz symbol meaning Hertz. The chart above shows a total span of frequencies from 20 Hz to 130,000 Hz. Noting that the limitation of the range of human hearing is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz one can easily see that frequencies exist outside of our capability to hear them.
The typical range of human hearing for a child is approximately 20 Hz to 20 KHz, but very few of us over 18 years of age can hear 20 kHz, I do a lot of noise induced hearing loss training and run experiments with guys in the class. Most are lucky to still be playing above about 14 kHz and several below that. 
The commonly stated range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Under ideal laboratory conditions, humans can hear sound as low as 12 Hz. Humans are most sensitive to (i.e. able to discern at lowest intensity) frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 Hz. Their hearing range varies by species; at the lowest it can be 1 kHz for some species and for other species the highest reaches up to 200 kHz. Bats that can detect 200 kHz cannot hear very well below 10 kHz. In any case, the most sensitive range of bat hearing is narrower: about 15 kHz to 90 kHz.
Ear cannot respond to all frequencies in an unbiased manner. Audible range of human being is commonly quoted as from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, which in fact will vary with age, health, past exposure to noises, and so forth. Ear also acts like a filter and will favour certain frequencies over the others
Frequency is measured in hertz. The hertz, Hz, is the derived SI unit of frequency. The frequency of a sound wave determines its tone and pitch. The frequency range of a young person is about 20 to 20,000 hertz. The human ear is capable of hearing many of the sounds produced in nature, but certainly not all. The range of hearing for a healthy young person is 20 to 20,000 hertz. The hearing range of humans gets worse with age. People lose the ability to hear sounds of high frequency as they get older.
