When did the Chernobyl accident occur and in what country did it take place?   The disaster occurred on On 26 April 1986 at 01:23:40 a.m, in the then USSR, It is now located in Ukraine, a former soviet state. It leaked 100 times the radiation than the two bombs dropped on Japan. Chernobyl is a nuclear power plant that it's reactor 4 e … xploded.It is located in Pripyat, urkrain. It happened August 27, 1987.
At the time of the accident--April 26, 1986--the Chernobyl nuclear power station consisted of four operating 1,000-megawatt power reactors sited along the banks of the Pripyat River, about sixty miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine, the fertile grain-producing region of the southwestern USSR. 
Thousands of people each year visit the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where the world's worst nuclear disaster took place in April 1986, and the 30-km zone around it that remains uninhabited. An aerial view of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, is shown in this May 1986 photo made a few days after the April 26 explosion in Chernobyl, Ukraine.
On April 26, 1986, a series of explosions destroyed Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 station and several hundred staff and firefighters tackled a blaze that burned for 10 days and sent a plume of radiation around the world in the worst-ever civil nuclear disaster.

Chernobyl was a nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union. On 26 April 1986, it suffered a massive failure which caused it to spread radioactive waste across large parts … of Europe.    The accident began with a steam explosion that caused a fire, more explosions, and a subsequent nuclear meltdown. 
Chernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident occurred on April 26, 1986. It was the largest nuclear energy disaster in history. The explosion took place in the fourth block of the Chernobyl power plant, located only 120 km from the capital of Ukraine – Kiev, close to the border with Belarus. Chernobyl power plant was at that time one of the largest in the world. It was dedicated to a strategic military program for the Soviet army.
Construction of the sarcophagus (cover) over the destroyed Chernobyl reactor. On April 26, 1986, a major accident occurred at Unit 4 of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl, Ukraine, in the former USSR. On 22 December 1988, Soviet scientists announced that the sarcophagus now enclosing the reactor was designed for a lifetime of only 20 to 30 years. Three years after the nuclear accident, the Soviet government halted construction of the fifth and sixth reactor units at the Chernobyl nuclear power complex.
Four hundred times more radioactive material was released from Chernobyl than by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The disaster released 1/100 to 1/1000 of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the 1950s and 1960s. The Chernobyl power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first 60–75 seconds of a total loss of electric power, and thus lacked an important safety feature.
