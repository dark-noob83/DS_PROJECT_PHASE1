A: Costs vary depending upon the well depth, diameter, location, and other factors. A shallow driven well may be plugged for as little as $50. The average cost for plugging a well in Michigan is $500. Your costs may be reduced by having your old well plugged at the time the replacement well is drilled or at the time you connect to municipal water service.
Demonstration pr ojects approved under the PDEGP will allow SWCDs to expend as much as $5,000 for well abandonment. Under this option, 100% of the expenses for a field day for water well sealing demonstrations could be covered. However, total project and field day costs may not to exceed the $7,500 PDEGP maximum limit. Cost-share cannot exceed $500 or 80% of the actual cost, whichever is less.

If your estimate is only $600.00 to properly abandon the well, and your income reduction is $750.00, you should not apply because your abandonment cost is less than the income reduction, therefore you will not be getting a reimbursement check. The DNR will cover eligible costs up to the invoice amount, less the 25 percent cost-share requirement. Well abandonment work must be done according to DNR specifications and the unused private well must be properly abandoned and filled by a licensed well driller or pump installer before payment will be made.
1 Drilling the well hole, installing the casing (a tubular lining that prevents the well hole from collapsing) and adding a well cap (a tight-fitting, vermin-proof top seal) typically costs $15-$30 per foot, or $1,500-$3,000 for a 100' deep well, and $6,000-$12,000 for a 400' well. 1 The well driller should provide a written contract listing the work to be done and the specific costs, including potential fees for drilling deeper or drilling a second well if the first must be abandoned. 2  Foster Water Well Drilling in California explains how to hire a water well contractor.

6. How much will it cost to have my well filled & sealed? It would be approximately $1000 to fill and seal a 100-foot deep 6-inch diameter well with bentonite chips, remove the pump and piping, and file the report. It would be approximately $1600 if that same well were 200 feet deep. A 2-inch diameter 50-foot well would cost approximately $300 to fill and seal. Grant funding may be available to assist with the cost of filling and sealing private wells through the Department of Natural Resources Well Abandonment Grant program. 
Abandonment costs are costs associated with the abandonment of a business venture. This term traditionally applied to the process of abandoning an under-producing or non-producing oil or gas well. The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the United States is about $5000 (~Texas average cost in year 2000).
Example of income reduction. Your family income is $47,500 for both you and your spouse. Your licensed well driller has given you an estimate that the proper well abandonment will cost $600. Your family income is $47,500 - minus the maximum base allowed, without income reduction, is $45,000. The difference is $2,500 - this number multiplied by .30 (30 percent) is $750.00, or your income reduction. The DNR will cover eligible costs up to the invoice amount, less the 25 percent cost-share requirement. Well abandonment work must be done according to DNR specifications and the unused private well must be properly abandoned and filled by a licensed well driller or pump installer before payment will be made.
1 This brings the typical total for drilling a well and setting up a private water delivery system to $3,500-$20,000 or more, but an especially deep and difficult well with a complex water system can cost $20,000-$50,000 or more, depending on depth, water yield and system complexity. 1 The well driller should provide a written contract listing the work to be done and the specific costs, including potential fees for drilling deeper or drilling a second well if the first must be abandoned. 2  Foster Water Well Drilling in California explains how to hire a water well contractor.
It is occasionally referred to as Removal and Abandonment or R & A. The objective of well abandonment is to ensure that no hydrocarbons leak into surface water or into the atmosphere. The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the United States is about $5000 (~Texas average cost in year 2000). If a well has developed a leak that allows gas to flow up the outside of the well casing, finding and correcting the leak can push the cost of abandonment beyond $100,000
