When the box arrived on December 1st, Anthony was so excited to have a package from Santa! When he opened the box he found the elf, a letter from Santa and the Elf on the Shelf book – initially he was not sure what to think about all this. Then he read his letter from Santa to us… (letter is shown below).
Elf on the Shelf {The First Arrival}. We really were not sure if we wanted to jump on the elf bandwagon, however after dragging our feet for years, we took the plunge this year. After doing some research about how to get started with the elf, I found this site on Pinterest, where an elf was first introduced to a family.
My daughter is only 1 1/2 years old, but we have an elf on the shelf and we had it last year for her first Christmas as well.
I'm so excited. My elf on the shelf arrived today. I totally wasn't expecting it. I wrote a letter to Santa yesterday and today I found this wrapped up on my door step. Eeekkk so excited. I named my elf today.
In order to restore the powers of a shelf elf, you must place him on a new shelf with a cookie and a glass of milk for the night.
Sometimes, the Elf on the Shelf will come back Thanksgiving Night.
When does your Elf on the shelf arrive. We have been doing the elf on the shelf for 2 years and he has arrived a different day both years. At first he came the morning of St. Nick but then the next year he came December 1. Just wondering when others have him come.
In October 2013, The Elf on the Shelf: A Birthday Tradition was released. Written and illustrated by the same team that created the first book, it offers instructions for inviting a scout elf to visit for a child's birthday party and describes how the elf decorates a chair for the child.
