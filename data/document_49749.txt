A wind turbine is designed to produce power over a range of wind speeds. All wind turbines are designed for a maximum wind speed, called the survival speed, above which they will be damaged. The survival speed of commercial wind turbines is in the range of 40 m/s (144 km/h, 89 MPH) to 72 m/s (259 km/h, 161 MPH). The most common survival speed is 60 m/s (216 km/h, 134 MPH).
Most large turbines produce their maximum power at wind speeds around 15 meters per second (33 mph). Considering steady wind speeds, it's the diameter of the rotor that determines how much energy a turbine can generate. Keep in mind that as a rotor diameter increases, the height of the tower increases as well, which means more access to faster winds. At 33 mph, most large turbines generate their rated power capacity, and at 45 mph (20 meters per second), most large turbines shut down. To calculate the amount of power a turbine can actually generate from the wind, you need to know the wind speed at the turbine site and the turbine power rating.
Typical modern wind turbines have diameters of 40 to 90 metres (130 to 300 ft) and are rated between 500 kW and 2 MW. As of 2014 the most powerful turbine, the Vestas V-164, is rated at 8 MW and has a rotor diameter of 164m. All wind turbines are designed for a maximum wind speed, called the survival speed, above which they will be damaged. The survival speed of commercial wind turbines is in the range of 40 m/s (144 km/h, 89 MPH) to 72 m/s (259 km/h, 161 MPH). The most common survival speed is 60 m/s (216 km/h, 134 MPH).
Figure 6 compares wind speed and rotor speed for the same duration. Both graphs clearly show that there is severe over-regulation at wind speeds above 10 m/s that does not allow the wind turbine to reach its maximum power potential and it never reaches the rated speed of 5 rev/s (300 rpm). Both turbine rotational speed and wind speed measurements were sensed as low-frequency AC waveforms. The Proven turbine maximum rotation speed of 300 rpm with a four-pole permanent magnet alternator produces an AC frequency of 20 Hz. Similarly, the output frequency of the anemometer at 20 m/s is 25.7 Hz.
A Wind Turbine. The wind turbine uses wind to generate rotational power. It is low-torque, but high speed and only requires an open area. For maximum efficiency, 16 blocks of unobstructed space in front of it and an altitude of at least 128 blocks are required. 
The spring tension is factory-set to run at a maximum operating speed of 300 rpm (5 rev/s) at the rated 12 m/s wind speed and above. Wear at the spring mountings and loss of elasticity of the springs in use can cause stalling and coning to commence at lower wind speeds, reducing the maximum power output of the turbine. Both turbine rotational speed and wind speed measurements were sensed as low-frequency AC waveforms. The Proven turbine maximum rotation speed of 300 rpm with a four-pole permanent magnet alternator produces an AC frequency of 20 Hz. Similarly, the output frequency of the anemometer at 20 m/s is 25.7 Hz.
Onshore wind turbines are installed in low wind speed areas and getting higher and higher towers. Usual towers of multi megawatt turbines have a height of 70m to 120m and in extremes up to 160m. All turbines are rotating with a speed, that the blade tip speed reach 80 m/s to 90 m/s. Higher tip speeds means more noise and blade erosion.
The Vestas V164 has a rated capacity of 8.0 MW, has an overall height of 220 m (722 ft), a diameter of 164 m (538 ft), and is the world's largest-capacity wind turbine since its introduction in 2014. At least five companies are working on the development of a 10 MW turbine. Usual towers of multi megawatt turbines have a height of 70m to 120m and in extremes up to 160m. All turbines are rotating with a speed, that the blade tip speed reach 80 m/s to 90 m/s. Higher tip speeds means more noise and blade erosion.
