PayScale also found that there's a gender gap for tipping, with men being tipped less than women. In PayScale's sample, women earned $1 more per hour in tips, but men were paid $1 more in base pay—bringing both to about $13 for median pay per hour. That's still below the national median for hourly wage for all occupations, which is $16.87, but it's $4 more than the BLS median for waiters and waitresses.
Income and Qualifications. Most waitresses are paid by the hour and earn tips on top of their hourly wages. Average tips for a waitress are 15 to 20 percent of the total bill, according to iTipping.com. Therefore, a waitress that rings up $400 during a four-hour shift should make $60 to $80 in tips. Average hourly rates for waitresses were $9.95 as of May 2012, according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics -- or $20,710 per year. This equates to $1,725.83 per month.
For customers who have ever wondered how much staff at restaurants actually earn, new data has revealed on average, they receive a median salary of $13.30 an hour. That includes a base salary of $9.90 an hour and earning $3.40 an hour in tips.
But even though they earn a combination of hourly wages and tips, waiters and waitresses don’t make much money. According to the BLS, servers earned an average hourly wage of $10.04, or about $20,880 for the year. They made a median salary of $18,590 in 2013.
