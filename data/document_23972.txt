Microbe is a term for tiny creatures that individually are too small to be seen with the unaided eye. Microbes include bacteria (back-tear-ee-uh), archaea (are-key-uh), fungi (fun-jeye) and protists (pro-tists). You've probably heard of bacteria and fungi before.
Microorganisms make the world go â€˜round Microorganisms were the first living creatures on earth. It is estimated there are a total of 5 nonillion microorganisms on earth (5x1020). You will find nearly 10 million a millilitre of ocean water and 40 million in a gram of soil. They are also ubiquitous on the human body.
Bacteria fall into a category of life called the Prokaryotes (pro-carry-oats). Prokaryotes' genetic material, or DNA, is not enclosed in a cellular compartment called the nucleus. Bacteria and archaea are the only prokaryotes. All other life forms are Eukaryotes (you-carry-oats), creatures whose cells have nuclei.
Microorganisms are microscopic, living, single-celled organisms such as bacteria. Ubiquitous throughout the world, microorganisms play a vital role in supporting and maintaining nature and life. Although some bacteria are harmful, the vast majority are not harmful, but in fact beneficial.
Scientists argue a lot about whether viruses are in fact living organisms or just organic structures interacting with living organisms. Some properties of viruses make them seem alive like the fact that they have genetic material and that they make copies of themselves to reproduce.
Answer 3: Viruses are not considered alive because they lack many of the properties that scientists associate with living organisms. Primarily, they lack the ability to reproduce without the aid of a host cell, and don't use the typical cell-division approach to replication.
