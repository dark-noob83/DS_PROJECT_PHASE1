All rights reserved. The kidneys are a pair of organs located in the back of the abdomen. Each kidney is about 4 or 5 inches long -- about the size of a fist. The kidneys' function are to filter the blood. All the blood in our bodies passes through the kidneys several times a day. The kidneys remove wastes, control the body's fluid balance, and regulate the balance of electrolytes.
The kidneys are bean-shaped with the convex side of each organ located laterally and the concave side medial. The indentation on the concave side of the kidney, known as the renal hilus, provides a space for the renal artery, renal vein, and ureter to enter the kidney.
The kidneys are the waste filtering and disposal system of the body. As much as 1/3 of all blood leaving the heart passes into the kidneys to be filtered before flowing to the rest of the bodyâ€™s tissues.
Location. The kidneys are located on the posterior abdominal wall, with one on either side of the vertebral column, in the perirenal space. The long axis of the kidney is parallel to the lateral border of the psoas muscle.
The right kidney is located under the diaphragm and behind the liver. The left kidney is also located under the diaphragm but behind the spleen. Your kidneys are on your back sides just below your ribcage, yet above your waist.
