Dormancy is a kind of armored sleep that plants go through. A plant, bud, or seed that is “dormant” is not visibly active. It is in a waiting state, a kind of suspension of life until conditions are right for active growth. “Actively growing” is the opposite of “dormant.”.
For non-dormant seeds, germination starts when a seed is provided with water as long as the temperature is appropriate. The uptake of water by dry seed is called imbibition (imbibition means to drink: seeds imbibe water, you do not imbibe seeds).
For most plants, seeds are the primary means of reproduction. Dormancy allows seeds to separate from their mother plant and survive dispersal over distance and time before growth recommences. Developing embryos are growing tissues but enter dormancy late in maturation and seeds then dehydrate.
Answer by Cycling-rod. Confidence votes 4.8K. A seed can become dormant when water and warmth are not available. Cereal seeds found in a pyramid have been sprouted once put in contact with warmth and moisture.
MD and MPD are present in B-type seeds, but can also be typical of some specialized species (for the structural seed types see ' seed evolution webpage '). MD is thought to be the ancestral dormancy type among seed plants and is the most primitive dormancy class.
Seeds are designed to dry out which puts the embryonic plant into  dormancy. However some seeds also have a hard outer covering which  protects the seed and prevents water e … ntering the seed for many  years. Such seeds (eg the poppy) can have a dormancy exceeding 10s  of years.   Some seeds also need frost before they will germinate a process  called cold stratification. Others need fire to start the process.
