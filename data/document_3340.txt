The root hair cells has a special structure to help it absorb water  from the soil efficiently.   1. Elongated structure that protrudes out to the soil    - This i … s to increase the surface area to volume ratio; thereby  increasing the rate of uptake of water from the soil to the cell.    2.
Root hairs are highly specialized cells necessary for a vascular plant's ability to maintain its survival. A root hair is a tubular outgrowth of root epidermal cells of vascular plants. They are found only in the region of maturation of the root. Root hairs are a specialized form of rhizoid. Root hairs form an important surface over which plants absorb most of their water and nutrients. They are also directly involved in the formation of root nodules in legume plants. They have a large surface area, relative to the other cells, that help them absorb water and minerals more efficiently.
3. Cell sap    - The cell sap of the root hair cell has a lower water potential  than the water in the soil. Thus, the water from the soil moves  into the cell via osmosis.
Best Answer: Its root hairs increase the surface area for better absorption, it has a thin surface to allow minerals and water molecules to be absorbed quicker. It has a lower concentration of water and minerals than what is in the soil so diffusion can happen more efficiently.
Plant roots start out with undifferentiated cells as the new plant is developing, and those cells grow and differentiate into more specialized cell types. The root, cut in a cross section, reveals several different specialized layers with different kinds of cells.
1 Specialized Cells Plant’s and animal’s cells are specialized to carry their job efficiently.  2  Specialized cells are cells that have a particular adaptation to preform a special task. 3  3. 4  Animal Specialized Cells 1.
