1 If you eat ½-to-1½ grams of protein for every pound you weigh then protein will usually make up 25-to-50% of your diet (or your total daily calories) so if you weighed 200 pounds you would need to eat 100-to-300 grams of protein a day and…. 
So, how many grams of carbohydrates is that exactly? This is easy to determine when we know that 1 gram of carbohydrates equals 4 calories. Let’s say you need to consume 3,000 calories per day to build muscle. If carbohydrates make up 50% of your diet, you will need to consume 1,500 calories worth of carbohydrates. At 4 calories per gram, 1,500 divided by 4 would equal about 375 grams of carbohydrates every day. Your own caloric intake will vary a lot based on your own personal goal and BMR. If you are bulking, you will need to consume between 300-500 calories above your maintenance level. If you are cutting, this number will be 300-500 calories below your maintenance level. You can determine your maintenance level by reading my post on how many calories to build muscle.
Protein is an important component of weight gain diets, especially when you’re trying to increase your lean body mass. The Institute of Medicine encourages women to consume at least 46 grams and men to eat at least 56 grams of protein each day; pregnant and nursing women need at least 71 grams of protein every day. Carbohydrates make up the largest percentage of your diet, especially if you exercise regularly. The Institute of Medicine recommends adults consume a minimum of 130 grams of carbohydrates each day, and 45 to 65 percent of their daily energy intake from carbohydrates.
Well, those calories will all come from carbs. And, since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, you’d just need to divide this left over amount of calories by 4 to figure out exactly how many grams of carbs you’d need to eat each day.
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, when you’re trying to build muscle your protein requirements are 1.4 to 1.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, or about 0.64 to 0.82 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day. Carbohydrates make up the largest percentage of your diet, especially if you exercise regularly. The Institute of Medicine recommends adults consume a minimum of 130 grams of carbohydrates each day, and 45 to 65 percent of their daily energy intake from carbohydrates.
If you consume 3,000 calories daily, this means you should aim for between 1,650 and 1,800 daily calories of carbohydrates -- equal to 412 to 450 grams. To determine how many carbs to eat at each meal, take the total carbs needed per day and divide by the number of meals you eat -- usually four or five.
1 First you figured out how many calories you need to eat per day for your specific goal (losing fat, building muscle, or maintaining your current weight). 2  From there you figured out where those calories should come from each day by calculating your ideal daily intake of protein, fat and just now, carbs. And, since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, you’d just need to divide this left over amount of calories by 4 to figure out exactly how many grams of carbs you’d need to eat each day.
This is equivalent to consuming 94 to 125 grams of protein per day for a 2,500-calorie diet, and 131 to 175 grams of protein each day for a 3,500-calorie, weight-gain diet. Carbohydrates make up the largest percentage of your diet, especially if you exercise regularly. The Institute of Medicine recommends adults consume a minimum of 130 grams of carbohydrates each day, and 45 to 65 percent of their daily energy intake from carbohydrates.
This means you need 281 to 406 grams of carbohydrates per day when consuming a 2,500-calorie diet, and 394 to 569 grams of carbs each day when eating a 3,500-calorie, weight-gain meal plan. Carbohydrates make up the largest percentage of your diet, especially if you exercise regularly. The Institute of Medicine recommends adults consume a minimum of 130 grams of carbohydrates each day, and 45 to 65 percent of their daily energy intake from carbohydrates.
