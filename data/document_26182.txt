Both the House and Senate employ a parliamentarian to assist members of Congress in interpreting the standing rules. Because the size of the two houses varies, their procedural rules differ. The House readopts procedural rules every two years.
To ensure the record of precedents stays current, every two years the Parliamentarian publishes the House Rules and Manual, a one volume digest that covers two centuries worth of parliamentary practice in the House.
