OpenStack is a set of software tools for building and managing cloud computing platforms for public and private clouds. Backed by some of the biggest companies in software development and hosting, as well as thousands of individual community members, many think that OpenStack is the future of cloud computing. Think metering and usage reporting. Heat is the orchestration component of OpenStack, which allows developers to store the requirements of a cloud application in a file that defines what resources are necessary for that application.
Open source software for creating private and public clouds. OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works with popular enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure
OpenStack software delivers a massively scalable cloud operating system consisting of three major components: 1  Compute: open source software designed to provision and manage large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. A project originally started by NASA and Rackspace for delivering a cloud computing and storage platform. Today, OpenStack is a global collaboration of developers and technologists producing an open source cloud computing platform for public and private clouds.

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center. All of the above components are managed through a dashboard which gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface. In this blog we often discuss OpenStack, and the different components, and have an OpenStack tutorial or guide at your disposal for many topics â€“ from OpenStack Neutron and networking in general, through NFV, OpenStack orchestration, DevStack, network automation, and much more.
The OpenStack Object Store project, known as Swift, offers cloud storage software so that you can store and retrieve lots of data with a simple API. It's built for scale and optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across the entire data set. 
OpenStack is a free and open-source cloud-computing software platform. Users primarily deploy it as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). OpenStack Networking (Neutron, formerly Quantum) is a system for managing networks and IP addresses. OpenStack Networking ensures the network is not a bottleneck or limiting factor in a cloud deployment, and gives users self-service ability, even over network configurations.
The OpenStack project is a global collaboration of developers and cloud computing technologists producing the open standard cloud computing platform for both public and private clouds. Backed by a vibrant community of developers and some of the biggest names in the industry. OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a dashboard or via the OpenStack API.
OpenStack began in 2010 as a joint project of Rackspace Hosting and of NASA. As of 2015 it is managed by the OpenStack Foundation, a non-profit corporate entity established in September 2012 to promote OpenStack software and its community. OpenStack Networking (Neutron, formerly Quantum) is a system for managing networks and IP addresses. OpenStack Networking ensures the network is not a bottleneck or limiting factor in a cloud deployment, and gives users self-service ability, even over network configurations.
Part of the Cloud computing glossary: OpenStack is an open source infrastructure as a service (IaaS) initiative for creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers in a data center. OpenStack has a modular architecture that currently has eleven components: Nova-provides virtual machines (VMs) upon demand. Swift-provides a scalable storage system that supports object storage. Cinder-provides persistent block storage to guest VMs. Glance-provides a catalog and repository for virtual disk images.
