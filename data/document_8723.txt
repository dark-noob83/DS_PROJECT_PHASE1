In a thrombectomy, the clot is usually accessed via catheter, and removal may be followed by placement of a stent or filter. Medication might be used to prevent further clotting at the area. However, the actual removal of the clot may remove some of the lining of the blood vessel too, and this creates future risk.
Various modifications to the procedure have improved its success rate. Venous thrombectomy is the surgical removal of a vein clot. This procedure is most commonly used to treat a rare complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) called phlegmasia cerulea dolens. This procedure is rarely performed in the United States.
For patients who have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) , an endovascular thrombectomy may be performed. This procedure is designed to rapidly break up the clot, restore blood flow within the vein, and potentially preserve valve function to minimize the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome.

OverviewA thrombectomy is a surgical procedure used to remove a blood clot (thrombus) from a vessel. The thrombus obstructs blood flow and may cause tissue death and even loss of a limb if the circulation is not restored promptly. Thrombosis can occur in veins or arteries.
