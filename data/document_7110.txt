Escheat is the reversion of property to a state when that property is lacking claimants or heirs. In the oil & gas industry, the property is usually an unclaimed oil and gas royalty or override payment. The property can be unclaimed for several reasons, but most often it is because the address of the owner is unknown.
DEFINITION of 'Escheat'. The transfer of title of property or an estate to the state when an individual dies without a will and legal heirs. Escheat ensures that property always has a recognized owner, which would be the state or government if no other claimants to ownership exist. Most jurisdictions have their own laws and regulations defining escheat and the circumstances under which it can be invoked.
The term escheat derives ultimately from the Latin ex-cadere, to fall-out, via mediaeval French escheoir. The sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a family into possession by the overlord.
Escheat. The acquisition of property by a state or government from the estate of a deceased person. An escheat occurs when the deceased person has no will, no relatives, and no survivors to whom the property would otherwise go. Because it is rare for a person to have no relatives at all, escheats are fairly unusual.
In feudal law. Escheat Is an obstruction of the course of descent, andconsequent determination of the tenure, by some unforeseen contingency, in whichcase the land naturally results back, by a kind of reversion, to the original grantor, orlord of the fee. 2 Bl. Comm.
