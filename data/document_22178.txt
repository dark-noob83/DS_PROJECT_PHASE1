Astrology: Ascendant or Rising Sign. The ascendant, or rising sign, is the zodiacal sign and degree that was ascending on the eastern horizon at the specific time and location of an event. I have known many astrologers who look at the rising sign as the most significant on the chart.
When you know the time you were born, your Ascendant Sign can be calculated to the exact degree. It is believed that if the Ascendant falls closer to the beginning of the Sign, the stronger the effects will be felt in the individual.
Ascendant. Ascendant is the unforgiving beat 'em up in which you are a demigod invading a world controlled by your rivals. Choose your fate by discovering Blessings, equipping mighty weapons and spells, and learning to survive in this brutal realm. Only the most impressive warriors have a chance of victory.
Your Rising Sign, otherwise known as an Ascendant, is the Zodiac Sign that was rising on the eastern horizon at the moment you were born. It can be abbreviated on a birth chart as ASC or AS.
The Ascendant is said to be the mask one wears in publicâ€¦ it is the first impression we make when we meet new people. Often, if you are confused at how others have described you, it is because they are describing this aspect of your personality.
