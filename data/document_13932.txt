Best Answer: The water and the bottle will try to get into thermal equilibrium (ie, the same temperature). If the water is initially cold, then it will cool the bottle, and warm up slightly. But this effect only happens in the small layer of water that is in direct contact with the bottle. After you shake it, the water from the middle of the bottle (which is still cold) will be brought to the edge.
As you proved in the first experiment, oil and water are immiscible liquids. On the other hand, water and rubbing alcohol are miscible and will mix with each other. Water and the dishwashing liquid will also mix. Stir up the liquids in the glass and watch what happens to the layers.
In fact simply by agitating or shaking a bottle of water we can never separate the molecules of water. There is a strong force which makes these molecules to bind together and that is why we get the water in liquid form.
If you mix oil and water, the tendency of the oil is to float above the water. This happens because the density of the oil is much lighter that the density of water. Any mater … ial that has heavier density compared with the water will sink and vice versa.
21 Apr 12. While it does no harm to shake water, the 'scientific' explanation for doing so which you have been given is complete poppycock! What happens when you shake water is that it aerates it and small bubbles of air become suspended for a time in the water.
When you mix oil and water the oil rises to the top. Oil and water do not mix together because of their make up, so when you put oil in water, the oil will rise to the top of … the water. 12 people found this useful. Answered.
4.Review 1. What kind of energy did you use to shake the water?Muscle power: kinetic energy.2. Where did that energy come from?From the chemical energy stored in the food we ate.3. What happened to that energy as you shook the water?It increased the motion of the water molecules, which made the water heat up.4.
