B+ blood type: The usual blood types are a, b, ab and o. Yours happens to be of b type. You also have rh antibodies in your blood, making it a b+.
If you have blood type O. If you fall into the O blood group, you have neither A nor B antigens on your red cells, but both A and B antibodies in your plasma. O positive is the most common blood type; O negative is the universal donor type, meaning those with this blood type can donate red blood cells to anybody.
AB Positive. As an AB blood donor, you have a unique opportunity to enhance your generous “gift of life”. People with AB Negative (.6% of the population) and AB Positive (3.4%) are potential universal plasma donors. You may not know, but there is a special need for AB Plasma.
The results of blood typing will determine if a person is type A, B, AB, or O and if he or she is Rh negative or positive. The results will tell the healthcare provider what blood or blood components will be safe for the person to receive.
Type a has only a molecule; type b has only b molecule; type ab has both and type o has neither. The positive and negative reference refers to the presence/absence of rh molecule on the red cell surface. O positive is the most common blood group.
If you do have it, you're Rh-positive. So the terms Rh-negative and Rh-positive are really just terms that further define what type of blood a person has, beyond the general blood type categories of A, B, AB, and O.
Blood type AB means you have both A and B antigens. A antigen is a sugar called N-acetyl galactosamine, added to fucose present on a red cell membrane glycoprotein. B antigen … is a sugar called D-galactosamine, also added to fucose.
In general, Rh negative blood is given to Rh-negative patients, and Rh positive blood or Rh negative blood may be given to Rh positive patients. 1  The universal red cell donor has Type O negative blood type. 2  The universal plasma donor has Type AB
