So if you start at the top of a geodesic dome and go down toward the next pentagon, you can count the poles from center to center and that will tell you what the frequency is. As the frequency number goes higher, the complexity and number of connectors and struts in the dome also increases.
By Jackie Craven. Definition: A geodesic dome is a sphere-like structure composed of a complex network of triangles. The triangles create a self-bracing framework that gives structural strength while using a minimum of material. The term geodesic is from Latin, meaning earth dividing.
â€¢ GEODESIC (noun). The noun GEODESIC has 1 sense: 1. (mathematics) the shortest line between two points on a mathematically defined surface (as a straight line on a plane or an arc of a great circle on a sphere). Familiarity information: GEODESIC used as a noun is very rare.
[From Robert T. Bowers' paper on Domes last posted to GEODESIC in 1989.]. A geodesic dome is a type of structure shaped like a piece of a sphere or a ball. This structure is comprised of a complex network of triangles that form a roughly spherical surface.

And if fans of geodesic design have their way, that's exactly what these domes eventually will do. As the push for sustainable living continues and our population burgeons, domes may offer affordable and smart ways to house humans. Or, they could simply cause a lot of complications.
