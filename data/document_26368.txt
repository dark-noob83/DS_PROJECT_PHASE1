How to Safely Clean Your Ears. Normally, ear canals are self-cleaning and should not need to be cleared with any foreign devices. Trying to clean the ear with cotton swabs or other objects can actually cause problems by pushing the ear wax deeper into the ear canal.
However, too much ear wax can affect your hearing and cause dizziness, pain or itching. For mild to moderate amounts of ear wax buildup, you can clean your ears with a hydrogen peroxide solution at home. Regular cleaning prevents hard wax buildup, which can trap bacteria in the inner ear and causing ear infections.
Clean your dog's ears after he has gone for a swim. Dogs with long, floppy ears are frequently the victims of ear infections. To avoid chronic ear infections, it's best to make routine ear cleaning part of your dog-care schedule. Many ear-cleaning products are available commercially, but you can also make your own.
To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear.
To avoid this problem, refrain from the following: 1  Do not clean your ears with bobby pins, twisted napkin corners, or other long pointed objects. 2  Do not use cotton swabs. 3  They will merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage. 4  Do not use ear candles.
The best tools to use for cleaning your dog’s ears are a good pair of hemostats and some cotton balls. Do not use Q-tips on a dog’s ears, as they can push debris further inside the ear canal, or even damage the ear. Hemostats can be purchased at drug stores, pharmacies, or from your veterinarian.
Good intentions to keep ears clean may be risking the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate area, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body.
