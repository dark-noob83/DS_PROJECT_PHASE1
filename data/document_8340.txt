Ribosome Function. A ribosome is an internal component of a biological cell (known as organelles) that is responsible in assembling molecules of specific amino acid to form a certain protein molecule, which will be determined by the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule.
Plant cell do have ribosomes and they are composed of proteins and ribosomal RNA. The ribosomes in a plant cell are found in the cytoplasm, the surface of the rough e ndoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria and on chloroplasts. There are two types of ribosomes-free ribsomes and attached ribosomes.
Free ribosomes freely float in the cytoplasm of the cell and the membrane-bound ribosomes bind to the nuclear membrane or to the endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosome function is vital for the production of proteins, or polypeptide chains, from the mRNA.
Ribosomes. Definition. noun, singular: ribosome. Small round particles in a cell made up of RNA and protein that are primarily involved in the assembly of proteins by translating messenger RNA (a process called translation).
The nucleus is where the DNA is kept and RNA is transcribed. RNA is moved out of the nucleus through the nuclear pores. Proteins needed inside the nucleus are transported in through the nuclear pores. The nucleolus is usually visible as a dark spot in the nucleus, and is the location of ribosome formation. Ribosomes are where RNA is translated into protein. This process is called protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is very important to cells, therefore large numbers of ribosomes are found in cells. Ribosomes float freely in the cytoplasm, and are also bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
