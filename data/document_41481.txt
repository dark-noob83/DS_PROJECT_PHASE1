Benazepril, sold under the brand name Lotensin, is a prescription drug used to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril belongs to the class of ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, which work by relaxing blood vessels so blood can flow easier. A: Benazepril belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), but can also be used to help the kidneys of diabetic patients.
Benazepril, brand name Lotensin (Novartis), is a drug of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class used primarily in treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and heart attacks, and also in preventing renal and retinal complications of diabetes. 
Before taking benazepril, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or to other ACE inhibitors (such as lisinopril); or if you have any other allergies. This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of benazepril, is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Benazepril is converted to benazeprilat by hepatic cleavage of the ester group.
Uses of This Medicine. Amlodipine and benazepril is a combination of medicines that are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. Benazepril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.
How it works: Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor used to dilate blood vessels in the treatment of high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and some types of kidney disease in dogs and cats. Cautions: Do not stop giving this medication without your veterinarian's approval. A missed dose can result in a sudden rise in blood pressure. Benazepril is a prescription medication not FDA approved for veterinary use; however, it is a commonly accepted practice for veterinarians to use this medication in dogs and cats. Benazepril is available as 5mg tablets. The usual dose to treat dogs is 0.1 to 0.2mg/lb 1 to 2 times a day.
DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Benazepril is an ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor used for treating high blood pressure. Other ACE inhibitors include enalapril (Vasotec), quinapril (Accupril), captopril (Capoten), fosinopril (Monopril), ramipril (Altace), moexipril (Univasc) and trandolapril (Mavik). 
This medication is a combination of two drugs: a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an ACE inhibitor (benazepril). It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Precautions. Before taking this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to amlodipine or benazepril; or to other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (such as nisoldipine, nifedipine); or to other ACE inhibitors (such as captopril, lisinopril); or if you have any other allergies.

Uses of This Medicine. Benazepril is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Benazepril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, benazepril relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart
