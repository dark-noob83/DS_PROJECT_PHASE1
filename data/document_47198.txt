Ways OTC products work. Non-prescription (over-the-counter) cold sore (fever blister) products typically provide their treatment benefit via one of the following modes of action. 1  They help to create an optimal healing environment, so the sore heals as quickly and as uneventfully as possible.
There are many over-the-counter medications available for cold sores. Most of them treat the pain and discomfort of a cold sore with anesthetics. There is one product available that speeds up the healing process for cold sores called Abreva, which contains docosanol.
If your cold sore is especially painful or irritating, your doctor may prescribe an anesthetic gel to alleviate pain or an antiviral oral medication to speed healing or prevent recurrence. The antiviral medicines available for treatment include acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex).
