I am sorry for your husband's new diagnosis. For many the issue of having pre-diabetes or insulin intolerance is one that can be controlled through making changes in diet and exercise. In a lot of cases weight is a major factor and losing weight is key. First and foremost, carbohydrates are not bad.
In general, looking to get about 50 - 55% of calories from carbs is a realistic goal for most folks. The math is pretty easy because a gram of carbs contains 4 calories. So for a 1,600 calorie diet that would be about 220 grams per day. (1600 x 0.55) / 4 = 220.
Each meal and snack will contain a specific total number of grams of carbohydrate. For example: Each gram of carbohydrate provides 4 calories. A person with diabetes on a 1,600 calorie diet should get 50% of these calories from carbohydrates. This would be a total of 800 calories of carbohydrates (at 4 calories per gram) spread out over the day.
50% of that 2,400 calories is 1,200 calories and there are 4 calories in a gram of carbohydrate so the total number of carbs for him is around 300 grams per day. The key to helping prevent diabetes and to controling blood sugar is to eat higher quality carbohydrates.
In many cases folks drink that extra 35 grams of carbohydrates along with a meal and it is simply added calories that they don't need. On the other hand, a half cup of dry oatmeal has about 25 grams of carbohydrate.
My husband is 5'10 and 150 lbs. and was diagnosed with pre-diabetes. We have been trying to find out how many carbs a day he should be eating or how many carbs per meal. He does not need to lose weight and trying to maintain his current weight without eating a lot of carbs is difficult.
Intake Recommendations. If you have prediabetes, carbohydrates should comprise about 50 percent to 60 percent of your total daily caloric intake. Carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram. Based on a 2,000 calorie diet, this means you should consume approximately 1,000 to 1,200 calories from carbohydrates.
