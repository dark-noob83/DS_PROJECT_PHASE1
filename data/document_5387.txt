Therefore, frequently, the incubation period of acute bronchitis is short and the infection creates intense and rapid symptoms such as cough with chest pain, sore throat and a running nose.
In this case, the incubation period is about 4 weeks. During acute bronchitis, the disease remains contagious. Thus, a patient infected with bacteria or virus may pass the pathogens to another healthy person.
Acute bronchitis is usually caused after running nose and sneezing and other flu like symptoms. The cause of cold and flu in many cases is virus infection, and to be precise rhino virus infection. The incubation period for this type of virus infection is usually 2 to 3 days. However for bacterial bronchitis, incubation period can be longer.
The incubation for Mycoplasma is between 15 to 30 days, and incubation period for Chlamydophila bacterial bronchitis is one month. A patient remains infectious in incubation period, thus he should maintain personal hygiene, cleanliness and precautionary measures to prevent further spread.
Bronchitis has an incubation period that may range from several days to several weeks. The incubation period for bronchitis may be seen among certain groups of people. For instance, mycoplasma pneumoniae tends to occur in young adults and older school-age children. The incubation period for this bronchial infection may last from 16 to 30 days.
However, when the causative agent is a bacterium, the incubation period may range from days to weeks. The bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae is seen to cause bronchitis in teenagers and young adults. The incubation period for this bronchial infection may last from 16 to 30 days.
Viral And Bacterial Bronchitis Incubation Period. The symptoms of acute bronchitis last for a short period, and the causative organism in most cases is virus infection. It has been reported that almost 90 percent of acute bronchitis cases are due to virus infection. The rest of 10 percent is attributed to bacterial origin.
