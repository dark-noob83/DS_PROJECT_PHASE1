The Largest Tree in the World. In terms of sheer volume, the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) known as General Sherman is a monster of a tree -- at 52,508 cubic feet, it's the world's largest tree, and perhaps the world's largest living thing.
The largest tree in the world is a California Redwood tree named the General Sherman tree located in Sequoia National Park in California.
The largest plant on Earth is a tree called the Giant Sequoia. They are a tree native to the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and grow an average of 165 to 280 feet tall, with a trunk diameter of 18 to 24 feet. The record holding Giant Sequoia is 311 feet tall, and the largest individual plant on Earth.
The tree called General Sherman is not only the biggest giant sequoia, but it is also the biggest tree in the world. He is 83.8 m (274.9 feet) tall, his girth at breast height is 24,10 m (79 feet) (near the ground it is 31,3 m or 102,6 feet).
