The Human Mouth. The human mouth is a complex structure that consists of both hard and soft tissues forming a hollow cavity. The mouth anatomy features several components including the jaws, teeth, gums, tongue, palate, cheeks, lips, which all together contribute in making possible the various functions of the mouth.
A very simple labelled diagram of the mouth (anterior view of the mouth) is shown below, followed by notes about each of the structures labelled. This is useful for introductory level courses but doesn't include all of the parts of the mouth that are involved in the initial stages of the digestion process.
Good knowledge of the morphology, anatomy, structure and physical characteristics of mouth and teeth is necessary in order to understand the development of several dental conditions, their causes and their treatments.
The mouth (or oral cavity) is important for speech and communication, eating and digestion, and can also be used for breathing. The main structures inside the mouth are the teeth, tongue, tonsils, salivary glands and-at the back of the throat (not shown on the left). the epiglottis. Structure in/of the mouth. Notes / Description. 1.
The mouth, like many organs in the human body, is a hollow cavity. The part in front of the teeth is called the vestibule, while the part behind is the mouth itself. The floor of the mouth is formed from sheets of muscle tissue which are attached to the inner surface of the jawbone, or mandible.

The mouth contains many other organs-such as the teeth, tongue, and the ducts of the salivary glands-that work together to aid in the ingestion and digestion of food. The mouth also plays a major role in the production of speech through the movements of the tongue, lips and cheeks.
