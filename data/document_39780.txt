Split and merge into it. Answer by Acid36. Confidence votes 5.0K. The ampicillin resistance gene (AmpR) is called a selectable marker gene and is incorporated into several plasmids that are commonly used in a wide range of genetic engineering and molecular biology experiments.
The function of a selectable marker gene is to provide the host containing the plasmid a certain property that is not inherently present in the host. For example, the AmpR gene codes for a protein that makes cells containing this gene resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin.
Hypothesis: If bacteria with +pGLO plasmids that are resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin and have the gene for GFP, colonies will survive and grow on the transformation plates that have LB/amp.
Ampicillin resistance. Nonsusceptibility of a microbe to the action of ampicillin, a penicillin derivative that interferes with cell wall synthesis. Please contribute to this project, if you have more information about this term feel free to edit this page.
A plasmid containing resistance to an antibiotic (usually ampicillin) is used as a vector. The gene of interest is inserted into the vector plasmid and this newly constructed plasmid is then put into E. coli that are sensitive to ampicillin. The bacteria are then spread over a plate that contains
ampicillin. penicillin antibiotic effective against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms but ineffective against penicillinase-secreting bacteria; as almost all staphylococci are resistant to ampicillin, it is not the drug of choice for 'blind' treatment of infection.
