1 Organic matter is a reservoir of nutrients that can be released to the soil. 2  Each percent of organic matter in the soil releases 20 to 30 pounds of nitrogen, 4.5 to 6.6 pounds of P 2 O 5, and 2 to 3 pounds of sulfur per year. Humus is organic material that has been converted by microorganisms to a resistant state of decomposition. Organic material is unstable in the soil, changing form and mass readily as it decomposes. As much as 90 percent of it disappears quickly because of decomposition. Organic matter is stable in the soil.
Although the C content of SOM is known to vary considerably, SOM is typically estimated to contain 58% C, and the terms 'soil organic carbon' (SOC) and SOM are often used interchangeably, with measured SOC content often serving as a proxy for SOM. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Soil organic matter (SOM) is the organic matter component of soil, consisting of plant and animal residues at various stages of decomposition, cells and tissues of soil organisms, and substances synthesized by soil organisms.
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is defined as the organic matter that is able to pass through a filter (filters generally range in size between 0.7 and 0.22 um). Conversely, particulate organic carbon (POC) is that carbon that is too large and is filtered out of a sample. 
The amount of organic material can be determined by ignition. Organic material is made of carbon compounds, which when heated to high temperatures are converted to carbon dioxide and water. In the ignition process, a dry solid sample is heated to a high temperature. The organic matter in the soil is given off as gases. This results in a change in weight which allows for calculation of the organic content of the sample. Oven-dry the sample to remove water (see soil moisture). Weigh a crucible and lid, evaporating dish and cover, or other covered container
The water content of most vegetal residues is in the range of 60% to 90%. The dry matter consists mainly of complex organic material composed of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Although this carbonaceous material comprises 92% of dry weight, there are other elements that are of great importance for the nutrition of plants. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Soil organic matter (SOM) is the organic matter component of soil, consisting of plant and animal residues at various stages of decomposition, cells and tissues of soil organisms, and substances synthesized by soil organisms.
For it to become organic matter, it must be decomposed into humus. Humus is organic material that has been converted by microorganisms to a resistant state of decomposition. Organic material is unstable in the soil, changing form and mass readily as it decomposes. As much as 90 percent of it disappears quickly because of decomposition. Organic matter is stable in the soil.

As essential as it is to create organic content that answers a readers' questions, Austin Lovvorn on BMI Elite cautions about writing the same article over and over in different ways. You don't want to bore your reader. Equally, you don't want to throw up a score of web pages and then forget about the site. If you're confused about how to weather the ever-increasing changes to search engine algorithms, turning your efforts towards writing good, organic web content is almost always a better use of your time and effort than chasing the latest trick to gaming the search engine systems.
Compost is valued for its organic matter content, and it typically used as a soil amendment to enhance the chemical, physical and biological properties of soil. Compost is typically not a fertilizer, although when used at normal rates it can reduce the amount of required fertilizer. Organic content Organic matter is the measure of carbon based materials in the compost. High quality compost will usually have a minimum of 50% organic content based on dry weight. Another means of expressing organic content is to list the weight of organic matter per unit volume of compost.
Other meanings can be found at Biological material (disambiguation). Organic matter or organic material, natural organic matter, NOM is matter composed of organic compounds that has come from the remains of organisms such as plants and animals and their waste products in the environment. Organic molecules can also be made by chemical reactions that don't involve life.
