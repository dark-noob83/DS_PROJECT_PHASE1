Professional ranges can be ordered in varying widths from 24″ to 60″. Slide-in ranges are available only in a 30″ width, and GE continues to manufacturer a 27″ wide drop-in range for replacement purposes of a popular model sold during the 60s and 70s. Unlike many other appliances, range sizes have become standardized throughout the years in both height and width. The majority of freestanding, slide-in, and drop-in ranges are designed to fit a 30″ wide opening. Standard countertop height is 36″ and most ranges also have a surface height of 36″. This allows for the range to fit seamlessly between two countertops, with the cooking surface and countertop perfectly aligned

Freestanding ovens are very popular, less expensive than slide-in ovens and are almost always manufactured in standard width of 30 inches. Depth is normally between 25 and 27 inches, which is a little more than base cabinet depth. Height to cook top is close to counter top height at 36.5 inches. It is possible to purchase an “apartment” freestanding range of smaller dimensions. Slide in ranges are most commonly 30 inches wide. Stand alone cook tops provide only the burner portion of a range and are typically sold in 4, 5, or 6 burner configurations. 4 and 5 burner cook tops are usually 30 inches wide and 6 burner cook tops are usually 36 inches wide.
The accepted “standard” for kitchen counter-height is 36-inches. In reality, sometimes they are that height, and sometimes they aren’t. Several things make a difference in whether or not the height of your new granite kitchen counters match the height for your slide-in range. Add up #1 and #2. For example, if your already-installed cabinets are 35 inches high, and your 3cm granite will be 1.1875 inches high, your finished granite counter top height will be 35 + 1.1875 = 36.1875. Oooh, I know, it’s giving me a headache, too. Now, look at the range of heights for the range, and see if that falls in between

Low Counter for Slide-In Range. I will be moving into a townhome at the Bell Estate in Scarborough this Sept and was told my counter-top will be 35 1/4 in height. I opted for a slide-in range which is 35 5/8 tall. There's 3/8 gap between the stove top lip and the counter-top, unless I upgrade my current $6,000 counter-top upgrade for an additional $1,350 to double-up on the granite counter-top thickness (incl $315 to continue the counter behind the range) from 3/4 to 1 1/2. Anyone wanting to upgrade to a slide-in range would have to have the counter-top upgraded as 35 5/8 seems to be kind of a standard height for slide-ins? Who's fault is this? The Industry or the appliance manufacturer? I would have preferred to use the extra expense for better appliances then a heavier counter-top.
