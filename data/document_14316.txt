Intracellular fluid is the cytosol of cytoplasm, a fluid located within the membrane of tissue cells. The proteins that are located within the cytosol act as intracellular rec â€¦ eptors also play an important role in glycolysis and signal transduction pathways.
a fluid within cell membranes throughout most of the body, containing dissolved solutes that are essential to electrolytic balance and to healthy metabolism. Also called intracellular water. Compare extracellular fluid, interstitial fluid, lymph, plasma.
Definition. Human cells are bathed in fluids both inside the cell and outside of it. In fact, the water that is inside the cell makes up about 42% of the total body weight. The water inside the cell is called intracellular fluid (ICF). There is also another compartment, related to the cell, which is important to mention.
Body water is divided into two primary types--intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF). The intracellular is fluid that is contained within the body's cells. The fluid within the cells makes up about 2/3 of a person's total body water and accounts for about 50 percent of the person's body weight.
1 28 litres is intracellular water. 2  14L is found in extracellular fluid of which. 3  3L is blood plasma, 4  1L is the transcellular fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, ocular, pleural, peritoneal and synovial fluids). 5  10L is the interstitial fluid (including lymph), which is an aqueous medium surrounding cells.
The total amount of water in our body is found in three main locations: within our cells (two-thirds of the water), in the space between our cells and in our blood (one-third of the water). For example, a 70-kg man is made up of about 42L of total water. 1  28 litres is intracellular water.
