Eukaryotic cells are those cells, which are complex and larger than the prokaryotic cells. The term eukaryote is derived from the Greek word- a€â€ oeeukaryotea œeukaryoteâ meaning true or. Good nuclei this cell includes all life kingdoms. except monera The prokaryotic cells do not have membrane bound cellular organelles. The cellular structure of the prokaryotes and eukaryotes differ in the presence of c ellular structures like the mitochondria and chloroplasts, cell wall and the structure of chromosomal DNA.
No, there is no Golgi apparatus in a prokaryotic cell. The Golgi apparatus (= Golgi body, Golgi complex, or dictyosome) is a membranous structure, and there are no internal … membranes in prokaryotes.   The only membrane is the one that surrounds the cytoplasm, called the cell membrane or plasma membrane. 7 people found this useful. The Golgi apparatus (also known as the dictyosome or Golgi body) is an organelle in a cell. The Golgi apparatus, and Golgi body are the same thing.     Yes.
The term eukaryote means 'good or true nucleus' and describes all cells other than bacteria (prostista, fungi, plant cells and animal cells). 1  These cells all possess a nucleus where the DNA is stored. 2  They also possess membrane-bound organelles-such as endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lysosomes, golgi apparatus, etc. 
Prokaryotic cells contain a single compartment enclosed within the cell membrane. In this space reside DNA, RNA, ribosomes and other molecules. Prokaryotes lack a defined nucleus (which is where DNA and RNA are stored in eukaryotic cells), mitochondria, ER, golgi apparatus, and so on. In addition to the lack of organelles, prokaryotic cells also lack a cytoskeleton
Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not. Differences in cellular structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes include the presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the cell wall, and the structure of chromosomal DNA.

Only bacteria have prokaryotic cell types. Eukaryotic cells are generally much larger and more complex than prokaryotic. Because of their larger size, they require a variety of specialized internal membrane-bound organelles to carry out metabolism, provide energy, and transport chemicals throughout the cell. We will now look at the Golgi complex of eukaryotic cells. 1) sort proteins and lipids received from the ER; 2) modify certain proteins and glycoproteins; and 3) sort and package these molecules into vesicles for transport to other parts of the cell or secretion from the cell. The Golgi Complex (def) (see Fig. 31, Fig.
Organelles are simply membrane-bound compartments within a cell, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum. You are a eukaryote. Your cells are eukaryotic. Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, including a nucleus. Eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicelled, such as you, me, plants, fungi, and insects. Bacteria are an example of prokaryotes. Prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelle. Prokaryotes include two groups: bacteria and another group called archaea. Having organelles is a big deal for a cell.
The presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name, which comes from the Greek ευ (eu, well) and κάρυον (karyon, nut or kernel). Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. In addition, plants and algae contain chloroplasts. Eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular, or multicellular. Only eukaryotes have many kinds of tissue made up of different cell types. A eukaryote (/juːˈkaeri.juːˈkæri/ oʊt /or/ juːˈkaeriət-JUːˈKæRIəT-yoo-karr ee oht-OR-yoo-karr) ee ət is any organism whose cells contain a nucleus and other organelles enclosed. Within membranes eukaryotes belong to The taxon Eukarya. or eukaryota
All multicellular organisms (many or more than one cell) including humans, which are composed of complex or many cells, are examples of eukaryotic cells. Both prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells have cytoplasm, cell membrane and genetic material in common. The prokaryotic cells do not have membrane bound cellular organelles. The cellular structure of the prokaryotes and eukaryotes differ in the presence of c ellular structures like the mitochondria and chloroplasts, cell wall and the structure of chromosomal DNA.
