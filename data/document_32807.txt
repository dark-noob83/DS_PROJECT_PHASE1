iii) Funeral costs. For many low income earners the price of a funeral in NSW remains generally unaffordable. The average price for a cremation (for undertakersâ€™ least expensive service) was $4,694 in rural and regional areas and $4,580 in the SMA.
There are also variations in the cost of caskets and coffins and in the cost of grave plots. Much of the expense of a burial is associated with the burial plot. Depending on the cemetery, a single grave can cost from $2970 to $4800, plus an opening fee of $1485. In country areas where cemetery land is not so scarce, a plot will be cheaper. Labour costs are involved in opening and closing the grave and maintaining it.

While the price of a cremation is similar in most states of Australia, there are some areas that are cheaper than others. The average cost of a cremation package in Brisbane and Perth is $4,600 - while the average price of a cremation in Melbourne and Sydney will set you back closer to $5,000.
Planning Ahead is the Key to Managing Funeral Costs. Funeral homes, cemeteries and other service providers expect to receive payment in full at the time of the funeral. With the average cost of a funeral in the U.S. exceeding $8,000, it can be a hardship if you have not planned ahead for this expenditure.
