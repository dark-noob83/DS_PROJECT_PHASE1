Electric motor. An electric motor is an electric machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. In normal motoring mode, most electric motors operate through the interaction between an electric motor's magnetic field and winding currents to generate force within the motor.
An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse of this would be the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator.
An electric motor is a device used to convert electrical energy to mechanical energy. Electric motors are extremely important in modern-day life.
Noun. 1. electric motor-a motor that converts electricity to mechanical work. armature-coil in which voltage is induced by motion through a magnetic field. brush-conducts current between rotating and stationary parts of a generator or motor. electric drill-a rotating power drill powered by an electric motor.
Simply put, an electric motor can be defined as a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The first electric motors date back to 1740s when Scottish monk Andrew Gordon created electrostatic devices.

Electric motors involve rotating coils of wire which are driven by the magnetic force exerted by a magnetic field on an electric current. They transform electrical energy into mechanical energy.
An electric motor is a device that turns electrical energy into motion, usually rotation. It changes electrical energy into mechanical or kinetic (movement) energy. This works using electromagnetism. A loop of wire containing a current is passed through an electromagnet's magnetic field.
