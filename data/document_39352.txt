The implication is that sonar may be affecting the whalesâ€™ dive patterns. Other possible causes put forth for the disruption of whale and dolphin navigation include: 1  weather conditions; 2  diseases (such as viruses, brain lesions, parasites in the ears or sinuses); 3  underwater seismic activity (sometimes called seaquakes);
Mass strandings of dolphins, whales, and other marine mammals date back to the time of Aristotle, but some environmental activists have suggested that human impacts of pollution, shipping noise and, in some cases, military sonar have led to a rise in such frequency and severity of such events.
My answer to the centuries-old mystery of why whales and dolphins beach themselves can be stated in only one word: BAROSINUSITIS. Barosinusitis in diving mammals is a pressure related injury in the sinuses and air sacs of their head.

Answer: There are many theories about why whales and dolphins sometimes swim into shallow water and end up stranding themselves on beaches in various parts of the world.
Because whales are highly social creatures that travel in communities called pods, some mass strandings may occur when healthy whales refuse to abandon a sick or injured pod member and follow them into shallow water. Mass strandings of dolphins are far less common than mass strandings of whales.
