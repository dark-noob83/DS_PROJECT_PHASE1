With an average salary of $85,930 in 2013, mechanical engineers are filling their coffers at a higher rate than a number of other technology jobs. Computer programmers, by comparison, make $80,930. The gap is wider for computer support specialists, who earn an average annual salary of $64,160. Still, some technology jobs, like information security analysts ($91,210) and IT managers ($132,570), earn more than mechanical engineers.
Salary Outlook. According to the BLS, mechanical engineers earned a median salary of $82,100 in 2013. The best-paid earned about $123,340, while the lowest-paid earned less than $52,550. Industries that pay well include oil and gas extraction as well as information services. Computer programmers, by comparison, make $80,930.

Overall Figures. In 2012, mechanical engineers earned an average salary of $84,770 annually, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This represented an increase of 1.46 percent from the previous year, when the average salary was $83,550. The top 10 percent of earners made $121,530 or more a year in 2012. Salaries by Degree. It should come as no surprise that a mechanical engineer's level of education can influence her pay. As already noted, salaries in mechanical engineering started at $61,300 a year in 2012. For those with a master’s degree, however, the average starting salary was $75,700 a year. Engineers who want to improve their chances of getting higher pay can do so by working toward a higher level of education
Compare the undergraduate degree salaries with the averages for all mechanical engineers, which ran $83,550 per year as of May 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The lowest-earning 10 percent received $51,340 yearly, while the best-paid 10 percent earned a mean $119,950 annually. Prospects. About 38 percent of mechanical engineering undergraduates went on to obtain a master’s degree in the field. A master's degree provided a 28 percent increase in salaries. This increases median annual wages to $102,400, with the 25th percentile making $75,520 and the 75th percentile receiving $135,680.
Salaries. Mechanical engineers with bachelor’s degrees earned a median annual salary of $80,000, with the 25th percentile making $59,000 and the 75th percentile receiving $105,000, a difference of $46,000. This was according to a salary survey of degrees and salaries conducted by Georgetown University in 2011. Prospects. About 38 percent of mechanical engineering undergraduates went on to obtain a master’s degree in the field. A master's degree provided a 28 percent increase in salaries. This increases median annual wages to $102,400, with the 25th percentile making $75,520 and the 75th percentile receiving $135,680.
$34,750. The median annual wage for mechanical engineers was $80,580 in May 2012. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $52,030, and the top 10 percent earned more than $121,530. 
A Mechanical Engineer earns an average salary of $66,437 per year. Most people move on to other jobs if they have more than 20 years' experience in this career. Experience has a moderate effect on income for this job. 
For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Mechanical Engineer I in the United States is $63,483 so 50% of the people who perform the job of Mechanical Engineer I in the United States are expected to make less than $63,483.
