The pelvis is a butterfly-shaped group of bones at the base of the spine. The pelvis consists of the pubis, ilium and ischium bones (among others) held together by tough ligaments to form a girdle of bones.
A pelvic fracture is a crack or break in one or more of the pelvic bones, which are located at the base of the spine. The pelvis is often referred to as part of the hip. (When you put your hands on your hips, your hands are actually resting on your pelvic bones.).
A pelvic fracture is a break in 1 or more bones in the pelvis. It is sometimes referred to as a hip fracture or broken hip because it occurs in the bones that make up the hip area. A pelvic fracture causes difficulty walking or standing.
Pelvic fractures are classified as: 1  Stable, in which the pelvis has one break point in the pelvic ring, limited bleeding and the bones are staying in place. 2  Unstable, in which there are two or more breaks in the pelvic ring with moderate to severe bleeding.
Treatment for a pelvic bone fracture depends on the type and severity of the pelvic fracture. Treatment usually includes bedrest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for pain, narcotic pain medications, and physical therapy.
Broken Pelvis Treatment. Treatment for a pelvic bone fracture depends on the type and severity of the pelvic fracture. Treatment usually includes bedrest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for pain, narcotic pain medications, and physical therapy.
Both types of pelvic fractures can also be divided into open fractures, in which the skin has been broken by the break, or closed fractures, where the skin is not broken. The main symptom of a pelvic fracture is pain in the groin, hip or lower back, which may get worse when walking or moving the legs.
