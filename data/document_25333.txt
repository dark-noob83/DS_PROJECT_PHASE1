The settlor then provides in the trust instrument how that trust property is to be used for the beneficiaries. In the case of the inter vivos trust, the settlor can also be the beneficiary.
A trust is the legal relationship created when a person (the settlor) places assets under the control of a person (the trustee) for the benefit of some other person or people (the beneficiaries) or for a specified purpose.
