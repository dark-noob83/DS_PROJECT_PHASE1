CoraBella Gluten Free Rice and Potato Gnocchi takes less than five minutes to cook. No joke. Bring water to a boil…and add some salt. Then, add the pasta and allow it to cook until the gnocchi rises to the top. Then let it cook for an additional two minutes, drain, and then serve with your favorite sauce. Yep…that easy.
Without wheat flour to bring stretchy gluten to hold the gnocchi together, starchy potatoes provide the structure that we need. Use russetts or Idaho potatoes for this recipe. To further ensure the gluten-free gnocchi hold together during cooking, you need to bake, not boil, the potatoes.
While the primary ingredient in gnocchi is potatoes, flour is typically used as a binder in traditional gnocchi so this makes them not gluten-free. There is a brand called Conte’s which makes gluten-free gnocchi, but we highly recommend this gluten-free gnocchi recipe from Serious Eats – it’s worth the extra work.

The Potatoes. Without wheat flour to bring stretchy gluten to hold the gnocchi together, starchy potatoes provide the structure that we need. So be sure to select russetts or Idaho potatoes for the recipe. To further ensure the gluten-free gnocchi hold together during cooking, you need to bake, not boil, the potatoes. Baked potatoes not only reward you with a stronger potato flavor, they don't absorb water during the cooking process.
