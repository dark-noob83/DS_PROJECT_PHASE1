From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The outer core of the Earth is a liquid layer about 2,300 km (1,400 mi) thick and composed of iron and nickel that lies above Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle. Its outer boundary lies 2,890 km (1,800 mi) beneath Earth's surface. 
We derive our primary estimate of the temperature of the deep earth from the melting behavior of iron at ultrahigh pressures. We know that the earth's core depths from 2,886 kilometers to the center at 6,371 kilometers (1,794 to 3,960 miles), is predominantly iron, with some contaminants. The bottom line of these efforts is that there is a rather wide range of current estimates of the earth's core temperature. The popular estimates range from about 4,000 kelvins up to over 7,000 kelvins (about 7,000 to 12,000 degrees F).
The inner core is at the center of the earth. The pressure and temperature of the earth increases as one moves closer to the center. First comes the mantle, this is a layer that is bellow the crust of the earth. This is said to go down 2,900 kilometers; it's temperature is about 870 degrees Celsius. The inner core is about 6,400 kilometers below the earths surface. the temperature at the inner core of the earth is at the high is about 7,00
The temperature difference between the mantle and the core is the main engine for large-scale thermal movements, which coupled with the Earth's rotation, function as a generator for the planet's magnetic field. To complete the experiment of Earth core temperature, the research team used a laboratory analysis of melting iron at extreme temperatures and pressures, using x-rays to determine the exact moment the iron transforms from a super-hot liquid to a solid.
Mark Garlick/Science Source. By duplicating the extreme heat and pressure at the Earth’s core, a European research team has determined that the temperature of the center of our planet is close to 11,000 degrees Fahrenheit — nearly 2,000 degrees hotter than previously thought. 
Extrapolating from that measurement, scientists estimated the boundary between Earth's inner and outer core is a searing 10,832 F, give or take about 930 degrees, at a pressure of 3.3 million atmospheres (or 3.3 million times the atmospheric pressure at sea level). 
The earth's core is divided into two separate regions: the liquid outer core and the solid inner core, with the transition between the two lying at a depth of 5,156 kilometers (3,204 miles). The bottom line of these efforts is that there is a rather wide range of current estimates of the earth's core temperature. The popular estimates range from about 4,000 kelvins up to over 7,000 kelvins (about 7,000 to 12,000 degrees F).

A new experiment on the temperature of Earth's core concludes that it's a hellish 6,000 degrees Celsius (10,832 F), a solid 1,000 C (1,832 F) hotter than previously believed when the last temperature model was run 20 years ago.

The Earth's inner core is thought to be slowly growing as the liquid outer core at the boundary with the inner core cools and solidifies due to the gradual cooling of the Earth's interior (about 100 degrees Celsius per billion years). For a broader coverage related to this topic, see Earth core. The internal structure of Earth. The Earth's inner core is the Earth's innermost part and according to seismological studies, it is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1220 kilometers, or 760 miles (about 70% of the Moon 's radius).
