genetic modification is when you take a beneficial gene a bit of dna from one species and add it to the dna sequence of another species the genetically modified subject will use the gene and benefit from it for example to grow better fruit or be resistant to disease or to produce insulin
it can be argued that any intervention by humans is a genetic modification of a plant or animal and some modifications occur by the process of mutation and selection humans have been actively genetically modifying plants and animals for thousands of years through selective cross breeding and domestication
genetic modification is achieved by altering dna or by introducing genetic material from one organism into another either from a different variety of the same species or a different species altogether
sidebara genetic engineering ge is the modification of an organism s genetic composition by artificial means often involving the transfer of specific traits or genes from one organism into a plant or animal of an entirely different species
gm which stands for genetic modification or genetically modified is the process of altering the genes of a plant animal or micro organism or inserting a gene from another organism living thing genes carry the instructions for all the characteristics that an organism inherits
this is called genetic engineering or genetic modification the definition of genetic modification is any alteration of genetic material dna or rna of an organism by means that could not occur naturally through mating or recombination the genetic techniques involved could include
genetic modification involves inserting or changing an organism s genes to produce a desired characteristic inserting genes below is the process that takes place when a plant for example is modified by inserting a gene from another plant a plant that has the desired characteristic is identified
