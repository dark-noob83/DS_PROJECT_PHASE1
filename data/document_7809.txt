If the planet changes its distance from the Sun as it orbits, then the force of gravity between them must change. If the force that the Sun exerts on the planet increases (as the planet moves closer), then the acceleration of the planet must increase, resulting in a higher orbital speed, and vice versa. After deriving gravitational orbital motion from the laws of motion, law of gravity and quite a bit of calculus, Newton found that Kepler's 3rd Law should actually be this: p 2 (yrs) = a 3 (AU) / (M 1 + M 2); where the masses are measured in units of our Sun's mass.
Let's use this result to get an estimate of the mass of the Sun. You need to use something orbiting with a known radius and speed. The Earth's orbit is roughly circular with radius = 1.5 × 10 11 meters and the Earth moves with a speed 30,000 meters/second (= 30 km/s) in its orbit. The distance is given in meters to match the units of the speed. Jupiter's distance from the Sun is 5.2 A.U., or 7.8×10 11 meters and the Sun's mass is 2×10 30 kilograms. The orbital speed of Jupiter around the Sun is Sqrt [6.7×10 -11 × (2×10 30)/(7.8×10 11)] = Sqrt [1.718×10 8 ] = 1.3×10 4 meters/second, or 13 kilometers/second.
As shown in blue, if a planet has twice the orbital distance = 2x1AU = 2AU, its orbital period is 2.8 years. 8) Based on your results from questions 6 and 7, which of the following best describes how a planet’s orbital period will change (if at all) when its distance to the central star is doubled? 
Kepler's 2nd Law: A line connecting the Sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. That is, the orbital speed of any one planet varies inversely with its distance from the Sun (actually, orbital speed varies inversely with the square-root of the distance, but you needn't worry about that detail). This one you can understand conceptually, once you understand Newton's Laws of Motion and Law of Gravity. After deriving gravitational orbital motion from the laws of motion, law of gravity and quite a bit of calculus, Newton found that Kepler's 3rd Law should actually be this: p 2 (yrs) = a 3 (AU) / (M 1 + M 2); where the masses are measured in units of our Sun's mass.
Because of the higher the gravitational, such a planet would be centripetally accelerated more strongly, and its constant orbital speed would have to be higher than the Earth's. Thus its year would be shorter, 1/(square root 2) of an Earth year or about 258 days. The force at constant distance is just proportional to the product of stellar and planetary masses. We don't know of any reason why an Earth mass planet should not form at 1 AU from a star of 2X Solar mass, though we as yet have few observational measurements of such low mass extra-solar planets.
You would get the same value for the mass of the Sun if you had used any of the other planets orbital speeds and sizes. This relation tells you what you need to know in order to measure a planet's or star's mass: the orbital speed of a satellite and the distance it is from the center of the planet or star. Jupiter's distance from the Sun is 5.2 A.U., or 7.8×10 11 meters and the Sun's mass is 2×10 30 kilograms. The orbital speed of Jupiter around the Sun is Sqrt [6.7×10 -11 × (2×10 30)/(7.8×10 11)] = Sqrt [1.718×10 8 ] = 1.3×10 4 meters/second, or 13 kilometers/second.
Find the orbital speed of Jupiter around the Sun. Jupiter's distance from the Sun is 5.2 A.U., or 7.8×10 11 meters and the Sun's mass is 2×10 30 kilograms. The orbital speed of Jupiter around the Sun is Sqrt [6.7×10 -11 × (2×10 30)/(7.8×10 11)] = Sqrt [1.718×10 8 ] = 1.3×10 4 meters/second, or 13 kilometers/second.
If you doubled the mass of the sun, the EArth could orbit at its current distance, but would do so in a period that is approximately 0.71 times the current period (i.e., about 7/10 of a year). kuiperbelt2003 · 7 years ago. Thumbs up. 1. Best Answer: Depends where and what Earth is doing at the moment you replace the Sun with the new massive star. The orbital speed of a body, at a given distance from a larger one, is proportional to the mass of the larger body.
Confidence votes 12. If an Earth-like planet was orbiting at the same distance from its double solar mass star as the Earth is from the Sun (1 astronomical unit, written 1 AU), then the force would be double that experienced by the Earth. The force at constant distance is just proportional to the product of stellar and planetary masses. We don't know of any reason why an Earth mass planet should not form at 1 AU from a star of 2X Solar mass, though we as yet have few observational measurements of such low mass extra-solar planets.
