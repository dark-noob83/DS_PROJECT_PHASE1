For a healthy, balanced diet, cut down on foods and drinks containing added sugars. These tips can help you to cut down: 1  Instead of sugary fizzy drinks and juice, go for water or unsweetened fruit juice (remember to dilute this juice for children to further reduce the sugar, and to limit intake to 150ml a day). Children should have less – no more than 19g a day for children aged 4 to 6 years old (5 sugar cubes), and no more than 24g (6 sugar cubes) for children aged 7 to 10 years old.
Pediatricians and nutritionists agree: In modest amounts, sugar can have a healthful place in a child's diet (or an adult's). But many kids get too much, too often. Worse, sugar-rich foods tend to be full of empty calories and often displace the nutritious foods children need. Sugar alone doesn't make kids overweight. Children gain too many pounds when they take in more calories than they burn. Unfortunately, sugary drinks and treats typically supply calories above and beyond what kids need to satisfy their hunger. Sugar calories also tend to go down too fast and easy.
It’s relatively easy for parents to limit these to occasional treats but there are hidden sugars in foods you may not be aware of. Sugar isn’t all bad. It’s naturally occurring in many foods and makes foods taste nicer. The body needs carbohydrates for energy and sugar is a source of carbohydrates. It’s only a problem if we have too much sugar, too often. Sugar has few nutrients but plenty of calories, so too much of it makes your children's diet less healthy. It’s also incredibly easy to over eat sugary foods. Guidelines in the UK suggest that added sugars should make up less than 10% of the calories you eat. The British Dietetic Association says the maximum recommended daily intake of sugars (excluding lactose milk sugar) is approximately 60 grams per day (10% of our total calorie intake) for adults.
It’s best when trying to limit your kids intake of sugar to reduce table sugar, high fructose corn syrup, powdered sugar and brown sugar. Honey is delicious in limited amounts, and contains some nutrients. But fruit sugar is ideal. Sugar doesn’t only make kids (and yourself) moody and tired. Too much sugar (more than 25 grams of added sugar a day) also: 1  Reduces brain function! 2  Leads to over-eating (that one should be obvious). 3  Contributes to obesity. 4  Ruins our sensitivity to insulin and contributes to Type 2 Diabetes.
One question that continues to haunt parents of children with ADHD is: Does sugar cause hyperactivity? Throughout my years of writing about ADHD, parents have consistently written to me asking whether they should limit their child's sugar intake to help reduce hyperactivity. My answer is: You should limit your child's sugar intake because sugar causes tooth decay and eating too many sweet foods can contribute to obesity. Despite not causing activity levels to increase, there are several good reasons to cut down on the amount of sugar your child consumes. 1  Sugar is the number one cause of tooth decay. 2  When your child fills up on sugary foods, he may skip more nutritious foods. 3  High sugar foods can lead
That's a maximum of 30g of added sugar a day for adults, which is roughly seven sugar cubes. Children should have less – no more than 19g a day for children aged 4 to 6 years old (5 sugar cubes), and no more than 24g (6 sugar cubes) for children aged 7 to 10 years old.
1 Instead of sugary fizzy drinks and juice, go for water or unsweetened fruit juice (remember to dilute this juice for children to further reduce the sugar, and to limit intake to 150ml a day). 2  If you prefer fizzy drinks, try diluting fruit juice with sparkling water. Children should have less – no more than 19g a day for children aged 4 to 6 years old (5 sugar cubes), and no more than 24g (6 sugar cubes) for children aged 7 to 10 years old.
I’m ready! Sugar doesn’t only make kids (and yourself) moody and tired. Too much sugar (more than 25 grams of added sugar a day) also: 1  Reduces brain function! 2  Leads to over-eating (that one should be obvious). 3  Contributes to obesity. 4  Ruins our sensitivity to insulin and contributes to Type 2 Diabetes.
The myth began back in the 1970's when Dr. Feingold suggested that certain additives and food coloring contributed to hyperactivity. Many parents included sugar in the foods that should be avoided. The myth is perpetuated, according to an article on Cornell University's website, because parents think it is so. Despite not causing activity levels to increase, there are several good reasons to cut down on the amount of sugar your child consumes. 1  Sugar is the number one cause of tooth decay. 2  When your child fills up on sugary foods, he may skip more nutritious foods. 3  High sugar foods can lead to obesity
