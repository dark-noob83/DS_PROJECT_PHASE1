Ocean plants are a part of Mother Nature's way to feed and shelter aquatic life and provide oxygen for the air. Just like land plants, ocean plants require sunlight. In shallow ocean waters, some plants present colorful layouts on the ocean floor. For instance, coral reefs are a large part of oceanic ecosystems that feed fish, provider shelter and produce oxygen. Phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are some of the most primitive plants in the ocean. Although they are very tiny, these plants account for a majority of the oxygen that is produced for the air that humans breathe.
Here, we can see different types of starfish, coral reefs and fishes in the Great Barrier Reef. Marine ecosystems are among the largest of Earth's aquatic ecosystems. They include oceans, salt marshes, intertidal zones, estuaries, lagoons, mangroves, coral reefs, the deep sea, and the sea floor. They can be contrasted with freshwater ecosystems, which have a lower salt content. Marine waters cover two-thirds of the surface of the Earth. In addition, other marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, provide food and shelter to the highest levels of marine diversity in the world. Marine ecosystems usually have a large biodiversity and are therefore thought to have a good resistance against invasive species.
Sponges are the simplest form of multi-cellular animals. They are very diverse and come in a large variety of colours, shapes and structural complexities. They range in heights of 1-200cm and in diameters of 1-150cm. They have partially differentiated tissues, and not true tissues. There are a higher number of sponge individuals and sponge species in the tropics of all regions because the water is warmer. They like to live in clearer waters over murky waters formed by currents. The murky waters may often clog the pores on the sponges so the sponge cannot get its nutrition and oxygen to survive.

The Sea Sponge ‘Simple Facts’. The Sea Sponge is not a coral, and is not a plant, rather it is classified as an animal which has neither brain nor central nervous system. Sea Sponges live on the ocean floor, they attach themselves permanently to a solid location under the water and they do not move around. The natural sea sponge is a renewable resource from the sea which has been harvested for over 150yrs. If not harvested, sea sponges have a definitive life span of approximately 10 years, harvesting allows for re-generation and extended life.
Kelp are a type of seaweed. These plants are seen on the shores and beaches of the Pacific Ocean in places like California. They can grow in very cold temperatures lower than 20 degrees C, so they are even found in arctic climates like the oceans of Antarctica. Kelp have a unique ability to grow very fast. Phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are some of the most primitive plants in the ocean. Although they are very tiny, these plants account for a majority of the oxygen that is produced for the air that humans breathe.

Unlike kelp, coral is seen in warm waters. Coral reefs make up a large amount of the ocean's ecosystem. It's estimated that coral supports up to 25 percent of marine life. Coral is not just made up of aquatic plants, but it also has a rocky surface that allows tiny fish and eels to hide within the crevices. Phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are some of the most primitive plants in the ocean. Although they are very tiny, these plants account for a majority of the oxygen that is produced for the air that humans breathe.
