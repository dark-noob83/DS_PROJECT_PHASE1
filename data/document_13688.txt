It is as well present in cane sugar and honey with glucose in mixture form. The polysaccharide inulin is a polymer of fructose and provides just fructose on hydrolysis.
Fructose is, along with glucose, part of sucrose or table sugar. Fructose is a ketohexose, and the only one of the four ketoses that can assume a ring structure. Like ribose, fructose forms a five-membered (or furanose) ring and has α and β anomers.
As physically founding fructose is laevorotatory, it is as well named as laevulose. Fructose, fruit sugar (C6H12O6) or ketohexose. It is exist in abundance in fruits and therefore is named fruit sugar. It is as well present in cane sugar and honey with glucose in mixture form.
1 Fructose is a simple, single unit, Ketohexose, sugar called a monosaccharide. ( 2 see diagram). 3  It is the optical isomer of fructose, d-fructose, also know by its old name levulose, that is the most common, naturally occurring form of fructose. 4  The term ketohexose consists of two parts, keto-and hexose.
It is a ketohexose. Glucose and fructose are formed in equal amounts when sucrose is hydrolyzed by the enzyme invertase or by heating with dilute acid; the resulting equimolar mixture of fructose and glucose, called invert sugar, is the major component of honey. Fructose is a reducing sugar.
