Water is the most overlooked nutrient for horses. The amount of water required by the horse is determined by the magnitude of losses of water from its body. These losses are affected by the amount, type and quality of the feed consumed, environmental conditions and the health, physiological state and physical activity.
The actual daily amount of water that most horses need to consume (at a minimum) to maintain body functions and remain properly hydrated is from a half gallon to a gallon per 100 pounds of body weight.
The amount of water required by the horse is determined by the magnitude of losses of water from its body. These losses occur through faeces, urine, respiratory gases and sweat and, in the case of lactating mares, through milk.
The amount of water a horse requires can vary depending upon several factors (Referenced from: TheHorse.com June 2012): The feed consumed can determine the amount of water required: 1  Fresh pasture has between 60-80% moisture and can provide a large amount of the horse's water requirements when grazing. 2  Hay and grain are very low in moisture, causing horses to drink more water.
Horses at rest in a moderate climate will generally consume between three and seven litres of water per 100kg of bodyweight. This translates to around 4-9 US gallons for an 1100 lb. (500 kg) horse. Diet plays a major role in determining voluntary water intake and requirements.
1 Fresh pasture has between 60-80% moisture and can provide a large amount of the horse's water requirements when grazing. 2  Hay and grain are very low in moisture, causing horses to drink more water.
The average horse will intake 5 to 10 gallons of fresh water per day. Just like humans different horses crave or need different water amount intakes. A horse deprived of feed, but supplied drinking water, is capable of surviving 20 to 25 days. A horse deprived of water may only live up to 3 or 6 days.
