An element is a substance which contains only one kind of atom: lead (Pb), silver (Ag), hydrogen (H2), oxygen (O2). An atom is the smallest particle of an element which exhibits the physical and chemical characteristics of that element. A compound is a substance which contains two or more kinds of atoms: carbon dioxide (CO2), calcium oxide (CaO), sodium hydroxide (NaOH). A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance which exhibits the physical and chemical characteristics of that substance. Monoatomic molecules of elements-Cu, Ag, Na, etc.
Elements are made up of only one kind of atoms. For example graphite and diamond are forms of the element carbon, and only contain carbon atoms. Atoms of a single element may â€¦ combine as molecules, or structurally as allotropes, in a number of ways. I put down Pure substance as well but appearantly the answer was All of the Above which included A.Pure Substance B.Compound C.Element ... so as long as you can prove it was only pure substance(This was for extra credit to get points back on the test for my teacher) You got the points.
Unit 3 Elements Made up of only one type of particle called an Atom. Any substance that is made up of one type of particle is called a pure substance. An element cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical or physical means Gold (Au) is an element. Each particle is the same. Name_________________ Period________________ Fill in the blank: 1. A pure substance is a substance that contains only one type of ___________________. 2. Characteristic properties can be used to ____________substances.
Sugar is a pure substance. It contains only sugar particles. A scoop of sugar made from Canadian sugar beets contains exactly the same kind of particles as a scoop of sugar made from Australian sugar cane. A mixture contains at least two different pure substances, or two different types of particles. A pure The Particle Theory of Matter Table 1 cold Principle Illustration substance A substance B hot 2. 3. 4. All matter is made up of tiny particles. All particles of one substance are the same. Different substances are made of different
A substance that contains only one type of particle is a[n] _____________.? 
Anything that takes up space, has mass, and is made up of particles. Pure Substance. A material that is composed of only one type of particle; examples of a pure substance include gold, oxygen and water. 
It is a mixture containing sugar particles and water particles. A mixture is a type of matter that contains more than one kind of particle. A mixture is made of two or more pure substances mixed together (Figure 3(b)). A piece of aluminum foil contains only one kind of particle. Each aluminum particle is the same as every other aluminum particle. White table sugar is made of only sugar particles.Aluminum and table sugar are both examples of pure substances. A pure substance is a type of matter that contains only one kind of particle (Figure 3(a)). Other examples of pure substances include distilled water and salt. Uranium, used in nuclear power stations to produce electricity, is another pure substance. Water from your tap is not a pure substance
Elements. Any substance that contains only one kind of an atom is known as an element. Because atoms cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, elements such as phosphorus (P 4) or sulfur (S 8) cannot be broken down into simpler substances by these reactions.
