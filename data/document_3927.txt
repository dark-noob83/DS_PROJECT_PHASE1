I think you can find out as early as 16 weeks, but I doctors usually wait until approx. 20 weeks to do that ultrasound. We didn't find out until closer to 24 though.
Answer: An ultrasound is the least invasive way to find out if you are having a boy or a girl. It is best done during the 18-22nd weeks of your pregnancy. Prior to this time the baby may not be well enough developed to get an accurate answer with a gender ultrasound. After this time the baby is more crowded making it more difficult to get a good view.
Having ultrasound to find out your baby’s gender is a fairly straightforward and safe procedure, and many expectant parents want to know this before the baby is born. That way, they can settle on a name for the baby and start decorating the nursery for either a girl or a boy.
Knowing Your Baby’s Sex. One of the most challenging decisions for many couples during pregnancy is whether or not to find out their baby's gender. Recent surveys suggest that between 50% and 70% of expectant couples decide to find out the sex of their child before birth.
At the same time, there are couples who want to wait and choose not to find out the baby’s gender until the moment of birth. They want the discovery of whether the baby is a boy or a girl to be a surprise. The suspense can make pregnancy, labor and delivery more exciting.
Usually between weeks 13-28 you will generally have an ultrasound that can detect the gender of your baby. If you have an ultrasound done during the first part of your s … econd trimester it might be more difficult to tell.
If you wish to know the gender of your baby, it can usually be determined by 20 weeks. Be sure to tell the health care provider performing the ultrasound whether or not you want to know the gender of your baby.
