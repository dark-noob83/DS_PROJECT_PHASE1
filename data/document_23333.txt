From a production of below 1 million tonnes in the early 1950s, production in 2004 was reported to have risen to 59.4 million tonnes, with a value of US$70.3 billion. This represents an average annual increase of 6.9 percent in quantity and 7.7 percent in value over reported figures for 2002.
The culture of aquatic plants has increased consistently, with an average annual growth rate of 8 percent since 1970. In 2006, it contributed 93 percent of the worldâ€™s total supply of aquatic plants, or 15.1 million tonnes (US$7.2 billion), some 72 percent of which was produced by China.
It is noteworthy that the growth of aquaculture production of fish, crustaceans and molluscs within developing countries has exceeded the corresponding growth in developed countries, proceeding at an average annual rate of 10.2 percent since 1970.
Overview. Aquaculture continues to be the fastest growing animal food-producing sector and to outpace population growth. Per capita supply from aquaculture increased from 0.7 kg in 1970 to 7.8 kg in 2006, an average annual growth rate of 6.9 percent. It is set to overtake capture fisheries as a source of food fish.

The total aquaculture areas rose from 2.86 million hectors in 1979 to 5.68 million hectors in 1996, and the production from 1.23 million tons to 15.31 million tons with an annual growth rate of 16%, higher than the rate of total fishery production (11.7%).
Production from aquaculture has greatly outpaced population growth, with per capita supply from aquaculture increasing from 0.7 kg in 1970 to 7.1 kg in 2004, representing an average annual growth rate of 7.1 percent. World aquaculture (food fish and aquatic plants) has grown significantly during the past half-century.
