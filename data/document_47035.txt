Posted by Financial Samurai 51 Comments. The average tax refund is around $3,000 in America according to the IRS. Since saving, or not spending $250 a month is difficult for many, I’m OK with such a refund. With basic savings interest rates close to zero, your opportunity cost is pretty small.
That amount is $2,400. The average income tax refund is up nearly 10% from a year ago, reflecting tax credits included in last year's economic stimulus package, according to IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman.
Taxpayers residing in Connecticut, Nevada and Texas receive the highest average federal tax refunds, according to IRS data. The smallest refund checks go to mailboxes in rural states: Montana, Maine, Vermont and North Dakota.
As of April 27th, nearly two weeks after the end of tax season, the average tax refund dipped slightly from two weeks ago to $2,716 as more returns were filed. They’ve now processed 126.3 million returns of a total 133.5 million received with 99.1 million refunds.
Connecticut taxpayers recorded an average IRS refund of $3,218, the nation’s highest in 2011. Nevada ($3,192), Texas ($3,112), New Jersey ($3,099), New York ($3,071) and Louisiana ($3,006) also all exceeded the $3,000 mark. If we factor in those taxpayers not receiving refunds, averages drop a few hundred dollars.
As of March 22nd, the average tax refund stands at just a hair under three thousand dollars. At this time last year, the average was a little over that amount, sitting at $3,030 (the average for last year would later fall to $2,803 as later filers were accounted for).
The average tax refund in 2012 was $2,700, equaling more than a month's worth of income for two-thirds of taxpayers, or more than three months of groceries for the average family of four, according to the American tax and financial center at TurboTax, a provider of tax preparation software.
