A properly designed mixture possesses the desired workability for the fresh concrete and the required durability and strength for the hardened concrete. Typically, a mix is about 10 to 15 percent cement, 60 to 75 percent aggregate and 15 to 20 percent water. Entrained air in many concrete mixes may also take up another 5 to 8 percent. In its simplest form, concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates, or rocks. The paste, composed of portland cement and water, coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates.

1 High-performance topical coatings, such as epoxies and urethanes, will cost more -- typically $0.50 to $2.50 per square foot. 2  In most cases, the investment in a sealer is well worth the expense, when you consider that the cost to replace concrete is generally $7 to $8 per square foot. To repel water and deicing salts, use an acrylic-resin sealer or reactive penetrating sealers. If you also want to repel oil stains, use a siliconate (a type of reactive penetrating chemical sealer). Owners of newly installed concrete are often told by their contractors to seal the concrete.
Dimensions must be stated in proper order-width, height, and length (WHL). For example, an 8-inch wide, 16-inch long, 4-inch high unit is termed an 8x4x16. Reversing any two dimensions will describe a completely different unit. Using the same example stated as 4x8x16 would indicate a unit 4 inches wide and 8 inches high (not 8 inches wide and 4 inches high). 
I have Extra(Sugarless gum). It's the long lasting time and after 15 minutes the flavor goes down. Depends on how fast ya chew it and if your chewing more than one piece at a … time. But Stride nonstop mint actually is said to last 5 to 6 freaking HOURS! Never tried it-- 'cause it costs around 14$... However it depends on several thing like temperature and moisture. You can typically walk on concrete the next … day but it can be prone to scratching. I generally have my customers wait two days to walk on it and 7-10 days to drive. In summer time on hot days concrete can cure to fast and crack within hours.
A standard concrete block is 7 5/8 in. wide by 7 5/8 in. tall by 15 5/8 in. long. With a 3/8-in. masonry joint, that equates to 8-by-8-by-16 inches when the block is installed in a structure. To reduce weight, concrete blocks usually have two or three hollow cores taking up about 50 percent of the block's volume. Partition or Floor Blocks. Partition and floor blocks are 3 5/8 inches wide by 7 5/8 inches tall by 15 5/8 inches long, which equates to 4 by 8 by 16 inches when installed with a 3/8-inch masonry joint.
Most use of the term concrete refers to Portland cement concrete or to concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, road surfaces are also a type of concrete, asphaltic concrete, where the cement material is bitumen. The world record for the largest concrete pour in a single project is the Three Gorges Dam in Hubei Province, China by the Three Gorges Corporation. The amount of concrete used in the construction of the dam is estimated at 16 million cubic meters over 17 years.
