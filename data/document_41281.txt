O. Introduction. 1  Taste and smell are chemical senses. 2  They give us information about the chemical composition of our surroundings. 3  Taste is an immediate sense-a final checkpoint for the acceptability of food before it enters the body.
(February 2011). The olfactory system is the sensory system used for olfaction, or the sense of smell. Most mammals and reptiles have two distinct parts to their olfactory system: a main olfactory system and an accessory olfactory system.
Olfactory receptor, also called smell receptor, olfaction: humanCreated and produced by QA International. Â© QA International, 2010. All rights reserved. www.qa-international.com protein capable of binding odour molecules that plays a central role in the sense of smell (olfaction). These receptors are common to arthropods, terrestrial vertebrates, fish, and other animals.
The sense of smell, just like the sense of taste, is a chemical sense. They are called chemical senses because they detect chemicals in the environment, with the difference being that smell works at dramatically larger distances than that of taste. The process of smelling goes more or less like this:
1 The cilia of the sensory neurons are immersed in a layer of mucus. 2  Odorant molecules (molecules that we can smell) dissolve in the mucus and. 3  bind to receptors on the cilia.

It contains the afferent nerve fibers of the olfactory receptor neurons, transmitting nerve impulses about odors to the central nervous system, where they are perceived by the sense of smell (olfaction).
