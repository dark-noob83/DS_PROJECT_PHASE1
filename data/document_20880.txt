It's important to understand the differences between preliminary hearings and arraignments, when each occurs, and what each involves. Both arraignments and preliminary hearings happen before your trial. However, they have distinct differences.
Preliminary hearings and arraignments both occur before your trial, but have different purposes. The preliminary hearing is where the judge decides if there is enough evidence mounted against you for you to stand trial.
