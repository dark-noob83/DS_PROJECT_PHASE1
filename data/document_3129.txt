a. Calculate the average cost per patient-day for Finkler Residential Treatment Facility at a volume of 25,000 patient-days and at 30,000patient-days. b. Assume that an HMO offers to generate 5,000 patient-days per year.
The adjusted average cost per patient would reflect the charges reported for the types of cases treated in that year. For example, if Hospital A has an average cost per patient of $1,000 and a CMI of 0.80 for a. given year, their adjusted cost per patient is $1,000 / 0.80 = $1,250. Likewise, if Hospital B has. an average cost per patient of $1,500 and a CMI of 1.25, their adjusted cost per patient is. $1,500 / 1.25 = $1,200. Therefore, if a hospital has a CMI greater than 1.00, their adjusted cost per patient or per day. will be lowered and conversely if a hospital has a CMI less than 1.00, their adjusted cost will be.
