Atherosclerosis (or arteriosclerotic vascular disease) is a condition where the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to an excessive build up of plaque around the artery wall. The disease disrupts the flow of blood around the body, posing serious cardiovascular complications.
Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis are different conditions: 1  Arteriosclerosis is the stiffening or hardening of the artery walls. 2  Atherosclerosis is the narrowing of the artery because of plaque build-up. 3  Atherosclerosis is a specific type of arteri

Heart disease is a serious medical condition in dogs, cats and humans. Cats do not normally develop arteriosclerosis or coronary artery disease, which are both common diseases in humans. In general terms, heart disease can be divided into two categories, congenital and adult onset forms.
Atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is a condition in which plaque builds up inside the arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium and fibrin (a clotting material in the blood). Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis.
A diagram of the aorta. The abdominal aorta is a common site for arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis can be detected through use of a stethoscope. Arteriosclerosis can affect the carotid arteries that supply blood from the heart to the brain. Aspirin therapy is sometimes used to address arteriosclerosis issues.
