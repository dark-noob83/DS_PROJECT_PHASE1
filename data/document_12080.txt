Sometimes the moon appears orange even when it's directly overhead. This occurs when there's a lot of dust, smoke, or pollution in the atmosphere. The size of those particles will determine the type of color you will see. Sometimes the moon will look red, orange...even blue.
The moon is sometimes orange because of refraction. The moon can appear orange when it is low in the sky and when there are a lot of dust particles in the atmosphere. The visible light of the moon is made up of different colors: red, orange, yellow, blue, green and purple (which together appear white). As it approaches Earth, the light of the moon passes through
The Orange Moon. Have you ever wondered why the moon is more orange or yellow in color when it first rises at night. This effect is caused by the atmosphere of the earth. The reason for the orange color is due to the scattering of light by the atmosphere.
That’s why the Moon — and the Sun! — look orange or red when they’re rising or setting. At those times, they’re low in the sky close to the horizon and their light must travel through the maximum amount of atmosphere to reach your eyes.
This is also why sunsets look the way they do. Orange light from the Moon. This is most prominent during a lunar eclipse, when some or all of the sunlight that reaches the Moon is passing through the Earth's atmosphere. The Moon will assume a reddish color due to this light.
The moon can have an orange color at any time of the year. Sometimes the moon appears orange even when it's directly overhead. This occurs when there's a lot of dust, smoke, or pollution in the atmosphere. The size of those particles will determine the type of color you will see.
