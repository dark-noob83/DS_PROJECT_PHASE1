Boron family of elements contains five elements namely boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium. Except boron which is classified as a non metal all other elements of this group are metals. The general electronic configuration of these elements is ns 2 np 1. These elements belong to p block of the periodic table.
The electronic configuration of the boron family is ns2np1. The element of this group are boron, aluminum, gallium, indium and thallium. On moving down the group following characteristic are seen.
Only one member of this family is a metalloid -- boron. The others are classified as metals, forming positive ions by giving up their three outermost electrons. In the Real World. Boron is most commonly found as borax and boric acid, which are used in cleaning compounds.
Boron Family. Boron is the first element of group III A. It has the symbol B. Its atomic number is 5 and atomic mass is 10.81. Boron compounds like borax have been known and used by ancient cultures for thousands of years.
About the Group. The last of the p block families we will be looking at is the boron family -- Group 13. This group includes the elements boron, aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. All five have three electrons in their outer energy level.
The atomic weight of an element is the average mass of a representative sample of atoms of the element expressed in atomic mass units. Atomic mass of boron family elements are given below. Fluoroboric acid is a strong acid and [BF 4 - ] ion is tetrahedral. Boric Acid UsesBoric acid is used inThe manufacture of enamels and glazes for pottery.Making heat resisting and shock resisting glass.Washing eyes.
