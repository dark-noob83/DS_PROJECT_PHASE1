A stye or hordeolum is a small, painful lump on the inside or outside of the eyelid. It is actually an abscess filled with pus and is usually caused by a staphylococcus bacteria eye infection. Styes are common with most people experiencing one or two of them at some stage in their life.
A sty is a bump that forms on or in the eyelid as the result of a blocked gland. The word sty can also be spelled stye. There are two distinct types of styes: hordeolum and chalazion. Each has different causes and treatments. A hordeolum is a blockage of one of the sweat glands or oil glands found in the skin of the eyelid, while a chalazion is a blockage of a meibomian gland, which is a special oil gland unique to the eyelids.
A stye is a painful, red pimple-like lump on the edge of the eyelid. Sometimes the eyelash follicle or oil gland of the eyelid is infected. Though red and often quite painful, swelling usually goes away on its own in a week or so. Despite the potential pain and irritation, styes are usually harmless.

A stye (or sty) is an acute infection of the secretory glands of the eyelids. Frequently, bacteria can enter and infect an eyelid oil gland, which are present in both the upper and lower eyelids, causing increased inflammation, pain, and redness of the eye, and even redness of the surrounding eyelid and cheek tissue.
