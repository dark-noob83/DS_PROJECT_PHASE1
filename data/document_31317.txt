Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited (genetic) condition which affects the muscles, causing muscle weakness. It is a serious condition which starts in early childhood. The muscle weakness is mainly in the 'proximal' muscles, which are those near the trunk of the body, around the hips and the shoulders. Therefore, boys with the DMD gene always have symptoms of the disease. The DMD gene can be passed on from parent to child. For a woman who carries the DMD gene, there is a 1 in 2 chance that her sons will have DMD, and a 1 in 2 chance that her daughters will carry the gene.
Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic conditions characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy). The Duchenne and Becker types of muscular dystrophy are two related conditions that primarily affect skeletal muscles, which are used for movement, and heart (cardiac) muscle. Both the Duchenne and Becker forms of muscular dystrophy are associated with a heart condition called cardiomyopathy. This form of heart disease weakens the cardiac muscle, preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. In both Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy typically begins in adolescence.
DMD, the largest known human gene, provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. This protein is located primarily in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. Small amounts of dystrophin are present in nerve cells in the brain. The damaged cells weaken and die over time, causing the characteristic muscle weakness and heart problems seen in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Genetics Home Reference provides information about familial dilated cardiomyopathy, which is also associated with changes in the DMD gene.
Because the Duchenne gene is found on the X-chromosome, it primarily affects boys; however, it occurs across all races and cultures. Duchenne results in progressive loss of strength and is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for dystrophin. Because dystrophin is absent, the muscle cells are easily damaged. 
A number sign (#) is used with this entry because Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutation in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD; 300377). Description. Dystrophin-associated muscular dystrophies range from the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD; 300376). (1979) found DMD with X-1 translocation and suggested that the DMD locus is at Xp1106 or Xp2107. A number of females with X-autosome translocations with the breakpoint in the Xp21 band have shown Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Inheritance properties of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Disease inherited from: Usually inherited by males from their mother who is a carrier; see inheritance of x-linked recessive diseases. Gender bias in inheritance: Males only get x-linked recessive diseases; females are carriers. About inheritance and genetics: Inheritance of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy refers to whether the condition is inherited from your parents or runs in families. The level of inheritance of a condition depends on how important genetics are to the disease.
When this protein is missing, muscle cells literally explode as material from outside the cell walls leaks in raising cell pressure. Mutations in the DMD gene can cause a muscle-wasting disorder, called Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or its milder form, Becker muscular dystrophy.

A boy gets an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father. Only the X chromosome can have the changed gene that causes DBMD. Females almost never have DBMD because they have two X chromosomes. 
Mutations in the DMD gene cause the Duchenne and Becker forms of muscular dystrophy. The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. This protein is located primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. Both the Duchenne and Becker forms of muscular dystrophy are associated with a heart condition called cardiomyopathy. This form of heart disease weakens the cardiac muscle, preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. In both Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy typically begins in adolescence.
The dystrophin gene is the largest gene found in nature, measuring 2.4 Mb. The gene was identified through a positional cloning approach, targeted at the isolation of the gene responsible for Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) Muscular Dystrophies.
