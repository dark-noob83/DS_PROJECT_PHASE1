These medical condition or symptom topics may be relevant to medical information for Dicrotic wave:
Arterial Pressure Waveforms. The pumping of the heart results in the development of pressure in the aorta and the arteries. If pressure in the aorta is recorded over time a pressure wave can be observed: Many factors influence the aortic pressure waveform.
in the caudal process of the cartilage of the pig's ear separating it from the tragus and antitragus. aortic notch. a small downward deflection in the arterial pulse or pressure contour immediately following the closure of the semilunar valves, sometimes used as a marker for the end of systole or the ejection period. Called also dicrotic notch.
The pulse pressure wave on the left was recorded in a smaller peripheral artery, while the pressure wave on the right was recorded from the aorta. Notice the dip in the arterial pressure waveform occurring on the descending part of the wave (dicrotic limb). This is referred to as the dicrotic notch.
The various parts of a cycle are described by the phase of the wave; all waves are referenced to an imaginary synchronous motion in a circle; thus the phase is measured in angular degrees, one complete cycle being 360Â°.

We report an unusual cause of a dicrotic pulse that was detected in a patient with no underlying cardiac disease. We postulate that this was the result of elastic recoil from a huge abdominal aortic aneurysm.
aortic notch (dicrotic notch) a small downward deflection in the arterial pulse or pressure contour immediately following the closure of the semilunar valves, sometimes used as a marker for the end of systole or the ejection period. Called also dicrotic notch.
