The pet scan look for tumor activity. Hypermetabolic state means that cancer is likely to be present in these lymph nodes as shown by increased uptake and that is why you would need chemo on an ongoing basis.
Recent PET scan shows hypermetabolic lymph nodes. My oncologist says this could be mets but more likely isn't because of no enlargement and the pattern of activity (symetrical) is not suggestive of mets. doctor recommends follow up PET scan in three months to see if there is any growth.
Lymphadenopathy is the disease or enlargement of lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small round structures that are present all over the body. They house cells (most commonly white … blood cells) that are involved in protecting the human body from infections.
Hypermetabolic lymph nodes could be from infection, some inflammatory process, like an auto-immune disease (not great, but it beats a cancer diagnosis). Of course, it’s also concerning for possible cancer, but a biopsy provides the ultimate answer. Good luck. -Dr.
Yes, it’s possible. Hypermetabolic lymph nodes could be from infection, some inflammatory process, like an auto-immune disease (not great, but it beats a cancer diagnosis). Of course, it’s also concerning for possible cancer, but a biopsy provides the ultimate answer. Good luck. -Dr.
My pet scan report says there is hypermetabolic activity in an enlarged lymph node in the right upper anterior chest wall and slightly increased activity in subcarinal area with a lymph node which is upper normal in size. I am a breast cancer surviror having a mascectomy of the left breast.
