The answer to how are igneous rocks formed is pretty straight forward: Igneous rocks are called fire rocks and are formed either underground or above ground. Underground, they are formed when magma deep within the Earth becomes trapped in small pockets. As these pockets of magma cool slowly they become igneous rocks. Igneous rocks are also formed when volcanoes erupt. Igneous rocks are formed as the lava cools above ground. The upper 16 km of the Earth’s crust is composed of 95% igneous rock. Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies underground. Extrusive igneous rocks are formed at the crust’s surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks and are fine grained.
An Igneous rock is the product of cooled solidified magma/lava. As magma/lava cools it goes through the process of crystallization which turns it into an igneous rock. The amount of time it takes for an igneous rock to form depends on its location and its composition. There are two types of igneous rocks; Extrusive and Intrusive. On the other hand an Intrusive igneous rock cools very slowly beneath the surface and is created by magma. Since the cooling process is very slow intrusive igneous rocks have very large crystals (coarse grained). In some instances there is also a third type of

When magma cools and hardens below the Earth's surface, an intrusive igneous rock forms. Because the process of the formation of intrusive igneous rock occurs slowly, these rocks tend to have a grainy texture. Examples of intrusive igneous rock include granite and gabbro. Rocks are classified by the way they form. Igneous rocks are those that form when magma cools and hardens. This process can occur on the Earth's surface or underground. The exact location of the formation of the rock determines the type of igneous rock it is. Interesting Igneous Rocks Facts:
Yes, an igneous rock forms when lava is cooled. It is called an extrusive igneous rock (because lava is extruded onto the surface of the earth).

Then, lava cools and hardens above earth's surface and later forms an ex
Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks.
Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust
Any rock that forms from the cooling of magma is an igneous rock. Magma that cools quickly forms one kind of igneous rock, and magma that cools slowly forms another kind. When magma rises from deep within the earth and explodes out of a volcano, it is called lava, and it cools quickly on the surface. Rock formed in this way is called extrusive
Igneous rocks are formed around hot spots when there is an increase  in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition.
