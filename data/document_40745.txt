— Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge. Cooler (クウラ) is the main villain in the movie Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge and an emulation of him acts as the main villain in Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler. He is the older brother of Frieza, and the eldest son of King Cold.
When Goku was fighting Frieza in regular form, Frieza was beating the crap out of him. When Goku was fighting Cooler in regular form, it was pretty even. Then when Goku went Super Sayian in the fight against Frieza, Goku started to win. But then Frieza went 100%, and it was even. When Goku fought Cooler, Cooler went to his fifth form and started beating Goku. Then Goku went Super Sayian and Cooler had no chance. Sooooooooooooooooooooo, if Frieza would have reached fifth form, Goku would have
Goku and Vegeta then arrive, and Freeza and Goku begin fighting, with Frieza going straight to his newly mastered final form, and Goku using his Saiyan beyond God form (his base form, but with the power of Super Saiyan God).
In response Cooler takes on his Fifth Form, and Frieza powers up to Full Power, and then takes on a Fifth Form of his own. He and Cooler attack Vegeta with a Death Cannon/Death Flash combo, but Vegeta counters with his Final Garlic Cannon and obliterates them.
Cooler's appearance in his base form is similar to that of Frieza's Final Form, though Cooler's skin is deep-purple as opposed to the pure white of his brother. Cooler is also much taller than Frieza, being roughly the same height as Goku.
