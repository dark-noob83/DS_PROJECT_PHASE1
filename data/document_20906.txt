With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible. Most people who get HPV vaccine do not have any problems with it.
After the MMR vaccination. MMR is made up of three different vaccines (measles, mumps and rubella) and these can each cause reactions at different times after the injection. After six to ten days, the measles vaccine may cause a fever, a measles-like rash, and loss of appetite. Three to four weeks after the injection, the mumps vaccine may cause mumps-like symptoms in some children (fever and swollen glands). The rubella vaccine may cause a brief rash and possibly a slightly raised temperature, most commonly around 12 to 14 day
The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). Many children in the U.S. are immunized as infants and toddlers, but that doesn't guarantee lifetime protection. And not everyone gets vaccinated as a child. Many adults move to the U.S. from countries without immunization programs. The three diseases covered by the MMR vaccine -- measles, mumps, and rubella -- are highly contagious. Viruses cause all three of these illnesses, and they spread through the air.

MMR vaccine side effects. The MMR vaccine is very safe and most side effects are mild and short-lived.
