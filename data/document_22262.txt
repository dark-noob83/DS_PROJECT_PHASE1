Using commercial pesticides in your yard is generally considered safe as long as you follow the instructions on the label. Still, many common pesticides -- like Roundup -- pose risks to your four-legged companions.
Roundup, made by Monsanto, is the most popular weed killer in the world, used by agricultural corporations and weekend gardeners alike. Though it's been around since the 1970s, questions about the safety of Roundup continue to swirl around the herbicide.
Information from Monsanto suggests Roundup to be safe for use around bird such as chickens; however, you may still have doubts about using herbicides, especially if your chickens are free range. In this case, consider using a more natural means of weed control. Use boiling water to scald weeds.
