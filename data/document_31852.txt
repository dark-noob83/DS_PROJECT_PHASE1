At 9:18 a.m. on April 10, 1963, sonar operators aboard the U.S. Navy submarine rescue ship Skylark, which was accompanying the nuclear attack submarine Thresher, heard a chilling sound like air rushing into an air tank, and Thresher was no more. Most submarines are built to survive down to a crush depth, which can be 20 to 35 percent greater than their maximum test depth. However, without the reactor, the sub would not have had enough power to stop itself from sinking to the bottom.
Rule interprets the communication 900 from the Thresher at 09:17 as a reference to test depth, signifying that the Thresher was nine hundred feet below its test depth of 1,300, or 2,200 feet below sea level. Thresher likely imploded at a depth of 1,300–2,000 ft (400–610 m). The Navy has periodically monitored the environmental conditions of the site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. Naval nuclear-powered craft.

In a dockside simulation of flooding in the engine room, held before Thresher sailed, it took the watch in charge 20 minutes to isolate a simulated leak in the auxiliary seawater system. At test depth, taking on water, and with the reactor shut down, Thresher would not have had 20 minutes to recover. Even after isolating a short-circuit in the reactor controls, it would have taken nearly 10 minutes to restart the plant. Thresher likely imploded at a depth of 1,300–2,000 ft (400–610 m). The Navy has periodically monitored the environmental conditions of the site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. Naval nuclear-powered craft.
The USS Thresher (SSN-593) was a nuclear submarine that sank off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts on April 10th, 1963. The disaster made headlines nationwide and led to an extensive inquiry by both the Navy board and Congress. 
The resulting spray shorted out electronics and forced an automatic shutdown of the nuclear reactor. Creaking Death. When the accident occurred, Thresher was near its maximum test depth, which, though classified, was probably around 1,300 feet (396 meters). Most submarines are built to survive down to a crush depth, which can be 20 to 35 percent greater than their maximum test depth. However, without the reactor, the sub would not have had enough power to stop itself from sinking to the bottom.
USS Thresher (SS-200) , a Tambor-class submarine, was the first United States Navy ship to be named for the thresher shark. Her keel was laid down 27 May 1939 at the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. 
This tribute is dedicated to the 129 Brave Men who lost thier lives when the USS Thresher SSN 593 went down off the coast of New Hampshire on Wednesday April 10, 1963. The Ship and its Crew now rests at a depth of 8,400 Ft. God Bless the men lost on the mighty warship USS Thresher. 
Without propulsion and heavy, THRESHER sank to collapse (pressure-hull and all internal bulkheads) in one-tenth of a second at an estimated depth of 2400-feet with an energy release many multiples of the USS SCORPION (SSN 589) collapse event energy release of 11.77 GJ (13,200 lbs of TNT) (UPDI)).
