Suppose we eat one ounce of celery filled with one ounce of peanut butter. That makes 2 ounces of food containing a total of 171.2 calories (4.5 + 166.7). Divide by 2 and we have a snack with 85.6 calories per ounce. The calorie density is way too high and will contribute to weight gain. Maybe we love peanut butter and we just have to have some with our celery. An ounce of celery contains 4.5 calories and an ounce of peanut butter has 166.7 calories. The calorie density of celery is 4.5 and the calorie density of peanut butter is 166.7.
Another way to calculate this is by using the calories in one cup of sugar, 770, and using that figure to calculate the number of calories in one ounce. There are eight ounces in one cup, and 770 divided by eight is 96.25. 96 calories in one ounce of sugar for the win. Note that this is one ounce by volume, not by weight. There are 6 teaspoons in one (dry) ounce. A teaspoon of sugar has 16 calories. Therefore, 6 x 16 = 96 calories per ounce of sugar. This is completely wrong. An ounce of sugar … (slightly more than ONE teapspoon) has around 19 calories. Sadly, no. According to the Exploratorium's chart of measurement equivalents (see link) a teaspoon is equivalent in volume to 5 grams. There are 28 grams in an ounce, so roughly 6 teaspoons in an ounce
