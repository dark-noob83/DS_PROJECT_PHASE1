1 It's possible to custom-build an 800-square-foot dome house for $1 million or a 12,000-square-foot rural ranch house for $400,000. 2  However, the $400,000 custom-built house is the exception rather than the rule. 1 A great deal depends on location plus the complexity of the project and the quality of the materials chosen. 2  It's possible to custom-build an 800-square-foot dome house for $1 million or a 12,000-square-foot rural ranch house for $400,000. 3
One has a fiberglass tub in the master bath (about $500), and one has a $5,000 whirlpool tub. That one change adds $4,500 to the cost of the house, but more importantly, it changes the “square foot” cost of the house by almost $1.50 per square foot. Perhaps you were quoted a base cost of $120 per square foot for your house. Add the tub, and it’s gone to $121.50. Add hardwood, granite, under-mounted sinks, brass hardware and other upgrades, and suddenly you’re at $140 per square foot and way out of your budget.
The cost per square foot is often higher for a small home than that of a larger home. When building a larger home, the cost of expensive items (such as a furnace or kitchen) is spread over more square footage. Consequently, a larger home may have a lower square footage cost than a smaller home. Also, it usually costs less to build a two-story home when compared to a one-story home that has the same square footage. This is because a two-story home will have a smaller roof and foundation. Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100. Use several new homes in your area to get an approximate square footage price
Let's begin by considering what square foot homebuilding costs really are — nothing more than the total cost of the home divided by the total number of square feet in that home. So, a 2,000 square foot home with total construction costs of $250,000 would cost $125 per square foot to build. A new house will probably cost between $100 and $250 per square foot. Yes, that is a huge range and here's why: In one form or another, this is one of the most frequent questions we hear. Unfortunately, it is also one of the few questions that we simply cannot answer very specifically.
Not all custom homes are designed by an architect. Custom home design companies may create custom home plans as well. Their costs typically range from $1.50 per square foot to more than $2.50 per square foot for the total project and home size. For smaller homes, this may be a budget-friendly option. However, for larger homes, this can be a substantial budget item. 
Too much space can be uncomfortable too. Our conclusion is that in order to build a true luxury home, the cost of the lot alone would be about a million dollars. Average construction costs would be $300 per square-foot, making a 3000 square-foot home cost about $900,000 and a 5000 square-foot home cost $1,500,000. The architect fees could be up to $300,000. So the average cost to build a luxury home could be approximately 2.2 million to 2.8 million at the average cost per-square-foot, if you include the lot. In some areas the average cost to build a luxury home could be twice that amount, or more. 
Show me a house design, and with a few specific questions, I can place it within a rough range of cost. That’s a start, but for a 2,500-square-foot custom home, even a range of $20 per square foot is a lot of money. You most definitely don’t want your cost estimate on a $250,000 house to be off by $50,000! With a little research, square-foot pricing can be a useful tool to get you “in the ballpark” — but that’s all. Perhaps you were quoted a base cost of $120 per square foot for your house. Add the tub, and it’s gone to $121.50. Add hardwood, granite, under-mounted sinks, brass hardware and other upgrades, and suddenly you’re at $140 per square foot and way out of your budget.
