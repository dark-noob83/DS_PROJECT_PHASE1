Also known as cranial nerve X, the vagus forms part of the involuntary nervous system and commands unconscious body procedures, such as keeping the heart rate constant and controlling food digestion.
The vagus nerve provides a speedy line of information to the brain from the gut, where battles with bacteria and viruses are continually raging. Knowledge of the vagus's role was a mystery until very recently, but we now know that you can learn about your body from your vagus.
The vagus nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves, which conduct impulses between the brain and other parts of the brain and va rious body structures, mostly in the head and neck. The vagus nerve-the longest of the cranial nerves-also extends to organs in the chest and abdomen.
The vagus nerve is one of 12 cranial nerves. It is the longest of the cranial nerves, extending from the brainstem to the abdomen by way of multiple organs including the heart, esophagus, and lungs.
The longest nerve directly from the brain, the vagus sends messages to and receives messages from your gut and every other organ in your body. Because 85 percent of this huge nerve carries information back to the brain, it's the main mechanism by which your brain audits
The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve. It contains motor and sensory fibers and, because it passes through the neck and thorax to the abdomen, has the widest distribution in the body. It contains somatic and visceral afferent fibers, as well as general and special visceral efferent fibers. (See Table 1, below.).
Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, called vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), is sometimes used to treat people with epilepsy or depression. The vagus nerve is involved in one of the most common causes of fainting, called vasovagal syncope. This is an overreaction of the body to certain stimuli, like the sight of blood, which involves the stimulation of the vagus nerve. This stimulation causes a drop in blood pressure and heart rate.
