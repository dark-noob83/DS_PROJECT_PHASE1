Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. (1 Peter 1:3). This verse contains several enlightening words: Blessed: The word in Greek means to be well spoken of, or praised. According to. This does not say that we are blessed according to the extent of His mercy, but rather, that He was impelled by His abundant mercy to save us. Begotten: A child is begotten of parents and is of the same nature as its parents. We are begotten into God's family by the work of Christ. Again. There are two possible concepts which are attached to the term born again--born the second time, or born from above..
This great declaration of Easter hope is an especially good place with which to begin our celebration of the Authorised Version (AV), a translation that can bless us in so many different ways. Peter speaks of having been ‘begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead’. And well he might, for he was a man who knew what it was to have lost hope altogether. He had lost hope in everything, and most of all in himself. On Good Friday Peter had witnessed the death of his hope.
