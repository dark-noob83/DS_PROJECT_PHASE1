1 There may be separate charges for an initial exam ($20-$100 or more) and dental X-rays ($10-$250). 2  If the tooth has extensive decay, become infected or been injured, a root canal ($300-$1,500 for a front tooth, $500-$2,000 for a molar) might be needed before the crown can be installed.
1 All-porcelain crowns require a higher level of skill and take more time to install than metal or porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns, and can cost $800-$3,000 or more per tooth. 2  CostHelper readers without insurance report paying $860-$3,000, at an average cost of $1,430.
Typically, the price of a CEREC crown ranges from $500 to $850, depending on your location. Some dentists offer payment plans, to help stretch the cost of your treatment.
Using Dr. Reinitzâ€™s same numbers ($150 lab bill, 40 units a month), the practice would spend $2,000 on CEREC and $2,000 to set up the chair for the patient, for a total of $4,000 per month. The time is the same; blocks and impression materials are a wash.
The cost of Porcelain dental crowns is based on various factors. The porcelain dental crown cost at StarBrite Dental is US $ 899 (With limited time coupon). We use the latest All-Ceramic Crown and mill it in our own facility using the Sirona CEREC machine.
1 If a large area of tooth is missing because of decay or damage, there may be an additional charge of $150-$250 or more to build up the tooth (although some dentists include this cost in their quoted price for a crown).
1 Metal crowns of gold alloy (called high noble metal) or of base metal alloys (non-noble) can cost $600-$2,500 or more per tooth. 2  CostHelper readers without insurance report paying $830-$2,465 for a metal crown, at an average cost of $1,353.
His first point is that the CEREC machine costs $100,000, which equates to a payment of $2,000 a month. This is an accurate statement and, if you do the math, the payments add up to be approximately $125,000 over a five-year period.
1 Porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns can cost $500-$1,500 or more per tooth. 2  For example, CostHelper readers without insurance coverage report paying $875-$1,400 for porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns, at an average cost of $1,093.
Having said that, the first important consideration is the cost of the purchase or lease of a CEREC machine. The unit cost is approximately $100,000, and during five years the monthly lease/note payment is approximately $2,000. Second, while the CEREC machine can do a lot, it cannot totally replace the laboratory.
