The average salary of a WNBA player for the 2012 season was $72,000 while the league minimum rests just above $35,000 for rookies.
In the WNBA, most coaches make more than double the salaries of their star players. Numerous coaches in the league are making in the range of $250,000 -- some as much as $300,000. Think about that for a second.
Diana Taurasi is one of the highest-paid players in the WNBA with a salary of $107,000 per season. According to ESPN, 36 other players approach that same salary.
The salary cap for a WNBA team doesn’t even reach the $1 million mark. It sits at $878,000. The NBA’s is $58 million. On top of that, you don’t have to be a genius to see that not as many people are buying tickets to WNBA games or buying as much merchandise.
Talk about unequal pay: The most a WNBA player can make in a season is $105,000. The Atlanta Hawks' Joe Johnson this season will make more than $272,000 -- per game. Agent Bruce Levy said players can add to the average $72,000 WNBA salary by playing overseas, where a typical seven-month contract starts at $40,000.
It’s important to note that the WNBA, unlike the NBA, forbids publicly disclosing the details of a player’s contract/salary. The WNBA consists of 12 teams with 12-player rosters and a minimum salary of $37,950. The maximum (for players who have played at least six seasons) is $107,000.
That’s just barely over six figures. The average salary of a WNBA player for the 2012 season was $72,000 while the league minimum rests just above $35,000 for rookies. Players with three or more years experience earn at least $51,000. $72,000 is still a decent check to people earning thousands lesser.
LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Derrick Rose all make millions. Tamika Catchings, Candace Parker and Diana Taurasi do not, at least not in the WNBA. To get a sense of the pay difference between the two leagues, the WNBA salary cap for 2012 is $878,000 per team and the maximum salary for a player is $105,000.
The salary disparity between the players in the NBA and sister league WNBA is vast. But most people probably can’t fathom just how large that gap really is. The average salary of a WNBA player is estimated to be around $72,000, according to the Examiner’s examination of the 2013 salaries.
