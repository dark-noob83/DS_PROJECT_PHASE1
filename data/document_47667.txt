Basically, how long do tattoos take to heal (mine would probably be 3 in. by 3 in. at biggest)? Do color tattoos take longer to heal than black ones? And since it's summer can I swim and stuff with my healing tattoo (obviously not the next day but a couple days after?).

Avoid soaking the tattoo. Until your tattoo is fully healed, you should avoid swimming in a pool, in the sea, or even soaking in the bathtub. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, exposing your tattoo to too much water may draw ink out of your skin and damage the tattoos appearance. Carefully remove the bandage. The jury is still out on how long a bandage should be left on before it is removed. Most artists agree that you should keep your tattoo covered for a minimum of two hours before removing, but the recommended maximum amount of time varies between 4 and 6 hours.
A tattoo normally takes anywhere from 7 to 14 days to look fully healed, depending on the type, style, size and placement. The truth is that it can really take up to a month for a tattoo to be fully healed below the surface of the skin and for your body’s natural healing abilities to lock the ink in completely. Your tattoo and skin need to breath to heal properly and quickly. You should reapply 3-5 times daily depending on the size, location and condition of your skin. If it looks dried out, then put a small amount on.

Anywhere from 2 or 3 weeks to 2 months depending on how much irritation it gets, where it is, how you take care of it, etc. If you have to wear boots all day getting a tattoo on your foot is not the best idea. You need to be able to leave it clear, let it heal and not be rubbed against and sweated on all the time. RE: How long does it take for a tattoo to heal? OK so I&#39;m thinking about getting a tattoo on my foot-the problem is I have to wear boots to work and there is a lot of walking involved.
First sitting, subsequent sittings, touch-ups. First sitting tattoos will probably take the longest to heal – all going well, and depending on the above factors (oh and if you are using TINKture, as directed) your new ink should be healed between 7-14 days. Certain colours are harder to heal than others (red is the hardest), some people’s bodies accept ink colours better than others but if you do experience a reaction to an ink colour(s) or pigment rejection, expect the tattoo to take up to a week longer to heal.
Best Answer: You'll have PLENTY of time for your tattoo to heal. It takes me about a week and a half for the tattoo to be completely flake-free and looking great. I tan very dark as well and I've never had a problem with my tats in the sun. 
Subsequent sittings can take just as long if your sitting is a lengthy one and in a new area (but the same tattoo) – if it’s just to complete some colours or add shading, the healing stage should be a little quicker – touch ups usually heal even quicker (7 days). Again, this is if you are using TINKture as directed. Certain colours are harder to heal than others (red is the hardest), some people’s bodies accept ink colours better than others but if you do experience a reaction to an ink colour(s) or pigment rejection, expect the tattoo to take up to a week longer to heal.

Best Answer: A tattoo will surface heal in approx. one week, varying from person to person, but the healing process beneath will take 1-3 months, during which time strong sunlight and extremes of temperature should be avoided. Make sure you clean your tattoo and use an oniment such as Savlon whilst it's still healing. So does my mates. And we all use Bepanthen after a new tattoo. It takes about 2 weeks to fully heal. Depends what part of the bodt.
It must be healed before you even think about getting in the water. Tattoos take anywhere from two weeks to a months to heal, it can be longer though. Color should not effect healing. If you can't stay out of the water for that long, wait until the following fall to get the tattoo, that way you won't have to miss out. crazzy_nascar_chick · 6 years ago. Thumbs up.

Continue to wash and moisturize your tattoo three to five times a day. You should continue to wash your tattoo with anti-bacterial soap and warm water until it is fully healed. This can take anywhere from 3 to 6 six weeks, depending on the size and location of the tattoo. Carefully remove the bandage.
