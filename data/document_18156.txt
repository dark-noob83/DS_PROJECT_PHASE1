By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Definition: An acetal is an organic molecule where two separate oxygen atoms are single bonded to a central carbon atom. Acetals have the general structure of R 2 C(OR') 2.
acetal. 1. any of a class of organic compounds formed by combination of an aldehyde molecule with two alcohol molecules. 2. CH 3 CH(OC 2 H 5) 2, a colorless volatile liquid used as a solvent and in cosmetics.
Delrin® is a homo-polymer Acetal produced by Dupont. The generic Acetal covers both the homo-polymer Delrin® and the co-polymer grades of resin. Both materials meet the ASTM-D-4181, ASTM-D-6100 or ASTM-D-6778 specification (an old call out is L-P-392). Homo-polymer is POM111, and Co-polymer is POM211.
An acetal is a functional group with the following connectivity R 2 C(OR') 2, where both R' groups are organic fragments. The central carbon atom has four bonds to it, and is therefore saturated and has tetrahedral geometry. The two R'O groups may be equivalent to each other or not.
The plastic known as acetal is a polyacetal of formaldehyde. Acetals are used as protecting groups for carbonyl groups in organic synthesis as they are stable with respect to hydrolysis by bases and with respect to many oxidizing and reducing agents.

Acetal Homopolymer (Delrin®). Delrin® is a crystalline plastic which offers an excellent balance of properties that bridge the gap between metals and plastics. Delrin® sheets and rods possess high tensile strength, creep resistance and toughness.
