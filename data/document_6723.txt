Feed: The amount of feed your chickens will eat will depend on the breed(s) you choose. Also, I noticed you said you would be free ranging during the day. I to free range my birds, I have 12 birds(several different breeds) and they go through a 50 pound bag of feed every 4 to 5 weeks. Also, include the cost of a chicken coop, waterer and a fence because we are planing to have free range chickens during the day. Answer: I am going to answer your question from the most economical way of starting out with chickens. First, lets get the vet issue out of the way.
adel97. I think there are a lot of variables to consider. Feed cost for 2 - 4 chickens will be relatively small since a 50 lb bag will last quite a while. I use pine shavings, and I use about 1 50 lb bag/month. There's the upfront cost for waterers and feeders, and if you electrify the coop, there's costs for installation and energy usage. 
Well it depends on where you get them and what type of chicken they are. You have to buy a minimum of 5 so you have to buy 5 or more. Tractor supply sells them but not until s â€¦ ometime in February thru early august. They sell 5 for about $25.00 but you still have to buy a coop $100.00, feed $10.00.....etc.... The price depends. if you buy them at chicks, they can cost anywhere from $1.50 to $6. If you buy them once they're all grown up, they will be more expensive, anywhere from $10 to $25.
Wood shavings cost around $6.00 (.276 cubic meter loose and .092 cubic meters compressed). Straw will cost you between $3.00 and $12.00 per bale, depending on availability, quality and size of order. Sawdust pellets will cost around $4.00 per 40 lbs bag. How much a chicken will eat is near impossible to say. Certain breeds, Leghorns for example, are not big eaters.
Grower and all flock feed for older chickens will cost around $17.00 per 50 lbs bag and layer pellets between $15.00 and $30.00 per 50 lbs bag, depending again on brand and whether you buy organic/regular.

What Chickens Cost. Since the beginning of this adventure, I've tracked feed and building costs, along with sales to friends and associates, but not actual egg production.

If you decide to raise your own chicks you can expect to pay $3.00 and $5.00 per chick (day-old) for popular breeds and for rare breeds you can expect to pay up to $50.00 or more per chick.

Each adult chicken will eat approximately 1/4 pound of feed per day. A bag of purchased layer feed is 50 pounds and costs me approximately $35 (you may be able to get it cheaper where you live). That is about 17.5 cents a day per chicken. The average multi-purpose hen will lay approximately 260 eggs per year at peak performance. How much does it really cost to feed chickens in return for eggs, is it really worth it or should I just buy them from the store or a neighbors. My first thought is that it's a no brainer. I know eggs from free range hens are much healthier than anything store bought and I love having chickens around.
