Used predominantly in geometry, solid state physics, and mineralogy, particularly in describing crystal structure, a primitive cell is a minimum volume cell corresponding to a single lattice point of a structure with translational symmetry in 2 dimensions, 3 dimensions, or other dimensions. A primitive unit is a section of the tiling (usually a parallelogram or a set of neighboring tiles) that generates the whole tiling using only translations, and is as small as possible. The primitive cell is a fundamental domain with respect to translational symmetry only.

Ionic solids— Made up of positive and negative ions and held together by electrostatic attractions. They’re characterized by very high melting points and brittleness and are poor conductors in the solid state. An example of an ionic solid is table salt, NaCl. Molecular solids— Made up of atoms or molecules held together by London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces, or hydrogen bonds. Characterized by low melting points and flexibility and are poor conductors. An example of a molecular solid is sucrose.
Solids have definite shapes and definite volumes and are not compressible to any extent. There are two main categories of solids—crystalline solids and amorphous solids. Crystalline solids are those in which the atoms, ions, or molecules that make up the solid exist in a regular, well-defined arrangement. Molecular solids— Made up of atoms or molecules held together by London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces, or hydrogen bonds. Characterized by low melting points and flexibility and are poor conductors. An example of a molecular solid is sucrose.

We will look briefly at bonding in solids, and conclude the chapter by tying the three states together in what is known as a phase diagram. 12.1 Solids and their properties Solids can be pure substances or mixtures, crystalline or amorphous. 12.4 Other Types of Crystalline Solids. It would be wrong to leave you with the impression that all ionic solids are simple, and that only ionic compounds form crystals with lattice points all‐in‐a‐row. Let’s take a quick look at a few solids that are more complicated.
The smallest repeating pattern of crystalline solids is known as the unit cell, and unit cells are like bricks in a wall—they are all identical and repeating. The other main type of solids are called the amorphous solids. Molecular solids— Made up of atoms or molecules held together by London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces, or hydrogen bonds. Characterized by low melting points and flexibility and are poor conductors. An example of a molecular solid is sucrose.
