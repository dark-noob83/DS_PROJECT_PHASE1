After preparing a good location, you are ready to start planting your strawberry plugs. Make sure your plugs are watered thoroughly before planting. Space your plugs 12 -18 inches apart in the row. Optimal spacing between rows is 3 - 4 feet apart for maximum air movement and sunlight.
Planting bare-root strawberries is an economical method of propagation for these early-summer, fruit-bearing plants. Strawberries will grow in most any soil as long as it is a well-drained soil. According to Utah State University, the growing site must have access to full sun and orientated on a north-facing slope.
Spacing. Spacing for strawberry plants depends on the plant variety. June-bearing strawberries should be spaced 1 to 2 feet apart, according to the University of Rhode Island Landscape Horticulture program recommendations. Leave 36 to 40 inches between rows.
Step 5. Firm the soil around the strawberry plant with your foot. Pour a cup of water around the roots of the plant. Set your strawberry plants 18 to 24 inches apart. Daughter plants grown on runners will fill in the rows. Set your rows 36 to 48 inches apart, depending on how much room you need to care for the strawberry plants.
Bare-root strawberries begin growing once you plant them. Bare-root strawberries are dormant. Their bare roots allow you to inspect them to find the healthiest plants, and they begin growing once you plant them. The roots can dry out, though, if you don't plant bare-root strawberries right away. A temporary home in a container keeps the roots protected until you are able to transfer the strawberry plants to the garden. A properly prepared garden plot and correct positioning is key to a thriving strawberry crop.
Plant the bare-root plants in a raised bed to reduce the risk of rotting roots. Test the soil in the planting area to check for a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.
