Water is important for our overall health and keeping sufficiently hydrated is important in almost any activity our body undergoes, but the specific advice to drink a glass of water 30 minutes before a meal to aid in digestion is ultimately baseless. Whilst we ve stated numerous times in this article that drinking water and keeping sufficiently hydrated is important to your overall health, it is important to know that drinking water specifically before bed has absolutely no effect on whether you will ultimately suffer from a heart attack or stroke.
The Correct Way to Drink Water: 1.Drink water when you wake up. Your body loses water while you sleep, so drink a glass before you go to sleep and another glass when you wake up. You are naturally thirsty or dehydrated in the morning. Drinking water in the morning helps flush out the toxins that have accumulated all night. 1. Drink water when you wake up.

Likewise, the belief that increasing one's water intake would be a good and healthful thing to do is also well traveled; many people continue to believe (erroneously, it turns out) that 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated and that to stay healthy folks must drink eight glasses of water a day. 5. Those who are old or sick and are unable to drink four glasses of water at the beginning may commence by taking little water and gradulayy increase it to four glasses per day. 6. The above method of treatment will cure diseases of the sick and others can enjoy a healthy life.
(Before It's News). How many folks do you know who say they don’t want to drink anything before going to bed because they’ll have to get up during the night. Heart Attack and Water – I never knew all of this ! Interesting……. Something else I didn’t know … I asked my Doctor why people need to urinate so much at night time. Answer from my Cardiac Doctor – Gravity holds water in the lower part of your body when you are upright (legs swell).
