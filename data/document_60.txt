illustration from Jack Kilby's inventor's journal. integrated circuit. What we didn't realize then was that the integrated circuit would reduce the cost of electronic functions by a factor of a million to one, nothing had ever done that for anything before - Jack Kilby.
Home Timelines. Computer History Timeline Timeline Description: Computers are made up of many parts, and each one of them is a unique invention on its own. In this timeline we will take a look at many of these parts, and how they contributed to the computers we have today. Date Event 1936 The First Computer The first freely programmable computer came into play. 1947 The transistor The transistor was invented by Bell Telephone Company.
The history of RFID has shown a steady development in RFID technology. Having its routes in the earliest days of electrical science and then radio, RFID history has come out of developments such as radar and IFF.
1 History of Integrated Circuit. 2  The integrated circuit otherwise known as The Chip or microchip was invented by both Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce.
History of Robotics: Timeline This history of robotics is intertwined with the histories of technology, science and the basic principle of progress. Technology used in computing, electricity, even pneumatics and hydraulics can all be considered a part of the history of robotics.
Robert Noyce, with sixteen patents to his name, founded Intel, the company responsible for the invention of the microprocessor, in 1968. But for both men the invention of the integrated circuit stands historically as one of the most important innovations of mankind. Almost all modern products use chip technology.
