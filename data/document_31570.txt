It was given to him for his efforts to end the gag rule, which prevented discussions in the House of Representatives about the abolition of slavery.

GAG RULE, ANTISLAVERY. In American politics the term gag rule refers to a series of procedural rules adopted by Congress in the 1830s and 1840s to prevent the submission of antislavery petitions.
Known as the gag rules, they prevented antislavery petitions from having to be read according to usual House procedures. House rules had been that during the first thirty days of each session of Congress was for reading of petitions from the people. Each petition would be read aloud, printed and assigned to committee.
When the first gag rule was instituted in 1836, House protocol required that the first thirty days of each session of Congress be devoted to the reading of petitions from constituents. After those thirty days, petitions were read in the House every other Monday.
