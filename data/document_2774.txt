View Details. Fiber Optic Cable Installation. Fiber Optic Cable. 288 Count Fiber Cost = 5,000 ft at $5.87 per foot; , 144 Count Fiber = 5000 ft at $2.98 per foot; 24 Count Fiber = 70,000 ft at $0.68 per foot. O&M Cost: Were based on two full time technicians with benefits maintaining the completed 25 mile fiber backbone. Initial start up cost for O&M included a fusion splicing machine $12,950; Fiber OTDR $12,694; Fiber Splicing Trailer $5,500; and $5,000 in training and additional sundry supplies.
Frontier built 675 miles of fiber optic cable to public facilities such as schools, State Police barracks, hospitals and government offices. Martin requested a state audit when Frontier charged the state about $62,000 per mile – what Martin claimed is twice the going rate. 
Some communications providers have excess fiber strands.Fiber count in cables ranges. from 6 to 24 near residences and individual businesses to more than 1,000 on backbone. routes. The cost of a 6-count fiber cable is $2,000 per mile, while an 864-count cable is. $50,000 per mile, implying a marginal cost of approximately $50 per fiber per mile. Actual costs for fiber purchase or lease,of course, reflect market costs and depend on the. Some entities (utilities, service providers, governments) have conduit available for purchase, lease, or trade. Pulling cables throughavailable conduit costs $20,000 to $50,000 per mile, instead of $90,000 to $400,000 for new construction. Cost of Building Fiber to America’s Anchors.
Vertical fiber cable cost is calculated as 98.4 feet at $0.35/fiber/meter for two fibers. In this scenario, the all-fiber system is more expensive than UTP, due to the high cost of 100Base-FX NICs and the high cost of the Cisco 4000 series equipment. Vertical fiber cable cost is 98.4 feet at $0.50/fiber/meter for two fibers. Again, the costs used for the model represent a starting point. The scenario shows at list price, running fiber in the horizontal is more expensive than running UTP.
1 Expect to pay $1 to $6 per linear foot for fiber optic cable installation (depending on the fiber count) plus the cost of connection hardware and terminations. 2  The cost to wire an entire building or facility with fiber optics is very difficult to estimate, as many variables come into play. 1 A cost comparison of copper cabling and fiber optic cabling must include both short-term and long-term costs. 2  Fiber optic cable, electronics, and terminations are somewhat more expensive than Cat5 or 5e counterparts, as is fiber optic installation.

The cost for 1 Gbps was $35 per Mbps, a staggering $35,000 per month, and that was only if a business could convince a provider to build the network lateral to their building.

As I try to self educate my self on the issues, I have heard figures cited that it takes about $100,000 a mile to deploy fiber optic cable in multi strands typical for telephone applications and information systems. But that may include two costs, the factory cost of the cable itself, and the cost of burying the cable that has all kinds of labor and right of way issues that increase the simple per mile cost of the cable itself.
The model compares the cost of a horizontal-UTP/vertical-fiber network to the cost of a centralized optical-fiber network. Fiber is used in the vertical riser for both network scenarios, as it is widely recognized as cost-effective in the backbone. In the horizontal, the UTP network model uses Category 5 cable. Vertical fiber cable cost is 98.4 feet at $0.50/fiber/meter for two fibers. Again, the costs used for the model represent a starting point. The scenario shows at list price, running fiber in the horizontal is more expensive than running UTP.
We installed fiber to interconnect large facilities because of runs in excess of 6,000 feet and the cost was no where close to $100,000. Then we had a ranch project that would have been 2 1/2 miles to the nearest cable provider that we were trying to work with. But that may include two costs, the factory cost of the cable itself, and the cost of burying the cable that has all kinds of labor and right of way issues that increase the simple per mile cost of the cable itself.
