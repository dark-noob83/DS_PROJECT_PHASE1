In adult males, the normal haemoglobin levels are 13.8 - 17.2 g/dl In adult females, the normal haemoglobin levels are 12.1 - 15.1 g/dl In children, the normal haemoglobin levels are 11 - 16 g/dl. . · 5 years ago.

A. The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 17-22 gm/dL. 2  One (1) week of age: 15-20 gm/dL.
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter. 
Normal hemoglobin values are related to the person's age and sex. Normal values may vary slightly between test systems, and which groups of doctors have determined normal values for their group of patients; however, the value ranges are close (vary by about 0.5 g/dl) for almost every group. An example of normal ranges that is widely accepted by Family Practice physicians is as follows: 1  Birth: 13.5 to 24.0 g/dl (mean 16.5 g/dl). 2  Age 1-2 months: 10.0 to 18.0 g/dl (mean 11.2 g/dl). 3  Age 2-6 months: 9.5 to 14.0 g/dl (mean 12.6 g/dl).
The normal range of hemoglobin (also haemoglobin) varies in men, women, and children. The normal range of hemoglobin in male is 13.5 to 18gm/dl (gram per deciliter). For female it is 12 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter). In a children 11 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter). And for a pregnant woman 11 to 12g/dl (gram per deciliter) is the normal range of hemoglobi
Normal range for adults: Male: 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL) Female: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL Normal range for children: Newborn: 14 to 24 g/dL Infant: 9.5 to 13 g/dL The normal hemoglobin levels for adults according to Mayo Clinic are similar, with the ranges slightly broader ...

In the routine laboratory test for hemoglobin (Hb), it is usually measured as total hemoglobin and the result is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dl) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. Hemoglobin normal values: Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying pigment in the blood, the predominant protein in the red blood cells.
Normal hemoglobin levels are different in women and in men. In non-pregnant women, normal hemoglobin ranges from 120 g/L to 160 g/L. In men, normal hemoglobin levels range from 140 g/L to 180 g/L. Canadian Blood Services tests each donor’s hemoglobin at the clinic and requires a minimum of 125 g/L for donatio
