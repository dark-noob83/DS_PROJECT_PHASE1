Certain fruits and vegetables are especially rich in soluble fiber. Among fruits, citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit and lemons are quite high in soluble fiber, as are berries, including strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries. Apples and pears also provide soluble fiber, as do bananas.
Comparisons. Strawberries have about the same amount of fiber as other favorite fruits. One cup of grapes has 1 gram of fiber. One peach and one-half grapefruit have 2 grams, and you’ll get about 3 grams of fiber from eating an apple, banana or orange. Pears have a little more, with 5 grams in one piece of fruit.
Soluble fiber has also been shown to help lower your blood sugar levels, which is important for people with diabetes. Oats, oat bran, oatmeal, barley, psyllium, flaxseed, peas, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, citrus fruits, strawberries, and apples all contain significant amounts of soluble fiber. Try to eat the skins of the fruits when possible since that's where high amounts of fiber are found.
Strawberry Nutrients. One cup of strawberries provides 50 calories and about 3 grams of fiber, most of which is soluble fiber. Studies have shown that fiber, particularly soluble fiber, can help lower LDL or “bad cholesterol” 2.
Strawberries contain both types of fiber. About 60 percent of the total fiber is the insoluble type and the remaining 40 percent is soluble fiber, so this serving supplies 0.8 grams of your recommended soluble fiber intake. Two grams of fiber is not an excessive amount to obtain from a serving of strawberries.
