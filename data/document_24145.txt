Two different pathways are involved in the metabolism of glucose: one anaerobic and one aerobic. The anaerobic process occurs in the cytoplasm and is only moderately efficient. The aerobic cycle takes place in the mitochondria and is results in the greatest release of energy.
When one glucose molecule is converted into lactic acid in anaerobic metabolism, three ATP molecules are generated. When a glucose molecule is converted into carbon dioxide and water via aerobic metabolism, it produces 39 molecules of ATP.
Anaerobic glucose metabolism (anaerobic glycolysis) occurs in oxygen deprived cells and cells which cannot preform aerobic glycolysis (e.g. red blood cells). A byproduct of anaerobic glycolysis is lactic acid, which we will discuss more in a later post.
The body is dependent upon two processes to create energy at rest and during exercise, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Simplified, the aerobic metabolic system uses oxygen, while the anaerobic system does not; however, oxygen plays a vital role in allowing the body to function under both systems.
Your ability to work and live depends on your metabolism, or the ability of your cells to convert proteins, carbohydrates and fats into energy. Whereas aerobic metabolism requires oxygen, anaerobic metabolism takes place without oxygen. These dual processes are not isolated but typically work in concurrence.
