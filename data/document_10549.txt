Option Fee. A rent-to-own house agreement typically involves an option fee. The option fee is usually between 1 percent to 5 percent of the sale price. In a rent-to-own agreement, the owner and the tenant(s) pre-negotiate a future sale price. For instance, the market value of the home may be $150,000 when you sign the agreement. If the agreement is for three years, the pre-negotiated sale price at the end of the lease could be $180,000.
If the renter doesn't buy the house, the option fee becomes income for the seller. Rent premiums are an amount slightly above the typical rent, with a portion of that money going toward a down payment. Here's a typical example: The house is worth $200,000, and typical rent would be $1,000 a month. Someone who's renting to own might pay $1,200 a month in rent and then receive a $200 rent credit each month. Add the option fee, in this case $5,000. On a three-year lease, the renter would earn $7,200 in rent credits. Adding the earned rental credits to the option fee, the renter has accumulated $12,200 for
For example, the rent is $900 and a $300 option fee is added to that. At the end of the two-year option, the renter plans to use the accumulated option fee ($300 multiplied by 24 months, or $7,200) as a down payment for the purchase.
A typical part of a lease-to-own agreement is rent credit. A portion of the rent payments are credited to the purchase price. For instance, if the rent payments are $1,000 per month, the rent credit is $200 per month and the length of the lease is 24 months, the rent credit applied to the purchase price would be $4,800.
