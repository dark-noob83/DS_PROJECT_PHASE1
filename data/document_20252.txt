It had been driven by advancements made by the Zeppelin Airship Construction Company, whose first airship took to the skies in 1900. Zeppelins, named after their creator, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, were first used for reconnaissance purposes, but within months of the war’s outbreak they were being used as weapons. In 1915, Germany started using them to bomb British cities, and hit London for the first time in May 1915.
Zeppelin had replaced the 14 hp engines used on LZ-1 with 80 hp Daimler engines, which gave LZ-2 sufficient speed to maneuver in light winds, but engine failure forced an emergency landing during the ship’s very first flight, and it was destroyed on the ground by a storm that evening.
The War in the Air-Bombers: Germany, Zeppelins. Balloons had been used in wars prior to the First World War, notably by the Americans in the civil war and the French during the siege of Paris in 1870.
ZEPPELIN was the name given to the duralumin-internal-framed, dirigibles invented by the persistent Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. The LZ1 made its initial flight from a floating hangar on Lake Constance, near Friedrichshafen in Southern Germany, on 2 July 1900. The Zeppelins were used in both war and peace.
LZ-1 (Luftschiff Zeppelin 1) was 420 feet long, 38-1/2 feet in diameter, and contained approximately 399,000 cubic feet of hydrogen in 17 gas cells made of rubberized cotton fabric.
A Zeppelin was a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century. Zeppelin's ideas were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893. They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899. After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word zeppelin came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships.
The German government promised financial support for Count Zeppelin’s efforts if his ship could make an endurance flight of 24 hours, and confidant in his ship’s ability, Zeppelin agreed to the challenge. LZ-4 departed the Bodensee on August 4, 1908, for a 24-hour trial.
