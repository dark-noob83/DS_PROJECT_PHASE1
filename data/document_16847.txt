Some scientists have long suspected that cats, which are strict carnivores, are sweet blind.. Now there's proof: Cats lack the receptor for sweetness. The discovery opens a window on what taste is for and how it evolved. It may also help cat food makers producer a product that even sick cats will eat.
Sweet taste of cats and dogs. Earlier studies on sweet taste in cats and dogs reported that in contrast to cats, dogs prefer natural sugars, e.g., sucrose, glucose, fructose, and lactose, but not maltose (17 - 19). Dogs also show a preference for sodium cyclamate, but not for sodium saccharin (17, 20).
Report Abuse. Cats don't have a natural taste for sugar. Since they don't eat anything sweet that is found in nature, they wouldn't have a sweet tooth. But if you feed it to them, then yes, they can taste it...just not as strongly as you do since their sweet taste buds aren't sensitive to sugar.
Of course, there are also plenty of anecdotal accounts pointing in the other direction: cats that eat ice cream, relish cotton candy, chase marshmallows. Maybe some cats can use their [ Tas1r3 receptor] to taste high concentrations of sugar, Brand says. It's a very rare thing but we don't know yet.. Scientists do know, however, that cats can taste things we cannot, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the compound that supplies the energy in every living cell.
Humans have taste buds that distinguish sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and meaty/savory (umami). Cats have taste buds like our own, however their sweet buds are not very reactive. Cats are obligate carnivores and driven to consume meat. They do not need to eat sugar or carbohydrates (that turn to sugar), thus there is no reason for them to have a “taste” for it. . . or a sweet tooth, if you will.
