The Internet has added a new dimension to the process of identity protection. Never respond to emails claiming that your bank or credit card account has been compromised. Financial institutions never send emails in situations of this nature. If a link is embedded in the body of the email, do not click on it. Personal efforts at identity protection should begin with limiting access to data that is of moderate or high interest to thieves. For this reason, it is important never to provide bank account or credit card information to a source that you cannot verify as legitimate.
While use of a pseudonym or alias is not necessarily unlawful, identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name, and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging, primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained, and identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims, according to a report done for the FTC.

Some other services will monitor public records and medical records, as well as monitor your driver's license number or look for address changes that you never authorized. It's a good question. Identity theft protection services cannot actually protect you from getting your identity stolen. That's not how they work. They do not take preemptive measures to protect you from hav
How Someone Can Steal Your Identity. Your identity is compromised. Someone — a family member, friend, or stranger — gains access to your personal information without your knowledge. Your identity is assumed. That person assumes your identity and attempts to access your financial resources, or other benefits, in your name. Your identity is used. The person pretending to be you uses your finances or other personal information, which puts your achievements, assets, credit, and more at risk.
