You calculate the percent variance by subtracting the benchmark number from the new number and then dividing that result by the benchmark number. In this example, the calculation looks like this: (150-120)/120 = 25%. The Percent variance tells you that you sold 25 percent more widgets than yesterday. The figure demonstrates how to translate this into a formula. The formula in E4 calculates the percent variance between current year sales and previous year sales.
Earned value, also known as the budgeted cost of work performed, is the estimated value of the work actually completed during a specified period. Continuing with the example, if 30 percent of the work is completed after one month, the earned value is 30 percent of $24,000, or $7,200. Note that these are budgeted costs, not actual costs, which could be different. Related Reading: How to Compute the Direct Labor Price Variance.
To calculate a percentage variance, divide the dollar variance by the target value, not the actual value, and multiply by 100. For example, the percentage variance for the previous revenue example is ($100,000) divided by $1 million times 100, or (10) percent.
Calculating Percent Variance in Excel. A variance is an indicator of the difference between one number and another. To understand this, imagine that you sold 120 widgets one day, and on the next day, you sold 150. The difference in sales in actual terms is easy to see; you sold 30 more widgets.
Calculating Variance of a Percentage. You should not calculate a percentage difference for a number that's already expressed as a percentage. For example, the gross profit for $1 million in revenue and $800,000 in expense is $200,000. The gross margin is $200,000 divided by $1 million times 100, or 20 percent.
A variance is an indicator of the difference between one number and another. To understand this, imagine that you sold 120 widgets one day, and on the next day, you sold 150.
Schedule Variance Percentage % (SV %) = $6 000 USD / 9 000 USD = - 0.67 or 67 %. According to this example, the project is 67 % behind the schedule. You need to do 67% of work to be on track with your schedule in terms of budgeted cost.
A variance in accounting tells you how much a business result varied from another value, such as a budgeted, target or expected amount. For example, if you budgeted $500 for postage and spent $600, the variance is $100, and it might be explained by an unanticipated increase in postage rates.
