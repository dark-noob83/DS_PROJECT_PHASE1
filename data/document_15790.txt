For adults, a normal resting rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Athletes may have a rate as low as 40 bpm because their hearts are trained to efficiently pump blood. If your heart rate is consistently below 60 or above 100, you may have a heart condition, such as arrhythmia.
somewhere between 60 to 100 beats per minute.if your heart rate is normally about 90, a heart rate of 60 is going to be abnormal low. if you are 2 years old your heart b … eat should be 115 - 170. the standard range of a normal healthy human adult heart rate is said to be 60 - 80 beats per minute when at rest.

For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the person’s physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA.
