Generally, between 10 to 30 minutes is how long you leave clothes  in dye. The longer you leave the clothing in the dye the more color  the fabric will take in.
Well! You deffinitly mix them together, mix them well, and you should leave it in for about 30 minutes max, depending how dark your hair is, if your very light haired do maybe 20 if your very dark haired maybe 35 to 40 minutes.
Best Answer: I used to use all colors of the manic panic dye. It never does last too long but red fades faster then the rest. I usually left mine in for about an hour - 2 hours. It all depends on what color your hair is and how well it hold color. I would reccomend dying your hair, wash the dye out after 2 hours, then not showering for as long as possible (or at least not washing your hair) to let the dye sit.
Depends on how deep you want the colour. If you're going lighter, then stick with the 30 minutes. If you're going darker you can leave it on a little longer but no more than 40 minutes really. Leaving it on longer doesnt make the colour better, just increases the depth of it.
I would imagine most semi-and demi-permanent dyes are about the same. If you are using a vegetable dye (such as manic panic, special effects, or henna) you may leave on as long as you want, from 30 minutes to overnight.
If your hair is brown, purple probably isn't going to show up very well. It's best to bleach your hair before dying it an unnatural color. Like I told you before, the box says 30-40 minutes, but the most I'd leave it on for is an hour. And that's at your own judgment, too.
Most permanent dyes process in about 25-30 minutes.   I would imagine most semi-and demi-permanent dy â€¦ es are about the same.   If you are using a vegetable dye (such as manic panic, special effects, or henna) you may leave on as long as you want, from 30 minutes to overnight.
