Incubation. The incubation period for rubella is 14-23 days, with an average incubation period of 16-18 days. This means that it can take 2-3 weeks for a child to get rubella after being exposed to someone with the disease. The rubella rash usually lasts 3 days.
In rare cases rubella can lead to serious complications. In one in 6,000 cases it can lead to inflammation of the brain; in one in 3,000 cases it can affect blood clotting. The incubation period for rubella is 14 to 21 days, with most people developing a rash between 14 and 17 days after exposure. In most cases rubella is a mild condition, but if you suspect you have the disease you should contact your doctor to have it confirmed.
A person is contagious during the later part of the rubella incubation period. A person is especially contagious anytime from about seven days prior to the onset of the rash to seven days after the rash develops. However, a person can spread rubella if he or she becomes infected with rubella virus, even if rubella symptoms never develop.
Rubella virus can be transmitted vertically from mother to fetus during pregnancy and cause the spectrum of congenital anomalies that define CRS. E.

Virus is typically secreted in nasopharyngeal secretions of persons with acquired rubella from about seven days before until seven days after rash onset.
