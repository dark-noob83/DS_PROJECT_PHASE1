The most common example of when a Notice of Assignment is necessary regards the lease of a property. When a leaseholder sells their interest in a property to someone else, it is vital that the landlord and management company are aware of the transfer. A Notice of Assignment must be served to the landlord or management company under the Law of Property Act 1925. The Notice of Assignment will assign the existing shares to the new tenant. Landlords and management companies also need to be made aware of any charges over the premises. This is usually in the form of the tenant obtaining a mortgage in order to purchase the lease.

Usually a lease will require the leaseholder to inform the landlord whenever there is a change of ownership of a lease or whenever the leaseholder offers the lease to a lender as security for a mortgage loan. The lease will also usually require a fee to be paid when that notice is given. The precise amount of the fee will depend upon what the lease says and the costs charged by the landlord or his managing agents. We will not know the precise amount until after we have seen the lease and any other relevant paperwork. Sometimes a old lease might specify a fixed level of notice fee that is involved-for example two guineas (now £2.10). Modern leases tend to specify that the fee is to be a reasonable fee.
