Best Answer: The earth's climate is generally defined as the average weather over a long period of time. A place or region's climate is determined by both natural and anthropogenic (human-made) factors.
Higher temperatures affect the conditions for cloud formation and rainfall. Heavy rain showers, such as summer thunderstorms, are influenced more by temperature than rain from larger widespread rain systems. Heavy rain has far-reaching consequences for society, and these could worsen at higher temperatures. “Imagine a summer thunderstorm with sudden intensive rain showers over a short period.
Weather is the current atmospheric conditions, including temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity at a given place. If you stand outside, you can see that it's raining or windy, or sunny or cloudy. You can tell how hot it is by taking a temperature reading. Best Answer: The earth's climate is generally defined as the average weather over a long period of time. A place or region's climate is determined by both natural and anthropogenic (human-made) factors.
For example, if the average temperature over a region increases significantly, it can affect the amount of cloudiness as well as the type and amount of precipitation that occur. Best Answer: The earth's climate is generally defined as the average weather over a long period of time. A place or region's climate is determined by both natural and anthropogenic (human-made) factors.
The volume of rain that falls in a heavy shower depends on the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. At higher temperatures the atmosphere may contain more water vapour, thus increasing the chance of heavy showers. Heavy rain showers, such as summer thunderstorms, are influenced more by temperature than rain from larger widespread rain systems. Heavy rain has far-reaching consequences for society, and these could worsen at higher temperatures. “Imagine a summer thunderstorm with sudden intensive rain showers over a short period.
As latitude ________, the average annual temperature _________. 0° Latitude 90° Temperature decreases increases How does closeness to a large body of water affect climate? Water __________ the temperature. Temperature decreases with elevation. During summer, temperature is strongly controlled by elevation -- cold at the higher reaches of the Alaska and Brooks Ranges, and warmer in the lowlands. How does elevation affect climate? As elevation _________, the average annual temperature __________.
Temperature DOES affect precipitation. More Info: Surface temperature affects the rate of evaporation, which has a direct effect on cloud formation. Also, changes of temperature within the atmosphere determine what form precipitation takes as it falls to the ground (1). 
Best Answer: Temperature is a property of climate. In any part of the world, you'll have average high and low temperatures, rainfall amounts, cloud cover, etc. that you expect the weather to vary around for any particular time of the year. That's climate. Climate can change over time, to where the temperature, etc, may be very different from what's been normal. Think of temperature as a snapshot measurement, and climate is the bigger picture, or average. If the temperature starts to change, and continues to stay that way, it will affect the overall picture, which is the climate. Stuart · 3 years ago.
Confidence votes 3.6K. Warm air holds more moisture than cold air. When the air has reached saturation point (ie. it cannot hold any more moisture), it is more likely to cause precipitation as the oversaturated air forms moisture droplets that fall as precipitation. One of the major causes of precipitation is when warm air cools rapidly (for example, when it rises after hitting a mountain front or other landmass). The higher the temperature of the air the higher the amount of  humidity you feel. Also the colder the airs temperature it can  cause precipitation such as hail, snow, and s … leet rather then just  rain. Gameroo.
