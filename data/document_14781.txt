The average cost in the Mid-Atlantic Market for a 50,000 square foot (5,555 square yards) parking lot ranges in price from $1.25 - $1.50 per square foot for a 1 &frac12;” – 2” compacted overlay. The factors listed below will also dictate the installation price. 
All of those parking lots are not only expensive but represent an opportunity lost. The average parking lot cost is $4,000 per space, with a space in an above-grade structure costing $20,000, and a space in an underground garage $30,000-$40,000.
If your parking lot was very small and only required 10 parking spaces to be restriped @ $4.00 per line, 2 arrows @ $20.00 and 1 handicap space @ $35.00, the minimum cost would be $350.00 - $500.00, not $115.00. The reason for the minimum mobilization is to cover fuel, labor, paint, equipment costs and overhead. 
Benefits of Asphalt. The cost of the installation process all depends upon the size of the space that you are having paved and the climate and weather on the day of the installation. Asphalt doesn't need to dry, it needs to cool and harden and this can take around 5-8 hours. If your base is still sound, you can possibly install a new layer of asphalt over the old to resurface the existing area. If you can add a layer of asphalt without needing to remove what is underneath that can save you considerably in the total costs.
Profit. The last part of the cost to install a concrete parking lot is the profit to the contractor. This is obviously a number decided upon by the contractor. Now this number is not only a calculation for profit but it is also a risk vs reward number. This is a VERY risky business. The more square footage being installed, the cost decreases. Preparation. The next cost factored into an estimate, is the amount of preparation that’s involved. For that, each parking lot is unique in it’s own way. But sometimes, to prepare a parking lot for proper drainage, big or little, can be quite a task.
How much dose it cost to install a parking lot pole light. The poles will be about 12 foot in length, and have 3 175W metal halide fixtures. I am planning on making the holes about 3 foot deep (soft soil). I Need to know a fair price to dig the holes, do the re-bar, and pour the cement. 
The average cost in the Mid-Atlantic Market for a 50,000 sq ft parking lot ranges in price from $1.25 - $1.50 per square foot for a 1 ½” – 2” compacted overlay. As the cost of liquid asphalt cement rises and lowers so does the cost of hot mix asphalt (HMA) per ton. The other factor is availability of raw materials. For instance, in some markets there are 3-4 asphalt plants in a 5 mile radius as others there may only be one asphalt plant in a 25 mile radius.
Parking Professional, June 1999, suggested land cost of $22 per sq. ft. as the level at which structured parking becomes the more favorable option. Since a parking lot normally requires 300-350 square feet per car, this would put the land cost decision level at $6,600 to $7,700 per space. EPA's Parking Alternatives guidebook at http://www.smartgrowth.org/pdf/PRKGDE04.pdf contains a discussion of car parking costs.
External Parking Costs: Conservative estimates place average off-street parking costs around $1000 per year or $3.75 per day per space, and place total U.S. employee parking subsidies at between $65 and $95 billion per year. A value of $70 billion is used. At a construction cost of $32,000 per apartment and $18,100 per parking spot, it would have cost $22,600 to provide parking for each $32,000 apartment, 71% as much as the cost of building the apartments.
