Quicksand is denser than water -- it has a density of about 125 pounds per cubic foot (2 g/cm 3) -- which means you can float more easily on quicksand than on water.
Drop everything. If you step into quicksand and you're wearing a backpack or carrying something heavy, immediately take off your backpack or drop what you're carrying. Because your body is less dense than quicksand, you can't fully sink unless you panic and struggle too much or you're weighed down by something heavy.
How to Escape. With quicksand, the more you struggle in it the faster you will sink. If you just relax, your body will float in it because your body is less dense than the quicksand.

Quicksand is denser than water and the human body is less dense than quicksand, which means you can actually float more easily in quicksand than a swimming pool. The worst thing to do if you fall into quicksand is thrash around. Instead, just relax.
Best Answer: The simple answer is: You sink in quicksand is because it is not dense enough to support your weight-the same reason you can't walk on water. Quicksand has a large percentage of water in it, so in some ways it behaves like water.
Quicksand is basically just ordinary sand that has been so saturated with water that the friction between sand particles is reduced. The resulting sand is a mushy mixture of sand and water that can no longer support any weight. If you step into quicksand, it won't suck you down.
If you ever find yourself in a pit of quicksand, don't worry -- it's not going to swallow you whole, and it's not as hard to escape from as you might think. The human body has a density of 62.4 pounds per cubic foot (1 g/cm 3) and is able to float on water.
