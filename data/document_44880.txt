Definition. A group of words that modifies an independent clause as a whole. An absolute is made up of a noun and its modifiers (which frequently, but not always, include a participle or participial phrase). An absolute may precede, follow, or interrupt the main clause:
ABSOLUTE. Without any condition or encumbrance, as an absolute bond, simplex obligatio, in distinction from a conditional bond; an absolute estate, one that is free from all manner of condition or incumbrance.
Absolute is defined as something that is 100 percent complete with no exceptions. An example of absolute silence would be total silence with no noise at all. The definition of absolute is something that is always true and accepted as fact, with no arguments against it or conditions necessary for it to be true. An example of an absolute is the idea that everyone will die some day.
ABSOLUTE. Without any condition or encumbrance, as an absolute bond, simplex obligatio, in distinction from a conditional bond; an absolute estate, one that is free from all manner of condition or incumbrance. A rule is said to be absolute, when, on the hearing, it is confirmed.
