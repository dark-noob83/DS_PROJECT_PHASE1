The health risks from fracking are not limited to what's in our drinking water -— oil and gas operations are also poisoning the air we breathe, said senior scientist Miriam Rotkin-Ellman of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which produced the report.
Fracking is a drilling process that blasts huge amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals deep underground to break apart shale deposits and extract gas and oil from the rock's pores.
The compounds EPA said could be associated with fracking, he said, could have had other origins not related to gas development. Those could just have likely been brought about by contamination in their sampling process or construction of their well, Hock said.
A 2004 EPA study concluded fracking did not pose a risk to drinking water, helping lead to its exemption from the Safe Drinking Water Act through the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The study was later criticized as limited and compromised by oil/gas industry influence.
Fracking also releases  produced water  from underground that also rises to the surface, and can be anywhere from two to 200 times as much water, depending on the oil/gas/water concentrations in the shale formation.
Due to public concerns about the high volume of water used in fracking, oil and gas drilling companies have started reusing and recycling the wastewater. The natural-gas industry uses a number of methods to recycle drilling waste.
The fracking occurred below the level of the drinking water aquifer and close to water wells, the EPA said. Elsewhere, drilling is more remote and fracking occurs much deeper than the level of groundwater that would normally be used.
4 states confirm water pollution from drilling. PITTSBURGH (AP) — In at least four states that have nurtured the nation's energy boom, hundreds of complaints have been made about well-water contamination from oil or gas drilling, and pollution was confirmed. Post to Facebook.
