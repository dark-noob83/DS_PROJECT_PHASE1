Craters of the Moon is a large lava flow field with cinder cones, spatter cones, lava tubes, volcanic bombs and tree molds. It is located along the north border of the Snake River Plain in Idaho. It was declared a national monument by President Calvin Coolidge in 1924.
And other craters are volcanic in origin. A volcano crater is a circular depression around a volcanic vent. This is where the lava, ash and rock erupt out of a volcano. In most situations, the volcano crater is located at the top of the volcano. Volcano Crater.
Two Types of Impact Craters. Impact craters can be categorized in one of two ways: simple or complex. A simple crater has a smooth bowl shape small with a small depth to diameter ratio. This ratio is typically 1:6 which means that if the crater is 1 m deep, it is 6 m wide.
Calderas are some of the most spectacular features on Earth. They are large volcanic craters that form by two different methods: 1) an explosive volcanic eruption; or, 2) collapse of surface rock into an empty magma chamber.

Ubehebe (pronounced you-bee-hee-bee) Craters, located about 150 miles northeast of Bakersfield in Death Valley National Park, consists of at least a dozen overlapping volcanic craters. The largest crater is about 800 m (0.5 mi) wide and 250 m (800 ft) deep.
The ropy surface of pahoehoe lava flows is the dominant lava type at Craters of the Moon. The pahoehoe flows were typically erupted through lava tubes and tube systems. Locally collapse of tube roofs has formed skylights and entrances to lava tunnels that are popular among visitors to the national monument.
