A larger five-year trial of BCG comes next. Diabetes researchers are hoping that an almost century-old vaccine for preventing tuberculosis may also reverse type 1 diabetes. The FDA has approved a mid-stage trial to test the vaccine, called bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), in 150 adults with advanced cases of the disease. We will be working again with people who have had type 1 diabetes for many years. This is not a prevention trial; instead, we are trying to create a regimen that will treat even advanced disease.”. The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921 as a vaccine against tuberculosis.
Purpose. The purpose of this study is to see if repeat bacillus Calmette-Guerin (GUéRIN) bcg vaccinations can confer a beneficial immune and metabolic effect On type 1. diabetes 
Types of vaccines. The way in which the body responds to a vaccine depends on the type of vaccine being administered. There are several different types of vaccine available and with new technology there will be further additions.
