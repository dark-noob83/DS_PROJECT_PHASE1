1 Bring to a boil and boil rapidly without stirring until candy thermometer reaches 220°F. (This temperature ensures that there is enough sugar for the pectin to form a gel.). 2  Remove from heat and skim off any scum that has formed on top of jelly. 3  Pour into sterilized jars.
Cranberry Jelly is a low-sugar or low-honey cooked jelly made with Pomona’s Pectin. Pomona’s Pectin contains no sugar or preservatives and jells reliably with low amounts of any sweetener. See below for where to buy.
Background. Cranberry sauce can be served either as a gooey liquid or as a solid jelly. The jellied version is solid enough to retain the shape of the container in which it's placed whereas the sauce version is much more fluid. The difference between the fluid sauce and the jelly versions comes down to pectin.
Cranberries are another example, served either as a gooey sauce or as a solid jelly. The jellied version is solid enough to retain the shape of the container in which it is placed, including the can if you buy a premade canned version (shown in Figure 1, below).
Of these, the temperature test is most dependable. Temperature Test Take the temperature of the jelly with a candy or jelly thermometer. When done, the temperature of the jelly should be 220°F, 8°F above the boiling point of water, if you are at sea level. NOTE: For each 1000 feet of altitude above sea level, subtract 2 degrees F. For instance, at 1,000 feet of altitude, the jelly is done at 218°F; at 2,000 feet, 216°F, etc. See Table 1 below.
