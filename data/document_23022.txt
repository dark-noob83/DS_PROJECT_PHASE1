The Poles had broken Enigma in 1932, when the encoding machine was undergoing trials with the German Army. But when the Poles broke Enigma, the cipher altered only once every few months. With the advent of war, it changed at least once a day, giving 159 million million million possible settings to choose from. 
Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II. Chiffriermaschinen AG began advertising a rotor machine— Enigma model A —which was exhibited at the Congress of the International Postal Union in 1923–1924. The machine was heavy and bulky, incorporating a typewriter.
German military texts enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rożycki różycki And Henryk, zygalski working For polish military. intelligence Like other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard; a set of rotating disks called rotors arranged adjacently along a spindle; and one of various stepping components to turn one or more rotor with each key press.

Template:EnigmaSeries. An Enigma machine was any of a family of related electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines used in the twentieth century for enciphering and deciphering secret messages. Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. Like other rotor machines, the Enigma machine is a combination of mechanical and electrical subsystems. The mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard; a set of rotating disks called rotors arranged adjacently along a spindle; and one of various stepping components to turn one or more rotor with each key press.
The Enigma was by no means the only cipher machine used by the Germans during WWII. In fact the Enigma, of which over 20,000 units were produced, was mainly used at a tactical level, whilst the German High Command used other machines, such as the Siemens T-52 Geheimschreiber and the Lorenz SZ-40/42 teleprinter add-on. The history of the Enigma machine is extremely complex. There were many different models and variations, and they were used by many different customers. During the war, a mixture of military and commercial Enigma machines were used by different branches of the war machine.
Bohnett said he purchased the Enigma machine in part because of his fascination with Turing's life. Like Turing, Bohnett has devoted his career to computer technology and is gay. As a young man, Bohnett helped to found the Internet site GeoCities, which he later sold to Yahoo. His Enigma machine, which is kept at his Beverly Hills office, was purchased 15 years ago at Sotheby's in London. The machine, for which Bohnett estimated he paid around 12,000 pounds ($18,000), is believed to have once been used on a German U-boat.
