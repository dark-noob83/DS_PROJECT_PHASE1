Pots require drainage holes in the bottom or around the side near the bottom edge. Creating holes in plastic, resin and wooden containers involves nothing more than a drill and the appropriate-sized bit. Drill one to four three-quarter inch holes in the bottom of the pot to provide ample drainage for the soil.
Overview. Although most flower pots already have a drainage hole, occasionally a flower pot will be missing this essential element. Drainage holes are necessary to protect the plant from becoming waterlogged. Drilling a hole in a flower pot is a simple and quick process.
The holes in the bottom of most flower pots and plant containers provide a necessary function; they allow excess water to drain freely from the soil after you water the plants. Not all pots come with drainage holes, which necessitates creating a drainage method for the pot before you begin to grow a plant in it.
Drainage Holes. To improve drainage and plant health, look for pots with at least one drainage hole in the bottom of the pot. If the pot doesn't have a hole you may be able to drill one. Clay or ceramic pots may crack when drilled, however.

Best Answer: To allow excess water to drain out of the pot. Most plants need water, but do not need to sit in water. The drain allows water out. To keep it from pouring out, place a small rock over the hole, it will keep some water in which will be good. Also a piece of terra cota from another broken pot would work.
