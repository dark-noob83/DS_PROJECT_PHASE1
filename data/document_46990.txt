The main cause of rickets is a lack of vitamin D. Not having enough calcium in one's diet may also be a cause of rickets, as may vomiting and diarrhea. Some childhood kidney and liver diseases can cause rickets, as may a digestive disorder complication that affects calcium and phosphorous absorption. Lack of vitamin D-the main cause of rickets.

Rickets is defective mineralization or calcification of bones before epiphyseal closure in immature mammals due to deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, phosphorus or calcium, potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is among the most frequent childhood diseases in many developing countries. The predominant cause is a vitamin D deficiency, but lack of adequate calcium in the diet may also lead to rickets (cases of severe diarrhea and vomiting may be the cause of the deficiency).
Rickets is a disease in children that causes the bones to develop softer than normal, resulting in muscle and bone weakness and deformity. Rickets is impaired mineralization of the growth plates of bones. The most common cause of rickets is a lack of vitamin D. Rickets is caused by faulty mineralization in the bone-building process. Because vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus are needed to build strong bones, a lack of these substances will affect the bones.
