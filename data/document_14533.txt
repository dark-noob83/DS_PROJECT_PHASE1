Normally, your contributions to a traditional IRA are tax deductible. You may contribute up to $5,000 each year or the amount of your earned income, whichever is less. The limit is $6,000 if you are age 50 or older.
You can’t make a regular (non-rollover) contribution to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA unless you or your spouse have qualifying income. This page explains what types of income count as qualifying income for this purpose.
Contribution Limits. The IRS sets IRA contribution limits annually. For 2012, the annual contribution limit was $5,000 — or the total of your taxable compensation, if it's less than $5,000. If you're over 50, you can contribute an additional $1,000, but only if you have another $1,000 in qualified earned income.
You must have earned income to make a Roth IRA contribution. The amount of earned income you have must equal or exceed the amount of your Roth IRA contribution. 1  If you have enough earned income, in addition to your own Roth IRA contribution, you may make a Roth IRA contribution for a non-working spouse.
If your earned income is less than your eligible contribution amount, your maximum contribution amount equals your income. In other words, if you have $3,000 in earned income, the most you can contribute to the Roth is $3,000 (instead of $5,500).
Income that is not earned does not qualify you to contribute to a Roth IRA. Examples of this income are retirement pensions, Social Security payments, interest and dividend income, unemployment benefits, and alimony and child support. Unemployment benefits are also not considered earned income.
In order to make an IRA contribution, you must have earned income or file a joint tax return with a spouse who has earned income. In addition to having earned income, Roth IRAs limit the amount of contributions based on adjusted gross income, or AGI.
