Unit Rate is the ratio of two measurements in which the second term is 1. 1 Step 1: Unit rate is a ratio of different units of measurement with the second term being equal to 1. 2  Step 2: So, Unit Rate = toys/hours =60/40. 3  Step 3: = [Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the denominator.]
Unit Rates A rate is a ratio that is used to compare different kinds of quantities. A unit rate describes how many units of the first type of quantity corresponds to one unit of the second type of quantity. Some common unit rates are miles (or kilometers) per hour, cost per item, earnings per week, etc.
more ... The cost per liter, per kilogram, per pound, etc, of what you want to buy. Example 2 liters for $3.80 is $3.80 / 2 liters = $1.90 per liter. Unit Price.
Rate is a ratio that compares two quantities of different units. Unit Rate: Unit rate is a rate in which the second term is 1. For example, Jake types 10 words in 5 seconds. Jake's unit rate is the number of words he can type in a second. His unit rate is 2 words per second. More About Rate. Unit Rate: Unit rate is a rate in which the second term is 1. For example, Jake types 10 words in 5 seconds. Jake's unit rate is the number of words he can type in a second. His unit rate is 2 words per second.
Solution: 1  Step 1: Unit rate is a ratio of different units of measurement with the second term being equal to 1. 2  Step 2: So, Unit Rate = toys/hours =60/40. 3  Step 3: = [Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the denominator.]. 4  Step 4: =15/1 = 15 [Simplify.]. 5  Step 5: So, William can pack 15 toys/hour. 1 Step 1: Unit rate is a ratio of different units of measurement with the second term being equal to 1. 2  Step 2: So, Unit Rate = toys/hours =60/40. 3  Step 3: = [Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the denominator.]
Unit Price. The Unit Price (or unit cost) tells you the cost per liter, per kilogram, per pound, etc, of what you want to buy. Just divide the cost by the quantity: Example: 2 liters for $3.80 is $3.80/2 liters = $1.90 per liter. So the lowest Unit Price (and the best bargain) is 1.5 liters at $2.70. Of course it doesn't tell you the quality of what you are buying, but it can help you make a decision.
Rates and ratios. The ratio is the relationship of two numbers. For example you have 2 flashlights and 5 batteries. To compare the ratio between the flashlights and the batteries we divide the set of flashlights with the set of batteries. The ratio is 2 to 5 or 2:5 or 2/5. All these describe the ratio in different forms of fractions. 
In each case the first quantity is related to 1 unit of the second quantity. Unit Rates. A rate is a ratio that is used to compare different kinds of quantities. A unit rate describes how many units of the first type of quantity corresponds to one unit of the second type of quantity. Some common unit rates are miles (or kilometers) per hour, cost per item, earnings per week, etc.
