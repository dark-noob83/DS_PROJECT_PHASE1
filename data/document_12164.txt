In Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal, recreational marijuana tax revenue has been far lower than predicted. Still, recent studies have projected that the U.S. marijuana industry may reach $8 billion to to $10 billion in sales by 2018. In 2012, Colorado and Washington state legalized recreational marijuana.
(Reuters) - Colorado, the first state to tax legalized recreational marijuana sales, expects to bring in an estimated $98 million in revenue this year, exceeding the state's original expectations by 40 percent. The state began levying sales and excise taxes on recreational marijuana on January 1, 2014.
The marijuana tax reports are based on actual revenue collected monthly as posted in the Colorado state accounting system. Taxes for the filing period are collected the month following the close of the reporting period. For example, taxes incurred in January are collected in February.
Six months of legal retail marijuana sales have generated $21.8 million in tax revenue plus another $10.1 million in taxes on medical marijuana in that time period (see Table 1). [6] For the new fiscal year that began July 1, 2014, state analysts project $30.6 million in revenue.
States like Alaska, Florida, Oregon and Washington, D.C. could make a combined $3 billion in marijuana tax revenue if they legalize the drug on Nov. 4. Colorado, the first state to allow the sale of recreational marijuana, is expected to take in $60 million to $70 million this year in taxes from legal pot sales,
Seven additional states would bring in $100 million or more from legalization, and 25 others would stand to make at least $20 million per year. NerdWallet's estimate assumed a flat, 15 percent excise tax on marijuana -- the same as Colorado's excise tax on recreational marijuana sales.
Excise taxes could be used to regulate the price of marijuana and generate revenues for the state. At current levels of consumption, an excise tax of $1 per gram of marijuana would yield $430 - $510 million per year.
The first month of legalization resulted in $3.8 million in sales and about $1 million in tax revenue. The Washington State Liquor Control Board, in charge of the program, estimates two-year marijuana tax revenue for the 2015-17 biennium will be $122,459,893; for the 2017-19 biennium it will be $336,898,396.
States such as Alaska, Florida and Oregon stand to collect millions in marijuana tax revenue if they legalize the drug on Nov. 4. Thatâ€™s when citizens in Alaska, Florida, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will cast their ballots on marijuana initiatives.
