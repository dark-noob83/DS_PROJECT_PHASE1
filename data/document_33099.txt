One example is the salary for chemists working in any field, when broken down by the number of years since earning a bachelor’s degree. The median annual salary for men who earned an undergraduate degree two to four years ago was $46,400; for women, that figure was $42,000, or 91% of the men’s median salary. This group saw a 2.0% drop in median salary to $100,000. Chemists with a master’s degree saw no change in salary from March 2011 to March 2012, while those with a bachelor’s degree experienced an increase of 1.9% to $74,200.
The average salary for entry-level chemists was $39,000 as of 2013, according to the jobsite Indeed. This salary is comparable to the $41,080 salary the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported for the bottom 10 percent of chemists as of May 2012. The minimum requirements for these scientists are typically a bachelor's degree in chemistry and two years of industry experience.
The survey shows that the median salary as of March 2012 for chemists with a bachelor’s degree was $45,000 in academe versus $74,000 and $76,300 in government and industry, respectively. For chemists with a master’s degree, those median salaries were $62,000, $83,800, and $93,000, respectively. Chemists with a Ph.D. had a median salary of $73,600 in academe, $112,300 in government, and $121,100 in industry. This group saw a 2.0% drop in median salary to $100,000. Chemists with a master’s degree saw no change in salary from March 2011 to March 2012, while those with a bachelor’s degree experienced an increase of 1.9% to $74,200.
The median annual wage for chemists was $71,770 in May 2012. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $41,080, and the top 10 percent earned more than $120,600. 
For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Chemist I in the United States is $52,048, so 50% of the people who perform the job of Chemist I in the United States are expected to make less than $52,048.

This chart describes the expected percentage of people who perform the job of Chemist I in the United States that make less than that annual salary.
The annual salary for someone with the job title Chemist I may vary depending on a number of factors including industry, company size, location, years of experience and level of education. This chart describes the expected percentage of people who perform the job of Chemist I in the United States that make less than that annual salary.
Employers. For all experience levels, the lowest salaries for chemists were in academia. In educational institutions, those with bachelor’s degrees earned an annual median of $40,000 in schools, $66,000 in government and $72,000 in industry. The survey showed how starting salaries by educational background also differed according to gender. For industrial chemists with bachelor’s degrees, starting median annual salaries were $47,000 for men and $45,500 for women. This compared to medians for all experience levels at $77,000 for men and $63,000 for women
The survey revealed that the median salary for chemists who were employed full-time—and who had not changed jobs over the prior year—fell 2.1% in 2012 to $92,000. That decline hit those with a Ph.D. hardest. This group saw a 2.0% drop in median salary to $100,000. Chemists with a master’s degree saw no change in salary from March 2011 to March 2012, while those with a bachelor’s degree experienced an increase of 1.9% to $74,200.
Salary by Region. In 2013, average annual salaries for entry-level chemists fluctuated the most in the West region, according to Indeed, where they earned the highest salaries of $43,000 in California and lowest of $26,000 in Hawaii. Those in the South made $33,000 to $46,000 per year Louisiana and Washington, D.C., respectively. This salary is comparable to the $41,080 salary the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported for the bottom 10 percent of chemists as of May 2012. The minimum requirements for these scientists are typically a bachelor's degree in chemistry and two years of industry experience.
