Plant cells are remarkable in that they have two organelles specialized for energy production: chloroplasts, which create energy via photosynthesis, and mitochondria, which generate energy through respiration, a particularly important process when light is unavailable.
All animal and plant cells contain organelles, little organs, which regulate specific functions within the cell. Two types of organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, are energy-related; they supply molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which power the processes of life and growth.
Chloroplast. Photosynthesis occurs in eukaryotic cell structures called chloroplasts. A chloroplast is a type of plant cell organelle known as a plastid. Plastids assist in storing and harvesting needed substances for energy production.
One of the most widely recognized and important characteristics of plants is their ability to conduct photosynthesis, in effect, to make their own food by converting light energy into chemical energy. This process occurs in almost all plant species and is carried out in specialized organelles known as chloroplasts.
(1 of 3). Several types of energy conversion occur in cells. Respiration is the process by which raw fuel energy is converted to a form that can be used for cellular work. Cellular work is a set of processes that includes routine housekeeping as well as special functions such as mitosis. All cells respire and do work.
In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells may contain several other types of organelles, which may include mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Each of these organelles performs a specific function critical to the cell's survival.
