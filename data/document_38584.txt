gig·a·byte. n. 1. A unit of computer memory or data storage capacity equal to 1,024 megabytes (2 30 bytes). 2. One billion bytes. Usage Note: The usual meaning of the prefix giga-is one billion, so one would expect the term gigabyte to refer to one billion bytes. 
The gigabyte (/ˈɡɪɡəbaɪt/ GIG-ə-byt or /ˈdʒɪɡəbaɪt/) is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The prefix giga means 10 9 in the International System of Units (SI), therefore one gigabyte is 1000000000bytes. The unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB. This definition is used in all contexts of science, engineering, business, and many areas of computing, including hard drive, solid state drive, and tape capacities, as well as data transmission speeds. The term gigabyte is commonly used to mean either 1000 3 bytes or 1024 3 bytes. The latter originated as compromise technical jargon for byte multiples that needed to be expressed by the powers of 2 but lacked a convenient name.
Definition. A measure of a computer's disk storage capacity or a computer file's size. One megabyte is equal to 1,024 kilobytes. A larger amount of megabytes increases a computer's ability to store and process more information. Megabytes are often abbreviated as MB. 
Gigabyte. A gigabyte is 2 to the 30th power, or 1,073,741,824 bytes. It can be estimated as 10 to the 9th power, or one billion (1,000,000,000) bytes. A gigabyte is 1,024 megabytes and precedes the terabyte unit of measurement. Hard drive sizes are typically measured in gigabytes, such as a 160GB or 250GB drive.
Gigabyte. A gigabyte is 10 9 or 1,000,000,000 bytes. One gigabyte (abbreviated GB) is equal to 1,000 megabytes and precedes the terabyte unit of measurement. 
The definition of a gigabyte is a unit of storage capacity for computer data and memory equal to about one billion bytes. An example of a gigabyte is about 200 songs stored on an mp3 player. 
Megabyte. A megabyte is 2 to the 20th power, or 1,048,576 bytes. It can be estimated as 10 to the 6th power, or one million (1,000,000) bytes. A megabyte is 1,024 kilobytes and precedes the gigabyte unit of measurement. Large computer files are typically measured in megabytes. 
›› Definition: Megabyte. A megabyte is a unit of information or computer storage equal to 1,048,576 bytes. The official SI definition uses the mebibyte or MiB unit to represent 2 20 bytes. However, most people have requested the more common usage, so the non-SI version is used on this site.
A megabyte is 10 6 or 1,000,000 bytes. One megabyte (abbreviated MB) is equal to 1,000 kilobytes and precedes the gigabyte unit of measurement. While a megabyte is technically 1,000,000 bytes, megabytes are often used synonymously with mebibytes, which contain 1,048,576 bytes (2 20 or 1,024 x 1,024 bytes)
