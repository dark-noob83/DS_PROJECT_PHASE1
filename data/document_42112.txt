To conduct a value chain analysis, the company begins by identifying each part of its production process and identifying where steps can be eliminated or improvements can be made. These improvements can result in either cost savings or improved productive capacity. To understand how to conduct a value chain analysis, a business must first know what its value chain is. A value chain is the full range of activities — including design, production, marketing and distribution — businesses go through to bring a product or service from conception to delivery.
Value engineering (VE) is systematic method to improve the value of goods or products and services by using an examination of function. Value, as defined, is the ratio of function to cost. Value can therefore be increased by either improving the function or reducing the cost. This is the basis of what value engineering refers to as function analysis. Value engineering uses rational logic (a unique how - why questioning technique) and the analysis of function to identify relationships that increase value.
Value Analysis. The value analyst should always be aware of functions, not of products, shapes, or processes. The main function is what the item does, is that which somebody wanted to archive by creating the item. Express this function (if possible) with just two words, a verb and a noun. Value analysis is not a method of controlling the work of others or of investigating errors. Normally the amount of work to implement an idea is greater than the amount of work needed to produce the idea.
Do not be surprised if as a result of value analysis the cost of an item is less than half of its previous cost. Select the item to be studied and form a study group. To make a value analysis we form a study group of 4 to 6 persons, preferably each with different knowledge, with different backgrounds. Value analysis is not a method of controlling the work of others or of investigating errors. Normally the amount of work to implement an idea is greater than the amount of work needed to produce the idea.
DEFINITION of 'Process Value Analysis-PVA'. A strategy that businesses use to determine whether all of their operational expenses are necessary and if they could be operating more efficiently. Process value analysis looks at what the customer wants and then asks if each aspect of operations is necessary to achieve that result. The goal of process value analysis is to eliminate unnecessary expenses incurred in the process of creating a good or service without sacrificing customer satisfaction. Next Up
A critical advantage to using value analysis is its potential for reducing costs, which is a benefit that permeates all advantages of the system. Because value analysis breaks down a product or service into components, it enables you to analyze each component on its own, evaluating its importance and efficiency. The value analysis process often allows users to root out practices that have grown out of date and can be replaced with more modern approaches. This is particularly beneficial when something has been done the same way for an extended period of time.
Value analysis is oriented to weigh costs and the benefit to customers of a product or service. It forces you to consider every aspect of a process in the context of how it serves the customer, which could be a consumer or another business. The value analysis process often allows users to root out practices that have grown out of date and can be replaced with more modern approaches. This is particularly beneficial when something has been done the same way for an extended period of time.
Paramount to the value analysis is the practice of breaking down a process into each individual component and considering ways to improve that component's value as measured by cost and importance to the process. General Electric developed value analysis during the late 1940s. The value analysis process often allows users to root out practices that have grown out of date and can be replaced with more modern approaches. This is particularly beneficial when something has been done the same way for an extended period of time.
Value analysis is a systematic effort to improve upon cost and/or performance of products (services), either purchased or produced. It examines the materials, processes, information systems, and the flow of materials involved. Value Analysis efforts began in earnest during WW II.
