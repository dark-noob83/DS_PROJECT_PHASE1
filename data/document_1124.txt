A stereo headset is a headset that is capable of playing stereo sound. A headset will include earphones or headphones that go over or in the ear to deliver sound directly to the wearer.
in order to enjoy a stereo headset, it is necessary to have the headset being used in both ears. Many may prefer to only put an earphone in one ear to have the other ear free. While this is certainly an option and personal preference, it will not provide stereo sound, as stereo requires two different speakers.

Applying the same logic to cell phone headsets, a normal headset (one that goes on one ear) is a mono headset with only one streaming line of audio. You have one ear, one speaker, and one line for audio. A stereo bluetooth headset will cover both ears and split the audio into a left and right channel for sound.
