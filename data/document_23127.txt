In warmer climates, you may need only 30 to 35 BTU per hour per square foot to heat your house adequately. In colder climates, you may need up to 50 to 60 BTU/h/ft 2. In general, the further from the equator you live, the greater the number of BTU/h/ft 2 you need, but weather patterns and geography modify this somewhat. 1 To cool 250–300 ft 2, you need ~7,000 BTUs per hour. 2  To cool 300–350 ft 2, you need ~8,000 BTUs per hour. 3  To cool 350–400 ft 2, you need ~9,000 BTUs per hour. 4  To cool 400–450 ft 2, you need ~10
0. British Thermal Unit (BTU) is the traditional unit of energy. The heat value of fuels and the heating power of gas grills can be expressed in terms of BTU. It is defined as the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit at a constant pressure of 1 atmosphere. How many BTU do you need? In the past, we've been advised to look for grills with about 100 BTU per square inch of main cooking area. This rule no longer applies because modern gas grills are now becoming more and more efficient at trapping heat.
For a standard gas grill, look for about 80 to 100 BTUs per square inch, and 60 to 80 for an infrared grill like the Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Commercial 2-Burner Gas Grill ($215.20 with in-store pickup, a low by $54), which uses radiant heat. Once again, this supposes that the grill you buy is efficient and well made. 
BTU (British Thermal Units-those dang Brits) is the amount of heat needed to bring one pound of water to a boil not the size of the grill. However, the bigger the grill, the more BTUs you will have. Gas grills are typically 20,000 - 50,000 BTU. One tip-you should buy your grill based on how often and how much you grill. Report Abuse. The BTU rating is based on the output of the burners. Basically, the more BTUs, the more heat will come out of your burners. For a regular sized BBQ, I would suggest at least 40 000 BTUs.
If you are considering charcoal, think 9,000 BTUs per pound and pellets about 8,500. A 30,000 BTU gas grill emits 30,000 BTUs in one hour, or about two pounds of propane an hour. BTU's do not indicate how quickly a grill will heat up, but can indicate how much fuel you will be using while you cook. The anagram stands for British Thermal Unit and indicates how much heat energy is needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree F. So if you choose a propane grill, propane has about 15,000 BTUs per pound.
The term BTUs will be thrown at you when you begin your grill shopping. Don't panic. The anagram stands for British Thermal Unit and indicates how much heat energy is needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree F.

The rule was once 100 Btu per square inch of main cooking area. This rule no longer applies because modern gas grills are now becoming more and more efficient at holding heat. One thing you should know is that the temperature a gas grill can attain is not influence by the BTU rating alone.
How Many BTUs: In the old days, 100 BTUs per square inch was probably on the low side. These days, grills are more efficiently designed and typically don't need as high an output. For a standard gas grill I recommend looking at how the lid fits to the body. If it is a close fit and the components, like the cooking grates, are heavy the grill should heat hot and fat with a BTU rating of 80 to 100 per square inch. For an infrared grill, the same rules apply but the BTUs should be more in the 60 to 80 range
Summer kicks off the grilling season in many parts of North America, and while a gas grill is a home appliance of sorts, it's nowhere as easy to purchase as a toaster or a blender. On the one hand, you could spend as little as $68 for this two-burner gas grill at Walmart (with in-store pickup, a low by $107). Or, you could opt for the mighty Kalamazoo K750HT Hybrid Fire Freestanding Grill, which packs 75,000 BTUs of burger-searing firepower and boasts a 33 x 22 primary grilling surface. But there are some magic numbers to look for. For a standard gas grill, look for about 80 to 100 BTUs per square inch, and 60 to 80 for an infrared grill like the Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Commercial 2-Burner Gas Grill ($215.20 with in-store pickup, a low by $54), which uses radiant heat.
