Brain Stem. The brain stem is part of the hindbrain and connects the brain to the spinal cord. It controls various vital functions such as blood pressure, breathing and heart rate. Nerve impulses to and from the cerebellum and the cerebrum must travel through the brain stem.
Causes. The posterior fossa is a small space in the skull, found near the brainstem and cerebellum. The cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for movement, balance, and coordination. The brainstem is responsible for controlling vital body functions, such as breathing. If a tumor grows in the area of the posterior fossa, it can block the flow of spinal fluid and cause increased pressure on the brain and spinal cord. Most tumors of the posterior fossa are primary brain cancers.
Some parts of it are linked to the cerebellum and thus are associated with posture and movement. Medulla: The medulla is located in between the spinal cord and the pons. It is the tail-end of the brain stem and is tasked with the duty of controlling vital body functions like heart rate and breathing.
Many different parts of the brain and their functions are shown in the article. The human brain is ultimately responsible for all thought and movement that the body produces.
The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain, and contains tools which are responsible for most of the brain's function. It is divided into four sections: the temporal lobe, the occipital lobe, parietal lobe and frontal lobe.
Medulla. Medulla Oblongata-this structure is the caudal-most part of the brain stem, between the pons and spinal cord. It is responsible for maintaining vital body functions, such as breathing and heartrate. | Forum | Brain and Behavior | Serendip Home |.
