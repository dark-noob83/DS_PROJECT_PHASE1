In plants of the genus Capsicum, capsaicin is distributed around the seeds (not inside), and other parts of the flesh. Chilli peppers and other members of the genus Capsicum are added to foodstuffs to give them a spicy or pungent flavor and aroma. Capsaicin is an irritant humans and other mammals, causing a burning sensation in the tissues with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and other related compounds are called capsaicinoids. These are produced by chili peppers, probably through the ages, for deterant for consumption by herbivores.
Frostburg State University chemistry professor Fred Senese states that capsaicin fits into a category of chemicals known as vanilloids that contain a hexagonal ring of carbons and produce strong flavors. This is why guzzling water when you eat a spicy pepper does nothing to help the burn. Vegetable oils and alcohol can effectively bond with capsaicin to remove it from your mouth and ease the pain, but few people want to drink vegetable oil and there is not enough alcohol in beer to effectively remove enough capsaicin.
Capsaicin is the ingredient found in different types of hot peppers, such as cayenne peppers, that makes the peppers spicy hot. You can eat it in raw or cooked peppers or as a dried powder, which you can add to food or drinks. Although pain may at first increase, it usually decreases after the first use. Capsaicin stimulates the release of a compound believed to be involved in communicating pain between the nerves in the spinal cord and other parts of the body. When you apply it to the skin, capsaicin may help relieve pain from:
When a capsaicin cream or ointment is used on the skin (topical use), capsaicin helps relieve pain. Capsaicin works by first stimulating and then decreasing the intensity of pain signals in the body. Although pain may at first increase, it usually decreases after the first use. Capsaicin stimulates the release of a compound believed to be involved in communicating pain between the nerves in the spinal cord and other parts of the body. When you apply it to the skin, capsaicin may help relieve pain from: 1  Pain disorders, including pain after surgery. 2  Nervous system problems such as diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, and postherpetic neuralgia (shingles). 3  Cluster headaches. 4  Joint problems such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
A spicy addition to almost any recipe, jalapeno peppers get their fiery flavor from capsaicin, the active ingredient common to a wide range of chili peppers that are members of the Capsicum family. Long a staple of Mexican cuisine, the jalapeno is a medium-sized chili pepper thatâ€™s hot but not super-hot. Capsaicin is one of the capsaicinoids, pharmacologically active chemical compounds that occur naturally at varying levels in peppers of the Capsicum family. So potent is capsaicin that it is used in concentrated form to produce self-defense sprays designed to temporarily blind and disable potential assailants.
Products containing capsaicin are used to deter bears and dogs. They may also be used as repellents against wildlife or pets in backyards and gardens. Other products can be used in nurseries or in agriculture. Products containing capsaicin can be aerosols, liquids, or granular formulations. There are several dozen products containing capsaicin on the market in the United States. Many of these products are animal repellents. Always follow label instructions and take steps to avoid exposure.
Although it is often used in cooking, eating too much capsaicin can lead to irritation of the mouth, stomach, and intestines. People may develop vomiting and diarrhea. Inhaling sprays containing capsaicin can cause coughing, difficulty breathing, production of tears, nausea, nasal irritation, and temporary blindness.

Pure capsaicin is a volatile, hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, crystalline to waxy compound. It is an irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called capsaicinoids and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi.
Though capsaicin is present in miniscule amounts in foods such as oregano, cinnamon and cilantro, it is predominantly found in peppers of the genus Capsicum. Capsaicin is an odorless compound and not volatile, meaning that cooking it will not break it down chemically. This is why guzzling water when you eat a spicy pepper does nothing to help the burn. Vegetable oils and alcohol can effectively bond with capsaicin to remove it from your mouth and ease the pain, but few people want to drink vegetable oil and there is not enough alcohol in beer to effectively remove enough capsaicin.
Capsaicin Content. Capsaicin is formed in the glands of chili peppers, at the junction of the placenta and pod walls. It stimulates chemoreceptor nerve endings in mucous membranes, causing the burning sensation on the skin or in your mouth. Spicy peppers are the foods that contain the beneficial compound capsaicin. Generally, the hotter the fruit, the higher the content. Here is a list of high capsaicin foods. slide 1 of 5. Both sweet bell peppers and spicy chili peppers belong to the Capsicum family of vegetables.
