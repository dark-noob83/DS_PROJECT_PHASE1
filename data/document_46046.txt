Hold the tips of the skewers and slide off the meat and vegetables onto a bed of rice using a fork.
Place Kabobs on a baking dish and Bake @ 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes then turn the kabobs over and bake 5-7 minutes longer. If you like your steak well done just keep the kabobs in for a few extra minutes until the meat is cooked through and the peppers are tender. Enjoy.
Cook the kabobs in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, turning every five to 10 minutes. Brush extra -- fresh -- marinade on the kabobs during the last five minutes of cooking. 1  Although your vegetables will almost certainly cook thoroughly in the 20- to 30-minute time frame, youâ€™ll want to keep a close eye on your meats.
