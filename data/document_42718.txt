1 Architect's fees depend a great deal on the project and the location, and can vary in both amount and type: 2  Hourly charges may start at $50-$150 but can go up depending on the type of work (from creating drawings to inspecting a construction site), location, and the architect's training, experience and reputation. 1 A negotiated flat fee can be as low as $700-$1,000 for up to a specified number of hours spent creating a concept design. 2  Or an architect might agree to design a 25x25-foot room addition for $5,000-$10,000, or a 3,000-square-foot custom home for $50,000-$75,000 or more, no matter what the final construction price is.
Architect fees are typically charged by the hour, as a percentage of construction costs, or by square footage. How an architect charges depends on the firm, the nature of the job, what part of the country you’re in, the economy, and your skill at negotiating. If you hire an architect on a hourly basis, they might charge you between $60 and $125 per hour for their services, though it can vary. Charging by the hour is beneficial to the architect as some homeowners can find themselves constantly making changes to the design.
1 Fees can also be based on 5 to 15 percent of a project's construction expenses. 2  Designing a 25x25-foot room addition that costs $165,000-$200,000 to build could generate an architect's bill of $8,250-$30,000; using this pricing method, the fee for a $750,000 custom-built new home could be $37,500-$112,500. 1 A negotiated flat fee can be as low as $700-$1,000 for up to a specified number of hours spent creating a concept design. 2  Or an architect might agree to design a 25x25-foot room addition for $5,000-$10,000, or a 3,000-square-foot custom home for $50,000-$75,000 or more, no matter what the final construction price is.
If your building costs $1,000,000.00 and the architect charges 10% his fee is $100,000 making the total value of the house $1,100,00.00. It is important to understand that decisions made with the architect/designer are decisions that you will be living with for many years to com. 
If you want to amend your house plans, the best time to do this is during the drafting process. It’s much easier to make amendments while your professional is using CAD than to try and make changes further into the project. The cost of your house plans depends on the size and scope of the project. Larger properties will take longer for the drafter, architect or building designer to plan and document, so will cost more. Design fees may be charged by the house, at a fixed price or as a percentage of the total construction costs. Generally, it can cost anywhere between $5000 and $10,000 for a custom home design to be created and submitted to council. Your costs will increase if you choose an architect over a drafter or building designer
To give you an idea of costs I will tell you what my firm charges. If the project is done on an hourly basis it is $125/hr for me the architect and $85/hr for my CAD technicians. We usually charge a lump sum fee for a project based on my budgeting how much time I believe the project will take based on the rates above. Typically for single family new construction, minimum 5% to 6% of construction cost should cover the cost of an architect's time. However 6% to 8% will be needed to cover architect's overheads and profits (Engineers extra add another 2%.).
Most homeowners report spending between $2,091 and $7,813 when they hire an architect. An architect is an asset to any project requiring building a new structure or fundamentally altering a current structure. An architect can turn your vision into an actual plan and create blueprints for a builder to work from. If you hire an architect on a hourly basis, they might charge you between $60 and $125 per hour for their services, though it can vary. Charging by the hour is beneficial to the architect as some homeowners can find themselves constantly making changes to the design.
