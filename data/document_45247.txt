Argon. Argon was suspected to be present in air by Henry Cavendish in 1785 but wasn't discovered until 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay. Argon is the third noble gas, in period 8, and it makes up about 1% of the Earth's atmosphere.
Argon in the atmosphere is the third most abundant gas in the atmosphere behind nitrogen and oxygen. Argon makes up 0.934% of the atmosphere by volume in dry air. Argon is an inert or noble gas.
Argon was discovered by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Lord Rayleigh, an English chemist, in 1894. Argon makes up 0.93% of the earth's atmosphere, making it the third most abundant gas. Argon is obtained from the air as a byproduct of the production of oxygen and nitrogen. Argon is frequently used when an inert atmosphere is needed.
Though inert, argon is far from rare; it makes up 0.94 percent of Earth's atmosphere, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). By Chemicool's calculations, that translates to 65 trillion metric tons â€” and the number increases over time as potassium-40 decays.
