Guidance for Ofsted inspectors conducting inspections under sections 49 and 50 of the Childcare Act 2006 from the time the inspection is arranged to the publication of the report.
Changes to Ofsted inspections for new settings. Following the announcement by Ofsted that new settings will be inspected within 30 months of opening rather than 7 months, concerns have been raised about jeopardising quality of care.
Early Years Register. If you’re on the Early Years Register, you’ll usually be inspected within the first 30 months of registration and then at least once in every inspection cycle. The current Early Years inspection cycle finishes on 31 July 2016. You’ll also be inspected if someone reports concerns about the childcare you’re providing.
Ofsted’s school inspection framework from September 2015 From September 2015, a new common inspection framework will be introduced to cover early years providers, state-funded schools, some independent schools and further education and skills providers.
