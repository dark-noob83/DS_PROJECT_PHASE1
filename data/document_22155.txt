Work out contribution margin ratio. Contribution margin ratio measures the percentage of sales that would increase net income. To calculate it, divide contribution margin by sales, either in total or per unit: Suppose a gadget selling for $100 per unit brings in $40 per unit of contribution margin. Its contribution margin ratio is 40 percent: To find out how sales affect net income, multiply the contribution margin ratio by the amount of sales.
To calculate breakeven in dollars, divide its fixed expenses by the contribution margin ratio of 60% ($60,000/.6 = $100,000). This means that the company has to make $100,000 in sales to breakeven. The contribution margin ratio is an important financial metric to calculate the profit potential for a business firm.
Contribution Margin Ratio | Contribution Margin Formula. The contribution margin ratio is the difference between a company's sales and variable expenses, expressed as a percentage. The total margin generated by an entity represents the total earnings available to pay for fixed expenses and generate a profit.
The contribution margin, sometimes used as a ratio, is the difference between a company's total sales revenue and variable costs. In other words, the contribution margin equals the amount that sales exceed variable costs. This is the sales amount that can be used to, or contributed to, pay off fixed costs.
To compute contribution margin, subtract variable costs of a sale from the amount of the sale itself: For example, if you sell a gadget for $10 and its variable cost is $6, the contribution margin for the sale would be $4 ($10 – $6 = $4). Selling this gadget would increase your profit by $4.
You can use total contribution margin to create something called a contribution margin income statement. This document is different from a multi-step income statement, where you first subtract cost of goods sold from sales and then subtract selling, general, and administrative costs.
Net income = Total contribution margin – Fixed costs $20,000 = Total contribution marginTarget – $10,000 $30,000 = Total contribution marginTarget. If you have set a specific goal for net income, contribution margin analysis can help you figure out the needed sales. This goal for net income is called target profit.
