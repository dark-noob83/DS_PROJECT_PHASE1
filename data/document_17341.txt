Best Answer: Non-OEM inkjet cartridges are actually a great way to save money on printer ink (which can be really pricey for some machines). I've used them-and still do, for my cannon-they've worked out really well.
Buying NON-OEM (original equipment manufacturer) INK can be scary, especially if you have always bought name brand ink!
Refilling is simple, and the print quality is as good as an OEM cartridge. I had not used this printer in nearly 6 months due to the price of ink, and due to the fact that the printer lost all functions if one of the four cartridges was empty.
Sometimes itâ€™s hard to know what makes one cartridge different from another. Here is a basic guide to the different types and kinds of printer cartridges, outlining the differences and benefits of OEM, remanufactured, and compatible printer ink and toner cartridges.
Like any other product, you can expect a wide range of quality and price for ink and toner cartridges. It is often worth experimenting with remanufactured or compatible cartridges, as you may discover a third party company like Inkpal that offers good ink cartridges at a much cheaper cost.

The printer makers--the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs--claim that their ink is worth the premium prices they charge for it. OEM ink, they say, creates images that are more accurate and color-rich, and longer-lived. Third-party suppliers, on the other hand, say that their inks are just as good but cost a lot less. For example, HP charges $18 for a black ink cartridge for its Photosmart C5180 printer, but the same cartridge remanufactured by Cartridge World costs only $8.75.
