The General Schedule. The General Schedule (GS) is the predominant pay scale for federal employees, especially employees in professional, technical, administrative or clerical positions. The system consists of 15 grades, from GS-1, the lowest level, to GS-15, the highest level. There are also 10 steps within each grade. The grade level assigned to a position determines the pay level for that job.
Thus, an employee’s salary may be raised without moving out of the grade itself. For example, an employee at GS-1 (grade 1), Step 1 will be paid about $16,000 while an employee at GS-1, Step 10 will receive $20,000. This is part of the incentive program the government uses to inspire better employees. There are two promotion patterns when changing grades. The highest grade is GS-15 with the highest salary, which is also the cap for all the salaries. In any given year, a government employee may not be paid more than that limit. As of January 2005, the top salary allowed is $116,517.
