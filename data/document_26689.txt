13-18 years: Teens who missed getting a tetanus and diphtheria toxiods booster vaccine (Td) or Tdap booster at age 11-12 should also receive a single dose of Tdap if they have completed the recommended childhood DTaP vaccination series. Td boosters are recommended every 10 years throughout adulthood.
