Hertz is a frequency measurement unit. The SI unit of frequency is a frequency equal to one oscillation or cycle per second. The unit has a special name, the hertz (Hz), after German physisist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz who first experimentally demonstrated electromagnetic theory of light.
Hertz. Hertz (abbreviated: Hz) is the standard unit of measurement used for measuring frequency. Since frequency is measured in cycles per second, one hertz equals one cycle per second. Hertz is used commonly used to measure wave frequencies, such as sound waves, light waves, and radio waves. For example, the average human ear can detect sound waves between 20 and 20,000 Hz. Sound waves close to 20 Hz have a low pitch and are called bass frequencies.
Hertz. Named after Heinrich Hertz and abbreviated as Hz or illustrated as the f symbol, hertz equals one (0.00000000125) cycle per second, measuring the waves or frequencies of electric changes each second. Hertz is commonly used to measure a computer monitor's refresh rate and in computer processors.
Hertz is a unit of frequency (of change in state or cycle in a sound wave, alternating current, or other cyclical waveform) of one cycle per second. It replaces the earlier term of cycle per second (cps)..
hertz. A unit used to measure the frequency of vibrations and waves. One hertz is equal to one cycle per second. Radio waves are usually measured in megahertz, or millions of hertz.
The hertz (symbol Hz) is the unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second. It is named for Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves.
