The length of time it takes blood to circulate throughout the body depends on a person's size, overall physical condition and health, age and heart rate. It takes the heart less than one minute to pump blood to every cell in the body. In fact, six quarts of blood can fully circulate throughout the body at least three times within that minute. That totals thousands of round trips each day.
Blood takes less time to circulate when you are active or exercising, as your heart rate decreases when you are resting. The healthy adult heart beats approximately 65 to 75 beats per minute. With each beat, the heart pumps an average of 60 to 70 milliliters of blood, or about five liters per minute. The American Heart Association points out that based on an average of 100,000 beats each day, the heart pumps out 2,000 gallons of blood. It takes the heart less than one minute to pump blood to every cell in the body. In fact, six quarts of blood can fully circulate throughout the body at least three times within that minute. That totals thousands of round trips each day.
This vast system of blood vessels-arteries, veins, and capillaries-is over 60,000 miles long. That's long enough to go around the world more than twice! Blood flows continuously through your body's blood vessels. The veins (blue) take oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. 1  Arteries begin with the aorta, the large artery leaving the heart. 2  They carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to all of the body's tissues. 3  They branch several times, becoming smaller and smaller as they carry blood further from
The answer is… 20 seconds. That’s pretty amazing considering the complex network of blood vessels – arteries, veins and capillaries – that carry blood through the body. According to The Cleveland Clinic, that system is over 60,000 miles long. That’s long enough to circle Earth twice! Keep on tickin! 
If you are more active, it will take less time. Exactly how long depends on several things: the rate at which your heart beats, how big your heart is, and, to a certain extent, how big you are as well. A person's heart beats about 65 to 75 times a minutes. This is called the beat rate. For a normal adult, it takes close to one minute for a blood cell to circulate the body:- The stroke volume (SV) of the heart is roughly 60-70ml.
How long does the round trip take? A typical human body contains 5.6 liters (6 quarts) of blood. According to this page “The heart pumps about 2,000 gallons (7,571 liters) of blood a day through its chambers.”. 2,000 gallons per day works out to 83 gallons per hour, or nearly 6 quarts per minute. So it takes about one minute for blood to make the round trip to the heart.
also consider; For a person at rest, it takes just about one minute. If you are more active, it will take less time. Exactly how long depends on several things: the rate at which your heart beats, how big your heart is, and, to a certain extent, how big you are as well. A person's heart beats about 65 to 75 times a minutes. Confidence votes 137. For a normal adult, it takes close to one minute for a blood cell to circulate the body:-. The stroke volume (SV) of the heart is roughly 60-70ml. The total blood volume (BV) is 4-5L in an individual.
The Heart. Blood moves through the arteries and veins in only one direction. The opening and closing of valves in the heart's chambers work in such a way to make certain that blood is carried throughout the body in a circle known as circulation. It takes the heart less than one minute to pump blood to every cell in the body. In fact, six quarts of blood can fully circulate throughout the body at least three times within that minute. That totals thousands of round trips each day.
