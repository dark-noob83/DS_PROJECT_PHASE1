Hi and congratulations: Most wedding invitations are mailed (or should arrive at the guest's home) 6-8 weeks before the wedding, not necessarily 2 months, but that is OK also. Shower invitations will not be mailed by you, but by the person hosting the shower. Shower invitations only need about 3 weeks notice.

Make sure also to ask your caterer when they'll need final head counts. Typically, you should ask for an RSVP date 3 weeks before your wedding, if you sent them on time. At a minimum, send them out six weeks in advance, and set an RSVP date of 2 weeks before the wedding.
