Triglyceride Ranges. A triglyceride level less than 150 mg/dL is considered ideal for adults, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. A triglyceride level of 150 to 200 mg/dL is borderline high. A triglyceride result of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, and levels of 500 mg/dL or more are very high. The normal range for triglyceride level for adults is less than 150 mg/dL
In the United States, cholesterol levels are calculated in milligrams of cholesterol for each deciliter of blood. A result of under 200 mg per dL (5.2 mmol/L) is ideal. A level somewhere between 200 to 239 mg per dL (5.2 and 6.2 mmol/L) is within the edge line of high-risk class. LDL levels are therefore the very best gauge of risk of cardiac arrest. A low LDL cholesterol is much better. Lower than 100 mg per dL (2.6 mmol/L) is the ideal. Between 100 and 129 mg per dL (2.6 and 3.3 mmol/L) is close to ideal, while between 130 and 159 mg per dL (3.4 and 4.1 mmol/L) is borderline elevated.
The National Cholesterol Education Program sets guidelines for triglyceride levels: Normal triglycerides means there are less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline high triglycerides = 150 to 199 mg/dL. High triglycerides = 200 to 499 mg/dL. Very high triglycerides = 500 mg/dL or higher. High triglyceride levels may lead to heart disease, especially in people with low levels of good cholesterol and high levels of bad cholesterol, and in people with type 2 diabetes. Your total cholesterol level is in the Desirable range, but your level of bad LDL cholesterol is High. This may mean that your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, is too low. It is best to have a high level of good HDL and a low level of bad LDL.
A simple blood test can reveal whether your triglycerides fall into a healthy range. 1  Normal — Less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or less than 1.7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). 2  Borderline high — 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.8 to 2.2 mmol/L). 
Test Results. If your blood triglyceride levels are normal, your test results will be less than 150 milligrams per deciliter. The range for borderline high triglycerides is 150 to 199 milligrams per deciliter. The range for high is 200 to 499 milligrams per deciliter. Any level above 499 is considered very high. Eating too many foods that are high in sugar and fat can throw your triglycerides out of the normal range. Triglycerides, or blood fats, are usually measured along with cholesterol during a routine blood test known as a lipid profile.
Lipid measurement may show normal total cholesterol, with a low HDL-good cholesterol and a moderately elevated triglyceride level; for example, total cholesterol of 197 mg/dL, an LDL-bad of 120 mg/dL, an HDL of 35 mg/dL, and a triglyceride of 210 mg/dL. High Triglycerides and High LDL-Bad Cholesterol : If you have high triglycerides (over 200 mg/dL, or 2.3 mmol/L) in combination with high LDL-bad cholesterol (over 160 mg/dL, or 4.1 mmol/L), the LDL abnormality will be treated first-along with lifestyle changes, medication (usually statins), or both.
Triglycerides are one of the types of fat in the body and your level can be measured with a blood test. The test is more accurate if it is done after fasting from food and drinks for 9 to 12 hours. The normal range for triglyceride level for adults is less than 150 mg/dL. A triglyceride level less than 150 mg/dL is considered ideal for adults, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. A triglyceride level of 150 to 200 mg/dL is borderline high. A triglyceride result of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, and levels of 500 mg/dL or more are very high
In assessing the risk of heart disease, standard medicine targets usually total blood cholesterol and LDL-bad cholesterol levels. However, people with high cholesterol often have high triglycerides, especially when there is no another disorder present. High Triglycerides and High LDL-Bad Cholesterol : If you have high triglycerides (over 200 mg/dL, or 2.3 mmol/L) in combination with high LDL-bad cholesterol (over 160 mg/dL, or 4.1 mmol/L), the LDL abnormality will be treated first-along with lifestyle changes, medication (usually statins), or both.
3. Triglycerides Over 500 mg/dL : 4. Borderline-High Triglycerides and Normal LDL-Bad Cholesterol : If your triglycerides are borderline-high (150 - 199 mg/dL, or 1.7 2.3 mmol/L) with normal LDL-bad cholesterol (less than 130 mg/dL, or 3.4 mmol/L) your doctor my consider using niacin or a fibrate. Not all doctors would agree you should be treated medically, unless you have history of vascular disease. High Triglycerides and High LDL-Bad Cholesterol : If you have high triglycerides (over 200 mg/dL, or 2.3 mmol/L) in combination with high LDL-bad cholesterol (over 160 mg/dL, or 4.1 mmol/L), the LDL abnormality will be treated first-along with lifestyle changes, medication (usually statins), or both.
