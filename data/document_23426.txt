That year, driving a car 10,000 miles cost 9 cents a mile, and gasoline sold for 27 cents per gallon. Methodology Cost calculations in this edition of Your Driving Costs are comparable to the 2012 version. The process used to estimate annual driving costs is proprietary to AAA.
Car insurance costs are affected by several factors, such as driving record, where you live (state regulations as well as neighborhood crime rates), age, and the car itself (s â€¦ ports cars will cost more to insure), however, the national average is $1,837 per year or $153 monthly.
Multiply the total amount of fuel per month you burn by the cost of a gallon or liter of gasoline to get your monthly fuel costs. If gas costs $4 per gallon ($1.05 per liter), you spend $128 per month on fuel, or 17 cents per mile (10 cents per km).
2. Divide vehicle operation costs, $293.83 per month in our hypothetical scenario, by the distance you drive per month, 750 miles (1,207 km) in our example, to calculate the cost per mile. The cost per mile for this hypothetical driver and vehicle is 39.17 cents per mile or 24 cents per kilometer.
(If your car has 30,000 miles [48,280 km] and is 40 months old, you drive about 750 miles [1,207 km] per month.) In this hypothetical example, divide 750 (1,207 km) by 20 gallons (75.7 liters) to get the number of gallons or liters you burn per month: 37.5 gallons (142 liters).
