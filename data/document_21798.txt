Your insurance will add a waver for the Caribbean that costs about $1000.00. Don’t forget that once you have closed on your new boat, all dockage and marina fees are billed to you. Marinas run about $100.00 per day, so if you leave her in the Caribbean for a month it will run you $3000.00. You should budget approximately $65.00 per linear foot, so if you are going to buy a 30 foot vessel, it will cost you for dockage $1950.00. Insurance will run about $800.00 per year, if you are operating your boat on an inland lake, coastal waters or major rivers.
Costs of living on a narrow boat (Updated for December 2014). Updated December 2014 We were afloat for 45 out of 52 weeks in 2014 so variable costs*** such as coal, diesel and gas have been divided by 45 and multiplied by 52 to give an annual figure. 
Francesca SpidalieriThe Trains' 40' Catalina has two bedrooms and a full kitchen on board. A year later, they still think that it was the right choice. In an average month, it costs them around $2,200 to live on the boat. By comparison, they would spend $2,500 to $3,000 to rent an apartment in a similar area of San Diego, and still be paying the boat's mortgage on top of that.

We spend about $1,700 per year on a catastrophic policy for the family. The annual cost of our boat liability insurance is about $550 per year—though it doubled for our time in Victoria because the marina requested we double our coverage (I wrote about our thoughts on insuring our own boat).
I own a 42' sailboat and have done some cruising in North and Central American, Portugal, Spain and the Canaries, and in the Caribbean. My personal take is that one can cruise and tour comfortably in a 40 to 45 foot boat for about $2,500 to $3,000 per month. One can live aboard for much less. 
Size matters with boats because every extra foot of boat costs more. When you live aboard, you get rid of all your land bills, but you take on a bunch of new and different costs, which are usually cheaper. So, the smaller your boat, the less expensive it is for both the initial purchase and ongoing costs. Most people think it isn’t possible to live on a boat under 30 feet. Not only is it possible, it’s preferable for the lone liveaboard or couple. And if you can’t afford to make a big mistake, don’t buy a big boat.
