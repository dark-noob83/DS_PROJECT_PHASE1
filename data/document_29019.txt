Medical school applicants can take the MCAT as many as 3 times in one application cycle / application year. Even still, you can only be registered for one test at any given time. For example, if you are registered to take the MCAT in May, you cannot register for the June exam until after you’ve taken the May exam.
No. All scores from every time you’ve taken the MCAT are reported and sent to the colleges you designate. The only exception is that if you tested prior to April 2003, you can select which of those pre-April 2003 scores to send to colleges.
1) The best way to improve your score on the MCAT is to take as many practice exams as possible. Ideally, you should take one exam/week for 12 weeks prior to the actual MCAT. Think of MCAT as a sport and yourself as the MCAT athlete. To prepare for the big day you need to practice, practice, and practice.

You may take the exam as many times as you want, but remember that schools you apply to will have access to all of your scores, so taking it more than 3 times may not be in your favor. You may take the exam up to 3 times per year, but you can only register for one exam at a time.
Remember that you can take the MCAT up to three times in a calendar year, with no lifetime maximum, and the scores from each test date are reported separately.
