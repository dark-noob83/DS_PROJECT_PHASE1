A normal resting heart rate can range anywhere from 40 to 100 beats per minute. Below is a chart relating resting heart rate and fitness level. As can be seen on this chart, your resting heart rate can vary with your fitness level and with age — the fitter you are, generally the lower the resting heart rate. 
The normal resting adult human heart rate ranges from 60–100 bpm. Tachycardia is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 BPM is common and is considered normal. Normal resting heart rates range from 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention.
While the normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60-100 beats per minute, conditioned athletes and other highly fit individuals might have normal resting heart rates of 40-60 beats per minute. 
For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the person’s physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA. But a heart rate lower than 60 doesn’t necessarily mean you have a medical problem. Active people often have lower heart rates because their heart muscles don't need to work as hard to maintain a steady beat. A normal heart rate depends on the individual, age, body size, heart conditions, whether the person is sitting or moving, medication use and even air temperature. Even emotions can have an impact on heart rate. For example, getting excited or scared can increase the
In newborn infants up to one year old, 100 to 160 bpm is normal. Children between one and 10 years old range from 70 to 120 bpm. After the age of 10, up to adults and seniors, 60 to 100 bpm are considered normal, often centered on 72 as a benchmark for healthy, resting adults. Physiologists at Montana State University report resting heart rates of 28 to 40 bpm. More common rates for most athletes range between the low 40s and low 50s. Normal athletic heart rates are low because athletes' heart muscles are so strong, a single beat pumps more than a normal amount of blood.

The pulse gets progressively slower through childhood toward adolescence. The normal resting heart rate for adults, including older-aged adults and everyone over the age of 10 years, is: 4. 1  Between 60-100 heartbeats a minute. 
A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute.
