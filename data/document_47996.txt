2400. Newer antipsychotics: over the last 10 years, newer medications have appeared. They still block dopamine, but much less so than the older drugs. They also work on different chemical messengers in the brain (such as serotonin) and are often called ‘atypical’ or ‘second-generation’ antipsychotics.
Antipsychotic drugs (which are also called 'neuroleptics') are prescribed to reduce the symptoms of psychosis, and to stop the symptoms re-occurring. Some antipsychotics also act as an antidepressant, a mood stabiliser or a sedative, and some can reduce the symptoms of mania.
There are three ‘generations’ of antipsychotics. The first generation is often called ‘typical’ antipsychotics, and a second, or newer generation, is called ‘atypical’. The latest drugs, some still in development and called third generation, are also often referred to as ‘atypical’. There are no published lists of ‘most prescribed’
The newer second generation antipsychotics (also called atypical antipsychotics) are mostly partial dopamine antagonists. They also block serotonin receptors, and are hence called serotonin dopamine antogonists. A lot of the side effects of the antispychotic medications are also mediated by blockage of the D2 receptor.
Antipsychotic Medications. Antipsychotic medications are the main form of treatment for psychotic disorders, not just for the treatment of schizophrenia. They are also called neuroleptic drugs or neuroleptics. Antipsychotic medications first came into recognition in the 1950s when it was fortuatously first used as an anxiolytic for the treatment of delirium. It was noticed that it had a very calming effect and that psychotic symptoms also improved.
