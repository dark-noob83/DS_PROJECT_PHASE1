Is a working definition of a non-minimum phase system something like: a system that contains zeros in the right half of the s plane? If so, can anyone point out to a relatively simple mechanical system example that is non minimum phase, something like a modified version of the classical spring/mass/damper? Thank you.
A maximum-phase system is the opposite of a minimum phase system. A causal and stable LTI system is a maximum-phase system if its inverse is causal and unstable. That is, 1  The zeros of the discrete-time system are outside the unit circle.
14.2 Minimum Phase Systems Denition 14.1 (Minimum phase systems). H (z) is minimum phase if all zeros & poles within unit circle. The denition of minimum phase systems implies they are stable and causal. It also suggests that H i (z)=1 H (z)has poles/zeros within unit circle. Therefore the inverse of a minimum phase system is another minimum phase systemwhich is causal and stable.Recall the magnitude response of C (z)= H (z) H (1= z)of a system couldnâ€™t uniquely determine H (z).
However, we are free to choose whether the zeros of the system are inside or outside the unit circle. A system with rational transfer function is minimum-phase if all its zeros are also inside the unit circle. Insight is given below as to why this system is called minimum-phase.
In other realms, if a system is minimum phase, it's inverse will have all of it's poles inside the unit circle and be causal. So a minimum phase system has a stable inverse.
In control theory and signal processing, a linear, time-invariant system is said to be minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable.
The relation of minimum to phase in a minimum phase system or filter can be seen if you plot the unwrapped phase against frequency. You can use a pole zero diagram of the system response to help do a incremental graphical plot of the frequency response and phase angle.
