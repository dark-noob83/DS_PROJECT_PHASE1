While I’ve seen brides spend as little as $200 on their wedding flowers and as much as $20,000, the cost will vary depending on your taste and the number of flowers you’ll need. To give you a better idea of what you can expect to spend, the average cost by type of wedding arrangement is below: 1  Bridal Bouquets : $100-150/each. 2  Bridesmaids Bouquets : $50-90/each. 3  Flower girl petals : $30-60. 4  Corsages : $15-20/each. 5  Boutonnieres : $10-15/each. 6  Altar Arrangements : $50-150/each. In fact, I spent around half that, with the flower cost breaking down as follows: 1  Ceremony flowers: $300. 2  My Bouquet: $95. 3  Bridesmaids: $35/each (6)= $210. 4  Groomsmen and Father Boutonnieres: $10/each (9)= $90. 5  Mother/Grandma Corsages: $25/each (4)= $100.
