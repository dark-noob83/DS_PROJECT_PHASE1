The United States farm real estate value, a measurement of the value of all land and buildings on farms, averaged $3,020 per acre for 2015, up 2.4 percent from 2014 values. The Mountain region had the lowest farm real estate value at $1,100 per acre. The United States cropland value increased by $30 per acre (0.7 percent) to $4,130 per acre from the previous year. In the Southern Plains region, the average cropland value increased 9.2 percent from the previous year. However, in the Corn Belt region, cropland values decreased by 2.3 percent

The Average. The average cost per acre of land can vary across the United States, but does have a general range. According to the Lincoln Institute and the Federal Housing Authority figures, an acre of land in 2010 sold for an average of $1,000. This is unimproved land without utilities or any structures or easements. In New Jersey, farmland can have an average cost of $8,000, while in Wyoming the same size acre can be purchased for one-tenth the same price. While there is an “average” cost per acre for land, there are various other costs and considerations that can drive the price upwards.
Arizona. With more than 72 million acres, Arizona was one of the largest states in the country. However, much of the land was undeveloped and unusable for agricultural purposes, leading to a valuation of just $315 billion, or $4,300 per acre, nearly one-third the value of an average acre in the lower 48 states. In fact, it is the smallest in the union. At just 673,000 acres Rhode Island’s total land value was just $90 billion, nearly the lowest in the country. However, the state was valued at $133,700 per acre on average, second only to New Jersey.
An average acre in Wyoming was worth just $1,600, less than any other continental state. Like most low-value states, Wyoming is one of the largest states in the country. But Wyoming’s 62.3 million acres were worth a total of $97 billion, less than all but a handful of other states. In fact, it is the smallest in the union. At just 673,000 acres Rhode Island’s total land value was just $90 billion, nearly the lowest in the country. However, the state was valued at $133,700 per acre on average, second only to New Jersey.
Maryland’s land was worth $75,429 per acre on average, making the state the fifth most valuable in the country. Less than 3% of the state’s land was owned by the federal government. By contrast, nearly 24% of the contiguous U.S. was owned by the federal government. In fact, it is the smallest in the union. At just 673,000 acres Rhode Island’s total land value was just $90 billion, nearly the lowest in the country. However, the state was valued at $133,700 per acre on average, second only to New Jersey.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The average land per acre in Washington state is worth about $1,600. The amount will vary depending upon the exact location of the land.

The state-wide average price per acre for large parcels of agricultural land increased from $3,187 in 2009 to $3,254 in 2010. Low interest rates, strong grain prices and relatively strong farm equity positions have all helped to sustain farmland values. The same was not true for smaller bare land parcels (10-35 acres). The average small parcel price per acre was $3,194 (a decrease of $154). The number of transactions and the total acres exchanged in 2010 returned to levels not seen since 2005 for both large and small parcels.
