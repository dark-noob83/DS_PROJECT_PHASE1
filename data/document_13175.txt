Humoresque. The star of HUMORESQUE was composer Franx Waxman, not John Garfield’s driven concert violinist or Joan Crawford as his patroness-slash-lover. Waxman’s Oscar-nominated score took center stage, featuring everything from Tchaikovsky to Chopin, Rimsky-Korsakov to the Dvorak piece upon which the film’s title was based, plus a couple of Gershwin songs thrown in for good measure as source cues.
From: Wesley S. Date: 18 Oct 07 - 10:10 AM. I was just reading on another forum that Humoresque by Dvorak was written as a counterpoint for The Old Folks at Home also known as Way Down upon the Swannee River. I don't have an instrument handy but I can hear that they would mesh together. Also-Chet Atkins was once heard to play both pieces at the same time
