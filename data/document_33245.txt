Instead, you're focused on the price you pay overall, and if the dealer wants to include a doc fee in that price, then so be it. For instance, say you have a $30,000 budget and you're looking at a $28,000 car with a $500 doc fee. Add in a 7-percent sales tax, and this car costs $30,495. In this case, we might tell the dealer that we'd be willing to pay $30,000 out the door. After that, it won't matter whether the dealer charges the doc fee or not, since you're only dealing with the total price.
If you're going through the process of buying a car, you may have come across doc fees, or documentation fees. Dealers sometimes charge this fee in addition to a car's purchase price, and it can often add several hundred dollars on top of the figure that you and the dealer agreed on.
1 Massachusetts has no cap on doc fees, according to the Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association. 2  Michigan caps doc fees at $200 or 5 percent of the price of the car, whichever is less, according to Michigan's Department of State.
Doc fees range from $0 to nearly $1,000 depending on which dealer and state you purchase from. Some states such as California limit the maximum amount a dealer can charge for this fee, but most have no limits.
Documentation Fees: Dealerships charge car buyers a documentation fee, or doc fee, to cover the cost of preparing and filing the sales contract and other paperwork. In some states, the doc fee is limited by state law.
We've seen a dealership in greater New York charge a $75 doc fee while a New Jersey dealer wanted $349 — for similar examples of the same used SUV. That's because New York state has a $75 maximum for doc fees, according to the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association.
If you live in an area where the fees aren’t regulated, then the dealers will set the fee as high as the market will bear. If the majority of the dealers are charging $395 for their DOC Fees, it might be hard for a dealer to charge $795 in that same area.
