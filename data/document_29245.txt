A hydrogen bond is a weak type of chemical bond that is common in organisms. As the name suggests, this type of bond involves a hydrogen atom that is attracted to a strongly electronegative atom such as oxygen, fluorine, or nitrogen of a polar covalent bond in the same or another molecule.
Noun. 1. hydrogen bond-a chemical bond consisting of a hydrogen atom between two electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen) with one side be a covalent bond and the other being an ionic bond. bond, chemical bond-an electrical force linking atoms.
A hydrogen bond is the electromagnetic attraction between polar molecules in which hydrogen is bound to a larger atom, such as oxygen or nitrogen. This is not a sharing of electrons, as in a covalent bond. Instead, this is an attraction between the positive and negative poles of charged atoms.
hydrogen bond. n. 1. (Chemistry) a weak chemical bond between an electronegative atom, such as fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, and a hydrogen atom bound to another electronegative atom.
hydrogen bond. A chemical bond in which a hydrogen atom that is already bonded to an atom in a molecule forms a second bond with another atom, either in the same molecule or in a different one. The second atom is usually of a type that strongly attracts electrons, such as nitrogen or oxygen.
Hydrogen Bond Definition: A hydrogen bond is a type of attractive (dipole-dipole) interaction between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom bonded to another electronegative atom. This bond always involves a hydrogen atom. Hydrogen bonds can occur between molecules or within parts of a single molecule.
A hydrogen bond is the attractive force between the hydrogen attached to an electronegative atom of one molecule and an electronegative atom of a different molecule. Usually the electronegative atom is oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine, which has a partial negative charge.
