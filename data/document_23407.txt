Good sources of protein are seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans and peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Protein is also found in dairy products. Protein from plant sources tends to be lower in fat and cholesterol and provides fiber and other health-promoting nutrients. Foods from animal sources and certain foods like seeds, nuts, avocado, and coconut also contain fat. There are different categories of fats—some are healthier than others: 1  Monounsaturated. 2  These include canola oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and safflower oil.
There are two major sources of fats: animal and vegetable. Animal fat, found in a virtually pure state in lard, is very much present in pork products such as pates, pâtés, salamis, sausages hot, dogs and meat. Spreads lamb and mutton and certain, poultry such as goose and, duck have a plentiful. supply But remember that these fish are no fattier than ordinary steak, and the fat of cold-water fish is rich in omega- 3 fatty acids, a known safeguard against cardiovascular disease. Vegetable fats are, for the most part, represented by the long list of plant and nut oils and fruits such as avocado.
1 Fat adds flavor and taste to foods and gives you satiety value. 2  Fats are an important source of calories and nutrients especially for infants and toddlers. 3  Fats are known as triglycerides, both in food and in the body and they are the storage and transport form of fats. Examples of foods that contain these fats include salmon, trout, herring, avocados, olives, walnuts and liquid vegetable oils such as soybean, corn, safflower, canola, olive and sunflower.
Foods from animal sources that are rich in saturated fats include beef, beef fat, veal, lamb, pork, lard, poultry fat, butter, cream, milk, cheeses and other dairy products made from whole and 2 percent milk. All these foods also contain dietary cholesterol. Examples of foods that contain these fats include salmon, trout, herring, avocados, olives, walnuts and liquid vegetable oils such as soybean, corn, safflower, canola, olive and sunflower.
If you don’t eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods, you may not be getting all the micronutrients your body needs. In fact, Americans tend to eat foods that are high in calories and low in micronutrients. These foods often also contain added sugar, sodium (salt), saturated fat or trans fat. Fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, whole grains, lean meats and fish and low-fat milk products are excellent choices. The amount of nutrient-rich food each person needs depends on their daily calorie needs.
Back to Top Recommendations. 1  Choose lean, protein-rich foods such as soy, fish, skinless chicken, very lean meat, and fat-free or 1% dairy products. 2  Eat foods that are naturally low in fat such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. 3  Get plenty of soluble fiber such as oats, bran, dry peas, beans, cereal, and rice. Back to Top Function. Fat is one of the 3 nutrients (along with protein and carbohydrates) that supply calories to the body. Fat provides 9 calories per gram, more than twice the number provided by carbohydrates or protein. Fat is essential for the proper functioning of the body.
You can get these micronutrients through a variety of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, low-fat and fat-free dairy products, and lean meats and fish. Getting vitamins and minerals through food ensures that your body is able to absorb them properly. Fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, whole grains, lean meats and fish and low-fat milk products are excellent choices. The amount of nutrient-rich food each person needs depends on their daily calorie needs.
Beans and other non-meat sources. Nutrient-rich, non-meat sources of protein can also satisfy the protein recommendations. A quarter-cup of beans, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter or ½ ounce of nuts or seeds counts as an ounce toward your protein needs. Beef, Pork, Veal and Lamb. Choose low-fat, lean cuts of beef or pork. Fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, whole grains, lean meats and fish and low-fat milk products are excellent choices. The amount of nutrient-rich food each person needs depends on their daily calorie needs.
Salmon, flax seeds and walnuts are excellent sources of omega 3 fatty acids. Very good sources of these healthy fats include scallops, cauliflower, cabbage, cloves and mustard seeds. Good sources of these fats include halibut, shrimp, cod, tuna, soybeans, tofu, kale, collard greens, and Brussels sprouts.
