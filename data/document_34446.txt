2) Decomposition Reactions • This is a chemical change where a single compound (the reactant) breaks down into two or more simpler products. • This type of reaction is easily identifiable, because: •It is the exact opposite of synthesis; if you know one you know them both •There is always one reactant. If you see one reactant that’s a compound and several products, a decomposition reaction occurred. On the reactant side there is a single element and a compound, as there is on the product side. • No reaction will occur if the most reactive element is already in the compound • The image on the next slide should help to visualize. • Notice that the couple in white are a compound on the. reactant side.
In a synthesis reaction two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. Two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction. For example, simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas can produce a more complex substance-----water! The chemical equation for this synthesis reaction looks like: In the cartoon, the skinny bird (reactant) and the worm (reactant) combine to make. DECOMPOSITION REACTION. In a decomposition reaction a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. One reactant yields 2 or more products.
Share. A synthesis reaction or direct combination reaction is one of the most common types of chemical reactions. In a synthesis reaction two or more chemical species combine to form a more complex product. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. A + B → AB. The combination of iron and sulfur to form iron (II) sulfide is an example of a synthesis reaction :
Synthesis Reaction. The word 'synthesis' means to put together. In a synthesis reaction two substances combine to produce a single product. The general chemical equation for a synthesis reaction is A + B AB. The reaction of a metal with a non-metal to produce a compound is an example of a synthesis reaction.
The noun DECOMPOSITION REACTION has 1 sense: 1. (chemistry) separation of a substance into two or more substances that may differ from each other and from the original substance. Familiarity information: DECOMPOSITION REACTION used as a noun is very rare. Dictionary entry details. 
Identify a Synthesis Reaction. The first type of reaction we are going to talk about is the synthesis reaction. 'Synthesis' means 'to put together,' and that is what this reaction does-it takes two or more reactants and puts them together to form a single compound. A synthesis reaction is a reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a new compound. When two elements combine in a synthesis reaction, the only product that can be made is a binary compound. A binary compound is a compound composed of only two elements: A + B = AB, or C + O2 = CO2
Rather a synthesis is a result of an integration of what you heard/read and your ability to use this learning to develop and support a key thesis or argument. Learning to write a synthesis paper is a critical skill, crucial to organizing and presenting information is academic and non-academic settings. 
3) Single-Replacement Reactions • A chemical change where one element replaces a second element in a compound. • It is identifiable by its symmetry. On the reactant side there is a single element and a compound, as there is on the product side. • No reaction will occur if the most reactive element is already in the compound • The image on the next slide should help to visualize. • Notice that the couple in white are a compound on the. reactant side.
To visualize a synthesis reaction look at the following cartoon: In the cartoon, the skinny bird (reactant) and the worm (reactant) combine to make. DECOMPOSITION REACTION. In a decomposition reaction a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. One reactant yields 2 or more products.
5) Combustion Reaction • A chemical change where an element or a compound reacts with oxygen • This will often yield energy in the form of heat and light • Oxygen is ALWAYS going to be on the reactant side •This is the main indicator that a combustion reaction has occurred. On the reactant side there is a single element and a compound, as there is on the product side. • No reaction will occur if the most reactive element is already in the compound • The image on the next slide should help to visualize. • Notice that the couple in white are a compound on the. reactant side.
