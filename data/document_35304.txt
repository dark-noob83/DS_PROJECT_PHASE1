Qatar’s expat residents consume a per capita average of 150 liters, or nearly 634 cups of water per day. But nationals consume eight times that amount, or about 5,100 cups of water per day, said Mari Luomi, a post-doctoral fellow of Middle Eastern studies at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar.
Water and electricity is provided by Qatar’s Water and Electricity Department. Qatar has 3 pin sockets with a 240 voltage. It is not uncommon to find water tanks supplementing water to buildings as the mains water is not pumped continuously and has low pressure.
Consumption per captia, according to latest statistics, is 464 liter. In regard to Qatari consumption: those above 100 cubic meters represent 39% and 61% of Qataris are beyond 100 cubic meters. The average fold in regard to expatriates is less than 3 times not 8 times as mentioned in the report.
