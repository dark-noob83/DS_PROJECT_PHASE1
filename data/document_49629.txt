Metallurgical Engineering is the science and technology of processing materials to extract, refine and recycle metals. These processes include the development and use of metals and alloys that have specific physical properties. Metallurgical Engineering has three distinct branches:
The required and elective courses you would take for Metallurgical & Materials Science majors vary considerably among institutions. Courses are listed here that are illustrative of the breadth of topics you are likely to experience were you to major in this field. 1  Advanced Fluid-Solid Reaction Engineering.
Metallurgy is a field of materials science, and it doesn’t take much guesswork to figure out which material in particular it focuses on. That’s right: metals. Read on for more information about studying metallurgy at undergraduate level.
Overview. The undergraduate program in Metallurgical Engineering trains students in three areas: mineral processing, extractive and physical metallurgy. The curriculum reflects these three areas to produce an engineer ready to work in industry, research, management and/or graduate school.
