Roasted Pork Shoulder. Roast your pork shoulder in the oven at 350 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes per pound for a nice slicing roast. At this temperature, a 6-pound pork shoulder will require 3 to 3 1/2 hours to roast. Check for doneness by placing a meat thermometer into the roast at the thickest point. Be careful not to touch the bone.
Pork shoulder normally cooks around 1.5-2 hours per pound of meat and my shoulders normally cook for 15-19 hours then rest in a cooler for 2 hours before serving. Pork shoulder yields delicious pulled pork sandwiches and the left overs are perfect for bbq pizza, tacos, and can be frozen for later use.
Pork shoulder is best when it's cooked long and slow. Roast uncovered in the oven for about 1 hour per pound of meat. You may reduce the heat as needed if the pork appears to be cooking too quickly-many recipes call for 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius) rather than 350 (177 C).

In the smoker, a 6-pound pork shoulder roast will require between 6 and 9 hours, depending on how tender you want your meat. Keep the smoker temperature between 225 and 250 degrees F. The shoulder is done in approximately 6 hours, when the temperature reaches 170 degrees.
Cook at a low heat for 8 to 10 hours. Place the cover on the crock pot and begin the lengthy slow cooking process. Slow cooking allows plenty of leeway in terms of cooking time, but, generally, you'll want to cook for roughly 2 hours per pound of meat. Check several times during cooking, adding more liquid if needed.
