There are three major species of pathogenic Staphylococci; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. While S. aureus is the main cause of infection among the Staphylococci, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis are the source of several infections of clinical importance.
The inadvertent use of a mixed culture in biochemical testing will lead to erroneous results. The simplest biochemical test that is used to differentiate between Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species is the Catalase test. In this test we are testing for the ability of the bacteria to produce the enzyme catalase. This enzyme breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
1 Laboratory Exercise # 11: Differentiation of the Species Staphylococcus and Streptococcus Purpose: The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to explore the differences between Staphylococcal species and Streptococcal species.
A. Staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-positive staphylococci). Staphylococcus aureus is the most pathogenic species and is implicated in a variety of infections. S. aureus is with some frequency found as normal human flora in the anterior nares (nostrils). It can also be found in the throat, axillae, and the inguinal and perineal areas.
Staphylococcal infections are a group of infections caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus. You may have heard them referred to as staph infections. Staph bacteria can cause a wide range of infections, from relatively minor skin infections such as boils, to more serious infections of the blood, lungs and heart.
The main criterion for differentiation between Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera is the catalase test. Staphylococci are catalase positive whereas Streptococci are Catalase negative. Catalase is an enzyme used by bacteria to induce the reaction of reduction of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
