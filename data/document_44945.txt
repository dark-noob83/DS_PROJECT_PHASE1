In order to keep food out of the Danger Zone, your fridge must be set between 32-40° F (0-4 degrees Celsius). Your freezer must be below 32° F (0° Celsius). I keep mine as cold as it will go. Keep your freezer efficient by half-filling it with bottles of water.
Normally a domestic freezer is best set to −18 °C (0 °F) or colder, as that's what the expiration dates for many food items are based on. It's also a requirement for freezers in restaurants, supermarkets & other places that sell food (at least here in Europe) to maintain a temperature of at most -18 °C.
The numbers in your fridge are usually measured in degrees celcius (C), and it is recommended that you set your fridge to a temperature between 2 and 5 celcius. Since food lasts much longer at lower temperatures, setting to 3.5 or just under is a good idea.
Typically you cannot set the temperature on the freezer section of a fridge freezer. Mark 6 is actually the coldest and on a new fridge freezer can often cause food to freeze solid particularly at the back! Correct setting varies according to model and things like wear and surrounding temperature/season.
One of the most basic ways to ensure food safety in your kitchen is to set your refrigerator and freezer to safe temperatures for food storage. According to the Food and Drug Administration, your fridge should be set at or below 40 F (4 C). Your freezer should be set at 0 F (-18 C). Food stored in the freezer at 0 F will remain safe indefinitely, although the quality will decrease the longer the food is in the freezer.
