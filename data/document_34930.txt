Baby bumble bees are found in the bumble bee colony. Like honey bees, bumble bees live in a colony where the adults care for the young (larvae) produced by a single queen. Bumble bee nests are small compared to honey bees, as each nest contains only a few hundred individuals. Also unlike honey bees, a bumble bee nest is annual and is used only one year and then abandoned. Bumble bees may re-appear in the same area from one year to the next but they do not reuse an old nest.
Bumblebee nests vary in size depending on the species and time of year. A well-established nest may contain up to 400 bees. Honeybee hives typically contain 50,000 bees so bumblebee nests are very small in comparison.
So if the nest is under the house or shed it is best just to leave it. Bumblebees do not damage brickwork or wood. Some of the bumblebees which make smaller nests, Bombus pratorum and B. hortorum do sometimes chose strange places to nest. Their nests are small and in the case of B. pratorum are usually very short lived. So again, I would say leave the nest alone.
Or you could make a nest box, almost any weatherproof container will do as long as you make a hole big enough for the bees to get in and out. If you can get hold of the book by Sladen, Alford or Prys-Jones, they have many designs for artificial nests, or have a look at nest box plans.
FAQs. Many people automatically assume that all bees live in hives. However, bee nests vary greatly, and as far as hives are concerned, they are of course a man made contraption designed specifically for keeping honey bees, and to enable access to the combs and honey for beekeepers.
