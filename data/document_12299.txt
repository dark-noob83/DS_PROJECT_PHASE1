Brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a validated physiological measure of endothelial dysfunction. %FMD has been associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and has been shown to predict cardiovascular events in some but not all studies. Abstract. Backgroundâ€” The relationship between impaired brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and subsequent clinical cardiovascular events is not well established, especially in older adults whose FMD is often diminished.
The present review attempts to explain the controversies concerning the mechanism of shear stress-mediated arterial dilatation, commonly called flow-mediated arterial dilatation (FMD). Flow-mediated dilatation occurs in an artery when the blood flow to the organ supplied by the artery is increased. The first hypothesis is excluded because a vasodilated peripheral vascular bed does not cause dilation of the upstream conduit artery if an increase in flow within the conduit artery is prevented and because FMD is completely blocked by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS).

An increase in organ metabolic rate results in an increase in blood flow. The increased blood flow is accommodated by dilatation of the artery supplying the muscle and causes an increased shear stress between the flowing blood and the adjacent layer of the arterial wall, which is the glycocalyx.
Endothelial dysfunction is now considered an important early event in the development of atherosclerosis, which precedes gross morphological signs and clinical symptoms. The assessment of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was introduced almost 20 years ago as a noninvasive approach to examine vasodilator function in vivo. FMD is widely believed to reflect endothelium-dependent and largely nitric oxide-mediated arterial function and has been used as a surrogate marker of vascular health. Schematic representation of steps involved in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) generation from the initiation of the shear-stress stimulus (step 1) to the resultant vessel diameter change (step 6). Blood flow-associated shear stress is sensed by deformation of mechanosensitive structures at the cell membrane.

1 To measure flow-mediated dilatation, arterial blood flow (usually to a limb) is temporarily stopped and then restarted, causing blood flow to overshoot (reactive hyperaemia) as the vessels dilate. 2  The resultant increase in blood vessel diameter can be measured using an ultrasound probe. Large-vessel function was measured using flow-mediated dilatation (see below), and small-vessel (microvascular) function was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry of the forearm skin after cuff occlusion of blood flow to the arm.
Our system was tested both on synthetic ultrasound images and in in-vivo FMD examinations so that its performances could be compared with those of the other methods. 1. Introduction Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a parameter which is used to assess endothelial dysfunction in humans. This evaluation is thought to be particularly important in subjects at risk of arteriosclerosis or other cardiovascular diseases. 
Most of these studies on human participants have involved the percentage flow-mediated dilation (FMD%) index as the study outcome, which must have proper statistical consideration to be interpreted correctly. In vascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction is a systemic pathological state of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and can be broadly defined as an imbalance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances produced by (or acting on) the endothelium.
A noninvasive method to measure endothelial dysfunction is % Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) as measured by Brachial Artery Ultrasound Imaging (BAUI). Current measurements of endothelial function via FMD vary due to technical and physiological factors. In vascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction is a systemic pathological state of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and can be broadly defined as an imbalance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances produced by (or acting on) the endothelium.
