the transmission of a nerve impulse along a neuron from one end to the other occurs as a result of chemical changes across the membrane of the neuron. The membrane of an unsti â€¦ mulated neuron is polarized that is there is a difference in electrical. 4 people found this useful.
Neurons. Neurons carry impulses from one place to another, around the many parts of the nervous system. They connect receptors to the central nervous system and also connect one part of the nervous system to another, for example in the brain and spinal cord.
Transmition of impulse through synapse is through the release of neurotransmitter. when trigger neurotransmitter will be released to the synaptic cleft and diffuse to postsynaptic neuron. at the membrane of post synatic neurone there are receptor that specific to the
Transmission of a nerve impulse: Resting potential and action potential. Like the gaps between the Schwann cells on an insulated axon, a gap called a synapse or synaptic cleft separates the axon of one neuron and the dendrites of the next neuron.
synapse. the junction between the processes of two neurons or between a neuron and an effector organ, where neural impulses are transmitted by chemical means. The impulse causes the release of a neurotransmitter (e.g. acetylcholine or norepinephrine) from the presynaptic membrane of the axon terminal.
Synapses. The point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another is called a synapse. The transmission is chemical in nature; that is, there is no direct contact between the axon of one neuron and the dendrites of another.
Signals are transmitted from one neuron to another by using special chemicals, called neurotransmitters. The speed of these signals depends on how fast the exchange of charged ions is inside and outside of the cell membrane. The main ions involved are sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium.
