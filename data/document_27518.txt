NICOTINE TARTRATE is a salt of an alkaloid produced from tobacco. This material is combustible, highly toxic. When heated to decomposition it emits very toxic fumes of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. 
The most common applications of glycerin are in cosmetic products as well as in various products like lotions and soaps. This product serves as a humectant since it can be used to keep the water moisture at an ideal level. Nicotine. This is a drug that is naturally present in tobacco leaves. This is normally used as a solvent. It is an ingredient that is normally found in various edible products as well as in cosmetic goods. In electronic cigarettes, it is one of the major ingredients. This ingredient is used in air sanitation as well as the disinfection of solid surfaces.
Answers. Best Answer: The short answer is yes. Nicotine is a liquid and its vapors will combust when the temperature reaches 95F or 35C despite having a low vapor pressure. (Because of this, most of the nicotine is burned when a cigarette is smoked; however, enough is inhaled to provide the desired effects. The amount of nicotine inhaled with tobacco smoke is a fraction of the amount contained in the tobacco leaves.)
This is a flammable liquid, colorless and volatile. It is produced by the fermentation of yeast as well as carbohydrates. This is normally used as a solvent.

Nicotine will oxidize in the presence of air and light and turn dark, but this doesn’t impact on its properties, according to nicotine expert Dr. Jacques Le Houezec. However, pure nicotine evaporates in significant quantities at 68 °F (20 °C) , and e-liquid is flammable, so it’s best to avoid sources of heat or fire. In e-liquid, there are also numerous different flavorings which could be degraded by excessive heat or sunlight, so it’s best to protect it from the elements. If you bear in mind that nicotine is toxic and can be absorbed through the skin, you won’t have any problems when you’re filling a cartomizer, tank or clearomizer. Technically speaking, gloves would make the process of filling up much safer, but if you’re careful it’s easy to stay safe even without them.
The tar and nicotine measurements mean very little. Regarding nicotine, in its pure form, with none of the chemicals and alkaloids found in tobacco, it is about as dangerous and addictive as coffee. It is the tar, plus many chemicals in all smoke that is harmful. It is the tar and smoke that is dangerous and over 30 years of snus use in Sweden has proved that people who use smokeless tobacco that has been treated to remove the dangerous chemicals do not die of smoking. People smoke for the nicotine but are killed by the tar, and there is no safe level for that.
