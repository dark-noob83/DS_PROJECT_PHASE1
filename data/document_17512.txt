FADH2 and NADH Defined. Flavin adenine dinucleotide, or FADH2, is a redox cofactor that is created during the Krebs cycle and utilized during the last part of respiration (the electron transport chain). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NADH, is a similar compound and used more actively in the electron transport chain as well. In fact, more NADH is produced and used than FADH2 in the process of creating energy. There are actually 6 NADH produced and only 2 FADH2 molecules. FADH2 and NADH are created from FAD and NAD+ through redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions in the Krebs cycle during respiration as seen below here: This cycle gives off small amounts of energy in the form of ATP (adenonsine triphosphate, cell energy) and produces these compounds, FADH2 and NADH.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a coenzyme found in all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms, an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD+ and NADH respectively. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, like all dinucleotide s, consists of two nucleotides joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups. The nucleotides consist of ribose rings, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position.
In metabolism, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD + is an oxidizing agent â€“ it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD.

Basically, the NADH and FADH2 molecules are affixed with electrons and are transferred to the inner membrane of the mitochondria. They travel down the electron transport chain, releasing the electrons that they once had. FADH2 and NADH are created from FAD and NAD+ through redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions in the Krebs cycle during respiration as seen below here: This cycle gives off small amounts of energy in the form of ATP (adenonsine triphosphate, cell energy) and produces these compounds, FADH2 and NADH.
NADH in biology is a reduced form of NAD meaning it is when NAD accepts electrons with a proton of H+ converting it into NADH. The coenzyme is therefore found in two forms in cells: NAD+ is an oxidizing agent-it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced, this reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD+.

NADH, short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is an important pyridine nucleotide that functions as an oxidative cofactor in eukaryotic cells. NADH plays a key role in the production of energy through redox reactions. The NAD coenzyme acts as a hydrogen acceptor in oxidation-reduction reactions. The electron transport chain in cellular respiration is responsible for energy production and is an excellent illustration of NAD's involvement in
