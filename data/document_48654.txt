ICBC’s soft tissue injury settlement guidelines apply particularly to whiplash injuries and a cap on damages for these injuries ranges from $6,500 – $15,000, depending on the severity and duration of the injury. British Columbia Courts are not bound by ICBC’s soft tissue injury settlement guidelines. The Supreme Court of Canada set a limit for non-pecuniary damages at $100,000 in 1978. This figure is adjusted for inflation and has a current value of approximately $300,000.
In an ICBC personal injury claim you can pay your lawyer on an hourly rate or on a contingency fee basis. Contingency fees are percentage fees of the settlement amount. If you do not recover any damages your lawyer is free. Typically, contingency fees are 25%. Q. Does ICBC have to pay me additional money if I retain a lawyer? Yes. If you retain a lawyer you are entitled to taxable costs and disbursements to offset a portion of your legal fees. These do not completely cover your lawyer’s costs but are designed to reimburse you for 30% to 50% of your actual legal bill.
ICBC’s 2008 annual report indicates that in 2008, ICBC paid out about 2.6 billion dollars ($2,646,191,000) to claimants or third parties on behalf of claimants. I expect these third parties to be lawyers, body shops, medical practitioners and the like. Very often the interest is over 55% per year. If you borrow one thousand dollars and your case settles two years later for $4,000, you will have to pay the lender the $1,000 lent, plus at least an additional $2,400 as there is interest on the interest. As such if you get $4,000 in settlement, after paying the loan, you could end up with less than $1,600
Each ICBC claim is unique. The value of any ICBC claim will depend on a number of factors including who is at fault, the type of injuries and the effect of the injuries on everyday life and employment. The Supreme Court of Canada set a limit for non-pecuniary damages at $100,000 in 1978. This figure is adjusted for inflation and has a current value of approximately $300,000.
ICBC’s internal soft tissue injury settlement guidelines are to value Whiplash Associated Disorder injuries as follows: 1  Mild Injuries : $0 – $6,500 for non-pecuniary damages. 2  Mild/Moderate Injuries: A maximum of $10,000 for non-pecuniary damages. 3  Moderate Injuries: A maximum of $15,000 for non-pecuniary damages. The Supreme Court of Canada set a limit for non-pecuniary damages at $100,000 in 1978. This figure is adjusted for inflation and has a current value of approximately $300,000.
In addition, a good rule of thumb is to call the police if you think the damage to your vehicle looks like it may be more than $1,000 (or $600 for a motorcycle and $100 for a bicycle). If the police don't come to the accident scene, your Dial-a-Claim adjuster will let you know if you have to get a police report. 
So long as you have the required insurance, ICBC will pay for any damage you have caused to someone else’s vehicle in an accident. Whether ICBC will pay for your own damages depends on who caused the accident and whether you have collision insurance. If you were not at fault, ICBC may pay the entire bill. If you caused the accident, but you have collision insurance with ICBC, you’ll have to pay the deductible, and ICBC will pay the rest. However, if you don’t have collision insurance and you caused the accident, you will have to pay for your own vehicle damage.
You agree with ICBC to an excessive reduction of your past wage loss claim from gross to net. ICBC will often claim a deduction of 30% to arrive at net; however, this deduction is usually much less. Agree to only a small deduction for income tax and EI premiums.
