Your remote starter will allow you to turn the car and some accessories on without being in the vehicle, but you cannot actually put the car in gear and drive until you put the key into the ignition and turn it to the on position.

This is a basic rundown of a remote start/keyless entry install in a 2000 Honda Accord. The remote starter that is being installed is an Avital 4103 and the bypass module is the DEI XK05.

A: The Honda Remote Engine Starter System comes with a wiring harness specially designed for select Honda models that integrates your Immobilizer and Security System with the Remote Starter System. Aftermarket systems need to deactivate the Immobilizer and Security System, which leaves your vehicle unprotected. If you attempted to start your engine outside of the 200-foot range, the vehicle may have received the request and started the vehicle (one-way signal), but the reply back to the transmitter wasnâ€™t completed because you were outside of the 200-foot range (two-way signal).
Instructions. Start the Accord, ensuring that all lights and accessories are in proper working order before you begin the installation. Everything must be in proper working order to complete a successful installation. Thoroughly read the instructions that came with your remote starter kit before you begin. Your remote starter will allow you to turn the car and some accessories on without being in the vehicle, but you cannot actually put the car in gear and drive until you put the key into the ignition and turn it to the on position.
