Narita Airport. Photo by Shizuko Mishima. If you are planning to visit Japan in December or January, try to avoid traveling during the last week of December to the first week in January. It's one of the busiest travel seasons in Japan when many people are off work for holidays.
While in Osaka/Kyoto i would take a day trip to Hiroshima & Miyajima Island and a day trip to Nara as well. Or, i would also do a 4 nights stay in Osaka/Kyoto, 2 nights stay in Fuji and 1 week in Tokyo. It really depends on whats your preference. :) While in Tokyo, i would take a day trip to Yokohama too.
