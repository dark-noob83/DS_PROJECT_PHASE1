The life expectancy of a toilet is more than 100 years. In fact, a study conducted by the National Association of Home Builders determined that toilets can last indefinitely. The components inside the toilet tank, however, do need to be periodically replaced and have a much shorter life expectancy of about five years. Many toilets meet their demise long before the age of 100, however, and proper care is required to maximize the longevity of yours.
