The time per pound is strictly a guide and cooking times wil actually vary. If you are cooking the brisket at a temperature between 225 and 250 degrees, pull it off the pit and put it in a cooler for 2 hours when the internal temp is 185.

Q: Sir, Do you have a best guess on how long a 8-10 lbs brisket at 200-225 will take to get done. I was thinking about 1 hour per pound. Is this close. thank you! A: You can usually figure about 1.5 hours per pound at 225 degrees for brisket, pork shoulder and other larger pieces of meat. Several things can affect this time such as wind, temperature and how often you open the door of the smoker.
You will need to repeat this step every 1.5 hours just before it is time to mop the meat and flip. Brisket time is figured at about 1.5 hours per pound so assuming you have a 10 pound brisket, you will be looking at a 15 hour time in the smoker.
