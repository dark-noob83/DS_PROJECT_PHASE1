1 transcription of the information encoded in DNA into a molecule of RNA (described here) and. 2  translation of the information encoded in the nucleotides of mRNA into a defined sequence of amino acids in a protein (discussed in. 3  Gene Translation: RNA → Protein).
Transcription: the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase, and the processing of the resulting mRNA molecule. Translation: the use of mRNA to direct protein synthesis, and the subsequent post-translational processing of the protein molecule.
Steps of DNA Transcription. Transcription is the biochemical process of transferring the information in a DNA sequence to an RNA molecule. The RNA molecule can be the final product, or in the case of messenger RNA (mRNA), it can be used in the process of translation to produce proteins.
Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied (transcribed) to mRNA, which carries the information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes.
Report Abuse. DNA is involved in replication (of cell). RNA is involved of transcription and translation. DNA is also involved in transcription (it is the pamphlet from which RNA is transcribed). Amino Acids are involved in protein synthesis.
Transcription is the synthesis of an mRNA molecule using a DNA molecule for a template. That mRNA molecule then goes on to complete translation in the ribosome. Translation is … the process in which proteins are produced based on instructions carried by mRNA.
Initiation. Just before initiation, RNA polymerase and accessory proteins bind to a DNA molecule upstream of the initiation point. The DNA is unwound to separate and expose the strand to be transcribed. Then, the RNA polymerase complex binds to a promoter sequence, which establishes initiation of transcription.
