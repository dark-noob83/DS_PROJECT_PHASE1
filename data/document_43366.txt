By Bonnie L. Grant. Florence fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is the bulb type of fennel that is eaten as a vegetable. All parts of the plant are fragrant and can be used in culinary applications. Florence fennel cultivation began with the Greeks and Romans and filtered through the ages to Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
The flower can be used as a garnish. Every part of the fennel plant is edible. Fennel seeds are widely available in markets all over the world, and grace many vegetable stands. Its flavor is close to anise, which provides the main flavoring for liquorice. They can be used to make seed cakes, and are a common ingredient in sausages.
Fennel yields both a herb and a spice. All plant parts are edible: roots, stalks and leaves, with the spice coming from the dried seeds. A native to the Mediterranean, it is an ancient and common plant known to the ancient Greeks and spread throughout Europe by Imperial Rome.
Raw or cooked, every part of fennel is edible. Fennel belongs to the large botanical family Umbelliferae, of which other members include celery, parsley, dill, anise, carrots and parsnips.
Fennel is composed of a white or pale green bulb from which closely superimposed stalks are arranged. The stalks are topped with feathery green leaves near which flowers grow and produce fennel seeds. The bulb, stalk, leaves and seeds are all edible.
