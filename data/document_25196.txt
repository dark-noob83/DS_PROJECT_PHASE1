senior fellow at the Fraser Institute and professor of economics at Nippissing University. Prevailing estimates on how much it costs to raise a child in Canada and the United States are currently between $10,000 and $15,000 per year, the report says. 
The calculations work out similarly in Canada, where the total cost of raising a child to 18, including lost income, forgone investment savings and the price of a college education, comes out to around $670,000. For those dreaming of two children, that’s likely to cost well over $1 million. Statistics Canada estimates that couples with children account for 30 per cent of households, but more than half of all of Canada’s household debt. Two-parent families with children under the age of 24 averaged $157,000 in debt, or $33,000 more than couples without children.
Raising children in Canada is an expensive proposition. The average cost of raising a child in Canada to age 18 in a typical two-child family is $243,660. This amounts to an average cost of $1,070 per month per child. This cost varies by the number of children in a family.

By the time your child is toddling about the kitchen cooing for juice, the average yearly food cost is $1,140. By school age, you’re paying $1,465 annually and a pre-teen is setting you back $1,835 per year. But that all pales in comparison to the $2,400 cost per year of feeding a ravenous teen. But when we added up all of the expenses we arrived at $243,660 as the total cost of raising a typical child to age 18 (in other words, until the day before his or her 19th birthday). That’s $12,825 per child per year or $1,070 per month.
The Vanier Institute of the Family says that, on average, it costs the typical Canadian family $1,000 to $1,200 a month to put a two-year-old in full-time daycare, or the equivalent to paying the principal on a $360,000 house over the life of a typical 25-year mortgage.
