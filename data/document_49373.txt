1 The hardest way to build the pile of snow is to shovel it and then dig out the interior of it later. 2  The easiest way is by putting packs, gear and/or brush into a pile the size of the desired interior and then throw a tarp or poncho over it all. 3  Next, pile the snow on top of your covered gear. First, you have to select an area in the snow about 6 to 8 feet in diameter with no trees or big rocks in the way. (This is our selected area for the shelter). Then, you have two options for building the pile of snow: 1 
Among the highest potential scorers among the new additions is 'quinzhee,' a shelter made by hollowing out a pile of snow. Played on the board's top row, ending at the top right through an existing ‘u’, and a player can score 401 points, including the 50-point ‘bingo’ bonus for using all seven tiles. For really competitive Scrabblers there is also quinzhee, a shelter made by hollowing out a pile of snow, for which you can rack up 401 points if you play your tiles right.
How to build a quinzee. Similar to that of an igloo, a quinzee is a shelter made out of snow. Quinzee construction is valuable to those who spend time in the backcountry during winter months. Reprinted as seen in the January + February 2010 issue of Washington Trails Magazine, written by Diane Bedell.
Quinzhee. A quinzhee or quinzee is a shelter made by hollowing out a pile of settled snow. This is in contrast to an igloo, which is made from blocks of hard snow. The word is of Athabaskan origin.

A quinzhee hut is a type of temporary snow shelter, as distinct from more permanent ice-block igloos, that was historically used in survival situations by Native Americans, Scandinavians, and others living in cold northern latitudes. Traditionally, the builder would create a mound of snow 4 or 5 feet high, allow it a few hours to settle and conglomerate, then hollow it out to create a small cavern or snow hut for shelter from the elements.
A quinzhee or quinzee /ˈkwɪnziː/ is a shelter made by hollowing out a pile of settled snow. This is in contrast to an igloo, which is made from blocks of hard snow. The word is of Athabaskan origin, and entered the English language by 1984. Quinzhee are typically built on a flat area where snow is in abundance. Builders break up any snowdrifts or naturally formed piles to reduce the risk of collapse due to different amounts of sintering that can occur. Snow is typically piled 6 to 10 feet high in a circle 8 feet in diameter.
A quinzhee is made by making a pile of snow, then hollowing out the inside. The snow for a quinzhee need not be of the same quality as required for an igloo. Quinzhees are not usually meant as a form of permanent shelter, while igloos can be used for seasonal and year round habitation. Quinzhee are typically built on a flat area where snow is in abundance. Builders break up any snowdrifts or naturally formed piles to reduce the risk of collapse due to different amounts of sintering that can occur.

What sounds easier, cutting snow and ice into blocks to be assembled into shelter, or just shoveling snow into a big pile? Thats the difference between an Igloo and a Quinzhee. This survival shelter also makes a great fort for your kids and a fun afternoon for the family! Join Jeff Smith and his friends Chris and Dan Mills as they walk you through the stages of building a Quinzhee.
