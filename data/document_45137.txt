Fees for non-itemized returns are also low â€“ the average cost to prepare a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions is only $152. Fee information was collected in a survey of tax preparers conducted by NSA.
See the infographic of the survey highlights below. The average cost to prepare a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions was $159 this year, also a 4.6 percent increase over the average fee last year, which was $152.
For example, tax preparation firms with gross annual income of $50,000 or less charge an average of $174 for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return, while a company with gross income of $400,000 or more charges an average of $305.
I just ran across a bit of interesting information on the cost of tax preparation from the National Society of Accountants. According to their biennial survey, the average tax prep fee for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A plus a state tax return is $229. For a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions, the average price drops to $129.
The survey found that tax preparation fees for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return averaged $217 at one-person firms and jumped slightly to $245 for firms with three or more staff. Firms with lower levels of gross income also charge less on average than larger companies.
According to the survey, the average cost to prepare an itemized Form 1040 with a Schedule A (for itemized deductions) and a state tax return is $246. The average rate for a return without itemized deductions is lower: $143.
The average cost of a professional income tax preparer to handle a typical 2014 tax return (the one filed by April 15, 2015) was $273 this year. This includes an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return, according to the National Society of Accountants (NSA).
