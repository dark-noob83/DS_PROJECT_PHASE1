Long-Term Potentiation is the ability of brain cells to retain how frequently they send signals to other brain cells.
Main article: Postactivation potentials. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent increase in synaptic strength following high-frequency stimulation of a chemical synapse. Studies of LTP are often carried out in slices of the hippocampus, an important organ for learning and memory.
That is, long-term memories are thought to be biologically based on LTP because humans cannot retain memories for the long term (the cells could not communicate with each other) unless connections between nerve cells are sufficiently strong for an extended period of time.
In neuroscience, long-term potentiation (LTP) is a long-lasting enhancement in signal transmission between two neurons that results from stimulating them synchronously. It is one of several phenomena underlying synaptic plasticity, the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength.
When the long term potentiation is induced, the first synapse of the LTP will never spread in some synapses. This is only disseminated only to the synapses that are stated from the rules of cooperativity and associativity. But, the specificity input of LTP might get incomplete in short distances.
Long Term Potentiation Definition Psychology. Long term potentiation definition psychology (LTP) is a long lasting strengthening response of the postsynaptic nerve cell when the stimulation athwart the synapse which occurs in repeated stimulation. It involves the long term and learning memory.
