FSX: Steam Edition is installed in a different way to the boxed version and occupies a different location so it is possible that some add-ons may not work, but rest assured that we have made every effort to ensure that as many of them as possible work.
That's right, the steam installer will make that key so that regular FSX addons can find the new steam edition. If it finds that key the installer will elevate to the-SE install. No luck, unfortunately. I removed that key from the registry, restarted my PC and redownloaded FSX Steam.
A: Please see the full selection of add-ons for Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition on our website-please note that add-ons listed as FSX:SE compatible have been updated/confirmed to work in the Steam Edition of Flight Simulator X. This list is regularly being added to as more add-ons become compatible with FSX:SE.
Where add-ons do not immediately function with FSX: Steam Edition we will try to work with the community, developer or publisher of the add-on to find the solutions as needed.
If you installed FSX:SE and you have FSX discs, then you can uninstall Steam and FSX:SE, then install FSX from your discs. If you have FSX:SE the folder structure is the same as the disc version, once you find the root FSX folder.
If you installed Steam to the default location, FSX will be in C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\FSX Note that you can run both FSX disc and FSX:SE on your computer except that you would need to install the disc version first.
Please try again later. Here's a quick tutorial on how to install addons with FSX Steam. Note that you can also install your addons manually using the same way as you did in the past following the same sequence shown here. So far addons that I've added on have worked without issue so far.
