Outpatient cataract surgery is typically covered under Medicare Part B benefits, while inpatient surgery is usually covered under Medicare Part A. You may have greater coverage and lower out-of-pocket costs if you have a Medicare Advantage or Medigap plan. See Medicare Plans. The actual cause of cataracts is unknown.
In most cases, Medicare pays 80 percent of the approved cost of cataract surgery and you are responsible for the remaining 20 percent (the Medicare copayment), after meeting your annual deductible payment.
Average Cost of Cataract Surgery. The average cost of Cataract surgery in a Medicare outpatient setting is generally around $2,500.00/eye for the surgeon, the out patient facility, and the anesthesia provider. Medicare would pay 80% or $2,000.00/eye and you would pay the remaining $500.00 out of pocket.

Re: Does medicare help pay for cataracts. William, Yes, Medicare will cover cataract surgery. 1  If you have Original Medicare and the procedure is done on an outpatient basis, the Medicare Part B deductible applies and then Part B will cover 80% of the costs and you will be responsible for 20%. 2  A Medicare supplement (Medigap policy) can help cover these costs.
With any insurance.. medicare or other,.. your cost for a standard cataract surgery will be 500-550 per eye.. unless you choose.. crystalens.. then you can expect to pay.. 1200+..and the best thing to do is ask your Dr. (surgeon) for sample eye drops.. all of them will give you samples.. why pay..
