4,5 Nevertheless, all movements of the ankle during normal gait – dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, supination, and pronation – occur at multiple levels and involve several hindfoot and midfoot joints. 6 For example, movement of the hindfoot results from a combination of movements about the tibiotalar and subtalar joints. 7-11 The motions of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion are the major contributors to overall ankle motion are of particular import during clinical evaluation. The average plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle has been measured at 40°-56° and 13°-33°, respectively. 4,5,10,12-15.
16-18 Nigg et al measured ankle ROM in subjects between the ages of 20 and 80 years. 18 The authors demonstrated that in younger persons, the ROM is usually greater in women than in men. However, among older persons, female subjects had 8° less dorsiflexion and 8° more plantar flexion than males. 7-11 The motions of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion are the major contributors to overall ankle motion are of particular import during clinical evaluation. The average plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle has been measured at 40°-56° and 13°-33°, respectively. 4,5,10,12-15.
Standard Range of Motion. The standard range of motion for dorsi-flexion is between 15 and 30 degrees. For plantar flexion, the typical range of motion is between 20 and 50 degrees. These ranges vary according to age, gender and type of injury. Range of motion of the ankle, or any joint, is the measurable amount of movement in the joint. Ankle injuries and other types of injury of the lower leg can diminish range of motion. For those recovering from an injury, range of motion exercises increase the amount of movement in your ankle
Normal motion for passive dorsiflexion is 10° to 15°, while normal passive plantar flexion is 50 to 70°. Normal passive inversion is approximately 40° and eversion is around 10°. Any pain during passive movement may indicate musculotendinous or ligamentous. Finally, along the anterior aspect of the ankle, the body and tendon of the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus can be palpated. Range of Motion. Assessment for ankle range of motion typically begins with an evaluation of active, passive and resistive range of motion. There are four main motions that occur at the ankle joint: dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion, and eversion. To assess the passive range motion, have the patient seated with their foot off the exam table. While stabilizing the lower leg, passively apply pressure to assess soft tissue mobility
The foot flexion is 22° (40° in maximum plantar flexion − 18° talo-first metatarsal angle in neutral). This gives a total ankle(tibiotalar) ROM of 20° dorsiflexion and 3° plantar flexion for a total of 23°. The combined ankle and foot ROM is 23° in the ankleand 22° in the foot for a total of 45°. 2,3 Dorsiflexion was 2.1° (range, −2°–10°). Themean ankle plantar flexion was 16.4° (range, 0.0°–34.0°),with a combined true tibiotalar ROM of 18.5° (range,3.0°–44.0°) (Table 1).At 1-year followup, there was a limited, but significant(p 0.0037), improvement in the tibiotalar ROM (Table Fig 1A–C.
A range of 24° to 30°combined motion (dorsiflexion and plantar flexion) isneeded for normal walking, 37° is needed for ascendingstairs, and 55° is needed for descending stairs. 4,5 There are numerous reports on ankle arthroplasty in theliterature. 1–3,6,7 Few mention the preoperative and/or post-operative ROM. 2,3 Dorsiflexion was 2.1° (range, −2°–10°). Themean ankle plantar flexion was 16.4° (range, 0.0°–34.0°),with a combined true tibiotalar ROM of 18.5° (range,3.0°–44.0°) (Table 1).At 1-year followup, there was a limited, but significant(p 0.0037), improvement in the tibiotalar ROM (Table Fig 1A–C.
Anterior process fractures result from avulsion or compression. Inversion plantar flexion can cause avulsion fractures of the anterior process. This injury tends to be extra-articular and accounts for most of the anterior process fractures that are initially diagnosed as ankle sprains. 21 – 23.
