Dysgraphia Symptoms. Dysgraphia (pronounced: dis-graf-ia) affects approximately 10% of the population. Dysgraphia is a neurological disorder, dysgraphia symptoms are characterised by the inability to write properly. Dysgraphia in fact refers specifically to the inability to perform operations in handwriting. It could be described as an extreme difficulty with fine-motor skills. Fine-motor skills are essential for good writing.
Dysgraphia is a learning disability that affects writing abilities. It can manifest itself as difficulties with spelling, poor handwriting and trouble putting thoughts on paper. Because writing requires a complex set of motor and information processing skills, saying a student has dysgraphia is not sufficient.
