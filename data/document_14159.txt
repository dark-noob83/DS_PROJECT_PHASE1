For Bulls fans worried that their team would become boring to watch after Derrick Roseâ€™s most recent injury, have no fear-Joakim Noah has your back. Over his past 13 games, Noah has returned to the Point-Center role that he played so well last year.
Rose is a ball-dominant point guard, and the Bulls ran very little sets with Noah as the primary ballhandler when Rose was playing.
Comment. CHICAGO -- Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose has been cleared for more activity as he continues to recover from a broken left orbital, according to coach Fred Hoiberg.
The Bulls have been suffering as a team with Noah playing the point because their #1 (Butler), #3 (Rose), and #6 (Gibson) scorers have been out for most of that time. Consequently, the team has gone 5-8 in the stretch that Noah has been the primary facilitator on offense.
Rose got up a couple of shots and did some work with the Bulls' training staff after practice. Hoiberg noted that Rose, who has been fitted for a mask that he will wear when he returns, still has some problems around his eye.
Current Contract. Derrick Rose signed a 5 year / $94,314,380 contract with the Chicago Bulls, including $94,314,380 guaranteed, and an annual average salary of $18,862,876. In 2015-16, Rose will earn a base salary of $20,093,064. Rose has a cap hit of $20,093,064 while his dead money value is $41,416,316.
