The federal Department of Labor's website says that you can expect your first unemployment check two or three weeks after you apply, as long as you submit all of the required information, and no follow-up is necessary. In some states, there is a waiting period (one week is typical) between the time you become unemployed and when you are eligible for benefits. This means you won't receive any unemployment compensation for the first week you are out of work.
Your First Check. If you complete your claim application correctly the first time and there are no eligibility issues for the agency to sort out, you should receive your first unemployment check within a few weeks or so after you file. You should file your claim for unemployment benefits as soon as you lose your job, but you might not receive your first check for at least a few weeks. Talk to an Employment Lawyer.
