English: Size comparison between VY Canis Majoris and Earth (via the Sun) by zooming in three times. The colours of the stars have been chosen based roughly on their surface temperatures. 
Approximately 4.900 light years from earth you can find VY Canis Majoris, assuming you’re going the right way. That’s rather far to say the least. To start with the basics, a light year is the distance light can travel in a year. VY Canis Majoris is a mere 96,296 times bigger than Earth. I’d like to illustrate it, but Earth would be near to invisible on most comparisons. So therefore I’d like to use a more common picture that compared VY to our sun.
Here's what Betelgeus looks like, compared to Eta Carinae: Of course, the best way to feel really, really, super small is to compare our sun to one of the largest stars ever observed: VY Canis Majoris. This star's diameter is roughly 2000 times that of our sun's and 155,000 times that of Earth's. Discovery Chanel. Here's what the star looks like compared to our sun: Discovery Even larger than Eta Carinae is a star 640 light years from Earth called Betelgeuse. Betelgeuse is the eighth brightest star in the night sky and the second brightest star that makes up the constellation of Orion.
VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red hypergiant star located in the constellation Canis Major. Right to left: VY Canis Majoris compared to Betelgeuse, Rho Cassiopeiae, the Pistol Star, and the Sun (too small to be visible in this thumbnail).
Temperature. Our sun is hotter than VY Canis Majoris, but that doesn’t make the star a nice place to spend the weekend. The average temperature on Earth, estimated by NASA, is 59 Fahrenheit or 15 celsius. VY’s estimated temperature is 4939 Fahrenheit (or 2726 Celsius). VY Canis Majoris is a mere 96,296 times bigger than Earth. I’d like to illustrate it, but Earth would be near to invisible on most comparisons. So therefore I’d like to use a more common picture that compared VY to our sun.
VY Canis Majoris is about 2,100 solar radii, it is possibly the largest known star and also one of the most luminous known. It is located about 1.5 kiloparsecs (4.6×1016 km) … or about 4,900 light years away from Earth. The diameter of VY Canis Majoris is Est. 3,063,500,000 km. (but disputed) If the Sun was replaced by VY Canis Majoris, its surface would extend to the orbit of Saturn.
Size. The diameter of VY Canis Majoris is 1,420 solar radii, according to most recent estimates. That’s 1.227.000.000 miles or 1.920.000.000 kilometer. Multiply that with pi and we know the distance to travel around VY Canis Majoris. In this case that is 3,854,734,574 miles or 6,202,267,930 kilometer. VY Canis Majoris is a mere 96,296 times bigger than Earth. I’d like to illustrate it, but Earth would be near to invisible on most comparisons. So therefore I’d like to use a more common picture that compared VY to our sun.
The largest star yet discovered in the Universe is VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa). It is a red hypergiant star located in the constellation of Canis Major. It is about 2000 times the size of our Sun with a diameter of 3,063,500,000,000m. If this star replaced our Sun in the Solar system, it would extend up to Saturn. The real largest star is NML Cygni, 1,650 times the sun's radius! Compare it to VY Canis Majoris' 1,420 solar radii, and you will see what I mean.
The first known recorded observation of VY Canis Majoris is in the star catalogue of Jerome Jérôme, lalande on 7 march, 1801 which lists it as a 7th magnitude. Star further-19th century studies of its apparent magnitude demonstrate that the star has been fading since. 1850 Right to left: VY Canis Majoris compared to Betelgeuse, Rho Cassiopeiae, the Pistol Star, and the Sun (too small to be visible in this thumbnail).
