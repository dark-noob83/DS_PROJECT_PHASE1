1 If the damage is extensive, repaving may be necessary. 2  A newly paved driveway can cost $600-$3,000 for gravel, macadam or black asphalt for a small 12x50 (600 square foot) surface, and can run two to three times as much for materials like concrete or cobblestones. 
To calculate the asphalt driveway cost, you just need to take a measurement of length x width to get the approximate square foot area, and multiply it by the average cost of $3-$4/square foot. Example: A driveway that’s 10′ wide and 60′ long equals 600 square feet. In fact, most driveway contractors can come in, clean the old surface and chip away at the edges to make sure you get good adhesion of the new topcoat, roll on a new surface and be gone in less than 1 day! The cost, is even more attractive at just $1.65 – $2.40 dollars per

Cost of Resurfacing. Resurfacing usually costs anywhere from $1 to $2 per square foot. The price varies based on factors such as your geographic location, local competition, the season and the condition of your driveway. So the cost to resurface a 3,000 square foot driveway would be anywhere from $3,000 to $6,000. Repaving is more expensive than resurfacing because the job requires significantly more time, materials and labor. The cost is usually at least one-third more than resurfacing, and sometimes double the cost.
