Most of these gases are absorbed by the intestine and exhaled. In the colonic bacterial fermentation and putrefaction produce fetid gas which is expulsed as flatus. Overeating, bacterial invasion of the small intestine, inflammatory and circulatory disturbances of the small bowel and obstipation favour meteorism. The treatment depends of the origin of
* The conversion of Lactulose to lactic acid by fermentation by colonic bacteria results in acidification of the gut which in turn appears to promote movement of ammonia from the blood stream into the colon.
Colonic fermentation is regulated by the triad encompassing the colonocyte (constant), colonic bacteria (slightly variable) and diet (highly variable). Hence variation in diet is likely to have a significant impact on colonic fermentation and, to a lesser extent, on resident colonic bacteria.
The hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose is the first step of colonic fermentation of lactose, catalyzed by the enzyme β-galactosidase. β-Galactosidase is often measured as an indicator of the colonic capacity to ferment lactose (40 – 42).
Hence, diarrhea will ensue if colonic fermentation capacity is impaired (e.g., antibiotic-associated diarrhoea) or overwhelmed (e.g., lactase deficiency) (6). Colonocytes rely mainly on nutrition from the colonic lumen (the “milieu exterieur”) extérieur and have a preference for using butyrate as an energy. substrate

Summary. Fermentation of undigested foods in the colon by its resident bacteria affects not only colonic health (protection against inflammation and tumour formation) but also influences metabolic health. Studying fermentation directly is difficult for lack of access.
