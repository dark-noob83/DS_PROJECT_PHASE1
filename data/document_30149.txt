Orion /ori-on/ [2 sylls.] as a boys' name is pronounced oh-RYE-on. It is of Greek origin. Greek mythology: Orion was a mighty hunter, the son of Poseidon, who was turned into a constellation. The Orion constellation contains three of the most conspicuous stars in the nighttime sky.
While the Orion constellation is named after the hunter in Greek mythology, it is anything but stealthy. Orion, which is located on the celestial equator, is one of the most prominent and recognizable constellations in the sky and can be seen throughout the world.
The Orion Nebula is farther away than any of the naked eye stars at a distance of about 1,600 light-years. One light-year is the distance light travels in a single year, about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). The exception is the star Betelgeuse, which is a red giant and one of the largest stars known.
Origin of the name Orion: From Greek and Roman mytholoogy, Orion was a son of Poseidon. He loved the goddess Diana but was accidentally killed by her and thenceforth placed in the heavens as the constellation Orion. From A World of Baby Names by Teresa Norman.
