All ExpressCard slots will accommodate modules designed to use either USB 2.0, or the emerging PCI-Express standards. There are two sizes of ExpressCard module. One is 34 mm wide (ExpressCard/34) and the other is 54 mm (ExpressCard/54). Both modules are 75 mm long and 5 mm high. Host systems can provide any combination of slots for either width of module
The Expresscard/34 is 34 mm wide, while the Expresscard/54 is 54 mm wide. The modules are both 5 mm high and 75 mm long. The 34 mm module has the advantage in that it can fit into the slot designed for the 54 mm card, but not vice versa. 
However, the typical laptop with an ExpressCard slot uses that slot as a remote control holder. The ExpressCard slot found in most late-model laptop computers (and a few desktop computers) is a prime example of a high-speed technology that most users arenâ€™t putting to work. 1 ExpressCard/34 is 34mm wide, and (you guessed it) ExpressCard/54 is 54mm wide. 2  Both form factors use the same 26-contact connector, and you can connect ExpressCard/34 devices into either type of ExpressCard slot.
Considerations. While an ExpressCard/34 slot may save a little space, an ExpressCard/54 slot on a laptop can offer a wider range of uses. This is because the makers of ExpressCard slots designed the 54mm slot to accept both 34mm and 54mm cards while the 34mm can only accept the smaller sized cards. An ExpressCard is not an SD card or microSD card. It is also important to note that a PCMCIA card is longer than an ExpressCard. Older PC Cards will not work with an ExpressCard slot and ExpressCards will not function with PCMCIA or CardBus slots.
ExpressCard, initially called NEWCARD, is an interface to connect peripheral devices to a computer, usually a laptop computer. The ExpressCard technical standard specifies the design of slots built into the computer and of expansion cards to insert in the slots. The cards contain electronic circuits and sometimes connectors for external devices. 1 ASUS has also replaced the PC Card slot with an ExpressCard slot on many of its new models. 2  Sony also began shipping systems with ExpressCard with its new laptop VGN-C, VGN-SZ, VGN-NS, VPC and FW product line.
The two standard ExpressCard formats are the 34mm and 54mm cards. The measurement that each type is named after is the width of the card. The ExpressCard slot on a laptop may either be an ExpressCard/34 or an ExpressCard/54, with each number representing the width of the slot. The depth is always 75mm and both form factors use the same connection interface. An ExpressCard is not an SD card or microSD card. It is also important to note that a PCMCIA card is longer than an ExpressCard. Older PC Cards will not work with an ExpressCard slot and ExpressCards will not function with PCMCIA or CardBus slots.
Module Form Factors. There are two standard formats of ExpressCard modules: the ExpressCard/34 module (34mm x 75mm) and the ExpressCard/54 module (54mm x 75mm). Both formats are 5mm thick, the same as the Type II PC Card. The standard module length is 75mm, which is 10.6mm shorter than a standard PC Card. While the ExpressCard/34 device is better suited to smaller systems, the wider ExpressCard/54 module can accommodate applications that do not physically fit into the narrower ExpressCard/34 form factor. Examples include SmartCard readers, Compact Flash readers, and 1.8-inch disk drives.
ExpressCard technology is designed to deliver high-performance, modular expansion to both desktop and notebook computers at a lower cost and in a smaller form factor. Users are able to add memory, wired and wireless communications, multimedia and security features by inserting ExpressCard modules into compliant systems. While the ExpressCard/34 device is better suited to smaller systems, the wider ExpressCard/54 module can accommodate applications that do not physically fit into the narrower ExpressCard/34 form factor. Examples include SmartCard readers, Compact Flash readers, and 1.8-inch disk drives.
The ExpressCard/34 expansion slot is 34 mm wide and 75 mm long, and is not backwards compatible with Type I or II PC Cards, which are 54 mm wide and 85.6 mm long. According to ExpressCard.org, ExpressCard/34 is: There are two sizes of ExpressCard module. One is 34 mm wide (ExpressCard/34) and the other is 54 mm (ExpressCard/54). Both modules are 75 mm long and 5 mm high.
