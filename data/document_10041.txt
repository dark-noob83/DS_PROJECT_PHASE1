1. CMOS batteres DO NOT recharge so sticking the main battery in will not do jack. 2. 10 years is shelf life. How long the battery last depends on current drain and physical size of battery (ie a D cell vs a AA Cell). I had to replace the CMOS battery in my Compaq laptop-PAIN IN THE A2S.
They do recharge. A battery that doesn't recharge would not keep the CMOS data alive for very long. Maybe days. They need to be replaced because despite not having used many recharge cycles, a battery won't keep its ability to hold a charge forever. It happens to car batteries.
The CMOS battery (or the motherboard battery) has a unique purpose in a computer. This page will explain what the battery is, how to change the CMOS battery and how to remove the CMOS battery and a range of other things to do with that little computer battery inside your motherboard.
First up, nhinkle: The CMOS battery is not there to provide power to the computer when it is in operation, it is there to maintain a small amount of power to the CMOS when the computer is powered off and unplugged. The primary function of this is to keep the clock running even when the computer is turned off.
