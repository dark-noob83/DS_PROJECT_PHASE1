For the Gold elite status challenge, rather than trying to earn 25,000 miles in a year, you can earn status in three months by earning 5,000 miles. Earn 5,000 miles in 3 months to get American Airlines Gold Status. The points you earn with American Airlines depend on the miles flown and the fare purchases.
Over a year ago I created some comparison tables of elite status across the five major U.S. carriers: Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and US Airways. Now, American and US Airways are merging while Delta and United have introduced new elite qualification requirements.
Everyone is aware of American Airlines and most other carriers elite status levels. These are the people who are invited to board the planes first, get free upgrades, and even get the best seats in the first few rows of the economy seating section (you might not have known that).
And, of course, airlines offer the best perks to their highest tier elites. United is no different. They offer elite tiers ranging from Premier Silver status (25,000 miles per year flown) to Premier 1K status (100,000 miles flown). As with all airlines, perks improve as you move up the elite ladder.
Alaska Airlines is one of the few programs left that offers a standard status match program for elite members from AeroMexico, Air Canada, American, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, United, US Airways, and Virgin America.
With the merger and integration between American and US Airways underway, I know a lot of people are trying to figure out the best way to maximize status with the new airline.
