The opposite of gluconeogenesis is glycolysis (glyco for glucose, lysis for breakdown) which is as its name suggests the break down of glucose to form pyruvate and eventually acetyl CoA.
by admin. Glycolysis vs Gluconeogenesis. Cells take energy by the hydrolysis of ATP molecules. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is also known as the ‘currency’ of the biological world, and it is involved in most cellular energy transactions. ATP synthesis requires cells to perform exergonic reactions.
Gluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is synthesized from smaller simpler molecules such as lactate and pyruvate. While the catabolic linear pathway of glycolysis deals with the breakdown and extraction of energy from glucose, the reverse anabolic process of gluconeogenesis is equally important.
• Gluconeogenesis is an anabolic pathway while glycolysis is a catabolic pathway. • Glycolysis is an exergonic pathway, thus yielding two ATPs per glucose. Gluconeogenesis requires coupled hydrolysis of six phosphoanhydride bonds (four from ATP and two from GTP) in order to direct the process of glucose formation.
At a basic level, Gluconeogensis is an anabolic process. It involves the creation of a 6 carbon glucose molecule from smaller precursors. The name gluco (glucose) neo (new) genesis (creation) is quite descriptive of what the pathway does. Ana-bolic is greek for upward-throw. The opposite of gluconeogenesis is glycolysis (glyco for glucose, lysis for breakdown) which is as its name suggests the break down of glucose to form pyruvate and eventually acetyl CoA. Glycolysis in contrast is considered cata-bolic (greek for downwardthrow).
