Garvey, a freezer does indeed cost that much. You’re only looking at the electricity cost, which is only a piece of the pie. You also need to prorate out the cost of the freezer. If you spent $450 on a freezer and expect it to run 8 years, that’s another $4.69 a month. I think it’s important to note that these freezers can be had for much cheaper, too… 21cf is pretty big!! There are only two people in my house so we can get away with a 7cf model that uses 274kWh/year and cost $130 IIRC.
Costs. There is the obvious upfront cost of the freezer, monthly electricity costs to run it, hopefully minimal maintenance costs, and I suppose we’ll lose the space in the garage. Here is the rough breakdown for various sizes of chest freezers (Energy Star rated, name brand): 7 ft3: $210 + $25/year in electricity. When we leave it on, it’s an extra $30 a month on the electric bill. Here in Texas it’s just too hot to run an extra freezer in the garage. My husband’s parents have an upright freezer in their garage, and are constantly sending meat that has freezer burn home for our dogs.
Wattage. Look on the back of your freezer for the sticker or plate that shows the unit's annual wattage usage. To calculate how much it costs to run, take the annual wattage figure – using 1,235 kilowatt-hours for a pre-1980 chest unit – divide it by 12 to get the kilowatt-hours per month, or 103. An energy-efficient large freezer with more than 25 cubic feet will use about 956 kilowatt-hours per year, according to EnergyStar.gov. That equates to about $10 a month. When you reduce the size of your freezer, your costs go down. Standard freezer sizes run between 19 cubic feet and 22 cubic feet. Monthly costs for these units average about $67 per year or a little over $5 a month
If you are running a second freezer, you could unplug it and save $174 a year. (That’s for a 19-21 cubic foot freezer made before 1980.) Both calculations are using the average national price of $.11 per kilowatt hour. The numbers are convincing. For instance, if your fridge was made before 1980 and cools 19-21 cubic feet, you could save $1,005 over five years by upgrading. The calculator says your old clunker costs $246 a year to run, but an Energy Star qualified fridge costs just $45 a year to run. That’s $201 cheaper per year!
At 10c 10ç per kilowatt, hour the machine would cost you$.27 00 per month to. (OPERATE but you need to use the number from the) Freezer if the data plate does not state, watts it will state amperes or amps and'you ll need to calculate the. watts I have a old Kenmore coldspot deep freeze in my basement that was here when we moved here. We are wondering how much they cost to run per month since we now need a deep freeze. Follow.
To put it simply, if the cost of an appliance doesn’t save you money month over month, then don’t buy it. A washing machine is well worth it for almost everyone, for example, but a deep freezer merits some evaluation of your own lifestyle. I think it’s important to note that these freezers can be had for much cheaper, too… 21cf is pretty big!! There are only two people in my house so we can get away with a 7cf model that uses 274kWh/year and cost $130 IIRC.
But that’s only the start of the costs as the electricity to keep my freezer running costs approximately £85 per year (assuming it uses 2 units per day at current rates) and then there is the hidden cost of maintaining your food inventory. 
A chest freezer sized below 16.5 cubic feet costs $53 per year, using a total of 404 kilowatt-hours per year, or 34 kilowatt-hours per month. When you divide $53 by 12, your monthly costs equate to a little more than $4 per month. An energy-efficient large freezer with more than 25 cubic feet will use about 956 kilowatt-hours per year, according to EnergyStar.gov. That equates to about $10 a month. When you reduce the size of your freezer, your costs go down. Standard freezer sizes run between 19 cubic feet and 22 cubic feet.
