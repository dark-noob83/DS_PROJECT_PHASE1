Alpine glaciers are glaciers formed in the mountains. Continental glaciers are formed during ice ages and are large, expanses of ice. The high altitude or the troposphere and … the constant snow that is packed together and turned to ice is what forms the alpine glaciers high in the mountains. Unique landforms created by alpine glaciers are: U-Shaped Valleys, Hanging Valleys, Cirques, and Aretes.
Alpine Glaciers Alpine glaciers are very slow moving rivers of ice flowing down high mountain valleys.Like continental glaciers, they create land forms by weathering and deposition. Cirque: a circular hollow cut into bedrock during glaciation Arete: Arête steep knife edged ridge between two cirques in a mountainous. region
Continental Glaciers vs. Alpine glaciers Continental glaciers cover parts of continental land masses like Greenland but, Alpine glaciers are found high in mountain valleys, above the snow-line.
Alpine glaciers form at high altitudes (e.g. the tops of mountains) and continental glaciers for at high latitudes (e.g. Antarctica and Greenland).
Glaciers And Glaciation By definition a glacier is a mass of ice composed of compacted and recrystallized snow that flows under its own weight. This makes glaciers very effective agents of erosion, transportation and deposition of sediment. The two types of glaciers are Valley or Alpine glaciers Continental glaciers. The difference between them is where they flow. Valley glaciers flow in mountain valleys from high to low elevations. Continental glaciers or ice sheets flow over vast unconfined land areas. Valley glaciers are present at high altitude in mountain valleys of Alaska, the Italian Alps and New Zealand.
