Please type in the city or suburb's name for the postal code that you are looking for. 
Post Codes were introduced in South Africa in 1973, with the introduction of automated sorting. South African post codes consist of four digits. Mail may be delivered either to the physical address or to a PO Box, particularly in rural areas where no street delivery is available. In addition, many large organisations may use Private Bag address, with mail dispatched to the holder by a mail contractor. A feature of South African postal addresses, also common to Australia, is that it is only necessary to include the suburb, not the city, for example, in the case of Yeoville in Johannesburg : The code should be placed on a new line or in front of the suburb/town. The following is also acceptable
