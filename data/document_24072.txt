Texas Prison Facts:  At the end of 1999 -- the latest year figures are available -- Texas led the nation with the largest number of people under criminal justice supervision, with 706,600 people either in prison, on parole or probation. That equals 5 percent of the adult population of the state. The Texas prison population has tripled since 1990, and rose 61.5 percent in the last five years of the 1990s.  The Texas criminal justice system has grown so large that in July 2000, corrections officials ran out of six-digit numbers assigned to inmates, and officially created prisoner number 1,000,000.
Comparative incarceration. At mid-year 2000, Texas incarcerated 163,503 of its citizens in prisons or jails, or 779 per 100,000 people. Texas was second only to California (164,490) in the number of its citizens behind bars, and second only to Louisiana (793 per 100,000) in the portion of its citizens incarcerated. (Data table, [PDF] scroll to Table 2) By mid-year 2003, Texas's population had grown to be the largest state prison population, although the federal system is now even larger. Texas's incarceration rate rose to 803 per 100,000 residents, but Louisiana's still outranks Texas.
If Texas was a nation separate from the United States, it would have the world's highest incarceration rate--significantly higher than the United States (682), and Russia (685) which has 1 million prisoners, the world's third biggest prison system. (1) In Texas, if people are continued to be put into prison at the same rate as they are now, 1 out of every 6 Latino men born in 2001 will serve time in prison at some point in their lives. On the other hand, a white man born in 2001 is almost three times less likely to see the inside of a prison.
1 Ultimately, the cost of 10 days in prison is equal to over 10 months on probation. 2  Women make up 28% of all Texas probationers, with men making up the remaining 72%. 7. 3  Probation revocations were responsible for sending 32% of individuals to Texas prisons during FY 2010. 1 Altogether, approximately 155,000 men and women are in Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facilities, with more than 140,000 currently in prison units, 18 costing an average of $18,538 per individual per year. 2  19. 3  Of those in TDCJ facilities, approximately 12,000 are in state jail.
Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, also known as the Walls unit of the state prison system, was the state's first enclosed penitentiary for convicted felons. On March 13, 1848, the Texas legislature passed the bill to establish a state prison. Herman L.
