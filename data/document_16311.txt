Like other dangerous substances, DMT use may not be immediately detectable but will instead present itself as a shift in attitude, a disconnect with things the teen previously enjoyed and an increased interest in alternate realities. DMT might not be a drug many parents have discussed with their teens, but it's time to start talking about it. The hallucinogenic drug is popular with males and can be a deadly journey for its users.
Plants. There are a large number of plants from around the world that contain DMT and other similar alkaloids. Some of these are several Psychotria spp., Phalaris spp., Acacia spp., Arundo donax, Desmanthus illinoiensis, etc. The plant we will be dealing with in this text is called Phalaris aruninacea. A mixture of a MAOI and dimethyltryptamine is called Ayahuasca. This text will be dealing with smokable DMT, so don't worry about MAOI's right now. As far as I know, the whole idea of smokable DMT from plants is a very new area of exploration.
The idea of DMT having anything to do with death was first mentioned in DMT: The Spirit Molecule by Dr. Rick Strassman (which is listed in the sources). The interesting thing there is, Strassman himself admits that his idea is a mere hypothesis, and that there is no empirical data to suggest it is actually true. It is present in the lungs though, amo9ng other places. DMT has been found in trace amount in the human body (not in the brain), but at this point any declaration of where in the body it is produced or what purpose it serves is nothing more than conjecture.
About 90% of cells in ER-negative lines expressed detectable amounts of DMT protein, whereas only 40% or less of ER-positive cells contained a significant level of DMT. The most remarkable difference was observed in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Increased expression of DMT is an early event in two experimental models of cancer (Belinsky et al., 1996; Miyoshi et al., 1993), and overexpression of DMT can promote a transformed phenotype in NIH3T3 cells (Wu et al., 1993).
Authorities did not make it known that DMT was now detectable in hopes of trapping some competitors that had switched over from THG. It is possible, though extremely unlikely, that they are hoping to catch users with an unknown test for MGF. The PED now being used is a component of a hormone. That test, called a biomarker test, is now in use by WADA and in MLB. It took WADA years to come up with an HGH test, so it would be hard to imagine that the agency developed an MGF test in less time and complete secrecy.
Phalaris DMT is something brand new--derived from one of the ayahuasca analog plants, it is a natural form of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT which can be grown by anyone outside the polar regions. A mixture of a MAOI and dimethyltryptamine is called Ayahuasca. This text will be dealing with smokable DMT, so don't worry about MAOI's right now. As far as I know, the whole idea of smokable DMT from plants is a very new area of exploration.
This post is in response to DMT, Aliens, and Realityâ€”Part 2 by Scott A. McGreal. In previous posts (here and here) I discussed the psychedelic drug DMT, and the remarkable fact that many users of this substance report encounters with non-human entities that often seem compellingly real. Along with many indicators in DMT (psychedelia) context, such as reference in common to the 'alien' nature of 'DMT entities' (possibly - the customary fudge-caveat) - a 'lot in common' with alien abductionism, as analyzed by Kelley-Romano and others, is evident.
1 DMT is an abbreviation for Dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogenic substance. 2  DMT can be produced synthetically, but it's also found in a variety of plants and seeds. DMT might not be a drug many parents have discussed with their teens, but it's time to start talking about it. The hallucinogenic drug is popular with males and can be a deadly journey for its users.
1 DMT can be produced synthetically, but it's also found in a variety of plants and seeds. 2  Taken orally, DMT will not have hallucinogenic effects on its own. 3  DMT must be combined with an MAOI, a substance that inhibits enzymes in the human body so the psychedelic properties can be felt.
