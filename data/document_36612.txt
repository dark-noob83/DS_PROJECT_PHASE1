Endorphins. Endorphins are your body's natural painkillers. First discovered in 1975, they are proteins that work in a similar way to the painkiller morphine. The word 'endorphin' is actually an abbreviation of the words endogenous (meaning produced by the body) and morphine
endorphin (endogenous morphine) Naturally occurring peptide neurotransmitter found in the pituitary gland that has similar pain-relieving effects as morphine and other derivatives of opium. Endorphins block the sensation of pain by binding to pain-receptor sites. endorphins (ĕndor´fĬnz) , fĭnz neurotransmitters found in the brain that have-pain relieving properties similar to. Morphine there are three major types of: endorphins beta, endorpins found primarily in the pituitary; gland and enkephalins and, dynorphin both distributed throughout the nervous. system
There isn’t just one kind of endorphin – in fact, there are at least 20 kinds. One variety called beta-endorphins has been found to be stronger than morphine in its effects on the body. This isn’t an unusual comparison – endorphins are regularly compared to opiates in regards to their effects on the body.
β-Endorphin is an endogenous opioid neuropeptide found in the neurons of both the central and peripheral nervous system. It is one of five endorphins found in humans, the others of which include α-endorphin, γ-endorphin, α-neoendorphin, and β-neoendorphin. The amino acid sequence is: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Thr-Ser-Glu-Lys-Ser-Gln-Thr-Pro-Leu-Val-Thr-Leu-Phe-Lys-Asn-Ala-Ile-Ile-Lys-Asn-Ala-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Gly-Glu (31 amino acids).
Endorphins are natural pain killing substances found in the human brain. The name comes from endogenous (meaning within) and morphine (morphine being a pain killer). Endorphins are one of the neurotransmitters in the brain. Levels of endorphins in the brain may be changed by taking a number of drugs including alcohol, anabolic steroids and heroin and other opiates.
Endorphins can be found in the pituitary gland, in other parts of the brain, or distributed throughout the nervous system. Stress and pain are the two most common factors leading to the release of endorphins. Endorphins interact with the opiate receptors in the brain to reduce our perception of pain and act similarly to drugs such as morphine and codeine. In contrast to the opiate drugs, however, activation of the opiate receptors by the body's endorphins does not lead to addiction or dependence. Endorphins are among the brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which function to transmit electrical signals within the nervous system. At least 20 types of endorphins have been demonstrated in humans.
Definition of ENDORPHIN. : any of a group of endogenous peptides (as enkephalin) found especially in the brain that bind chiefly to opiate receptors and produce some pharmacological effects (as pain relief) like those of opiates; specifically: beta-endorphin.
