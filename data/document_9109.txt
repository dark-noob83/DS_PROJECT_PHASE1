The upcoming Hellboy in Hell will be a departure for the Hellboy comics in that it will not be a miniseries or one-shot. Instead Hellboy in Hell will be an ongoing comic with irregular release dates starting its numbering at #1. It will have its own trade paperback line much like B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth does.
