10% Discount on Daily Registration Fees Good at all KOA Kampgrounds.* At the closest KOA to me ... just for a comparison a one-night tent stay would be $24.39 with the membership discount it would be $21.95.My first thought is that there are a lot of other cheaper campground alternatives ... We've traveled all over the 49 States with our truck camper. I don't see where the KOA membership is worth the cost. The savings just isn't enough to make it worthwhile unless you use their campgrounds all the time. In our case we don't go out of our way for a KOA unless one just happens to be handy. We prefer state and county campgrounds whenever possible

Advertisements. There seem to be mixed reviews on KOA memberships, so I thought I would add to the confusion. A KOA membership will cost you $24 a year, and give you 10% off each visit. If you camp a lot like I do, it will pay for itself and then some. You also get members only exclusive deals and offers, which can vary from KOA to KOA. You earn points and can redeem those points for free stays. 
Posted. I'm not a big fan of these type of deals however. If you stayed for the max 21 days and moved on to the next park in one day and stayed at all 90 parks, you would spend 1890 days or 5.18 yaers in the Thousand Trails parks. That would cost $3,510.00 for 6 years membership. That would average out costing $1.86 per night. Hmmmm.
Considering the average non membership overnight fee, somewhere around $40 per night, a full timer on the road for ten years using public campgrounds will spend about $146,000.00 ($40 per night X 365 days a year X 10 years). Owning a membership over the same 10 years will cost somewhere cost somewhere around $36,000.00. This is a savings to you of about $110,000.00! These figures do not take in account annual inflation which given consideration will boost the number significantly higher. By that I mean that you have to bring power to the property, put in a sewer system and put in a well for water. The average expense to bring power to the property with a power pole and meter will average $500.00. The septic system will cost approximately $1500.00.
As for membership in KOA, I don't think I would benefit from it, even though I camp quite a bit. First, it offers 10% off the price of a stay, as I recall. That discount is only good at member campgrounds.
