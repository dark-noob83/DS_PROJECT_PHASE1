Well, the 2005 return will take longer than the 2006, since the tax centre is doing 2006 right now. If the 2006 return depends on the 2005 return for some reason (carryforwards, for example), you may be waiting several weeks.
After you have completed your return you have a choice to transmit via NETFILE or print and mail your return. If you have transmitted your return by NETFILE, all your data is sent to the CRA and /or the Revenu Quebec and you will receive a confirmation number from the CRA and the Revenu Quebec websites. It can take 2 to 3 weeks to receive a refund when you transmit your return via NETFILE. For mailed returns, refunds are mailed out in 4 to 6 weeks following receipt of the return by the CRA or the Revenu Quebec. If you haven't filed in your return yet, you must do so by choosing the option that suits your needs best. 
Warning Do not ignore a letter from the CRA. If the CRA doesn't receive a response to its letter within 30 days, it will adjust your claim based on the information it has. This may not be in your favour. â€‹The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may contact you about your tax return, and not necessarily just at tax time.
