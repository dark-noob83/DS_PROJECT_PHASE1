The retina neurons have been widely studied because the retina is highly structured in well-defined layers. This post will describe the work in this one small region of the eye and the different neuron types in different layers. Even this small region has more than 70 different types and possibly many more.
1 There are neurons that express specific secretions and membrane bound receptors. 2  Neurons have different orientations, shapes, and symmetries. 3  For example, specific neuron types have dendrites that have a particular form. 4  Also, in the retina different cell types connect in the many sub layers of the IPL and OPL.
There are two sensory receptors in the retina, rod cells and cone sells. Rod cells are stimulated by light intensity while cone cells are stimulated by light wave length.
The sensory neuron cell bodies that lead to spinal cord are present in the dorsal root ganglion which is very next to the spinal cord. These cell bodies are found in clusters with their axons extending in both directions.
Bipolar neurons. have two processes—an axon and a dendrite—that extend from opposite sides of the cell body. These rare neurons are found in some of the special sense organs. Examples include some neurons in the retina of the eye and in the olfactory mucosa.
Bipolar neurons are relatively rare. They are sensory neurons found in olfactory epithelium, the retina of the eye, and ganglia of the vestibulocochlear nerve. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. They are located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and in autonomic ganglia. Multipolar neurons have more than two processes emanating from the neuron cell body.  Fig.
