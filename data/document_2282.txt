Calculus is the mathematical study of change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits, broadly called mathematical analysis. Calculus has historically been called the calculus of infinitesimals , or infinitesimal calculu
integral calculus. n. 1. (Mathematics) the branch of calculus concerned with the determination of integrals and their application to the solution of differential equations, the determination of areas and volumes, etc. Compare differential calculus.
Calculus. The word Calculus comes from Latin meaning small stone, Because it is like understanding something by looking at small pieces. Differential Calculus cuts something into small pieces to find how it changes. Integral Calculus joins (integrates) the small pieces together to find how much there i
Integral calculus is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the indefinite integral and the definite integral. The process of finding the value of an integral is called integration. In technical language, integral calculus studies two related linear operators.

Integral. An integral is a mathematical object that can be interpreted as an area or a generalization of area. Integrals, together with derivatives, are the fundamental objects of calculus. Other words for integral include antiderivative and primitive. The Riemann integral is the simplest integral definition and the only one usually encountered in physics and elementary calculus. (8). What's more, the first fundamental theorem of calculus can be rewritten more generally in terms of differential forms (as in () above) to say that the integral of a differential form over the boundary of some orientable manifold is equal to the exterior derivative of over the interior of, i.e.
The integral is an important concept in mathematics. Integration is one of the two main operations in calculus, with its inverse, differentiation, being the other. Given a function f of a real variable x and an interval [a, b] of the real line, the definite integral. A line integral is defined for functions of two or three variables, and the interval of integration [a, b] is replaced by a certain curve connecting two points on the plane or in the space. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in the three-dimensional space.
Noun. 1. integral calculus-the part of calculus that deals with integration and its application in the solution of differential equations and in determining areas or volumes etc. math, mathematics, maths-a science (or group of related sciences) dealing with the logic of quantity and shape and arrangement. 1. (Mathematics) the branch of calculus concerned with the determination of integrals and their application to the solution of differential equations, the determination of areas and volumes, etc. Compare differential calculus.
