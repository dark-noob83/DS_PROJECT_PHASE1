This is an attempt by a survivor to bring information in plain understandable english on the ‘rare’ condition called Superficial Siderosis of the Central Nervous System to fellow world-wide survivors, their familes and supporters.
A Honor Society of Nursing (STTI) answered. Siderosis, also called welder's lung, is a lung disease caused by breathing in iron or iron oxide dust. Siderosis is considered to be an occupational illness because people breathe in the iron dust at work. The condition usually shows up on X-rays as small, opaque spots on the worker's lungs.
