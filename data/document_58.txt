The interquartile range is a value that is the difference between the upper quartile value and the lower quartile value. To find the interquartile range, simply take the upper quartile and subtract the lower quartile. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. To find the interquartile range, simply take the upper quartile and subtract the lower quartile: 7.5 - 2.5 = 5. The interquartile range for this data set is 5. That means that the majority of the group can make about five out of ten free throw shots.
1 The lower quartile (Q 1) is the median of the lower half of the data set. 2  The upper quartile (Q 3) is the median of the upper half of the data set. 3  The interquartile range (IQR) is the spread of the middle 50% of the data values. 4  So: The interquartile range is a more useful measure of spread than range as it describes the middle 50% of the data values and thus, is less affected by outliers. 19 21 24 21 24 28 25 24 30. 19 21 21 24 24 24 25 28 30. 1  The median is the middle value of the data set.
The interquartile range is a value that is the difference between the upper quartile value and the lower quartile value. Coach Taylor can use the interquartile range to summarize the overall accuracy of his players. To find the quartiles of this data set use the following steps: 1  Order the data from least to greatest. To find the interquartile range, simply take the upper quartile and subtract the lower quartile: 7.5 - 2.5 = 5. The interquartile range for this data set is 5. That means that the majority of the group can make about five out of ten free throw shots.
1 The upper quartile (Q 3) is the median of the upper half of the data set. 2  The interquartile range (IQR) is the spread of the middle 50% of the data values. The interquartile range is a more useful measure of spread than range as it describes the middle 50% of the data values and thus, is less affected by outliers. 19 21 24 21 24 28 25 24 30. 19 21 21 24 24 24 25 28 30. 1  The median is the middle value of the data set.
Interquartile range. The interquartile range is another range used as a measure of the spread. The difference between upper and lower quartiles (Q 3 –Q 1), which is called the interquartile range, also indicates the dispersion of a data set. The interquartile range spans 50% of a data set, and eliminates the influence of outliers because, in effect, the highest and lowest quarters are removed. Semi-quartile range. The semi-quartile range is another measure of spread. It is calculated as one half the difference between the 75th percentile (often called Q 3) and the 25th percentile (Q 1). The formula for semi-quartile range is: (Q 3 –Q 1) ÷ 2.
Since half the scores in a distribution lie between Q3 and Q1, the semi-interquartile range is 1/2 the distance needed to cover 1/2 the scores. In a symmetric distribution, an interval stretching from one semi-interquartile range below the median to one semi-interquartile above the median will contain 1/2 of the scores. Next section: Variance and Standard Deviation. The semi-interquartile range is a measure of spread or dispersion. It is computed as one half the difference between the 75th percentile [often called (Q3)] and the 25th percentile (Q1). The formula for semi-interquartile range is therefore: (Q3-Q1)/2
In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread or middle fifty, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q 3 − Q 1. Unlike total range, the interquartile range has a breakdown point of 50%, and is thus often preferred to the total range. The IQR is used to build box plots, simple graphical representations of a probability distribution.
