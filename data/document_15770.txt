There are three layers of meninges around the brain and spinal cord (these are continuous between the two structures). The outermost layer is the Dura mater, the toughest and most protective layer. The middle is the arachnoid layer, and the pia mater is the innermost layer. The protective layers of the brain are the 3 meninges. From the outermost layer to the innermost layer, they are the dura mater, the arachnoid, and the pia mater. Dura mater,arachnoid mater,pia mater,skull. The protective membranes surrounding the brain are called the meninges, and from outside to in are named the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and the pia mater.
They are composed of three membranes, called the pia mater, the arachnoid mater and the dura mater. Each layer of the meninges is a continuous layer, covering the entire brain and spinal cord. The pia mater is the innermost membrane and is the most delicate of the three layers. It also is the most closely fitting, running smoothly over the spinal cord and brain, following the contours of their surfaces. Within the pia mater is a network of capillaries that supply blood to the brain and spinal cord. 
The meninges refer to the membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord. There are three layers of meninges, known as the dura mater, arachnoid mater and pia mater. © 2015 TeachMeAnatomy.com [CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0]. Fig 1.0 – Overview of the meninges, and their relationship to the skull and brain. Arachnoid Mater. The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges, lying directly underneath the dura mater. It consists of layers of connective tissue, is avascular, and does not receive any innervation. Underneath the arachnoid is a space known as the sub-arachoid space.

The meninges are three layers of protective tissue called the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater that surround the neuraxis. The meninges of the brain and spinal cord are continuous, being linked through the magnum foramen. Dura Mater The dura mater is the most superior of the meningeal layers. Its name means hard mother in Latin and it is tough and inflexible. The subdural space is another potential space. It is between the dura mater and the middle layer of the meninges, the arachnoid mater. When bleeding occurs in the cranium, blood may collect here and push down on the lower layers of the meninges. If bleeding continues, brain damage will result from this pressure.

The meninges (/məˈnɪndʒiːz/ , singular: meninx (/ˈmiːnɪŋks/ or /ˈmɛnɪŋks/), from Ancient Greek: μῆνιγξ mēninx membrane, adjectival: meningeal /məˈnɪndʒəl/) are the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system. The arachnoid is attached to the dura mater, while the pia mater is attached to the central nervous system tissue. When the dura mater and the arachnoid separate through injury or illness, the space between them is the subdural space.
pia mater. delicate membrane that lies on the surface of the brain and spinal cord. delicate mother, it is the most delicate of the meninges; this layer faithfully follows all surface contours of the brain and spinal cord; pia mater has 2 specializations: denticulate ligament and filum terminale internum. denticulate ligament. a lateral extension of pia mater from the spinal cord
