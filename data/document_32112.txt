Granulocytes vs Agranulocytes. Granulocytes and agranulocytes, both are considered as a two types of white blood cells. This classification is based on the presence or absence of cytoplasmic granules, nuclear shape, and affinity for laboratory stains or dyes. White blood cells or leucocytes are considered as a main cellular component of blood.
• Granulocytes consist of eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils whereas lymphocytes and monocytes are the two types of agranulocytes. • Unlike granulocytes, agranulocytes lack cytoplasmic granules. • Granulocytes contain nuclei with lobes, while granulocytes do not have lobed nuclei.
There are two types of agranulocytes, namely Monocytes and Lymphocytes. These cells do not have granules in their cytoplasm. Monocyte is the largest white blood cell type and contains horse shoe-shaped nucleus. The main function of monocyte is to carry out phagocytosis of cellular debris and foreign particles.
Granulocytes and Agranulocytes. Leukocytes are classified broadly as granulocytes and agranulocytes. These terms tell you something about these cells. If a leukocyte possesses cytoplasmic granules it is a granulocyte and if these granules are lacking, it is an agranulocyte. Once this distinction is made, more specific identification can follow.

Normally the human blood has 3 types of lymphocytes namely B cells, T cells and NK cells. Lymphocytes are commonly found in lymphatic system of the body in particular the NK (natural killer) cells.
Granulocyte: A type of white blood cell that is filled with microscopic granules, little sacs containing enzymes that digest microorganisms. Granulocytes are part of the innate immune system, and they have somewhat nonspecific, broad-based activity.
