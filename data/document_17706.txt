Photosynthesis in plants is dependent upon capturing light energy in the pigment chlorophyll, and in particular chlorophyll a.
1 Chlorophyll a: This is the most abundant pigment in plants. 2  Chlorophyll a absorbs light with wavelengths of 430nm(blue) and 662nm(red). 3  It reflects green light strongly so it appears green to us. 4  It contains a hydrophobic (fat soluble) phytol chain that allow it to be embedded in a lipid membrane.
Land plants (and plants in the ocean, called algae) have a lot of chlorophyll-a pigment because it is essential to photosynthesis, but they also have other pigments, called accessory pigments, that help them absorb light.
Because they interact with light to absorb only certain wavelengths, pigments are useful to plants and other autotrophs --organisms which make their own food using photosynthesis. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, pigments are the means by which the energy of sunlight is captured for
Accessory Pigments for Photosynthesis. Chlorophylla-a is the primary pigment for photosynthesis in plants, but the range of light absorption is extended by chlorophyll-b, beta-carotene and other accessory pigments. The variations of chlorophyll-b and the bacterial version are indicated above.

They are popular in ‘scratch and sniff’ products, such as perfume samples etched into women’s magazines. The reader scratches the sample aroma pigment, releasing an aroma matching the selected perfume.
Pigments are chemical compounds which reflect only certain wavelengths of visible light. This makes them appear colorful. Flowers, corals, and even animal skin contain pigments which give them their colors. More important than their reflection of light is the ability of pigments to absorb certain wavelengths.
