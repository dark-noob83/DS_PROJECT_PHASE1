Bake for another 10 to 15 minutes: Bake the loaf for another 10 to 15 minutes (about 1 hour total), until the middle of the loaf registers at least 155째F on an instant-read thermometer. Cool 15 minutes before serving: Let the loaf cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. If you baked your meatloaf in a loaf pan, carefully drain off the liquid fat before transferring the meatloaf to a cutting board. Cut into thick slices and serve. 1 Coat the loaf with ketchup or bacon (optional): Spread 1/4 cup of the ketchup mixture over the meatloaf (reserve the other 1/4 cup for later). 2  Alternatively, drape the loaf with bacon slices. 3  Bake for 45 minutes: Bake the meatloaf for 45 minutes, then spread with the remaining 1/4 cup of ketchup, if using.

I've noticed that we have baking time issues with both our old standby meatloaf (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/fo... ) and with a new addition to the meatloaf family (http://cupcakesandkalechips.com/2014/... ). Both recipes call for 2-2.5 lbs of meat and are supposed to bake in about 45-60 minutes. 
Report Abuse. I line a rimmed baking sheet with tin foil, place the meatloaf (in a loaf shape) on the foil in the middle of the pan, and cook at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Although the loaf pan provides a nice shape, the only place for the fat to go is to be reabsorbed into the meat. I usually cook a 1 lb meatloaf for an hour on 350. Pour the tomato sauce/ketchup topping on and bake for 10 more minutes, and the let sit to cool. Either will work, when I didn't have a loaf pan, I would use a 9x13 pan line in foil and shape into loaf form.
Best Answer: I bake mine in a loaf pan so it catches the juices/fats that bake out of it. If you're going to use a baking sheet, make sure it has rim edges! I bake my 1 1/2 pound meatloaf for 1 1/2 hrs. at 350 F. You're probably fine with 1 hour at 350 F for 1 pound. Enjoy! I made meatloaf on Sat. I usually cook a 1 lb meatloaf for an hour on 350.
