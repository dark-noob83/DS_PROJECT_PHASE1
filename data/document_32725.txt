parkinson s disease or simply parkinson s or pd is the most common form of parkinsonism a group of motor system disorders it is a slowly progressing degenerative disease that is usually associated with the following symptoms all of which result from the loss of dopamine producing brain cells parkinson s disease is chronic persists over a long period of time and progressive symptoms grow worse over time although the disease may appear in younger patients even teenagers it usually affects people in late middle age it is not contagious
parkinsonism is the umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of tremors muscle rigidity and slowness of movement parkinson s disease is the most common type of parkinsonism but there are also some rarer types where a specific cause can be identified these include parkinsonism caused by parkinson s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra
pd is the most common form of parkinsonism 1 in which disorders of other causes produce features and symptoms that closely resemble parkinson s disease while most forms of parkinsonism have no known cause there are cases in which the cause is known or suspected or where the symptoms result from another disorder a number of disorders can cause symptoms similar to those of pd people with symptoms that resemble pd but that result from other causes are considered to have parkinsonism some of these disorders include multiple system atrophy
in parkinson s disease certain nerve cells neurons in the brain gradually break down or die many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine when dopamine levels decrease it causes abnormal brain activity leading to signs of parkinson s disease the cause of parkinson s disease is unknown but several factors appear to play a role including
a shortage of dopamine parkinson s disease occurs when nerve cells or neurons in an area of the brain that controls movement become impaired and or die normally these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine but when the neurons die or become impaired they produce less dopamine 
in this article font size a a a parkinson s disease is caused by the progressive impairment or deterioration of neurons nerve cells in an area of the brain known as the substantia nigra when functioning normally these neurons produce a vital brain chemical known as dopamine
parkinson s disease is the most common movement disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative disorder the most common being alzheimer s disease the hallmark symptoms of parkinson s disease pd are asymmetric tremors at rest rigidity and bradykinesia slowness in movement 
the specific cause of parkinson s is unknown however medical experts believe the symptoms are related to a chemical imbalance in the brain caused by brain cell death parkinson s disease is chronic persists over a long period of time and progressive symptoms grow worse over time although the disease may appear in younger patients even teenagers it usually affects people in late middle age it is not contagious
causes of parkinson s disease parkinson s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamin
