1 On average, bus rapid transit (BRT) costs $10.24 million in 1990 dollars per mile to build. 2  This figure is less than half that of that for light rail transit (LRT), $26.4 million and one-tenth of metro rail transit (MRT), $128.2 million.

A feasibility study of high-speed rail in Britain came up with the considerably higher figure of $493,000 a mile for surface trains. I’ll stay closer to the lower estimate and go with $200,000 a mile per year, which brings the fixed costs of the track up to $648 million per annum.
Recent costs range from an estimate of $251 million per mile for the BART San Jose extension to a staggering $2.1 BILLION per mile for the Second Avenue Subway in New York-a number also reached by the East Side Access project to allow the Long Island Railroad to enter Grand Central Station.

The cost of recent surface light rail lines has ranged from a low of $43 million per mile in Norfolk, VA to a high of $204 million per mile for the new Milwaukie line in Portland. Los Angeles's Crenshaw Line, which includes short subway sections, clocks in at $165 million per mile.
I've read that a new 8 lane interstate class highway in the US costs about $50 million per mile on flat land, aside from land acquisition costs which, of course, vary widely. The $2-3 million for rail is what I have heard for a 79 MPH signaled single track line.
I have heard from $1 million to $3 Million. Some of the mass transit projects are mind boggling for the cost per mile, do a search on the subject and you will find a great spread on those costs. Here is a link to a site that gives the cost of a mile siding.
