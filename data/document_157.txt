However, while many (but not all) canyons are found offshore from major rivers, subaerial river erosion cannot have been active to the water depths as great as 3000 meters where canyons have been mapped, as it is well established (by many lines of evidence) that sea levels did not fall to those depths. Canyons cutting the continental slopes have been found at depths greater than 2 km below sea level. Many submarine canyons continue as submarine channels across continental rise areas and may extend seawards for hundreds of kilometres onto the abyssal plain.
4. Kali Gandaki Gorge, Nepal. Because all canyons and gorges are different, from the slope of their walls and their rim height above sea level, it’s difficult to determine a list of the “deepest” canyons in the world. 
Someone can find more information about canyons from a number of websites such as the National Park Service website. The website has detailed information about various canyons … located throughout the US. Edit.

Photograph by Bruce Dale. Bound by cliffs and cut by erosion, canyons are deep, narrow valleys in the Earth's crust that evoke superlatives and a sense of wonder. Layers of rock outline stories of regional geology like the table of contents to a scientific text. 
Most canyons were formed by a process of long-time erosion from a plateau or table-land level. The cliffs form because harder rock strata that are resistant to erosion and weathering remain exposed on the valley walls. In the United States, place names generally use canyon in the southwest and gorge in the northeast, with the rest of the country graduating between these two according to geography. In Canada, gorges are usually narrow, and ravines more open and often wooded.
About 3% of submarine canyons are joined to shelf valleys that connect with large rivers; the largest canyons (equal to about 29% by number) incise into the continental shelf but the largest number of canyons (about 69%) terminate on the slope, making so-called “blind” or “headless” canyons. Canyons cutting the continental slopes have been found at depths greater than 2 km below sea level. Many submarine canyons continue as submarine channels across continental rise areas and may extend seawards for hundreds of kilometres onto the abyssal plain.
1 Amazon Canyon, extending from the Amazon River. 2  Baltimore and Wilmington Canyons, East Coast of Maryland and Delaware States. 3  Bering Canyon, in the Bering Sea. 4  Congo Canyon, the largest river canyon, extending from the Congo River, is 800 km (497 mi) long, and 1,200 m (3,900 ft) deep. Canyons cutting the continental slopes have been found at depths greater than 2 km below sea level. Many submarine canyons continue as submarine channels across continental rise areas and may extend seawards for hundreds of kilometres onto the abyssal plain.
Tourists can also enjoy hiking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. Bryce Canyon is close to both Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon, as well as the town of Kanab, Utah, where many visitors to the area choose to find accommodation. Lodging can also be found in Bryce Canyon National Park’s two campgrounds or its lodge. Credit: charlesgyoung. Credit: Andreas Adelmann. 
For a period of time it was barren, but the Den Depot takes it's place. The Den Depot is a place where you can buy various different dens as used today. Coral Canyons is a gorge-like land full of red dust and sandstone. It seems to be based on the famous Grand Canyon. It was released on September 10th, 2010 (January 2015 for the app), as a celebration after the Beta Days ended.
