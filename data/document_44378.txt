During low water flow, the wing dams keep the channel deeper for barge traffic and increase water velocity in the center to create a stable, self-scouring channel. Piles of rock mark a wing dam on the Mississippi River. Studies have indicated that wing dams may cause problems.
You might mark a ton of fish on the backside of a wing dam and you can catch them occasionally. But when it‘s game on or time to eat they are on the front side of the wing dam.”. One thing to keep in mind while looking for wing dams is to stay in the channel.
Wing dam in a man-made river bed. A wing dam or wing dike is a manmade barrier that, unlike a conventional dam, only extends partway into a river. These structures force water into a fast-moving center channel which reduces the rate of sediment accumulation while slowing water flow near the riverbanks.
