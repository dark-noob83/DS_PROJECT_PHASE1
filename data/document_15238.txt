How many you will put on the car is up to you. Just as a tip, if your planning on leasing, figure out how many miles you drive a month, then add 50% to get the amount of miles you should buy for a lease. i.e. if you figure you drive 1,000 miles per month you need a lease for 1,500 miles per month or 18,000 miles per yr.

For example, say your lease is for three years and 45,000 miles. If you go 7,000 miles over your lease mileage and want to purchase the car at the end of the lease, you’ll be paying the price of a car that has 45,000 miles on it instead of the 52,000 it actually does. Park it.
Excess Miles Charge The amount, per mile, you will pay at lease end if you have exceeded your allowed miles. Excess mileage charges are typically in the range of $0.10 - $0.25 per mile.

Annual Miles Alloweds The average miles you can drive your leased car each year without paying excess mileage charges at the end of the lease. Typical values are 10,000, 12,000 or 15,000 miles and you should be able to find this in your lease agreement.
Also choose whether 'Length of Lease' is years or months. The average miles you can drive your leased car each year without paying excess mileage charges at the end of the lease.

Lease mileage allowances are expressed as annual miles, such as 12,000 miles per year, which equates to 1000 miles per month, or 36,000 miles total for a 36 month (3 year) lease. It doesn’t mean the lease company is going to be checking to see if customers are meeting their monthly or annual allowances. For example, for a Honda Accord the rate is $0.15. If you drive 2000 more miles than your total allowance for the lease, you would be responsible for paying 2000 x $0.15 = $300 at lease-end when you return your car. Here’s a little table that translates annual mileage to monthly mileage
The short answer to your question is no, a high-mileage lease is not a good option. Any benefit you might get from a lease does not offset the high charge for excess miles. The standard lease is for 15k miles per year. If you go over the 45k miles allowed on a 3-year lease, you will pay $0.15/mile for anything over 45k. If you actually drive the extra 60k miles, you are looking at a charge of $9,000 to turn the car in, and that's before any excess wear and tear charges. And if I lease with say 30k per year miles and then in 3 years turn it in. I understand that if I go over I will have to pay, But I have to think that 10000 miles at .20/mile is a lot better than having 5-6k sill owed on the car.
When leasing your new Honda it’s important to select a mileage that works best for you. Leasing typically isn’t the best option for anyone driving a lot of miles a year. Standard leases usually aim for 12,000 or 15,000 miles a year. However, you can work up to as many as 25,000 miles a year into your lease. As TJ Nissen explains in the video, one of the advantages to leasing a vehicle is a low payment. If you increase miles to as much as 25,000, you may get closer to a retail payment.
