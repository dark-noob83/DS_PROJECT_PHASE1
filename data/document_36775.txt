Knee flexion is the bending of the knee to bring the foot toward the posterior thigh, and extension is the straightening of the knee. Flexion and extension movements are seen at the hinge, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket joints of the limbs (see [link] a-d).
In the limbs, flexion decreases the angle between the bones (bending of the joint), while extension increases the angle and straightens the joint. For the upper limb, all anterior-going motions are flexion and all posterior-going motions are extension.
SHARE SHARE TWEET EMAIL. The lunge is a split-squat that allows you to train one leg at a time. As you drop down into a lunge, the front knee bends, or flexes. The amount of flexion, the type of lunge and the exercise technique all affect the safety and health of the knee joint during the lunge exercise.
For the vertebral column, flexion (anterior flexion) is an anterior (forward) bending of the neck or body, while extension involves a posterior-directed motion, such as straightening from a flexed position or bending backward. Lateral flexion is the bending of the neck or body toward the right or left side.
Overview. Knee flexion means bending your leg at the knee joint, reducing the angle between your lower leg and upper leg. Knee flexion is always accompanied by knee extension, which is straightening of the leg. Vern Gambetta, director of Gambetta Training Systems in Sarasota, Florida, recommends doing exercises that incorporate multiple joints and muscles because many activities that you do every day rarely use knee flexion alone.
