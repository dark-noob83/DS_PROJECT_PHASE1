Houseflies pass through four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The life expectancy of a housefly is generally 15 to 30 days and depends upon temperature and living conditions. Flies dwelling in warm homes and laboratories develop faster and live longer than their counterparts in the wild. The houseflyâ€™s brief life cycle allows them to multiply quickly if left uncontrolled.
Once the adult house fly hatches from the pupal stage, it has an approximate life span of 20 to 30 days. The average life span of a house fly is fifteen to thirty days. The length of time a house fly lives is dependent on both temperature and living conditions.
The housefly life cycle closely mirrors that of most insects: a basic cycle that begins with an egg, then develops through a larva phase, a pupa phase, and finally, into an adult. During a warm summer -- optimal conditions for a housefly -- the cycle, from fertilized egg to adult, spans a mere seven to 10 days.
The life cycle of a house fly begins in the egg stage. A female house fly is capable of laying up to 150 eggs in a batch. Over a period of a few days, she will produce five or six batches of eggs. Female house flies favor damp, dark surfaces such as compost, manure and other decomposing organic material for egg laying.
Best Answer: The average life span of an adult housefly is from 20 to 30 days. The housefly combines a capacity for producing great numbers of young with one of the shortest life cycles known. A few flies in early summer can produce millions of descendants by fall, and as many as ten generations in that single season.
1 Adult: Once the adult house fly hatches from the pupal stage, it has an approximate life span of 15 to 30 days. 2  Females are able to start producing eggs after two days of life and will continue to lay eggs for about a month.
