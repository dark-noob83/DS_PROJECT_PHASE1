Ionizing Radiation. Ionizing radiation sources may be found in a wide range of occupational settings, including health care facilities, research institutions, nuclear reactors and their support facilities, nuclear weapon production facilities, and other various manufacturing settings, just to name a few.
The radiation-absorbed dose (rad) is the amount of energy (from any type of ionizing radiation) deposited in any medium (e.g., water, tissue, air). An absorbed dose of 1 rad means that 1 gram of material absorbed 100 ergs of energy (a small but measurable amount) as a result of exposure to radiation.
Ionizing radiation is addressed in specific standards for the general industry, shipyard employment, and the construction industry.
Radiation may be defined as energy traveling through space. Non-ionizing radiation is essential to life, but excessive exposures will cause tissue damage. All forms of ionizing radiation have sufficient energy to ionize atoms that may destabilize molecules within cells and lead to tissue damage. Radiation sources are found in a wide range of occupational settings. If radiation is not properly controlled it can be potentially hazardous to the health of workers. The following link to information about non-ionizing and ionizing radiation in the workplace.
One of the two units used to measure the amount of radiation absorbed by an object or person, known as the “ absorbed dose ,” which reflects the amount of energy that radioactive sources deposit in materials through which they pass.
DEFINITION. A nuclear gauge (also called a nuclear density gauge, a soil moisture gauge, or a moisture density gauge) is a tool used for civil engineering projects and construction that measures soil density or soil water content. Nuclear gauges are also used for industrial, mining, and scientific purposes.
