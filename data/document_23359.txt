The average human can lift their own body weight. And since the average human weighs about 150 lbs, then that is the average weight a human being can lift.

Novice weight trainers -- weighing 198 pounds, the nearest cutoff to the average American male -- with several months of experience average 230 pounds for the squat, 175 pounds for the bench press and 290 pounds for the deadlift -- according to Kilgore's strength standards.

An effective way to evaluate the average's man strength is to look at familiar exercises that work multiple muscle groups. With this in mind, the average untrained man can squat 125 pounds, bench press 135 pounds and deadlift 155 pounds.

A 5 Milligram Ant lifting 100 times it's body weight. An often cited reference is that an ant can carry up to 20 times it's own weight. While it's true that an ant can carry 20 times it's own body weight, it can also carry much more than that. (wikipedia, 2013). So in order to lift 100 times their body weight, a person would need to lift 17,700 lbs. (177lbs x 100 = 17,700). That's about the size of a school bus.

That's about the size of a school bus. It would be a hard enough task to simply drag the school bus, let alone lifting the bus over your head and carrying it around all day like the ant doe
