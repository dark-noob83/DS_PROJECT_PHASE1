Ms Sim, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on public order events, also told the Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights of concerns over the Human Rights Act and its impact on policing. It (the Act) is an issue that's currently an ongoing question around risk aversion, she said. I don't think the human rights aspect is any different from the health and safety aspect if I'm being perfectly blunt. I think they're all things that I think, if we're not careful, can lead to officers being risk averse.
This is why both the police and prison services have been reviewing their practices to identify those which may not be compatible with the European Convention. In the case of the police, each force has designated a human rights champion - a senior officer-who has been responsible for supervising an audit of functions. Lawyers believe that Article 2, the right to life, will be the basis for a number of significant challenges. This will not only affect situations where the police take a life-for example by use of firearms-but also deaths in custody, where it may be argued that officers have failed to preserve a life.
This article explores the impact of the Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998 on the police service of England and Wales. An important result of this is that the HRA is not used to achieve a balance between individual rights and community interests, but becomes a framework for mandating police decision making and protecting officers from criticism and blame.

The Human Rights Act. The Human Rights Act is a UK law passed in 1998. It means that you can defend your rights in the UK courts and that public organisations (including the Government, the Police and local councils) must treat everyone equally, with fairness, dignity and respect. The Human Rights Act protects all of us-young and old, rich and poor. What this actually means is that it does two things: 1  Judges must read and give effect to legislation (other laws) in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights; 2  It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.
