For the Kenmore Elite white 30-inch freestanding gas range model 78402 (item no. 02278402000), what are the lowest and highest oven temperatures that I can set? The minimum temperature setting in the ownera€™ownerâ s manual is 170 Degrees fahrenheit and the maximum temperature is 550 Degrees. Fahrenheit i hope this will help. you
Place it in the centre of the oven and set the oven to 175 degrees Celsius. Check the temperature shown on the thermometer after 20 minutes and if it's not within five degrees of 175, you'll need to get the oven professionally calibrated. A medium oven means a temperature of around 180 degrees Celsius. This is a good temperature to choose if you are not sure of the temperature you need. This temperature will work well for everything from pies to cakes and even pasta bakes. A high oven means a temperature of around 230 degrees Celsius. Temperatures this high are mainly used for fast roasting lean cuts of meat and fish. With a little bit of practice, and sticking to these temperature guidelines, you can make the most of your produce and use your oven to its full potential
The various standard phrases to describe oven temperatures include words such as cool to hot or very slow to fast. For example, a cool oven has temperature set to 90°C (200°F), and a slow oven has a temperature range from 150–160°C (300–325°F). A moderate oven has a range of 180–190°C (350–375°F), and a hot oven has temperature set to 200–230°C (400–450°F). A fast oven has a range of 230–260°C (450–500°F) for the typical temperature.
For this reason, they reach around the same maximum temperatures. The maximum temperature of a home gas oven is 537.7 degrees Celsius (which the heat reached by self-cleaning ovens during the self-cleaning process). For ordinary cooking, the maximum temperature used is 287.7 degrees Celsius. The maximum heat of an electric oven depends on the brand and the model. The meat top of the oven (the top of the stove) can reach temperatures of around 185.5 degrees Celsius. Solar powered ovens can be used when no other fuel is available
Ideal for high temperature processes such as preheating prior to welding or stress relief of steel springs and stampings. MODEL NTR-1000 Same as Model NT-1000, plus recirculating blower system to improve temperature uniformity and reduce heat-up time of oven and parts. • Additional Shelves, 20 lbs distributed load per shelf, 40 lbs maximum oven load, specify oven model when ordering.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Common oven temperatures (such as terms: cool oven, very slow oven, slow oven, moderate oven, hot oven, fast oven, etc.) are set to control the effects of baking in an oven, for various lengths of time. A moderate oven has a range of 180–190°C (350–375°F), and a hot oven has temperature set to 200–230°C (400–450°F). A fast oven has a range of 230–260°C (450–500°F) for the typical temperature.
