Best Answer: I'm not sure how the membrane surface area can increase in cells, but an obvious example of an organelle with an increased surface area would be the mitochondria-it has two membranes, an outer one and an inner one.
Microvilli: In some cells the membrane is thrown into minute fingerlike projections or folds called microvilli which greatly increase the surface area of the cell avail … able for absorption or passage of materials and for the binding of signaling molecules.

The main role of microvilli is to increase the area of a membrane through which the cell can absorb nutrients. Nutrients from digested food are absorbed into the cells of the intestines. An epithelial cell in the intestines can have as many as 1,000 microvilli. Microvilli increase the surface area of a cell by 25 times. The microvilli also secrete enzymes that digest proteins and sugars into smaller pieces, which are easier to absorb. There are motor proteins inside a microvillus that pull on the actin rods inside the microvillus.
As a cell grows bigger, its internal volume enlarges and the cell membrane expands. Unfortunately, the volume increases more rapidly than does the surface area, and so the relative amount of surface area available to pass materials to a unit volume of the cell steadily decreases.
The surface area to volume ratio (SA:V) of a cell imposes upper limits on size, as the volume increases much faster than does the surface area, thus limiting the rate at which substances diffuse from the interior across the cell membrane to interstitial spaces or to other cells.
