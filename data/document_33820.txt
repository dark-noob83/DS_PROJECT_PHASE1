Reminder: Mitosis is defined as the type of cell division by which a single cell divides in such a way as to produce two genertically identical daughter cells.
Mitosis. Mitosis is a form of eukaryotic cell division that produces two daughter cells with the same genetic component as the parent cell. Chromosomes replicated during the S phase are divided in such a way as to ensure that each daughter cell receives a copy of every chromosome.
What is Mitosis. New cells are made by cell division and mitosis is a type of cell division. Mitosis is the name given to the process by which the nucleus of a cell divides in such a way that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of its genetic material. The genetic code or genetic material is contained within the chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell.
Cytokinesis (Cytoplasmic Division). Cytokinesis is the process by which the cytoplasm of the original cell forms the two new (daughter) cells around the two new (daughter) nuclei formed by the process of mitosis (or meiosis-cytokinesis being a part of both types of processes of cell division).
Cells divide and reproduce in two ways: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells developing from a single parent cell.
When a cell splits and becomes two, certain processes occur within  the nucleus first. One of these processes involves the splitting of  the chromosomes. This process is called Mitosis and there are four  distinct stages.
Mitosis is the process in which a eukaryotic cell nucleus splits in two, followed by division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. The word mitosis means threads, and it refers to the threadlike appearance of chromosomes as the cell prepares to divide.
