Brain size and EQ (Encephalization Quotient) Some EQ comparisons and what not to do with them The first set of EQs I'm using on this page are from a single source and will vary somewhat from other figures that may be found in other sources (as you'll see in the sets of EQs I present later on this page). Besides different methods of calculating EQ there may be some variation in the specimens used as source material -- most, if not all, animals vary from individual to individual in both body and brain size, and this can make a difference depending on what source specimens are used for comparison.
The above equation is an example of scaling, as it defines a relationship between a dependent variable (in the above, BM(e) or expected brain mass) and a measure of body size or scale. Further, the mathematical relationship above is non-. Returning to the topic of encephalization, once an estimate of brain mass is obtained using a credible statistical model (based on data from a range of species), encephalization can be measured. Foley and Lee [1991] provide a good explanation of encephalization quotients
The cephalization factor and the subsequent encephalization quotient was developed by H.J. Jerison in the late 1960s. The formula for the curve varies, but an empirical fitting of the formula to a sample of mammals gives. As this formula is based on data from mammals, it should be applied to other animals with caution. Thus, the same amount of brain matter can govern breathing in a large or a small body. While not all control functions are independent of body size, some are, and hence large animals need comparatively less brain than small animals.
Encephalization quotient (EQ), or encephalization level is a measure of relative brain size defined as the ratio between actual brain mass and predicted brain mass for an animal of a given size, which is hypothesized to be a rough estimate of the intelligence or cognition of the animal. Thus, the same amount of brain matter can govern breathing in a large or a small body. While not all control functions are independent of body size, some are, and hence large animals need comparatively less brain than small animals.
One method commonly used, the encephalization quotient or EQ, is an equation comparing the proportional brain size of an animal, that is brain size relative to body size, to the “expected” brain size in an animal of that size. EQ greater than one indicates brain size larger than expected for an animal of this mass, if EQ equals one brain size is about average, if EQ less than one brain size is less than would be expected. The assumption being that proportional brain size of an animal is a general indicator of intelligence.
The Encephalization Quotient (EQ) is the ratio of C over the expected value for C of an animal of given weight S. Here E is the weight of the brain, C is the cephalization factor and S is body weight and r is the exponential constant. The exponential constant for primates is 0.28 and either 0.56 or 0.66 for mammals in general.
Sexual Dimorphism An encephalization quotient is calculated as a corrected ratio of brain mass to body mass for a particular organism. However, Table II demonstrates the well-known fact that the australopithecines and Homo habilis are sexually dimorphic (Johanson and White, 1979; McHenry, 1986; 1991a; Zihlman, 1985). Abstract. The australopithecines and Homo habilis have been publicized for years as examples of evolutionary transitional forms that launched our own human lineage. Dogmatic evolutionists have rationalized these claims on the basis of brain expansion, encephalization quotients, and bipedalism.
Encephalization may also refer to the tendency for a species to evolve larger brains through time. Anthropological studies indicate that bipedalism preceded encephalization in the human evolutionary lineage after divergence from the chimpanzee lineage. Here E is the weight of the brain, C is the cephalization factor and S is body weight and r is the exponential constant. The exponential constant for primates is 0.28 and either 0.56 or 0.66 for mammals in general.
Encephalization is defined as the amount of brain mass related to an animal's total body mass. Quantifying an animal's encephalization has been argued to be directly related to that animal's level of intelligence. Here E is the weight of the brain, C is the cephalization factor and S is body weight and r is the exponential constant. The exponential constant for primates is 0.28 and either 0.56 or 0.66 for mammals in general.
The result of their work was the proposal of an encephalization quotient which is defined as the ratio of the true mass of a brain to the anticipated mass of the brain for a given body size (Jerison, 1970; Martin, 1990). Abstract. The australopithecines and Homo habilis have been publicized for years as examples of evolutionary transitional forms that launched our own human lineage. Dogmatic evolutionists have rationalized these claims on the basis of brain expansion, encephalization quotients, and bipedalism.
