Cervical dilation (or cervical dilatation) is the opening of the cervix, the entrance to the uterus, during childbirth, miscarriage, induced abortion, or gynecological surgery. Cervical dilation may occur naturally, or may be induced by surgical or medical means.
Dilation. The word dilation, in terms of human physiology, means to 'relax, open, or widen.' This is usually used in structures where materials are allowed to pass. Dilation is an autonomic process, which means you cannot consciously control it. But when it is time for birth, the smooth muscle of the cervix relaxes, causing the cervix to dilate, or open wider. In this example, dilation is used by the smooth muscle of the cervix to allow the passage of a newborn child from the uterus to the birth canal.
