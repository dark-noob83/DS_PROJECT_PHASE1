And, you get a lot less honey from a small super for the same amount of work. In an upcoming lesson, we'll discuss when and how to add supers. But for now, we are merely getting familiar with the hive components.
In summary, before removing honey supers determine how much stored honey the hive has in the two deep brood nest area. Do not remove honey supers until you can see 8-10 deep frames in the brood nest area full of honey.
As you can see, the only difference is the height, which is very critical, because the greater the height, the larger the frame in height, and the larger the frame, the more honey it can hold. Therefore, a deep super full of honey can weight close to 70 pounds. A medium close to 50 pounds and a small 30 pounds. We only build and sell medium supers because it is more commonly used by the average beekeeper.
Honey super. 231 pages on this wiki. A honey super is a part of a beehive that is used to collect honey. The most common variety is the super with a depth of 6 5/8 inches in the length and width dimensions of a Langstroth hive. Honey supers may contain 8-10 frames.
A deep brood super weighs approximately 60-80lbs with bees, brood, and honey. Now all this is using a 10 frame set up. If you use 9 frames you can count on adding 10 lbs. to theÂ theâ, shallow-15 20 lbs to the, medium and 20 to 40 lbs or more to the. deep
Some beekeepers use only 8 or 9 frames in a honey super, while others use all 10. It does make a difference. Obviously, if you use 9 frames, the comb on each frame will be drawn out wider by the bees, thus making much more space for the honey.
