The plasma membrane (cell membrane) is made of two layers of phospholipids. The plasma membrane has many proteins embedded in it.The plasma membrane regulates the entry and exit of the cell.
Function of Plasma Membrane. 1  It separates the contents of the cell from its outside environment and it regulates what enters and exits the cell. 2  Plasma membrane plays a vital role in protecting the integrity of the interior of the cell by allowing only selected substances into the cell and keeping other substances out.
The cell membrane is the outermost barrier of an animal cell. As for plants, the cell membrane is surrounded by the cell wall, which gives the cell a much more rigid structure. To clarify, all cells have a plasma membrane. The function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell and control the transport from the inside to the outside of the cell. It contains transport signaling systems such as protein channels through which substances such as salts pass.

The eukaryotic plasma membrane is a phospholipids bilayer containing proteins and carbohydrates attached to the proteins and sterols. It is a fluid phospholipids bilayer embedded with proteins and glycoprotein. The phospholipids bilayer is arranged in such a manner that they form the center of the membrane.
Lists of functions of a cell membrane (= plasma membrane) can include various numbers of functions because particles can move across the membrane in several different ways, including diffusion via ion channels, active transport via membrane pumps, endocytosis (into the cell) and exocytosis (out of the cell).
All living cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, have a plasma membrane that encloses their contents and serves as a semi-porous barrier to the outside environment. The membrane acts as a boundary, holding the cell constituents together and keeping other substances from entering.
The plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, which is two layers of phospholipids back-to-back. Phospholipids are lipids with a phosphate group attached to them. The phospholipids have one head and two tails. The head is polar and hydrophilic, or water-loving.
