Explanation [edit]. The perception of loudness is related to both the sound pressure level (SPL) and duration of a sound. The human auditory system averages the effects of SPL over a 600–1000 ms interval. A sound of constant SPL will be perceived to increase in loudness as samples of duration 20, 50, 100, 200 ms are heard, up to a duration of about 1 second at which point the perception of loudness will stabilize.
The determining factor as to the softness or loudness of a sound is the amplitude of the sound wave. We know that sound is mechanical energy, and a source of sound will put me … chanical energy into the medium through which it is going to travel. Let's look at the wave. Loudness is a subjective measure, which is often confused with objec … tive measures of sound prtessure such as decibels or sound intensity. Filters such as A-weighting attempt to adjust sound measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the average human.
The term loudness could be applied to the measure of the amount of sound, and we often use the bel (commonly, the decibel) to measure sound. The decibel is actually a comparison of a sound level to another or to a standard. No better proof of the relative nature of the word loud can probably be found than that. Loudness is a subjective measure, which is often confused with objec … tive measures of sound prtessure such as decibels or sound intensity. Filters such as A-weighting attempt to adjust sound measurements to correspond to loudness as perceived by the average human.
Loudness, a subjective measure, is often confused with objective measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, sound pressure level (in decibels), sound intensity or sound power. A sound of constant SPL will be perceived to increase in loudness as samples of duration 20, 50, 100, 200 ms are heard, up to a duration of about 1 second at which point the perception of loudness will stabilize.
The benchmark threshold of hearing, in other words the smallest perceptible amplitude, is approximately 0.00002 N/m 2 for a 1 kHz tone in laboratory conditions (this is actually contradicted by loudness curves discussed below). Power is also proportional to amplitude squared, therefore power and intensity are proportional to each other. Decibels: While power is measured in watts, the most-used acoustic measurement for intensity is the decibel (dB) .

Amplitude is directly related to the acoustic energy or intensity of a sound. Both amplitude and intensity are related to sound's power. All three of these characteristics have their own related standardized measurements and will be discussed below. Amplitude is measured in the amount of force applied over an area. Power is also proportional to amplitude squared, therefore power and intensity are proportional to each other. Decibels: While power is measured in watts, the most-used acoustic measurement for intensity is the decibel (dB) .

Loudness is the characteristic of a sound that is primarily a psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). A sound of constant SPL will be perceived to increase in loudness as samples of duration 20, 50, 100, 200 ms are heard, up to a duration of about 1 second at which point the perception of loudness will stabilize.
Amplitude is the objective measurement of the degree of change (positive or negative) in atmospheric pressure (the compression and rarefaction of air molecules) caused by sound waves. Sounds with greater amplitude will produce greater changes in atmospheric pressure from high pressure to low pressure. Power is also proportional to amplitude squared, therefore power and intensity are proportional to each other. Decibels: While power is measured in watts, the most-used acoustic measurement for intensity is the decibel (dB) .
