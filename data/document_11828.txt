Reference Range. Vancomycin is an antibiotic drug used to treat serious, life-threatening infections by gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to less-toxic agents. The reference range for vancomycin trough levels is 10-20 µg/mL (15-20 µg/mL for complicated infections). The reference range for vancomycin peak levels is 25-50 µg/mL.
Vancomycin is used to treat colitis (inflammation of the intestine caused by certain bacteria) that may occur after antibiotic treatment. Vancomycin is in a class of medications called glycopeptide antibiotics. It works by killling bacteria in the intestines.
The vancomycin peak and trough represent two extremes in terms of the levels of concentration of this antibiotic in a patient's bloodstream. At the peak, large amounts are circulating, and at the trough, the levels fall very low.
This test is used to monitor levels of the antimicrobial drug vancomycin in the blood. When a person takes a dose of vancomycin, the amount in the blood rises for a period of time, peaks, and then begins to fall, usually reaching its lowest level, or trough, just before the next dose. The next dose is timed to coincide with the falling concentration of the drug
Interpretation. Vancomycin trough concentrations below 10 µg/mL are associated with inadequate therapy and an increased risk of developing bacterial resistance. Vancomycin trough concentrations above the therapeutic range may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.
