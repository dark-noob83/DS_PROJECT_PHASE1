Confidence votes 26. Ethidium bromide binds with DNA and slips in between its hydrophobic base pairs and stretches the DNA fragment, removing water molecules from the ethidium cation. The result of this dehydrogenation is an increase in fluorescence of the ethidium (as well as the cell). Hence it is useful in visualizing DNA. Unfortunately, ethidium bromide does not distinguish between what DNA it binds to, whether it be ours or our sample's. Hence ethidium bromide is a mutagen, suspected carcinogen and at high concentrations is irritating to the eyes, skin, mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract.
Ethidium Bromide Staining. The most commonly used stain for detecting DNA/RNA is ethidium bromide. Ethidium bromide is a DNA interchelator, inserting itself into the spaces between the base pairs of the double helix. Ethidium bromide possesses UV absorbance maxima at 300 and 360 nm. Ethidium bromide is a sensitive, easy stain for DNA. It yields low background and a detection limit of 1-5 ng /band. The major drawback to ethidium bromide is that it is a potent mutagen.

Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent commonly used as a fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) in molecular biology laboratories for techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis. It is commonly abbreviated as EtBr , which is also an abbreviation for bromoethane. Ethidium bromide is thought to act as a mutagen because it intercalates double stranded DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription.
Ethidium bromide intercalated between two adenine-thymine base pairs. The intercalation may cause mutation of DNA. Ethidium bromide is thought to act as a mutagen because it intercalates double stranded DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription.
Ethidium bromide is the most commonly used dye for DNA and RNA detection in gels. Ethidium bromide is a DNA intercalator, inserting itself between the base pairs in the double helix. Ethidium bromide has UV absorbance maxima at 300 and 360 nm, and an emission maximum at 590 nm. Uses of Ethidium Bromide. Although ethidium bromide is routinely used to stain DNA in gels, ethidium bromide has also been used to detect proteinâ€“DNA complexes in band shift assays and to observe single DNA molecules during gel electrophoresis.
Ethidium bromide is a molecule commonly used to visualize DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis experiments. It both binds to DNA and fluoresces under the proper conditions. Ethidium bromide is known as an intercalating agent. In this lesson, you will learn about the role that ethidium bromide, loading buffers, and DNA ladders play in visualizing DNA and determining the size of DNA fragments in agarose gel electrophoresis.
Ethidium bromide is an intercalcating dye, which means it inserts itself between the bases that are stacked in the center of the DNA helix. One ethidium bromide molecule binds to one base. As each dye molecule binds to the bases the helix is unwound to accommodate the strain from the dye. Closed circular DNA is constrained and cannot withstand as much twisting strain as can linear DNA, so circular DNA cannot bind as much dye as can linear DNA.
