The pancreas has 2 important jobs in the body. The first is to produce the pancreatic digestive juices. The second is to produce insulin and other hormones to do with digestion. The part of the pancreas which produces the digestive juices is called the exocrine pancreas.

The pancreas is a gland organ that is located in the abdomen. It is part of the digestive system and produces important enzymes and hormones that help break down foods.
The pancreas is an organ that sits in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach and plays a role in both the digestive and endocrine system. In the endocrine system, it is responsible for producing several hormones, such as insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide.
The pancreas produces chemicals that are crucial for blood sugar regulation and proper digestion. It is an abdominal gland, and is situated in the abdominal cavity, behind the stomach, close to the duodenum with its head pointed toward the small intestine. Both the exocrine and endocrine systems utilize this organ.
The pancreas is a small (5 to 6 inches) gland that produces insulin and enzymes used for digestion. Insulin regulates the use of blood sugar throughout the body and is therefo â€¦ re necessary for life. The pancreas also produces a fluid that neutralizes stomach acid.
The pancreas stretches across the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach and produces the body's supply of insulin and digestive enzymes. The insulin is essential for controlling blood sugar level. If the pancreas fails the person will have diabetes and have to rely on injected insulin.
