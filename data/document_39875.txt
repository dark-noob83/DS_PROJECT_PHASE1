4) Hair color is mixed on a 1 :1 ratio. Unless your hair is abundantly thick or you have more than six weeks regrowth, 1 ounce of peroxide mixed with 1 ounce of hair color is usually sufficient to cover new growth. Of course, if not, simply mix more. Tightly cap unused, unmixed hair color for your next application.
sadly you can not. If you put chemicals in your hair it is permanent and eventually it will fall out. ANSWER: After your hair color is mixed it oxidizes and after so many minutes it stops processing.
if you only use about half of a dye colour can you save it and how long will it save for its just its like 6quid and i use half n throw them away thanks! Follow.
that's it.. throw the rest away but if you mix half of the color and half of the developer use them on your hair and keep the remaining products tightly sealed, the unused products will be fine to use again within a few months if you see the color turn dark..
Report Abuse. Here's the difference: If it's a Semi-Permanent color that you DON'T have to mix (The ones that you open and slap on your hair without mixing like Manic Panic, Clairol's Loving Care, Jazzing, etc.) then YES, you can save the rest for later.
Depending on the dye.. after its mixed it has a life span of about 1 hour. Then the developer is done with its developing. So it will just be a waste. if you do a test strand.. put a drop or two of the color on a piece of tin foil... put a drop or two of developer on the tin foil and mix it together with a q tip.
