Skip this step if your eggs are very soft-boiled with runny yolks or if you're planning to dye your eggs for Easter. Place the eggs in a bowl of ice water. Fill a bowl with ice water. Transfer the eggs to the bowl and leave them there for at least 1 minute.
3 1/2 minutes will get you fully cooked whites, some of the yolk will be cooked to a soft, custard stage and some it will be warm and runny. 3 minutes, and you don't have any yolk firmness at all, which I feel is inferior. 4 minutes, and you're too close to hard boiled for my taste. And shock the in cool water right at the 3.5 mark, just long enough so they don't burn your hands when you pick them up. Soft boiled eggs are probably my favorite.
For a soft-boiled egg, lower the egg into gently boiling water with a slotted spoon. Allow three and a half minutes for a medium-sized egg and four minutes for a large egg. The yolk will be runny and the white just set. Cook for a further minute if you like your soft boiled eggs a little firmer. For a hard-boiled egg, start the egg in cold water and bring up to the boil. Once the water is gently boiling, set the timer for between 7-10 minutes depending on how well cooked you like your eggs. The longer you boil the egg, the firmer it will be.
Cook the eggs for 5 to 7 minutes: For 1 to 2 eggs, cook 5 minutes for a very runny yolk or up to 7 minutes for a barely-set yolk. For 3 or 4 eggs, add a few extra seconds to your timing. (For more than 4 eggs, cook in batches.) Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon. Run under cold tap water for 30 to 60 seconds.
Put eggs in a pan of cold water (the water should at least cover the eggs), bring to boil, and boil for 3-5 minutes (depending on the size of the eggs). 4 minutes on a medium â€¦ boil is about right for a medium sized soft boiled egg.
