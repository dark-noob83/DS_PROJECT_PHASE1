RDW is the abbreviation for red blood cell distribution width.. According to Lab Tests Online, RDW calculates the varying sizes of red blood cell (RBC) volume in a blood sample. An RDW test is usually performed as part of a CBC, or complete blood count.
RDW stands for the red blood cell distribution width. This is a standard reported measure on a complete blood count (CBC) lab test. It measures the variability in red blood cell size. In the normal state, red blood cells are continually being produced and removed from the blood at a steady rate.
77 Followers. A. RDW stands for the red blood cell distribution width. This is a standard reported measure on a complete blood count (CBC) lab test. It measures the variability in red blood cell size. In the normal state, red blood cells are continually being produced and removed from the blood at a steady rate.
RDW is elevated in accordance with variation in red cell size (anisocytosis), ie, when elevated RDW is reported on complete blood count, marked anisocytosis (increased variation in red cell size) is expected on peripheral blood smear review.
The red blood cell distribution width (“RDW”) test is normally done when the complete blood count is ordered by the health practitioner. The RDW test measures the variations in size of red blood cells.
Red cell distribution width (RDW) laboratory test is a part of a standard complete blood count (CBC), and it is used along with other RBC indices, especially mean corpuscular volume (MCV) to help determine the causes of anemia.
