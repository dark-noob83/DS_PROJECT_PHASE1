While phonemes can be associated with several graphemes, the reverse is also true: the same spelling can be associated with more than one sound. In this tutorial we look at how easy it is to work with the full array of grapheme-phoneme correspondences using the phonic toolkit. 
Hanna, Paul R.; And Others. This study sought to analyze phoneme/grapheme correspondences in a 17,310-entry word list drawn from the Thorndike-Lorge word list and Merriam-Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary.

Knowing a GPC means being able to match a phoneme to a grapheme and vice versa. Digraph-A grapheme containing two letters that makes just one sound (phoneme). Trigraph-A grapheme containing three letters that makes just one sound (phoneme). Oral Blending-This involves hearing phonemes and being able to merge them together to make a word
