Usually, no. Alcohol doesnâ€™t reduce the effectiveness of most antibiotics. However, alcohol can worsen side effects caused by some antibiotics, like dizziness or an upset stomach. You should definitely avoid drinking alcohol while taking metronidazole (Flagyl), as this combination can cause severe nausea and vomiting.
Although it is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol when taking any medication; it is unlikely that drinking alcohol, in moderation, will cause problems if you are taking most common antibiotics.
So check the label and avoid such products while taking these antibiotics. Although alcohol doesn't reduce the effectiveness of most antibiotics, it can reduce your energy and delay how quickly you recover from illness. So, it's a good idea to avoid alcohol until you finish your antibiotics and are feeling better. With. James M. Steckelberg, M.D. 1  Triclosan.
Some antibiotics have a variety of side effects, such as causing nausea and dizziness, which might be made worse by drinking alcohol. It's best to avoid drinking alcohol while feeling unwell anyway, as the alcohol itself can make you feel worse. Both metronidazole and tinidazole can cause drowsiness.
In general, drinking moderate amounts of alcohol when you're taking antibiotics doesn't lessen their effectiveness. But since both alcohol and antibiotics can lead to upset stomach, dizziness and drowsiness, the combination can amplify these side effects.
