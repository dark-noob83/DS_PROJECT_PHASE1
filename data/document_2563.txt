For people without diabetes, the normal range for the hemoglobin A1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes, and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes. 
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter. If your hemoglobin level is lower than normal, you have anemia. There are many forms of anemia, each with different causes, which can include: 1  Iron deficiency. 2  Vitamin B-12 deficiency. 3  Folate
Hemoglobin level less than the lower range value for age (In general normal hemoglobin levels are 1-2 g/dL lower in women and African American men than in white men). 
For older men, this hemoglobin value would be 132 g/L (13.2 g/dL). The corresponding value for women of all ages would be 122 g/L (12.2 g/dL). As shown in Table 1 and in a number of previous studies, the lower limit of normal of hemoglobin concentrations of African Americans are appreciably lower. Lower limits of normal of hemoglobin concentration of the blood of adult men and women as assessed by various sources. The differences in the stated lower limits of normal may seem small, but in their application they are far from trivial.
Low hemoglobin means that a person's hemoglobin level when measured, is below the lowest limits of normal for their age and sex (see above normal range of values). For example, a 19 year old male would have low hemoglobin if the detected blood value was below 13.6 g/dl. 
Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together. 
Normal hemoglobin values are related to the person's age and sex. Normal values may vary slightly between test systems, and which groups of doctors have determined normal values for their group of patients; however, the value ranges are close (vary by about 0.5 g/dl) for almost every group. An example of normal ranges that is widely accepted by Family Practice physicians is as follows: 1  Birth: 13.5 to 24.0 g/dl (mean 16.5 g/dl). 2  Age 1-2 months: 10.0 to 18.0 g/dl (mean 11.2 g/dl). 3  Age 2-6 months: 9.5 to 14.0 g/dl (mean 12.6 g/dl).
If it gets more severe and causes symptoms, your low hemoglobin count may indicate you have anemia. A low hemoglobin count is generally defined as less than 13.5 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter (135 grams per liter) of blood for men and less than 12 grams per deciliter (120 grams per liter) for women. In children, the definition varies with age and sex. A low hemoglobin count is a commonly seen blood test result. Hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb) is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. In many cases, a low hemoglobin count is only slightly lower than normal and doesn't affect how you feel
Normal hemoglobin levels are different in women and in men. In non-pregnant women, normal hemoglobin ranges from 120 g/L to 160 g/L. In men, normal hemoglobin levels range from 140 g/L to 180 g/L. Canadian Blood Services tests each donorâ€™s hemoglobin at the clinic and requires a minimum of 125 g/L for donatio
