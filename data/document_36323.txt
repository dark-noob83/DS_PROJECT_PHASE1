Wheel bearings will greatly vary with what type of vehicle you have, but to give a rough estimate, about $60-130 for the bearing and roughly an hour of mechanic labor at $40-70/hour depending on the shop. I suggest http://mibearings.com for the part. Good Luck!
$200 for a drive wheel bearing. Much cheaper if it is a non drive wheel which you can do yourself easily by buying the bearing for $80 and with some basic tools. Ehow. Squeeking sounds more like a suspension strut to me.
