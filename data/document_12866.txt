Elevations along the eastern border of Colorado range from about 3,350 feet at the lowest point in the State where the Arkansas River crosses into Kansas to near 4,000 feet. Elevations increase towards the west to between 5,000 and 6,500 feet where the plains meet the Front Range of the Rocky Mountain chain. Western Colorado winter weather is colder but calmer and less variable than east of the mountains. Temperatures can drop below zero F in all areas of western Colorado, but the valleys of west central and southwest Colorado receive abundant sunshine and the winter climate is not harsh.

Weather. The biggest surprise for visitors to Denver is the climate. The arid conditions bring only 8 to 15 inches of annual precipitation and locals wake up to more than 300 days of sunshine a year. That’s more annual hours of sun than Miami and San Diego. In summer, Denver enjoys low relative humidity, making for beautiful, sun-filled days and cool, comfortable evenings. The average daily high temperature in August is a mild 86 degrees Fahrenheit. The mild weather is due in part to the city's altitude: 5,280 feet above sea level, or exactly a mile high.
The highest temperatures in Colorado occur in the Arkansas Valley and lower elevations of South Platte and Republican Rivers. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 114°F at Las Animas in July 1, 1933 and at Sedgwick on July 11, 1954. Because of the very low relative humidity accompanying these high temperatures, hot days cause less discomfort than in more humid areas. Western Colorado winter weather is colder but calmer and less variable than east of the mountains. Temperatures can drop below zero F in all areas of western Colorado, but the valleys of west central and southwest Colorado receive abundant sunshine and the winter climate is not harsh.
