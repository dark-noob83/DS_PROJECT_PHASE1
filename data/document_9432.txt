disease. Modern humans (or homo sapiens) emerged out of the “hominid” group almost two million years ago, and began wandering out of Africa about 70,000 years ago to populate the world. The group analysed the DNA sequences of 259 TB strains from around the world, and showed that genetic diversity arose in them roughly around 70,000 years ago, concurrent with the outward migration from Africa of anatomically modern humans.
In the 21st century it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as foxes and bats, but it is one of the oldest known virus diseases: rabies is a Sanskrit word (rabhas) that dates from 3000 BC, which means madness or rage, and the disease has been known for over 4000 years. Viruses of plants and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as potyviruses of potatoes and rinderpest of cattle had devastating consequences. Smallpox and measles viruses are among the oldest that infect humans. Having evolved from viruses that infected other animals, they first appeared in humans in Europe and North Africa thousands of years ago
Scurvy. Scurvy is a disease caused by a vitamin C deficiency. Symptoms of scurvy include weakness, anemia, gum disease, and bleeding from the mucus membranes. The disease was once common among sailors who were at sea for long periods without access to fresh fruit. Measles. Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. Early symptoms include fever, cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. During the first few days, the characteristic measles rash appears, beginning with white spots in the mouth and spreading to a red rash that covers the entire body.
Epidemics caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the Neolithic period, around 12,000 years ago, when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities. This allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become endemic. Viruses of plants and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as potyviruses of potatoes and rinderpest of cattle had devastating consequences. Smallpox and measles viruses are among the oldest that infect humans.

tuberculosis. Modern humans (or homo sapiens) emerged out of the “hominid” group almost two million years ago, and began wandering out of Africa about 70,000 years ago to populate the world. The group analysed the DNA sequences of 259 TB strains from around the world, and showed that genetic diversity arose in them roughly around 70,000 years ago, concurrent with the outward migration from Africa of anatomically modern humans.
Of the many diseases of humans that were found to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated. The diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to be more difficult to control. Other diseases, such as those caused by arboviruses, are presenting new challenges. Viruses of plants and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as potyviruses of potatoes and rinderpest of cattle had devastating consequences. Smallpox and measles viruses are among the oldest that infect humans.

Influenza, more commonly known as “the flu,” is caused by a contagious virus. Symptoms include body aches, sore throat, headache, fever, coughing, and chills. Perhaps because influenza is so common, misconceptions about the disease abound. Measles. Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. Early symptoms include fever, cough, red eyes, and a runny nose. During the first few days, the characteristic measles rash appears, beginning with white spots in the mouth and spreading to a red rash that covers the entire body.
AIDS. Modern humans (or homo sapiens) emerged out of the “hominid” group almost two million years ago, and began wandering out of Africa about 70,000 years ago to populate the world. The group analysed the DNA sequences of 259 TB strains from around the world, and showed that genetic diversity arose in them roughly around 70,000 years ago, concurrent with the outward migration from Africa of anatomically modern humans.
This is because these diseases require a level of population density that didn't develop until humans began living in cities. Influenza, measles and the plague are social. Malaria isn't. We've listed 10 of the oldest known diseases, listed in no particular order. On the next page, we'll get started with a condition that thrives in close quarters. Another source for dating diseases is genomic data, said Dr. Charlotte Roberts, archaeologist at the University of Durham and author of the book The Archaeology of Disease.. DNA testing of samples from mummies and skeletons can conclusively identify disease.
