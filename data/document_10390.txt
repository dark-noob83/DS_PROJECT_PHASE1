if the earth was on the same side of the sun as neptune at its maximum distance from the sun ie its nearest distance to neptune and neptune was also at its minimum distance from the sun ie its nearest distance to earth the minimum distance of neptune from earth would be 4298 million km or 4 298 billion km
9 au which will be closer to the sun than pluto neptune s average distance from the sun is 30 1 au therefore depending upon where each planet is in its respective orbit the distance could be anywhere from about 1 billion kilometers to over 19 billion km
how long it would take to get to neptune from earth would depend on the path chosen and on where neptune and earth were in their orbits when the mission was launched for example the voyager 2 spacecraft was launched on aug 20 1977 and it reached neptune on aug 24 1989
the average distance of neptune from the sun is 2795084800 miles or 4498252900 kilometers because its orbit is elliptical its distance from the sun changes depending on where it is in its orbit
therefore if the earth was on the opposite side of the sun from neptune at its maximum distance from the sun and neptune was also at its maximum distance from the sun the maximum distance of neptune from earth would be 4702 million km or 4 702 billion km
secondly earth is at aphelion and neptune is at aphelion but in conjunction diametrically opposite the earth on the other side of the sun in this case the separation will be 4553946490 km 152097701 km or 4706044191 km this is 0 0004974 of a light year the furthest possible
firstly earth is furthest from the sun aphelion 152097701 km and neptune is in opposition directly opposite the sun in the sky so that the earth is exactly between the sun and neptune and nearest to the sun perihelion 4452940833 km
when the earth is on the same side of the sun as neptune the distance to neptune is shorter than the distance when the earth is on the opposite side of the sun from neptune the distance also changes because both planets revolve round the sun in ellipses so their distance from the sun varies
for example the planet venus is about 42 million kilometers 26 million miles from earth at its closest point and about 258 million kilometers 160 million miles away at its most distant point
the average distance to the moon is 384399 kilometres 4 06318742 10 8 light years note the minus the moon is only a tiny fraction of one light year from earth it ta kes light from the sun eight minutes to reach earth and the moon is much closer to earth than the sun
