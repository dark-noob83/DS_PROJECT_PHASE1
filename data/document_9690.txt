Oral antibiotics (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime) are used for Lyme arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. (In rare cases, patients with arthritis may need intravenous antibiotics.). A 2 - 4 week course of intravenous ceftriaxone is used for treating severe cases of neurological Lyme disease.

People treated with antibiotics in the early stages of a Lyme disease infection usually recover rapidly and completely. Antibiotic treatment can range from 14 to 28 days. A few people, particularly those who are first diagnosed with later stages of the disease, may have persistent or recurrent symptoms.
