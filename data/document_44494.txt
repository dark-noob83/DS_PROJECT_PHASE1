The normal costing figure of $12,360 is less than the variation of normal costing (based on budgeted rates for direct costs) figure of $12,600, because the actual direct-cost rate ($58) is less than the budgeted direct-cost rate ($60).

250,000. The budgeted overhead rate = $3,600,000 600,000 direct labor hours = $6.00 per direct labor hour. In practice, the factory would track costs by batch, or perhaps weekly, but to simplify our example, we record only one journal entry for each type of transaction. In fact, 500,000 direct labor hours were used: 200,000 for jeans, and 300,000 for chinos. The average direct labor wage rate was the same on both assembly lines, and was $14 per hour. Denim fabric is used to make jeans, and chinos are made from a cotton twill fabric. Overhead is allocated using direct labor hours.

During March, the job-cost record for Job 626 contained the following information: Direct materials used $40,000 Direct manufacturing labor costs $30,000 Compute the cost of Job 626 using (a) actual costing and (b) normal costing.
Normal costing is used to derive the cost of a product. This approach applies actual direct costs to a product, as well as a standard overhead rate. It includes the following components: 1  Actual cost of materials. 2  Actual cost of labor. 
Direct labor-hours: 900 1,010. Direct materials and direct labor are paid for on a contract basis. The costs of each are known when direct materials are used or when direct labor-hours are worked. The 2007 actual assembly-support costs were $6,888,000, and the actual direct labor-hours were 164,000. 
At the end of 2016, the balance of raw materials is $50,000, work in process is $125,000, finished goods is $75,000, and cost of goods sold is $800,000. a. Fabulous uses a normal costing system. Overheard is allocated on the basis of direct labor hours. 14. Benny Company allocates overhead at $4 per direct labor dollar. Job 52 required 6 cases of direct materials at a cost of $6 per case and took employees of 5 hours to complete. Employees earn $10 per hour.
Tracking Your Actual Costs. Tracking your costs involves calculating the actual costs of the direct materials, direct labor and factory overhead. For example, it takes $2 of direct materials and 4 labor hours at $10 per hour, or $40, to produce one completed unit at $42 per unit. The actual indirect costs are $1 per unit. Your total actual cost per unit is $43. If you produce 10,000 units, your actual manufacturing costs are 10,000 multiplied by $43, or $430,000.
Costs of Job 626 under actual and normal costing follow: Actual Normal Costing Costing Direct materials $ 40,000 $ 40,000 Direct manufacturing labor costs 30,000 30,000 Manufacturing overhead costs $30,000 × 1.90; $30,000 × 1.80 57,000 54,000 Total manufacturing costs of Job 626 $127,000 $124,000. 3. Laguna Model Mission Model Normal costing Direct costs Direct materials Direct labor Indirect costs Assembly support ($50 × 900; $50 × 1,010) Total costs $106,450 36,276 142,726 45,000$187,726 $127,604 41,410 169,014 50,500$219,5142b.
Divide the $40,000 costs by the 20,000 units produced to get your normal factory overhead cost of $2 per unit. If your actual direct materials are $5 per unit, the actual direct labor is $8 per unit and the normal factor overhead is $2 per unit, it costs you $15 to manufacture one unit. Since your normal costs remain fixed, any unusual price change is the result of higher direct materials or direct labor costs. For example, it takes $2 of direct materials and 4 labor hours at $10 per hour, or $40, to produce one completed unit at $42 per unit. The actual indirect costs are $1 per unit. Your total actual cost per unit is $43. If you produce 10,000 units, your actual manufacturing costs are 10,000 multiplied by $43, or $430,000.
