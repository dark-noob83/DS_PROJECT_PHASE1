Teppanyaki (鉄板焼き, teppan-yaki) is a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food. The word teppanyaki is derived from teppan (鉄板), which means iron plate, and yaki (焼き), which means grilled, broiled, or pan-fried. In Japan, teppanyaki refers to dishes cooked using an iron plate, including steak, shrimp, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, and monjayaki. 
History [edit]. It is not known when the hibachi was first used in Japan. However, written records suggest that it was in use by the Heian period (794–1185 AD). The hibachi (Japanese: 火鉢, lit. fire bowl) is a traditional Japanese heating device. It consists of a round, cylindrical or a box-shaped open-topped container, made from or lined with a heatproof material and designed to hold burning charcoal.
