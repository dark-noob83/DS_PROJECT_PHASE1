Recently, I filed my 1040X and I used TurboTax Online. I have to say amending tax return with TurboTax is really as easy as 1,2,3. I just logged in my account and click on “Amend Your Tax Return” for 2014 and it will guide you through the process. For me, my case was easy. My son was born on December 2014.
How long will it take to process my amended tax return? A Form 1040X-Amended Tax Return can take up to 16 weeks to process once the IRS receives it. It can take up to three (3) weeks from the date you mailed it to show up in our system. Unfortunately, calling us will not help us process your return more quickly.
1 As a rule, you must file your 1040X within three years from the date you filed your return, or two years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. 2  How long does it take to get an amended return processed? 3  Normally, amended returns will be processed in 8 to 12 weeks.
An Amended return can ONLY be MAILED, not efiled. So if you think you efiled it, you didn't. An amended return will take 8-12 weeks to process and they only mail checks for refunds, no direct deposit. Comments (10). i clicked the amend on turbotax and it says it was accepted.
As a reminder, amended returns take up to 16 weeks to process and up to three weeks to show up in our system. Before that time, there is no need to call the IRS unless the tool specifically tells you to do so. Please note: A change made on your federal return may affect your state tax liability.
