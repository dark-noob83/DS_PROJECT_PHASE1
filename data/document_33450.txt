Laurel wilt is a fungal disease of plants in the Laurel family that is carried from tree to tree by a small beetle called the redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus).
Mushrooms. Oak root fungus, or white rot, is a widespread disease that becomes visible just beneath the bark and on roots. What looks like layers of light brown to tan mushrooms form in clusters at the base of the trees. Pleurotus ostreatus is a heartwood and sapwood killer that enters trees through wounds.
Shelf-like mushrooms are usually the only sign a tree is infected with inner decay diseases. Mushrooms or mushroom-like structures growing on the trunk or root area give you the most obvious signs that a tree is suffering from a fungal disease or internal decay.
Lichens are a common site on branches of trees and shrubs. Seeing lichens can be an unusual site because it looks like a strange organism is taking over the plant. It is often thought that lichens are a fungus or disease that is damaging the plant but in reality that is not the case. Lichens are unique organisms. It is a fungus and algae combined to live together. Although lichens really do not look like a fungus or algae both work together so that lichens can survive.
Most of the time the fungus is not lethal to the tree, however, the redbay ambrosia beetle carries a fungus that is pathogenic, or capable of causing disease, to the trees. When the beetle bores into the wood they easily infect the tree with their fungus.
