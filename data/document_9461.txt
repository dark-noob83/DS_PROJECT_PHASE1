As a spatial hypermedia system, KMS was intended to represent all forms of explicit 'knowledge artifacts' such as presentations, documents, databases, and software programs, as well as common forms of electronic communication.
To qualify for KMS activation, a network must meet the activation threshold: KMS hosts activate client computers only after meeting this threshold. To ensure that the activation threshold is met, a KMS host counts the number of computers that are requesting activation on the network.
When planning for KMS activation, the network must meet or exceed the activation threshold, or the minimum number of qualifying computers that KMS requires. You must also understand how the KMS host tracks the number of computers on the network.
kms. It stands for kill me silently, usually said after hearing a cringe-worthy joke. It basically represents how unhappy the person is and shows that you should end their life before this moment of happiness and ignorance to life and death dissipates. Silently being the operative word.
