Levels of vibration are typically considered as a function of magnitude (g-force), frequency (Hz) and duration of exposure (time). One “g” is equal to earth’s gravitational field, or an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second per second.
A complete assessment of exposure to vibration requires the measurement of vibration acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s 2). Vibration exposure direction is also important and is measured in a well-defined directions. Vibration frequencies and duration of exposure are also determined.
HARMONICS A characteristic of energy generated by a vibration is that there will be a number of frequencies appearing up the frequency spectrum at multiples of the fundamental frequency. These are called Harmonics. The fundamental frequency is also the first harmonic.
The whole universe is vibration in one form or another. The things that we see and experience in our daily lives are all vibrations in some ways. When there is a vibration, there will be the speed, frequency and wavelength in which we can attribute to the oscillation of the vibration. Knowing that there can be no end to the different speed in which a vibration can vibrate, we can deduce that the universe is infinite in size.
Exposure tovertical vibrations in the 5-10 Hz range generally causes resonance in the thoracic-abdominal system, at 20-30Hz in the head-neck-shoulder system, and at 60-90 Hz in the eyeball. When vibrations are attenuated in thebody, its energy is absorbed by the tissue and organs. The muscles are important in this respect. Vibrationleads to both voluntary and involuntary contractions of muscles, and can cause local muscle fatigue,particularly when the vibration is at the resonant-frequency level.
The low-intensity vibration signal delivered by LivMD is considered safe for up to 4 hours of exposure per day according to the International Safety Organization threshold for human tolerance of vibration, ISO 2631.
