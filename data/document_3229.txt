1 Stir in the sugar, a teaspoonful at a time. 2  Keep adding sugar until it starts to accumulate at the bottom of the container and won't dissolve even with more stirring. 3  This means your sugar solution is saturated. 4  If you don't use a saturated solution, then your crystals won't grow quickly.
The white stuff we know as sugar is sucrose, a molecule composed of 12 atoms of carbon, 22 atoms of hydrogen, and 11 atoms of oxygen (C12H22O11). Like all compounds made from these three elements, sugar is a carbohydrate. Its found naturally in most plants, but especially in sugarcane and sugar beetshence their names.
The chemical elements that a crystal is made of are what tell the crystal what shape it will be. A crystal of salt is a different shape than a crystal of sugar (do the Salt vs. Sugar project to see for yourself!) because they are both formed from different elements.
It's easy to grow your own sugar crystals! Sugar crystals are also known as rock candy since the crystallized sucrose (table sugar) resembles rock crystals and because you can eat your finished product. You can grow beautiful clear sugar crystals with sugar and water or you can add food coloring to get colored crystals. It's simple, safe, and fun.
What a crystal is made of actually depends on what kind of crystal it is -- for example, salt, sugar, and snowflakes are actually formed out of different kinds of crystals! Snowflakes are made from crystals formed by frozen water.
It depends on what the crystals are being made from.   Ice is a crystal made up of water (hydrogen and oxygen)   Quartz is a crystal made up of silica and oxygen   Py â€¦ rite (fools gold) is a crystal made from iron and sulfur.
