what it is lactate dehydrogenase also called lactic acid dehydrogenase or ldh is an enzyme found in almost all body tissues it plays an important role in cellular respiration the process by which glucose sugar from food is converted into usable energy for our cells 
in order to know what is ldh blood test one would need knowledge about what does ldh mean ldh is known by various names ld lactatic dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase ldh isoenzymes or total ldh ldh consisting of five molecular forms of ldh is an enzyme found in all cells and tissues of the body this enzyme is released into the blood once there is trauma or damage to a tissue or organ an ldh blood test is performed to detect and determine the extent of tissue disease or damage to the brain kidney muscles liver and lungs it is performed in case of bone fractures anemia and cancers this test can be called for if the doctor wants to ascertain or rule out organ disease or damage
ldh is the short form for the lactate dehydrogenase test this test is typically used as a measure of tissue damage in an individual it may be used to measure acute tissue damage which has occurred due to a recent illness or injury lactate dehydrogenase also known as ldh is an enzyme that is found in nearly all body tissues ldh is responsible for creating energy from glucose for cells normal levels of ldh range from 105 and 333 iu liter
ldh or lactic acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme that is found in almost all tissue in the body it is responsible for converting glucose derived from food into energy cells then use this energy in order to function properly normal ldh levels in the blood range from 140 iu liter to 333 iu liter lactate dehydrogenase also known as ldh is an enzyme that is found in nearly all body tissues ldh is responsible for creating energy from glucose for cells normal levels of ldh range from 105 and
a lactate dehydrogenase ldh or ld is an enzyme found in nearly all living cells animals plants and prokaryotes ldh catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and back as it converts nadh to nad and back 
definition the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase also known as lactic dehydrogenase or ldh is found in the cells of almost all body tissues the enzyme is especially concentrated in the heart liver red blood cells kidneys muscles brain and lungs 
test levels ldh is normally contained within the body cells and hardly detectable in the blood after a tissue damage ldh level increases in the blood if the ldh level is uncommonly high then the doctor will call for ldh blood test to identify organs that have been affected this enzyme is released into the blood once there is trauma or damage to a tissue or organ an ldh blood test is performed to detect and determine the extent of tissue disease or damage to the brain kidney muscles liver and lungs it is performed in case of bone fractures anemia and cancers
lactate dehydrogenase ldh is an enzyme that helps facilitate the process of turning sugar into energy for your cells to use ldh is present in many kinds of organs and tissues throughout the body including the liver heart pancreas kidneys skeletal muscles brain and blood cells when illness or injury damages your cells ldh may be released into the bloodstream causing the level of ldh in your blood to rise there are five different forms of ldh and they are distinguished by slight differences in their structure each form of the ldh enzyme is called an isoenzyme the isoenzymes of ldh are ldh 1 ldh 2 ldh 3 ldh 4 and ldh 5
testing ldh levels if your ldh levels are tested the doctor will take a blood sample from your finger toe heel arm or earlobe the blood is then sent to a lab and put into a machine called a centrifuge this machine separates the blood cells from the liquid or serum ldh levels are measured from the serum
