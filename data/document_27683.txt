So the second decade of the twenty-first century, if you want to use the term “second decade,” might begin either in the 2010 or 2011; my sense is that actual usage is mixed on this. The first decade of the 21st century, therefore, consists of the years 2001 through 2010, no matter how many “Decade in Review” essays, roundups, recaps, and slideshows you’re being bombarded with as 2009 comes to an end.
According to the calendar, because there is no 0 year, the new decade just started January 1, 2011. Common use of the word decade, because we refer to the decade of the 80's or 90's, the new decade starts on January 1 of the decade that is being referred to. This is because it is illogical to say the decade of the 80's doesn't include 1980 but does include 1990. So, if you like the common use of the word decade, instead of the calendar use, the new decade will start on January 1, 2020.
Well, it all depends on which decade you’re speaking of. Let’s begin with centuries. We’ve set up our BC and AD dating system so there’s no year zero, presumably because back when they were set up, the concept of “zero” as a number was not well-established in Europe. The first decade of the 21st century, therefore, consists of the years 2001 through 2010, no matter how many “Decade in Review” essays, roundups, recaps, and slideshows you’re being bombarded with as 2009 comes to an end.
The focus of Wilson's attention in Fences is Troy, a 53-year-old head of household who struggles with providing for his family. The fence referred to by the play's title is revealed to be finished in the final act of the play, and Bono has bought his wife a refrigerator as he promised Troy he would do if he finished building it.
This resulted in enactment in 2006 of the Secure Fence Act which mandated the expansion of border fencing by 700 miles with a focus on Arizona’s and California’s border with Mexico. This focus on the increased need for border security also led to a major increase in Border Patrol staffing. 
Fences is a 1983 play by American playwright August Wilson. Set in the 1950s, it is the sixth in Wilson's ten-part  Pittsburgh Cycle . Like all of the Pittsburgh plays, Fences explores the evolving African-American experience and examines race relations, among other themes. The play won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the 1987 Tony Award for Best Play. The fence referred to by the play's title is revealed to be finished in the final act of the play, and Bono has bought his wife a refrigerator as he promised Troy he would do if he finished building it.
If you have 1432 feet of fence that must be strung out in a straight line A fence post must be placed for every 4 feet of fence so how many fence posts will be needed? 1432 divided by 4 equals 358, which is the number of 4-foot sections of fence. 
Best Answer: Consider the first year of the decade to be 1. There is no 0 to start. So the full ten years would end in this decade for example on 12/31/10. 
The first decade of the 1st century ran from Year 1 through Year 10. The first decade of the 21st century, therefore, consists of the years 2001 through 2010, no matter how many “Decade in Review” essays, roundups, recaps, and slideshows you’re being bombarded with as 2009 comes to an end.
Wilson has taken upon himself the responsibility to write a play about black experiences in the United States for every decade of the 20th century. Only two decades remain, the first years of the century and the 1990's. Fences is his play about blacks in the 1950's. Beginning in 1957, between the Korean and Vietnam wars, Fences ends in 1965, but the themes of the play directly place its consciousness in a pre-civil-rights-movement, pre-Vietnam-war-era psyche. August Wilson was named Frederick August Kittel when he was born to a German father and an African American mother in 1945. Wilson was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. His father drifted in an out of his family. His mother and a stepfather, David Bedford, mostly raised Wilson.
