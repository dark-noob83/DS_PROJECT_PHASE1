The aims are to begin the collection of baseline/foundational thermal processing data and subsequent generation of thermal processing food safety knowledge and tools to contribute to thermal processing food safety. One method to understand the lethality effect caused by thermal processing while also taking into consideration the various peripheral elements of lethality is to utilize D-and z-values.
Overview. The processing of foods by heat (or heat treatment) is the most important conservation technique of long duration. It aims to destroy or partially or totally inhibit enzymes and microorganisms, whose presence or proliferation could alter the food in question or make it unfit for human consumption. The heat sterilization involves exposing food to a temperature generally exceeding 100 ° C for a period sufficient to inhibit enzymes and all forms of microorganisms, including bacteria spore. Sterilization of a food is not sufficient in itself for its long-term conservation.
Definition. Thermal processing is a food sterilization technique in which the food is heated at a temperature high enough to destroy microbes and enzymes. The specific amount of time required depends upon the specific food and the growth habits of the enzymes or microbes. The primary purpose of thermal processing is to destroy potential toxins in food. The process does have limitations and its application must be carefully overseen by an authority who understands the importance of variables in regulating thermal processing.
Amanda King is a graduate student completing her Ph.D. in meat science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Her research has focused on improving the safety of alternatively cured meats and thermal processing food safety. One method to understand the lethality effect caused by thermal processing while also taking into consideration the various peripheral elements of lethality is to utilize D-and z-values.
Given thermal processing’s importance for producing safe, high-quality meat and poultry products, the need for a critical understanding and appropriate application of thermal processing cannot be emphasized enough. One method to understand the lethality effect caused by thermal processing while also taking into consideration the various peripheral elements of lethality is to utilize D-and z-values.
In general, the point of thermal processing is to kill pathogens and inactivate enzymes that cause negative changes to the food during storage. The most common type of thermal processing is the kind that happens in the kitchen at mealtime. Even the most domestically challenged among us have heated something in the microwave and have therefore thermally processed something. Pasteurization constitutes one of the milder forms of thermal processing. Ultra-high temperature and sterilization methods kill all microorganisms in the food, while milder heat treatments like thermization and pasteurization only kill some of them. The answer is that higher temperatures change the characteristics of the food. Since milk is what most people think of in relation to pasteurization, we'll use the pasteurization of milk throughout the rest of this article to show how pasteurization works.

The basic purpose for the thermal processing of foods is to reduce or destroy microbial activity, reduce or destroy enzyme activity and to produce physical or chemical changes to make the food meet a certain quality standard. e.g. gelatenization of starch & denaturation of proteins to produce edible food.

Thermal processing is a commercial technique used to sterilize food through the use of high temperatures. The primary purpose of thermal processing is to destroy potential toxins in food. The process does have limitations and its application must be carefully overseen by an authority who understands the importance of variables in regulating thermal processing.
