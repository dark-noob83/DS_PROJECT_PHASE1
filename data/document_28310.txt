If you adopt a U.S. child that a state has determined to have special needs, you are eligible for the maximum amount of credit or exclusion for the year the adoption is final, even if you did not pay qualified adoption expenses.
Child support is money paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent, and may be paid either directly, through wage deductions or through a state agency. Support is considered a right of the child and child support awards aren't arbitrary.
In response to that claim, can I file an action to reduce my child support obligation? Unless your ex spouse consents, you cannot file a claim for modification of child support under the same case number as the contempt action, and you would have to file a separate action for modification in the appropriate court.
Resolved Question: I live in MN and if you have a non joint child it lowers your child support pymt. I provide all financial needs to my stepchildren as their father doesn''t pay child support and is not in their lives. If I adopt them will I my child support pymt to my ex-wife be lowered. Submitted: 7 years ago.
YES, your child support payment to your ex-wife will be lowered (assuming your adoption of your stepchildren is the only change in the factual and financial circumstances on which the existing child support calculation was made).
Tips & Warnings. If the other child's parent agrees to reduced support payments, you may be able to sign a joint agreement and submit it to the court. However, because support is a right of children, it will be up to the judge to determine whether the reduction is reasonable.
