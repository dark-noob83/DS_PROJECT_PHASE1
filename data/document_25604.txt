Most earthworms native to North America are thought to be extinct. The two most common species of earthworms in the USA are the common earthworm (nightcrawler) and the red earthworm (Lumbricus rubellus). These earthworms were introduced from Europe during colonial times through soil in potted plants.
If an earthworm population gets too large in one place, many will seek a new location when they can. The two most common species of earthworms in Northern Virginia are the Common Earthworm, or nightcrawler (Lumbricus terrestris) and the Red Earthworm (Lumbricus rubellus). These earthworms were introduced from Europe many years ago.
In the Great Lakes region, there is only one anecic species of earthworm, the common night crawler (Lumbricus terrestris). This very large, pigmented species, Lumbricus terrestris, is by far the most common earthworm sold for fishing bait across the Great Lakes region.

Endogeic earthworms are the most common earthworm species found in New Zealand. Their niche is the top 20 cm depth of soil. Endogeic earthworms eat large amounts of soil and the organic matter in it, although species sometimes come to the surface to search for food. They form shallow semi-permanent burrows.
The common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) is an abundant species, which has an important role in the aeration and fertilisation of soil.
The common earthworm is an abundant species, which has an important role in the aeration and fertilisation of soil (3). It is the largest British earthworm (5) and has a reddish-brown back, a yellowish underside and an often prominent orange-red 'saddle' region known as the 'clitellum', close to the reproductive organs.
