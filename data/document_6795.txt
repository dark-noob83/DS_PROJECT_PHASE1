therefore it's a good idea to use [math.h]. and in general, for such header pairs, to use the [.h] version. I would disagree. The only reason the .h versions exist is for compatibility. The C headers are listed under [depr.c.headers] for a reason. 9. @Jesse: the argument goes that if you include math.h, then you know you're dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace. If you include cmath then you may or may not be dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace.
They are C++ standard library headers. The headers are headers defined by the C standard library: The C++ standard library also makes available the facilities of the C standard library, suitably adjusted to ensure static type safety. The C++ headers, for the most part, have content identical to the corresponding C library headers except that the names are all defined in the std namespace. If those answers do not fully address your question, please ask a new question. The marked duplicate precisely answers your question. – Alok Save Mar 27 '13 at 10:55. Possibly more pertinent duplicate than those already listed: stackoverflow.com/questions/8734230/… – Chris White Dec 9 '13 at 2:14. @ChrisWhite: indeed.
2. I've seen some information about differences between things like iostream vs iostream.h. From what I gathered from those the difference between them is that the version without the .h extension will not populate the namespace while the version with the extension will. 9. @Jesse: the argument goes that if you include math.h, then you know you're dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace. If you include cmath then you may or may not be dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace.
Overview over the Functions of CMATH. In C++ and Delphi, synonyms are defined for all these functions. The synonyms do not have a prefix, since the data type information is implicitly handled by the compiler. Only in the following cases, the conversion really makes sense: 1  You have only multiplications and related math functions (like square, sqrt, ipow). 2  You have to call the complex exponential function. 3  You are in polar coordinates and have to calculate the logarithm.
Square Root (The sqrt Function). C++ cmath library includes a square root function, which has the signature: double sqrt (double x); . That is, it calculates and returns the square root of x as a double value. If the function is called with an integer argument, the C++ compiler will convert it to a double before calling the function. The notation for division in mathematical formulas is similar to the operator used in C++. For example, the formula P/T is converted to C++ as P/T or as pressure / temperature. But what about a formula like this:
Basically I have to raise a power. I'm using the volume formula V=pi*r^2*h. I already declared PI using #declare PI 3.141592. But I just learned I cannot simply do (radius)^2 in C++ rather there's a power function pow() I have to do (around those terms not done fully learning it yet). 
I've seen some information about differences between things like iostream vs iostream.h. I've seen some information about differences between things like iostream vs iostream.h. [iostream.h] is not a standard header. 9. @Jesse: the argument goes that if you include math.h, then you know you're dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace. If you include cmath then you may or may not be dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace.
CMATH is a comprehensive library for complex-number arithmetics and mathematics, both in cartesian and in polar coordinates, for C/C++ and Pascal/Delphi compilers. CMATH is available as a stand-alone product. It is also included in the OptiVec package. The complex C++ class es and the C struct s fComplex CMATH polar, which had to be replaced by magargtoc, as the word polar now denotes the complex classes in polar coordinates. are the same as in the plain-C version. Only in the following cases, the conversion really makes sense: 1  You have only multiplications and related math functions (like square, sqrt, ipow). 2  You have to call the complex exponential function. 3  You are in polar coordinates and have to calculate the logarithm.
-1 no, the headers that start with c are C++ specific variants of C standard library headers. they do not come from the C library. also, there is no guarantee that cmath doesn't define the symbols in the global namespace, and there's no guarantee that math.h doesn't define the symbols in the std namespace. 9. @Jesse: the argument goes that if you include math.h, then you know you're dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace. If you include cmath then you may or may not be dropping a heap of junk in your global namespace.
