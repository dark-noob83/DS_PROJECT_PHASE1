Most of the main joints of the appendicular skeleton (including the arms and hands, and the legs and feet) are synovial joints. This type of joint is therefore very important in many health sciences, not just medicine and nursing but also physiotherapy, sports sciences, occupational therapy, massage therapies and so on.

Structure of a synovial joint. The bones of synovial joints are held together by ligaments that form a fibrous capsule. The synovial membrane lining the capsule secretes a lubricating fluid, and articular cartilage on the bone ends provides a smooth surface for movement. Types of joint. Illustrated here are six examples of synovial joints, each of a different type, and one fixed and one semi-movable joint. Synovial joints are classified according to how their articular surfaces (where bones meet) fit together and the movements each permits.
A synovial joint, also known as diarthrosis, is the most common and most movable type of joint in the body of a mammal. As with most other joints, synovial joints achieve movement at the point of contact of the articulating bones. Structural and functional differences distinguish synovial joints from cartilaginous joints (synchondroses and symphyses) and fibrous joints (sutures, gomphoses, and syndesmoses).
(between bones in the human body). Different types of joints enable the bones forming the joints to move relative to each other in different ways and to different extents, i.e. from freely moveable to hardly any movement at all. The types of joints in the human body can be classified according to either. 1  the structure of the joint (how the bones are attached together) or. 2  the function of the joint (described in terms of the extent of possible movement of the bones forming the joint
Joint Categorization. Just like every person is a bit different, so are the joints in your body. They may look similar superficially, but, oftentimes, they are made of different types of tissue and do not allow the same type of movement as other joints might. Therefore, joints can be classified in one of two main ways. The most common and movable joint tissue type in the body is known as the synovial joint. These types of joints have a joint capsule encasing the joint and synovial fluid within the joint, which helps to cushion and protect the joint itself.
There is, of course, a connection between the structure of a joint and the degree of movement of the bones it allows. It is useful to know the words used to refer to and describe different classes of types of joints-see the table below. Some practical courses concentrate on the structural types (or classes) of joints. Different types of joints enable the bones forming the joints to move relative to each other in different ways and to different extents, i.e. from freely moveable to hardly any movement at all. The types of joints in the human body can be classified according to either.
Ball & Socket Joint. Ball-and-socket joints are a special class of synovial joints that enjoy the highest freedom of motion in the body thanks to their unique structure. The shoulder and hip joints are the only ball-and-socket joints in the human body due to the need for great motion at the end of the bodyâ€™s limbs and the vast amount of musculature needed to move and support such flexible joints.
Synovial joints have a synovial cavity between the articulating bones. This cavity is filled with synovial fluid that reduces friction at the joint, enabling the articulating bones to move freely. The page about types of joints explains the 3 functional classes of joints: 1  synarthroses (immovable joints).
