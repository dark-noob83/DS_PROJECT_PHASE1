Graphite has the same chemical composition as Diamond, which is also pure carbon, but the molecular structure of Graphite and Diamond is entirely different. This causes almost opposite characteristics in their physical properties. Graphite is rather common mineral, but fine crystals are rare.
P eople who ask about carbon-14 (14 C) dating usually want to know about the radiometric [1] dating methods that are claimed to give millions and billions of years—carbon dating can only give thousands of years.
Uses of Carbon. Carbon (in the form of coal, which is mainly carbon) is used as a fuel. Graphite is used for pencil tips, high temperature crucibles, dry cells, electrodes and as a lubricant. Diamonds are used in jewelry and – because they are so hard – in industry for cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing.
Graphite, while also composed of carbon, has an entirely different crystal structure, and different uses. Graphite is used as an electrical contactor (a brush) in electrical motors. It makes a great dry lubricant for things like locks, and when mixed with clay, forms the lead for ordinary pencils.
In fact, radiometric dating can be used to determine the age of the Earth, (5.54 billion years old) other planets, and celestial objects. Radiometric dating is often referred to as “radioactive dating” and “carbon dating,” though many different types of isotopes can be used to identify an object’s age.
Graphite is the dark gray material that is found in most pencils. Graphite is most commonly referred to as pencil or lead. Graphite is a grayish material that is available in a variety of different grades. HB is most commonly called a #2 pencil and is found in the middle of the grades.
