Adjust the stock price down to the average P/E ratio for the industry. If the average P/E ratio is 3, and the P/E ratio on my stock is 5 (current price $10 / earnings per share $2), then I can use the P/E equation to find what the stock price would need to be in order to have a P/E ratio of 3. The equation is: New P/E ratio x Earnings per share. The answer is 3 x $2 or $6.
Let's say a stock trades at $20 per share. If you crunch the numbers--projected sales growth, future profit margins, and so on--you might estimate the stock's fair price per share to be $30. You pay $20 for the stock, and in return you receive a stream of income valued at $30. That's a great deal.
The formula used to calculate the P/E ratio is current stock price per share /  current earnings per share.. Compare the P/E ratio for your company with other companies in the same industry.
Years : %. The number of years in the growth stage, and the average annual growth rate. The default value for the growth rate is the average Earings Per Share (eps) growth rate of the past 10 years. If this growth rate is high than 20% a year, it is set to 20%.
DEFINITION of 'Fair Value'. 1. The estimated value of all assets and liabilities of an acquired company used to consolidate the financial statements of both companies. 2. In the futures market, fair value is the equilibrium price for a futures contract.
If the stock was trading at $40, above the $30 fair value of the future income stream, you are looking at an expensive stock. At Morningstar, our analysts estimate a company's fair value by determining how much we would pay today for all the streams of excess cash generated by the company in the future.
For instance, if you want to find the fair value for a bank, you must compare the P/E ratio to other P/E ratios in the banking industry. Interpret the meaning of the P/E ratio. A high P/E ratio means the company is overvalued and a low P/E ratio means the company is undervalued.
