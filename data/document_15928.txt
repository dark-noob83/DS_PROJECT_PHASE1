Replacing a typical thatch roof costs on average £10 per square foot or about £100 per square metre. Mr New said: Check the roof every two or three years. The life of a thatched roof ranges from 25 years to 70 years; this varies depending on where the house is situated and on what kind of material the roof is made of.
The cost of thatching your roof will vary greatly according to a number of factors. These include: 1  The size of the roof. 2  The shape and design of the roof. 3  The types of thatching material used. 4  The type and pattern of ridge used. 5  The height to the ridge. 6  The height to the apex.
A normal domestic house roof of 350 m2 roof area would take 6 teams about seven days to thatch. How much does it cost?The cost of a thatch roof is dependant primarily on the maximum span of the roof. The greater the span, the higher the cost per square meter.
In short if an average cottage takes 2-3 Thatchers 4 weeks to thatch the wage bill is going to be considerable; if this runs over to 5 or 6 weeks whilst the cost to the thatch owner may not increase the Thatchers earnings will have taken a nose dive.
Houses, commercial establishments, heritage centers, holiday villages-you name it, we've probably thatched one. There is a practical consideration-the roof should have a slope no less than 45 degrees (12 inches in 12 inches) to aid in the shedding of water.
Thatched Homes Around the World. There are many materials you can thatch a home with, each with different life spans e.g. rush 3-5 years, bracken 5-10 years, heather 20-30 years and reed 30-50 years. However thatch can have an extremely long lifespan on a building.
