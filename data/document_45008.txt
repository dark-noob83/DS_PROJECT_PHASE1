As a percentage, the profit margin is 15 divided by 25, or 60 percent. Profit margin is always calculated from the retail price and is the money coming in to run your business.
Typical markup on designer fashions ranges from 55 to 62 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal..

Selling price = [(Cost) ÷ (100 - percentage markup)] × 100. Say you buy a sweater at wholesale for $60 and need to sell it at a 60 percent markup. The calculation would be [($60) ÷ (100 - 60)] x 100. This breaks down to ($60 ÷ 40) x 100, resulting in a selling price of $150.
Margin Formulas/Calculations: 1  The gross profit P is the difference between the cost to make a product C and the selling price or revenue R. 2  P = R-C. 3  The mark up percentage M is the profit P divided by the cost C to make the product. 4  M = P / C = (R-C) / C. Calculate the gross margin percentage, mark up percentage and gross profit of a sale from the cost and revenue, or selling price, of an item. * Revenue = Selling Price.

Mark Up Formulas/ Calculations: 1  The gross profit P is the difference between the cost to make a product C and the selling price or revenue R. 2  P = R-C. 3  To calculate revenue R based on the cost C and the desired gross margin G, where G is in decimal form: 4  R = C / (1 - G). 1
