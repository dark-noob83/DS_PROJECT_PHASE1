2. inherited. genetic code the arrangement of nucleotides in the polynucleotide chain of a chromosome; it governs the transmission of genetic information to proteins, i.e., determines the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain making up each protein synthesized by the cell.
Full Definition of GENETICS. 1. : a branch of biology that deals with the heredity and variation of organisms. 2. : the genetic makeup and phenomena of an organism, type, group, or condition. — ge·net·i·cist \-ˈne-tə-sist\ noun. ADVERTISEMENT.
the manner in which the arrangement of nucleotides in the polynucleotide chain of a chromosome governs the transmission of genetic information to proteins, i.e. determines the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain making up each protein synthesized by the cell.
genetic marker a gene having alleles that are all expressed in the phenotype, that is, they are codominant, and which can be used to study inheritance. The various blood group systems and serum or red blood cell proteins easily detected by electrophoresis or immunodiffusion are commonly used markers.
Definition of Control (genetic). Control (genetic): The control of gene expression. Genetic control may be on the transcriptional or translational level. Transcriptional control works by controlling the number of RNA transcripts of a region of DNA, indirectly controlling protein synthesis. Translational control of protein synthesis works by regulating the step of translating RNA into protein.
