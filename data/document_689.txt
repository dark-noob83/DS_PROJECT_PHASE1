Like many of Conrad's novels and short stories, Heart of Darkness is based in part upon the author's personal experiences. In 1890, after more than a decade as a seaman, Conrad requested the command of a Belgian steamer sailing for Africa.
Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad is a story that connects the audience to the narrator s senses. We come to understand the environment, the setting, the other charters, and Kurtz strictly from the narrator s point-of-view, as he experiences things.
Conrad published Heart of Darkness in novel form in 1902. It was taken from a 3 part series he wrote for the magazine Blackwood's Magazine which ran in 1899.
