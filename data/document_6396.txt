Realistically, a sofa being shipped coast to coast by way of hire, could cost $300 to $650 depending on weight, length and other factors like geographic locations. To carry the move-a quilted sofa cover could run $55 alone. Chair covers perhaps $28 and for a love seat cover, $40 would be expected. A wheeled 1000 lb furniture dolley is about $20, for which a pair could be needed to scoot things along, that are available at home centers. Altogether, shipping furniture, due to its irregular cumbersome makeup can get expensive. And usually someone else, aside from freight, performs the pickup. Lesser costs can come in where someone else helps unload at the endpoint to take it from there. After delivery, being faced with a temporary storage unit can cost $55 to $90 a month, and that much easily for a temperature-controlled environment.
