Clinical infections caused by Enterococcus include urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, diverticulitis, and meningitis. Sensitive strains of these bacteria can be treated with ampicillin and vancomycin. The most important feature of this genus is their high level of antibiotic resistance.
Enterococcal species can cause a variety of infections, including urinary tract infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, and meningitis. The antimicrobial agents available for treatment of enterococcal infection are reviewed here, followed by treatment approaches for clinical syndromes caused by enterococci.
Pathophysiology. Infections commonly caused by enterococci include urinary tract infection (UTIs), endocarditis, bacteremia, catheter-related infections, wound infections, and intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. Many infecting strains originate from the patient's intestinal flora.
Definition of ENTEROCOCCUS. : any of a genus (Enterococcus) of gram-positive bacteria that resemble streptococci and were formerly classified with them; especially: a bacterium (E. faecalis) normally present in the intestine.
Enterococcus: Bacteria normally found in the feces. Two types, Enterococcus fecalis and Enterococcus fecium, cause human disease, most commonly in the form of urinary tract and wound infections. Other infections, including those of the blood stream (bacteremia), heart valves (endocarditis), and the brain (meningitis) can occur in severely ill patients in hospitals.
Enterococcus is a large genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes. Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains, and are difficult to distinguish from streptococci on physical characteristics alone.
