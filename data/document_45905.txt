If you take another pill or pills in the same 18 hour period, you have to add to the number of milligrams in your system. Therefore, you take a pill that is 50 mgs. The half life is 18 hours, once again in 18 hours, you will still have the same 25 milligrams in your system. But lets say you take another pill in 9 hours.

Answers. Best Answer: Clonazepam is a long acting benzodiazepine with a half-life of 20-50hrs. It is most likely to be detectable for 3-4 days but it varies greatly on the individual. Clonazepam's long duration of action and long half-life make it more easy to detect compared to a drug like Ativan (lorazepam).
Klonopin has a half-life of up to 50 hours. That means that half of the active metabolite is still in the system after 50 hours, half of that half is still present after 100 hours and so on.
