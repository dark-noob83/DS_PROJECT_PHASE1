Steam Box and Steam Controller UK release date, UK price, specs. UPDATE: Valve announced in late May 2014 that its Steam Controller and all upcoming Steam Machines are delayed until '2015', rather than releasing at the tail end of 2014. Now at the beginning of 2015 there is little further information.
Now, Valve has offered further details on the Steam Controller. Speaking at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the developer has revealed that the Steam Controller will be available to purchase in November of this year. Valve also set a finite price tag of $50.
Steam Link will support 1080p resolution at 60 Hz with low latency, Valve says. The device will be available this November and will retail for $49.99. That's the same price as Valve's forthcoming Steam Controller, which will also be out by November.

Following a previous delay, Valve announced the controller's November launch window at GDC today. The controller is priced at $50 USD, and will release alongside Valve's Steam Link service, which is also slated for a $50 release. The controller's worldwide pricing will be announced closer to November, Valve said. Hands-on With the Updated Valve Controller. 01:37.
