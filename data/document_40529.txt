Average Cost Per Yard. Some retailers sell topsoil in 40-pound bags, ranging from $2 to $5 per bag. A 40-pound bag contains about three-quarters to 1 cubic foot of topsoil, depending on its moisture content and the type of organic material. There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard, so bagged topsoil costs $54 to $180 per cubic yard. At this rate, purchasing topsoil in bags is only suitable for very small areas. For example, to cover 1,000 square feet to a depth of 4 inches for a new garden or lawn, you will need 12 cubic yards of topsoil. Prices for bulk topsoil vary across the country, ranging from about $18 to $55 per cubic yard, including delivery. The price per cubic yard usually decreases with larger quantities
1 Some companies sell clean or screened fill dirt for $8-$15 a cubic yard, or $40-$75 for five yards to spread it 3+ inches deep over a 500-square-foot area (20x25 feet). 2  The cost of topsoil depends a lot on location. 1 Typically lower-quality topsoil is at the lower end of the scale, and the more yards you order the less it will cost per cubic yard. 2  Topsoil is also sold in bags, at $2-$5 a bag. 3  It takes roughly 18-20 bags to make a cubic yard, or $36-$100
Cost to Deliver Soil. Soil usually ranges in price from $10-$60 per cubic yard (27 square feet), not including delivery or spreading. 1  Rough wood chips fall on the low end of that range, while high-quality woods like cedar fall on the high end. 2  Most bark soil and wood chips fall cost $20-$30 per cubic yard. Delivery and labor often double the cost, so if you’re buying soil for around $30 per cubic yard, expect the total bill to be about $60 per cubic yard. However, some companies drop the per-cubic yard delivery price for large orders
