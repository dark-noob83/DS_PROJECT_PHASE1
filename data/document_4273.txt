Consider the main indicators of sociopathy. In addition to showing signs of antisocial personality disorder, someone who is a sociopath would display additional traits. These traits are mostly related to a defect with the person’s conscience, whereas someone who is a psychopath might be said to lack a conscience.
The sociopath is now described as someone with antisocial personality disorder. The main characteristic of a sociopath is a disregard for the rights of others. Sociopaths are also unable to conform to what society defines as a normal personality. Antisocial tendencies are a big part of the sociopath’s personality. This pattern usually comes into evidence around the age of 15.
Antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy are often confused. Someone with antisocial personality disorder may show psychopathic tendencies, but not be a psychopath. Symptoms of this disorder include an inability to follow the law, lying and conning, and a tendency to be impulsive. Aggression and a marked disregard for personal safety and the safety of others is also evident.
However, this could only be a few of the sociopathic tendencies of an individual. More correctly cited as a result of antisocial personality disorder, sociopaths are characterized by their utter disregard for the rights of others.
