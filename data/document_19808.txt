Snapper carries it under part number 7035500. This belt is the same size for mowers with 46-, 50- and 52-inch decks -- it runs from a pulley on the transmission, at the rear of the tractor, to a pulley near the front of the tractor, rather than the width of the deck.
Push this foward to create slack in the belt. Remove the belt from the pulley at the rear of the mower still holding it in place. Install the new belt. The flat side should be facing outward. Push the idler pulley tension arm forward as you did in step 4, and thread the new belt through the rear pulley. Release the arm to tighten the loop.
Zero-turn mowers have large decks and require longer deck drive belts than standard riding mowers with decks of the same width. Snapper models 355Z, 360Z and 400Z take a deck drive belt 151 1/4 inches long and 1/2 inch wide on both 44- and 50-inch decks. Snapper carries this belt under part number 5023256.
8. Replace the mower blade, making sure the blade hub is seated properly between the flanges. Snug the central bolt down and tighten it to 40 foot-pounds with a torque wrench and socket. Rotate the blade clockwise to ensure the belt is tracking properly.
1. Remove the rubber boot connecting the spark plug wire to the spark plug, and secure it away from the plug. Follow the instructions that came with the fuel siphon kit and drain the fuel tank.
7. Loop the replacement drive belt over the engine pulley. Guide the right side of the belt into the blade pulley groove, and rotate the pulley clockwise to seat the belt. Reattach the belt guard and tighten it securely with the box wrench.
Remove the mower deck belt from around all the pulleys, including the deck idler pulleys. Don't put your fingers on the idler spring or between the mower deck belt and any of the pulleys, as this could cause your fingers to get pinched or injured.
