So the fight is not canceled, an agreement may be reached where the fight is made at a catch weight. Commonly, the fighter who comes in overweight pays a penalty-for example a 20% penalty with 10% going to the fighter who made weight and 10% going to a commission sanctioning the fight.
For example: At UFC 60 (MMA, similar weight rules to boxing/wrestling), Matt Hughes and Royce Gracie fought at a catch weight of 175 pounds. The welterweight division in the UFC is 170 pounds and the Middleweight division is 185 pounds.
For example, when Manny Pacquiao fought Miguel Cotto, the fight was at a catch weight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique. Boxing has a junior welterweight weight class with a weight limit of 140 and a welterweight weight class with a weight limit of 147.
