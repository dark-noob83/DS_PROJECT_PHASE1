By Larry Kramer. Ice packs are used sometimes to treat muscle strains or sprains in different parts of the body. These packs if incorrectly used, can cause skin burns which may vary from mild such as first degree burns or more severe such as second and third degree burns. Cold burns are caused by the prolonged contact with icy objects or snow, as well as the exposure to windy conditions.
Burn Levels. There are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree. Each degree is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first degree being the most minor and third degree being the most severe.
Do not put butter or oil on burns. Do not put ice or ice water directly on second-or third-degree burns. If blisters form over the burn, do not break them. These things can cause more damage to the skin.
It absolutely does cause a blister, but not a 3rd degree burn. I would classify the burn from salt and ice as a 2nd degree burn for sure though. I was dared as a teen to pour salt on my ankle and lay a cube of ice over it. After just a minute or two i had a huge blister on my skin and it hurt like the dickens.
While the ice won't actually burn the skin, it can have the same effect. A 3rd degree burn occurs when the flesh is actually charred. The result is dead flesh. If the ice and salt mixture is cold enough and held in place long enough, the flesh will freeze and die (frostbite).
Best Answer: Actually, the ice can burn to 3rd degree. Especially easily done with one of those ice packs or gel ice packs attached to the injury with nothing between that and skin.
There are three types of burns: first, second and third degrees. This categorization of burns is in relation to the layers of skin affected by the heating element. A first degree burn is a mild burn on the first layer of skin, or epidermis. A second degree burn has occurred once the first and second layers of the skin are damaged, and a third degree burn occurs beyond that.
