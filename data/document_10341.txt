ACC collects money (called levies) to pay for the help we provide for people who are injured in accidents. As an employee, you pay levies through your PAYE, and the amount you pay is based on how much you earn. They can be compared to insurance premiums.
We’d like to explain how employees pay ACC levies, why they pay levies, how those levies are calculated and what they get in return.
Self-employed individuals are required to pay for annual personal injury cover from us. The cost of your levies depends on your business type and income. Our online calculators can give you an indication of the likely levy amount.
Average ACC hourly pay ranges from approximately $9.88 per hour for Call Center Manager to $18.00 per hour for Telephone Representative.
As an employee, you pay your ACC levies through your PAYE – that is, the tax your employer automatically deducts from your pay. The amount you pay depends on how much you earn and your individual levy rate. Find out the current year’s levy rates.
