Therefore, the average home uses about 24 kilowatt hours of electricity in a 24 hour period. If your power rate is 10 cents per Kwh, then you are paying about 10 cents per hour or $2.40 per day-more if your home is electrically heated and you live in Fairbanks or Winnipeg in January. Report Abuse. The average household in the United States uses about 8,900 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year.. there are 9000 hours in a year. so 9e3 kwatt-hour/9e3 = about 1kw average usage, averaged over time, is 1000 watts. At 10¢ per kw-hr, that is 10¢ per hour, or $2.40 per day or $900 per year
The average electricity consumption of a US family of four is in the neighborhood of 50 kWh per day, or 1,500 kWh per month. Similar figures apply for Canada. Assuming an average electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh, that translates into about $6 per day for electricity, or $180 per month. 
Household electricity use: 6,000 kWh per household per year for 3 residents average per household. So the household use per capita is 2,000 kWh or about of per capita electricity from all applications. Household Natural Gas use: 400 therms per household x 30 give 12,000 kWh equivalent electricity. Since much of the electricity is generated by natural gas, it is not totally unreasonable to compare these two in kilowatt hours. Reduction of Total Household Energy Use. We are now down to about 8,000 kWh from gas and 1,800 kWh from electricity for a total of 9,800 kWh total of GHG producing household usage, down from the initial 18,000 kWh.
You are mixing up watts and kilowatts. 1000 watts = 1 kilowatt. The average North American home uses about 1000 watts at any given time, or 1 kilowatt. Electricity is sold in units of kilowatt hours, which is 1000 watts for 1 hour. Report Abuse. The average household in the United States uses about 8,900 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year.. there are 9000 hours in a year. so 9e3 kwatt-hour/9e3 = about 1kw average usage, averaged over time, is 1000 watts. At 10¢ per kw-hr, that is 10¢ per hour, or $2.40 per day or $900 per yea
How much electricity does an American home use? In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. 
But most of us don’t live in perfectly average households. (The state that comes closest to matching the average monthly electricity usage is Ohio). Depending on whether a state is hot or cold, urban or rural, an average household can use as little as 531 kWh a month (Maine) or as much as 1,245 kWh (Louisiana). Costs vary state-by-state, too. Hawaiians pay the most for electricity ($203 a month) and New Mexicans pay the least ($75 a month). But there’s another value listed: how much energy you actually used. If you are a perfectly average American living in a perfectly average household, your monthly electricity bill will read 903 kilowatt hours (kWh), which costs $107, per household.
In the US typical household power consumption is about 11,700 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010. Perhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates. In China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3.
The average kWh usage level refers to the typical amount of energy your household consumes in a given month. Electric providers commonly charge different monthly rates and fees related to the usage level your household falls into. 500 kWh, 1000 kWh, or 2000 kWh. Don’t be caught off-guard. 
The average electricity consumption is 4,800 kWh per household [36]. A smaller than average household is taken arbitrarily to be 3,000 kWh (i.e. roughly two-thirds of the average), and a larger than average household to be 7,000 kWh (i.e. roughly 50% more).
