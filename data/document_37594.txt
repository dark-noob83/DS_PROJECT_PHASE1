It takes 247.9 Earth years for Pluto to make one orbit around the Sun, at an average speed of 10,623 miles per hour (17,096 kilometers per hour). 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 2  Learn how. 
Report Abuse. Pluto is about 39 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Its average distance from the sun is about 3,647,240,000 miles (5,869,660,000 kilometers). Pluto travels around the sun in an elliptical (oval-shaped) orbit. At some point in its orbit, it comes closer to the sun than Neptune, the outermost planet
248 earth years. Pluto revolves around the sun all the time. Even without ever stopping, it takes 248 years to complete one revolution. Since … its discovery in 1930, Pluto has made less than 1/3 of a complete orbit around the sun. In fact, it takes so long for Pluto to orbit that Sun, that the dwarf planet hasn't even completed a third of an orbit from when it was discovered back in February 18th, 1930. Pluto has a highly elliptical orbit.
Long answer: Because Pluto orbits much further from the Sun t … han Earth, it takes much longer to orbit the Sun. In fact, Pluto takes 248 years to orbit the Sun. That's because Pluto orbits at an average distance of 5.9 billion km from the Sun, while Earth only orbits at 150 million km. In fact, it takes so long for Pluto to orbit that Sun, that the dwarf planet hasn't even completed a third of an orbit from when it was discovered back in February 18th, 1930. Pluto has a highly elliptical orbit.
Pluto's mass is only 0.2 percent of planet Earth's mass. Orbit. Pluto has a strange orbit. It was the only one to cross another planet's orbit. Pluto's orbit tilts up from the Solar System plane. It takes Pluto 6 days 9 hours to rotate and 248 Earth years to complete an orbit around the Sun. It's orbit is off-center in relation to the Sun. That leads Pluto across planet Neptune's path. Size. Pluto is less than half the size of any major plane
One journey of our solar system around the center of the Milky Way galaxy is sometimes called a cosmic year. That’s approximately 225-250 million years. The planets in our solar system orbit around the sun. One orbit of the Earth takes one year. Meanwhile, our entire solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Our sun and solar system move at about 800 thousand kilometers an hour – that’s about 500 thousand miles an hour – in this huge orbit. 
No. It takes over 248 years for Pluto to complete its orbit around the Sun (astronomers have just been observing Pluto for 80 years so far).   It takes over 6 (Earth) days … and 9 hours for Pluto to revolve around its axis. In fact, it takes so long for Pluto to orbit that Sun, that the dwarf planet hasn't even completed a third of an orbit from when it was discovered back in February 18th, 1930. Pluto has a highly elliptical orbit. Its distance from the Sun varies from 4.4 billion km to 7.4 billion km
Because Pluto orbits much further from the Sun than Earth, it takes much longer to orbit the Sun. In fact, Pluto takes 248 years to orbit the Sun. That’s because Pluto orbits at an average distance of 5.9 billion km from the Sun, while Earth only orbits at 150 million km. In fact, it takes so long for Pluto to orbit that Sun, that the dwarf planet hasn’t even completed a third of an orbit from when it was discovered back in February 18th, 1930. How long does it take for Pluto to orbit the Sun? Hubble image of Pluto and its moons, Charon, Nix and Hydra. Pluto was only discovered in 1930 by Clyde W. Tombaugh. Because it takes 248 years to orbit the Sun, Pluto won’t have completed a full orbit until the year 2178. We have written many articles about Pluto for Universe Today.
