Transformation In genetics, the transfer of genes by one organism taking up DNA belonging to another organism of the same or different species. Transgenic organism An organism created by genetic engineering, in which one or more foreign genes have been incorporated into its genome.

The DNA that is engineered often codes for some particular trait of interest. Using technology, scientists can take a gene from one species and transfer it into the DNA of an organism from another species. The resulting organisms are referred to as genetically modified (GM), or transgenic.
The genome is the set of all genes, regulatory sequences, and noncoding information within an organism's DNA. Thus, the study of genomics considers all of the genetic material contained within and shared between organisms.
