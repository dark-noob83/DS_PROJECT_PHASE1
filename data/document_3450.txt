That question is all relative to what brand, size, and where you shop for them. Generally speaking, the smaller the rim size, the lower the cost. On the flip side, the lower the profile, the higher the cost. Here's an example. I pad $170 for a set of 4 195/60/15 Kumho touring tires. Same size in Goodyear-$210. Is Goodyear a better tire you ask....well I personally don't think so

Report Abuse. you can get 4 new tires anywhere from 100-1000 dollars, average. the cheap ones would be economy tires. the top end ones are specialized, good branded, and/or rated for high speeds. my tires on my 3000gt are z rated (186mph i think) and cost me about 700 bux. I'm thinking 16 inch rims and i think the tire size will be 225/60r16. They should be anywear from 80 to 120 per depending on the brand and the place.

“These days a minority of people are focussed on the quality of the tyre,” says tyre retailer George Chalazia. “They are more focussed on cost.”. Mr Chalazia said that the tyre you buy depends on what your needs are. If you are travelling short distances in the city, it may not make sense to spend $1000 on a tyre. Since all tyres are compromises, it makes sense to buy a mid range tyre that will walk the line between value and performance. 
1 Tire retailers may suggest additional services, such as a wheel alignment ($20-$400) or replacing the brake pads ($130-$190 per axle). 2  A wheel alignment is only necessary if the old tires wore unevenly, or if the vehicle pulls to one side when steering; it is not standard when installing new tires. 1 Some shops include a valve stem, tire mounting and wheel balancing in the cost of the tire, while others may charge an additional $2-$25 per wheel for these needed installation services.
