1 ROTH IRA-There is no upper age limit to make a contribution to a ROTH IRA. 2  Traditional IRA-For a Traditional IRA, once you reach the year in which you turn age 70 ½ you are no longer eligible to make a Traditional IRA contribution.
Roth IRA Contribution Limits for Individuals 50 or Older. For individuals that are age 50 or older the same $5,500 contribution limit across all Roth IRAs is in place. However, the IRS also allows these individuals to also contribute an additional $1,000 as catch up contributions.
For 2013 and 2014. the basic limit for regular contributions to a Roth IRA is $5,500 for people under 50 years of age, and $6,500 for those who are 50 or older. (Numbers like this can be found in our Reference Room .) This limit may be reduced for any of the following reasons:
Age limits. Finally, one of the more appealing Roth IRA rules is that they do not have an age limit. Whereas traditional IRA contributions are barred for individuals older than 70 1/2, you can be any age and still contribute to a Roth IRA if you're earning money.
No age limit. Contributions to a Roth IRA don't have to stop when you reach age 70½, the cut-off for a traditional IRA. You can put money in your account for as many years as you want, as long as you have earned income that qualifies.
For example, you could contribute $2,500 to a Roth IRA with one provider and $3,000 with a second provider. You cannot contribute $5,500 to the first Roth IRA and $5,500 to the second provider. Your total contribution limit is $5,500 for all accounts for the tax year.
Like adults, minors are subject to the maximum annual contribution limits for Roth IRAs. As of 2012, the maximum contribution limit is $5,000 per tax year for investors under the age of 50. A minor may not contribute more than $5,000 to a Roth IRA. Contributing to a Roth IRA may have significant advantages for minors.
