Add your answer. How do you mod N64 ROMs. I'm trying to make a total conversion mod for the ever popular LoZ:OOT. What tools/programs would I need to edit the game and still let me play it on my Project64 emulator. And yes I know how much work it takes so please no answers stating how hard, tedious, and obnoxious its going to be.
Install a ROM Patch or Update. Similar to installing a ROM, this feature allows you to install a patch or update to your ROM. To use it, select ‘Choose patch/update’ and select the zip file of the patch or update you want to flash. To install any ROM to your device, select ‘Choose full ROM’. This will open up a file selection window, allowing you to select the zip file of the ROM you want to install. Once you have selected it, ‘Flash official ROM’ or ‘Flash custom ROM’ options would become enabled, depending on the ROM you have chosen.
In this post I will explain how to modify your stock ROM to include features like volume wake-up and more. Getting your stock ROM. First we need to get a copy of your ROM. I found the easiest way to get this is to flash ClockworkMod and doing a backup of your phone to an external sd card. Connect your phone to your computer and grab the file called system.ext4.tar in your backup folder. After that it is up to you to change what ever you want. This first post will contain general information and requirements. The 2nd post will have guides on how to modify the initramfs. The 3rd post will have example modifications of the ROM.
After that, you just need to pack up the files again. Not sure about mame games, usually they need to be extracted, not sure how to get into those files at all. Only problem is actaully modding the games files. I do believe it has been done on some playstation games, and possibly other console games. 
When you've found a ROM you want to try, download it and save it to your phone. It should come in the form of a fairly large ZIP file, so you'll probably want to be on Wi-Fi to download it. You can either download it directly from your phone, or download it on your computer and transfer it over via USB. 
ROM expansion [edit]. Generally speaking, a ROM hacker cannot normally add content to a game, but merely change existing content. This limit can be overcome through ROM expansion, whereby the total size of the ROM image is increased, making room for more content, and a larger game. One of the most popular forms of ROM hacking, level editing entails modifying or redesigning a game's levels or maps. This is almost exclusively done with an editor specially tailored for a particular game (called a level editor).
Hexpose (DOS) : An old but solid utility to hack the text in a ROM. It can even build a table based on a relative search! WindHex (Windows) : WindHex is my current favorite HEX editor. I recommend it over Hexpose as it includes support for Microsoft Windows and has more features. Now, we will see how to change the graphics in a ROM. Tile Layer Pro is the ultimate program to do it. Run it, then open your ROM. Be sure to open it in NES format. Now, you'll see a lot of random data, looking all weird. Scroll down, down, down... Down to the quarter or the third of the ROM, you'll see the letters to form the text, and Link, just a little bit up
