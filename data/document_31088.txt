Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures. The range for normal human body temperatures, taken orally, is 7002309950000000000♠36.8±0.5 °C (7002309927777777777♠98.2±0.9 °F). Therefore, an oral temperature of 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) would, strictly speaking, be a normal, healthy temperature in the afternoon but not in the early morning. An individual's body temperature typically changes by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) between its highest and lowest points each day.
The normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). In adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 33.2–38.2 °C (91.8–100.8 °F) for normal temperatures, depending on the gender and location measured. Therefore, an oral temperature of 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) would, strictly speaking, be a normal, healthy temperature in the afternoon but not in the early morning. An individual's body temperature typically changes by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) between its highest and lowest points each day.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . The body is very good at keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. When you are too hot, the blood vessels in your skin expand (dilate) to carry the excess heat to your skin's surface.
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally. 
Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response, is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point. There is not a single agreed upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.5 and 38.3 °C (99.5 and 100.9 °F). 
Pyrexia in Cats. The normal body temperature for cats falls in the range of 99.5-102.5 Fahrenheit. Fever, referred to medically as pyrexia, can be defined as a higher than normal body temperature in cats – a body temperature of at least 103.5 ° F (39.7° C).
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Although it is commonly thought that 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the average oral temperature for an adult, normal temperature can range from 97.1 degrees to about 99.5 degrees. It is a good idea to determine your own normal body temperature by taking your temperature when you feel well. 
But you can’t tell if your cat has a fever by feeling for a warm, dry nose, as many people believe. The only way to know for sure -- with either a human or a cat -- is to take its temperature. A normal temperature in cats ranges from 100.4º to 102.5º Fahrenheit. A fever in cats occurs when temperatures rise above 102.5º F. Although fevers may be helpful in fighting disease, a fever higher than 106º F can damage organs. 
Normal body temperature for healthy babies is in the range of 96.8°F to 98.6°F, or 36°C to 37°C. If the baby's body temperature rises above 100.4°F to 101.3°F, then it is considered as indication of fever. If it falls below 96.8°F then the child has low temperature and needs immediate warming up. For children, the normal body temperature range is between 96.8°F to 98.2°F. It is the lowest in the early morning between 4 and 6 a.m., and the highest in the early evening between 6 and 8 p.m. Normal temperature is about 37°C or 98.6°F. However, it can be as low as 36.1°C (97°F) in the early morning to a high of 37.2°C (99°F) in the evening and still be considered normal.
These temperatures are the core body temperature. It is in the normal range if the orally measured temperature of adults is 98.2°F, with fluctuation of 1.3°F higher or lower. If the adult shows oral temperature of more than 99.5°F, then it is considered as fever or some other medical conditions. It is the lowest in the early morning between 4 and 6 a.m., and the highest in the early evening between 6 and 8 p.m. Normal temperature is about 37°C or 98.6°F. However, it can be as low as 36.1°C (97°F) in the early morning to a high of 37.2°C (99°F) in the evening and still be considered normal.
