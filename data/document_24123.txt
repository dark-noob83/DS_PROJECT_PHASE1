If you achieve a share ratio of 1.0, that would mean you've uploaded as much as you've downloaded. The higher the number, the more you have contributed. If you have below a 1.0 that means you are just downloading and not uploading as much to help others complete their download.
If you achieve a share ratio of 1.0, that would mean you've uploaded as much as you've downloaded.. No, that can't be how it is computed. I have several torrents I created (downloaded zero.) If the ratio were computed as stated, my ratio for those torrents would be infinity.
In general, Share ratio is a measure of your sharing activity. The ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of uploaded data by the amount of downloaded data. If the ratio is over 1.0, you have uploaded more than downloaded. If it is below 1.0, you have downloaded more than uploaded. You should aim for a Share Ratio greater than 1 because otherwise, trackers could ban you because you are leeching, and there will be fewer good torrents out there.
