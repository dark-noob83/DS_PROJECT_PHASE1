Face painting is considered to be an important tradition among Native Americans. It is much more than just a beautifying practice. It’s a sacred social act of distinction and a cultural heritage. On special occasions faces of the tribe members are painted to augment one’s appearance and power. Tribal Societies, who still follow the ancient custom of face painting, choose the colors according to the available raw materials. In ancient times, only primary and locally available colors like red, blue, yellow or white were used. Sometimes by sprinkling dust or soft bird feathers, special effects were achieved.
Developed from a base of spotted horses with Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred bloodlines, the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) breed registry is now one of the fastest-growing in North America. 1 Solid: A horse otherwise eligible for registration as a Paint that does not have any white that constitutes a recognized spotting pattern.  2 Color: An informal term meaning that the horse has a
The image is of William Lone Star Dietz, whose mother was a full blooded Sioux Indian. Dietz was the first coach of the Redskins football team, and it was in his honor that the team was named Redskins. He brought a number of Indian players with him to the team and they wore war paint and Indian bonnets at games. The word Redskin is considered derogatory. The term comes from centuries ago when a bounty was placed on Indian people. Trappers would bring in Indian scalps along with the skins of animals -- bearskin, deerskin, redskin.
Tattoos and masks were the most popular Southeast traditions. Nevertheless, face paint was used as a “masculine adornment” during festivals. (Paterek, 1994) Red, black, russet, and yellow, were the most common colors, and white was used on the last day of the festival. (Lewis, 2009) Today, many Native Americans still apply traditional face paint for spiritual ceremonies, as well as events such as pow-wow competitions. Pow-wow dancers, who choose to wear face paint, use theatrical make-up.
The registry allows some non-spotted animals to be registered as Solid Paint Bred and considers the American Paint Horse to be a horse breed with distinct characteristics, not merely a color breed. 1 Solid: A horse otherwise eligible for registration as a Paint that does not have any white that constitutes a recognized spotting pattern.  2 Color: An informal term meaning that the horse has a

Face painting is a common theme across cultures as divergent as the Indigenous American tribes in North America and various tribes in Africa and South America. Tribal Societies, who still follow the ancient custom of face painting, choose the colors according to the available raw materials. In ancient times, only primary and locally available colors like red, blue, yellow or white were used. Sometimes by sprinkling dust or soft bird feathers, special effects were achieved.
These Paint horses eventually dotted the landscape in wild herds, and by the 1800s tribes of American Indians were using the breed for riding. There were a variety of names attached to these spot covered horses throughout the 1800s and 1900s, but the name that seemed to stick was the Pinto horse. Inseparable from the Wild West, and indistinguishable from the image of the American cowboy, horses will be forever identified with the picture of early Americana. But no breed of horse is more interconnected with this cherished history than Paint horses.
Native Americans commonly viewed face painting not only as an act of social distinction and cultural heritage, but as a significant aspect in cultural and spiritual ceremonies and rituals. Ceremonial paint was also used to hide ones identity, as well as to obtain power from the creature or spirit represented. (Lewis, 2009) Today, many Native Americans still apply traditional face paint for spiritual ceremonies, as well as events such as pow-wow competitions. Pow-wow dancers, who choose to wear face paint, use theatrical make-up.
