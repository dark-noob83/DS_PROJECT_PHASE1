Lung volumes and capacitirs: Tidal volume increases by 45% during pregnancy, with approximately half of the change occurring during the first trimester. Functional residuak capacity begins to decrease by the fifth month of the pregnancy.
1 Average maximum physiological changes associated with Pregnancy Respiratory Oxygen consumption + 20 to 50% Minute ventilation + 50% Tidal volume + 40% Respiratory rate + 15% PaO 2 + 10% PaCO 2 - 15% HCO 3 - 15% FRC (functional residual capacity). 2  20.
A 25% reduction of expiratory reserve volume and a 15% reduction of residual volume, account for the change. Inspiratory capacity increases by 15% during the third trimester because of increases of tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. Ventilation: Minute ventilation increases by 45% during pregnancy, with increase evident early in the first trimester, as a result of increase in tidal volume.
The compression also causes a decreased total lung capacity (TLC) by 5% and decreased expiratory reserve volume. Tidal volume increases with 30-40%, from 0.45 to 0.65 litres,[citation needed] and minute ventilation by 30-40% giving an increase in pulmonary ventilation. This is necessary to meet the increased oxygen requirement of the body, which reaches 50 mL/min, 20 mL of which goes to reproductive tissues.
There is an increase in tidal volume (almost 50%), which causes an increase in minute ventilation throughout pregnancy (21% and 50% in the second and third trimesters respectively) (Artal et al., 1986; Oâ€™Toole, 2003).
An increase in tidal volume and minute ventilation which occurs in pregnancy was observed in many studies [Rees GB, Pipkin FB, Symonds EM (8) ; Nelson Piercy C (9) ]. Minute ventilation increases during pregnancy because of increases in tidal volume; the respiratory rate does not change.
So tidal volume increases during pregnancy, but does anyone know how this occurs. Cause the way I think about it, pregnancy pushes upwards which should decrease lung capacity... and thus reduce tidal volume..
