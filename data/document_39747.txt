Place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven to ensure even cooking. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. 1 
Italian sausage is traditionally made from pork, which must be cooked the sausage thoroughly to prevent food-borne illnesses. How you cook the sausage depends on its intended purpose. For example, if you intend to use the sausage in lasagna, you need to remove it from the casing or use bulk sausage. If you intend to eat it like a hot dog or slice it, you need to cook it in link form. The stove-top method is the best way to cook both bulk and link Italian sausage quickly.
