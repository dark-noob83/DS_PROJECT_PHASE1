Normal respiration rate in adults is 12 breaths/min. Normal breathing, as we discussed, is strictly nasal (in and out), mainly diaphragmatic (i.e., abdominal), slow (in frequency) and imperceptible (or small/shallow in its volume).
Strength of the pulse. The normal pulse for healthy adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. The pulse rate may fluctuate and increase with exercise, illness, injury, and emotions. Females ages 12 and older, in general, tend to have faster heart rates than do males.
Dogs at rest have a normal respiration rate of 10 to 35 breaths per minute. The average dog at rest takes 24 breaths per minute. To check your dog’s respiration rate, count his chest movements for 15 seconds and multiply by four to get the total number of

- normal TV (tidal volume or air volume breathed in during a single breath): 500 ml; - normal Rf (respiratory frequency or respiratory rate): 12 breaths per minute; - inspiration: about 1.5-2 seconds; - normal exhalation is 1.5-2 seconds, followed by an automatic pause (no breathing for 1-2 seconds).
For children from the age of one to five years old, normal respiration is 20 to 30 breaths per minute, while children who are from six to twelve years old should have a normal respiratory rate that ranges from 12 to 20 breaths per minute.
Dogs at rest have a normal respiration rate of 10 to 35 breaths per minute. Practice checking your dog’s respiration rate at home, when you and your dog are both relaxed, so you’ll recognize quickly when something is wrong.
Most modern adults breathe much faster (about 15-20 breaths per minute) than their normal breathing frequency. The respiratory rates in the sick persons are usually higher, generally about 20 breaths/min or more.
