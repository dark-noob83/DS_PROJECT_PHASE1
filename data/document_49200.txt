Vitamin C helps your body produce enough collagen to maintain the tissues of your digestive tract. A diet rich in vitamin C might also protect against cancers of the digestive tract, including mouth, throat, stomach and colon cancer, according to the Linus Pauling Institute.
Two types of vitamins are essential for proper bodily function: fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E and K, and the digestion of these vitamins is enhanced in the presence of fat. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored within your liver, intestines and fatty tissues of the body.
Vitamin C. Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, supports digestion too. Found in a number of fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, spinach, citrus fruits and red peppers, vitamin C is essential for good health.
Foods contain chemical energy, stored as proteins, fats and carbohydrates, that your body must process to obtain energy. Most foods also contain other nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, that are released during digestion and absorbed within your body.
Vitamins and minerals are essential for every single function in your body, especially normal digestion. While almost all nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream through your small intestine, some of them help with the breakdown of carbohydrates, protein and fat along the way.
Function. The small intestine serves as the primary site of vitamin digestion and absorption. Vitamins perform various functions in the body. Vitamin C is incorporated into collagen, a protein that serves to provide structure for your bones and skin.
Vitamin A. Eat vitamin A each day to keep your digestive system healthy. The surface of your digestive tract is made up of mucosal tissues. These tissues secrete compounds that help with digestion -- the mucosal lining in your stomach, for example, secretes stomach acid -- and also absorb the nutrients from your food.
