Tendon to bone healing (for example, as frequently required in rotator cuff repair) does not result in the restoration of a normal tendon-bone insertion site, rather there is a scar formation and the zone of calcified cartilage does not form [15]. Structure and Function of Tendon. The function of a tendon is to transmit force created by the muscle to the bone and to generate movement; thus, the tendons are part of a bone-tendon-muscle-tendon-bone complex. The tendon is composed primarily of type I collagen, the major fibrillar collagen in the body, organized into fibrils
A tendon (or sinew) is a tough band of fibrous connective tissue that usually connects muscle to bone and is capable of withstanding tension. Tendons are similar to ligaments and fasciae; all three are made of collagen. Ligaments join one bone to another bone; fasciae connect muscles to other muscles. Therefore, the healing process for a broken tendon is long and painful. Most people who do not receive medical attention within the first 48 hours of the injury will suffer from severe swelling, pain, and a burning sensation where the injury occurred.
The tendons in the foot are highly complex and intricate. Therefore, the healing process for a broken tendon is long and painful. Most people who do not receive medical attention within the first 48 hours of the injury will suffer from severe swelling, pain, and a burning sensation where the injury occurred.
Tendon repair is surgery done to treat a torn or otherwise damaged tendon. Tendons are the soft, band-like tissues that connect muscles to bone. When the muscles contract, the tendons pull the bones and cause them to move. When tendon damage occurs, movement may be seriously limited in the area of the damage. The damaged area may feel numb, weak, or painful
1 Rest your Achilles tendon. 2  Avoid all activities that strain the tendon, such as stair climbing or running. 3  Try other activities, such as swimming, while you give your tendon the days, weeks, or months it needs to heal. 4  Your doctor will tell you what you can and cannot do. 
1 Tendons require weeks of additional rest to heal. 2  You may need to make long-term changes in the types of activities you do or how you do them. 3  Apply ice or cold packs as soon as you notice pain and tenderness in your muscles or near a joint. 4  Apply ice 10 to 15 minutes at a time, as often as twice an hour, for 72 hours. Initial treatment for a tendon injury (tendinopathy) typically includes rest and pain relievers. Acetaminophen can reduce pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce both the pain and inflammation you might have from a tendon injury.
Tendons usually fail by tearing away from the bone (common for rotator cuff and bicep tendon injuries), or rupture within the tendon itself (frequent in Achilles tendon injury). Tendons may heal through a conservative treatment, or may require surgery. The surgical approach involves repairing the torn tissue back to its original position (or as close as possible), with the tendon-bone or tendon-tendon attachment requiring months to be complete.

If the tendon is only overstretched, it should heal within a day or two with a treatment of ice packs, elevation, and rest -- similar to the healing routine for ankle sprains. After the first 24 hours, alternate ice packs with heat to help reduce the inflammation that often accompanies tendinitis. Tendinitis is the inflammation, stiffness, and swelling that result when a tendon is strained or torn. You can experience this problem in tendons anywhere in the foot, including those within the arch along the bottom of the foot. Tendinitis is, in fact, often related to arch problems.
