so what is the current cost of residential solar power as of early 2015 it s approximately $ 3 00 per installed watt the average sized solar panel system is 5000 watts so this brings the total cost to $ 15000 that 15k figure is just an average amount systems can cost more or less mostly depending upon a homeowner s energy usage
in 2011 residential solar system installers paid a little over $ 1 80 per watt for solar panels in both germany and the united states in germany installers added $ 1 20 to the cost of the solar panel to complete an installation but in the u s they tacked on $ 4 36 per watt more than three times as much
the chart at the left shows the average cost of electricity for 2014 by consumer group per the eia the us energy information administration for 2014 the average residential cost was 12 50 cents per kilo watt hour up 3 1 % from 2013 commercial was 10 75 cents and industrial 7 01 cents
at an installed price of $ 1 25 per watt the cost of pv solar is always cheaper than coal at $ 2 per watt it is cheaper after year 40 at $ 3 00 per watt it is cheaper about year 80
that s $ 1 67 per watt well below the $ 1 88 per watt gtm research said it would cost to build a single axis tracking system which is the most common and least expensive tracking design these are incredibly low costs and low rates of return for solar assets
generally solar pv systems that generate electricity from sunlight cost between $ 2 50 to $ 7 per installed watt typically the larger the system the lower price per watt large commercial systems are typically well below $ 4 per watt residential systems because of their smaller size are usually somewhat higher for example in ohio a 5 kw residential system with an average monthly production of about 530 kwh would cost approximately $ 19000 or about $ 3 77 per watt
