the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate atp to adenosine diphosphate adp and phosphoric acid pi releases energy it is an exergonic reaction some chemical reactions that occur in cells require energy aerobic respiration is a series of enzyme controlled reactions that release the energy stored up in carbohydrates and lipids during photosynthesis and make it available to living organisms aerobic respiration there are four stages glycolysis the link reaction the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
the reactions of glycolysis start the energy releasing process by splitting one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvic acid textbook reading assignment page 123 as indicated earlier most of the energy in food is stored in the chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms
insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar glucose from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high hyperglycemia or too low hypoglycemia 
during glycolysis glucose molecules six carbon molecules are split into two pyruvates three carbon molecules during a sequence of enzyme controlled reactions this is the same reaction as occurs in aerobic respirationis a series of enzyme controlled reactions that release the energy stored up in carbohydrates and lipids during photosynthesis and make it available to living organisms aerobic respiration there are four stages glycolysis the link reaction the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
glycolysis cells harvest the energy contained in the chemical bonds of glucose in a very controlled step by step series of reactions that release small amounts of energy during each biochemical reaction glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration where a molecule of glucose is split to release energy the process of glycolysis is an enzyme controlled four step reaction that occurs in the cytoplasm of the cells 
when a sugar molecule is broken down a usable form of energy is released for the cell s life functions cells can release energy in two basic processes cellular respiration and fermentation cellular respiration requires oxygen but fermentation does not in addition cellular respiration releases much more usable energy than does fermentation 2 the process begins when glucose in the cytoplasm is broken down into smaller molecules this releases a small amount of energy these molecules then move into the mitochondria at the same time oxygen enters the cell and travels
to extract energy from nutrient molecules cells use the reactions of glycolysis to split glucose molecules other reactions and pathways then capture the energy in the chemical bonds of the breakdown product pyruvic acidhe reactions of glycolysis start the energy releasing process by splitting one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvic acid textbook reading assignment page 123 as indicated earlier most of the energy in food is stored in the chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms
user 5 which process does not release energy from glucose 1 point glycolysis photosynthesis fermentation cellular respirationweegy d photosythesis please rate good jayden2012 points 0 user 6 which of the following is produced during both anaerobic and aerobic respiration 
the process in which cells use oxygen to release energy stored in glucose is cellular respiration metabolism specifically catabolism calvin cycle b cellular respiration c glycolysis d photosynthesis c glycolysis bacause only a small amount of the chemical energy that was originally stored in glucose is released to the cell about 90 % of the energy is still unused
the overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps most of which are redox reactions themselves although technically cellular respiration is a combustion reaction it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell due to slow release of energy from the series of reactions starting with glucose 1 atp is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6 phosphate glycogen can be converted into glucose 6 phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase during energy metabolism glucose 6 phosphate becomes fruct
