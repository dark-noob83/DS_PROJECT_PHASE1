In anaerobic respiration (respiration in absence of oxygen), pyruvate is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion, but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell.
Glucose (sugar) + Oxygen â†’ Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (as ATP). Cellular respiration is what cells do to break up sugars into a form that the cell can use as energy. This happens in all forms of life. Cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create ATP, a chemical which the cell uses for energy. Regular cellular respiration is aerobic (requires oxygen), but some simple organisms can only do anaerobic cellular respiration.
Noun. 1. cellular respiration-the metabolic processes whereby certain organisms obtain energy from organic molecules; processes that take place in the cells and tissues during which energy is released and carbon dioxide is produced and absorbed by the blood to be transported to the lungs. internal respiration, respiration.
In cellular respiration the blood cells release oxygen and pick up carbon dioxide. The lungs dispose of the carbon dioxide, left there by the red blood cells, in the process of breathing.
respiration. 1  act or process of respiring; breathing; inhaling and exhaling air. 2  the processes by which a living organism or cell takes in oxygen from the air or water, distributes and utilizes it in oxidation, and gives off products of oxidation, esp. carbon dioxide.
