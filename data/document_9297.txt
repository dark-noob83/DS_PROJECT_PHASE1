Using a rowing machine is a way to engage in heart-pounding, low-impact exercise that also challenges key muscle groups in your arms, core and legs, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. By using a rowing machine with proper form, you can achieve a full-body workout. Your muscles in your abdomen and back also are working as you use a rowing machine. The erector spinae muscles alongside your spine responsible for maintaining posture keep your back straight as you lean forward and backward.
A rowing fitness machine allows for a low-impact workout. It not only offers an intense cardiovascular workout, but also works to target and tone numerous muscles. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), rowing is a mode of exercise that involves both the upper-and lower-body muscles.

Your abdominal muscles are crucial for the powerful movements required by the rowing machine and are also a critical component in coordinating your upper and lower body to complete the movement in a fluid motion. It not only offers an intense cardiovascular workout, but also works to target and tone numerous muscles. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), rowing is a mode of exercise that involves both the upper-and lower-body muscles.
Arms. The rowing machine works several major muscle groups in your arms. When you are in the catch phase of rowing, you are working your biceps and brachioradialis muscles on the front of your arms, pulling back with the rowing bar or pulleys. Your muscles in your abdomen and back also are working as you use a rowing machine. The erector spinae muscles alongside your spine responsible for maintaining posture keep your back straight as you lean forward and backward.
Rowing machines involve your whole body. Rowing machines target muscle groups in your back, shoulders and arms, but most models have sliding seats that allow you to develop your lower-body muscles as well. Rowing workouts can be strenuous, so talk to your doctor before using one especially if you have joint or lower-back problems. Rowing Movements.

A rowing machine is one of the most effective and comprehensive pieces of workout equipment that you can use. Not only does it provide a great cardiovascular workout that will help you torch calories and shed excess pounds, but it also provides direct stimulation of many different muscles and muscle groups. Rowing machines enable a great total body workout regardless of your specific goals.
The muscles of the back are largely targeted by a rowing machine. Specifically, the trapezius, rhomboids and latissimus dorsi muscles. The trapezius and rhomboids act together to stabilize and retract, or pull together, the shoulder blades. It not only offers an intense cardiovascular workout, but also works to target and tone numerous muscles. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), rowing is a mode of exercise that involves both the upper-and lower-body muscles.
Arms. The arm region is used extensively while rowing. Your posterior deltoid muscles are activated and work in unison with the back muscles to complete the rowing motion of the upper body. The biceps and forearms are also targeted with each flexion of the arm. It not only offers an intense cardiovascular workout, but also works to target and tone numerous muscles. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), rowing is a mode of exercise that involves both the upper-and lower-body muscles.
