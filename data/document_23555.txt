The most used plant fibres are cotton, flax and hemp, although sisal, jute, kenaf, bamboo and coconut are also widely used. Plant fibre is composed mainly of cellulose and cellulose fibres are most commonly used to make paper and cloth.
This is enough cotton to make 325 pairs of denim jeans. PROCESSING THE CROP. The cotton gin is where cotton fiber is separated from the cotton seed. The first step in the ginning process is when the cotton is vacuumed into tubes that carry it to a dryer to reduce moisture and improve the fiber quality. Then it runs through cleaning equipment to remove leaf trash, sticks and other foreign matter. Ginning is accomplished by one of two methods.
Fibres grow from the seed coat to form a boll of cotton lint. The boll is a protective fruit and when the plant is grown commercially, it is stripped from the seed by ginning and the lint is then processed into cotton fibre. For unit weight of fibre, about 1.6 units of seeds are produced.
Every part of the cotton plant can be used. The long cotton fibers are used to make cloth, the short fibers can be used in the paper industry. You can make oil or margarine out of the seeds of the cotton plant. The leaves and stalks of the cotton plant are plowed into the ground to make the soil better.
