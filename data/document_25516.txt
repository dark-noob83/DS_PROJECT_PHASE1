Re: are amberjack edible? Good question, we caught 4-5 nice Amberjack this past Monday. Guy I went with insisted they were not good to eat, but said he'd eaten one in the Gulf area and it was good. Are they safe to eat and are they good to eat? I read on a webpage that some amberjacks, like barracuda, can acquire cigueratoxin in their flesh from the reef fish that they eat. I've been told that barracudas caught around here (SE US coast) should not be eaten because of this toxin.
