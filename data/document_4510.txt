It depends on which liquid it is. For example, water's freezing and melting point is 0 degrees celsius, whereas a liquid with a greater viscosity may freeze at 5 degrees celsius.
At temperatures below 32 ° F (0 ° C), liquid water freezes; 32 ° F (0 ° C) is the freezing point of water. At temperatures above 32 ° F (0 ° C), pure water ice melts and changes state from a solid to a liquid (water); 32 ° F (0 ° C) is the melting point.
No all liquids do not freeze at the same temperature because for example ,water ,water will freeze faster because it has less indgreidents and juice has more indre … dients so it might freeze 2nd.and if u have vinegar it will freeze last.
1 32°F (0°C) . 2  Share that the temperature at which fresh water freezes is called the freezing point. 3  The freezing point is the temperature at which a liquid turns to a solid. 4  The freezing point at which water — a liquid — turns to ice — a solid — is 32°F (0°C).
That temperature is above the freezing point of the water in your glass, but below its boiling point. So the water is liquid. But 72° is lower than the freezing point of glass, so the glass tumbler is solid, and it's holding the liquid water very nicely.
The freezing point or melting point of water is the temperature at which water changes phase from a liquid to a solid or vice versa. Thomas Northcut, Getty Images. Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.
The freezing point describes the liquid to solid transition while the melting point is the temperature at which water goes from a solid (ice) to liquid water.
No. Every substance has its own freezing and boiling temperatures, and they're rarely the same as the freezing or boiling temperature of any other substance. Here's someth … ing to consider: You're sitting in your easy chair, enjoying a glass of water and breathing comfortably.
Almost everything has a unique temperature at which it will freeze/melt and condense/boil. The temperature that it melts at is the same that it freezes at.
