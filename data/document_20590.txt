Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God Bible: St Matthew.
