Full Definition of DATABASE. : a usually large collection of data organized especially for rapid search and retrieval (as by a computer). â€” database transitive verb.
db-Computer Definition. In physics, one-tenth (1 / 10) of a bel (B). Bel is a measure of comparative power, or loudness, i.e., a unit of relative power ratio.
dBP) is positive. Part of the Electronics glossary: In electronics and communications, the decibel (abbreviated as dB, and also as db and DB) is a logarithmic expression of the ratio between two signal power, voltage, or current levels. In acoustics, the decibel is used as an absolute indicator of sound power per unit area.
(Note also the factor 10 in the definition, which puts the 'deci' in decibel). Sound pressure, sound level and dB. Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, p. Now the power in a sound wave, all else equal, goes as the square of the pressure.
The decibel (dB) is used to measure sound level, but it is also widely used in electronics, signals and communication. The dB is a logarithmic way of dscribing a ratio. The ratio may be power, sound pressure, voltage or intensity or several other things. Later on we relate dB to the phon and the sone (related to loudness). But first, to get a taste for logarithmic expressions, let's look at some numbers.
