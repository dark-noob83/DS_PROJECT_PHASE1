Diabetic retinopathy is caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. When these blood vessels are damaged, they may leak blood and grow fragile new vessels. When the nerve cells are damaged, vision is impaired.
A scar is the body's natural way of healing and replacing lost or damaged skin. A scar is usually composed of fibrous tissue. Scars may be formed for many different reasons, including as a result of infections, surgery, injuries, or inflammation of tissue. Scars may appear anywhere on the body, and the composition of a scar may vary-appearing flat, lumpy, sunken, colored, painful, or itchy.
“Scar tissue will always form inside the blood vessel and, in many cases, eventually block blood flow,” said Guillermo Ameer, professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering.
The organs in your body need oxygen to survive. Oxygen is carried through the body by the blood. When the heart beats, it creates pressure that pushes blood through a network of tube-shaped arteries and veins, also known as blood vessels and capillaries. The pressure --- blood pressure --- is the result of two forces.
The blood vessels may form scar tissue, which can pull on the retina causing a retinal detachment. A fluorescein angiogram is used to evaluate the retinal blood flow. Laser treatment is performed on those patients who develop neovascularization.
1 Second, the overstretching can cause tiny tears in the blood vessels that leave scar tissue on the walls of arteries and veins. 2  These tears and the scar tissue are like nets, and can catch debris such as cholesterol or blood cells traveling in the bloodstream.
Angioid streaks are small cracks in the retina similar to those seen in a pane of glass that is partially broken. Angioid streaks are not a problem; however, the weakened retina is susceptible to the development of new blood vessel growth and scar formation.
