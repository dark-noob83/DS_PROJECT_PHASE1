Best Answer: The time a satellite takes to orbit the Earth depends on how high it is above the Earth's surface-the higher the orbit, the longer it takes to circle the Earth. Most satellites in what is called Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are at a height of roughly 250 miles and take a little over 90 minutes for each orbit.
During a 24 hour period, how many times does the ISS orbit the Earth? Well, the space station orbits Earth about every 90 minutes, so that means in a 24 hour day, the space station orbits approximately 16 times.
How far does the ISS orbit? The ISS (International Space Station) orbits at an altitude of approximately 350 kilometres (220 miles) above the surface of the Earth, travelling at an average speed of 27,72 … 4 kilometres (17,227 mi) per hour, completing 15.7 orbits per day.
Orbital period The International Space Station completes 15.79 orbits per day, or about one orbit every 90 minutes.
The International Space Station travels in orbit around Earth at a speed of roughly 17,150 miles per hour (that's about 5 miles per second!). This means that the Space Station orbits Earth (and sees a sunrise) once every 92 minutes!
Share to: The International Space Station is maintained in a near circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of 278 km (173 mi) and a maximum of 460 km (286 mi). Atmospheric drag gradu … ally slows the station down and it moves closer to earth.
