The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease, which affects the blood flow to the heart and can cause a heart attack. The term heart disease refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease, which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack. Learn more about heart disease, heart attack, and related conditions:
Part A Complete the following statements: 1. The term blood pressure most commonly is used to refer to systemic ____________________ pressure. 2. The maximum pressure achieved during ventricular contraction is called ____________________ pressure. 3. 
Blood pressure when the heart beats is called systolic pressure. Blood pressure when the heart is at rest is called diastolic pressure. When blood pressure is measured, the systolic pressure is stated first and the diastolic pressure second. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). a common disorder that is a known cardiovascular disease risk factor, characterized by elevated blood pressure over the normal values of 120/80 mm Hg in an adult over 18 years of age. This elevation in blood pressure can be divided into three classes of hypertension.
High blood pressure is the most common chronic medical problem prompting visits to primary health care providers in USA. The American Heart Association estimated the direct and indirect costs of high blood pressure in 2010 as $76.6 billion. The systolic pressure occurs when the left ventricle is most contracted; the diastolic pressure occurs when the left ventricle is most relaxed prior to the next contraction. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60–90 mmHg diastolic. Hypertension is present if the blood pressure is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg for most adults; different numbers apply to childre
In normal health care two types of blood pressure is messured; the diastolic and the systolic. The systolic blood pressure is the pressure the heart generates when it contra … cts and sends out a pulse of blood through the arteries. The diastolic pressure is the pressure that resides in the arteries between heartbeats. Typical systolic pressure: 120 mmHg Typical diastolic pressure: 80 mmHg. The diastolic BP is the pressure in the arteries after the blood has been pumped out and before the next heart contraction. At this moment, the heart is relaxed and the pressure is much lower. The normal blood pressure is 120/80. In this case, 120 is the systolic BP and 80 is the diastolic BP.
Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. It has many causes, and is a risk factor for a number of other medical conditions, including coronary artery disease, aortic dissection, and heart failure. Hypotension. Hypotension refers to abnormally low blood pressure. 
JNC7 (2003) uses the term prehypertension for blood pressure in the range 120–139 mmHg systolic and/or 80–89 mmHg diastolic, while ESH-ESC Guidelines (2007) and BHS IV (2004) use optimal, normal and high normal categories to subdivide pressures below 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic. The systolic pressure occurs when the left ventricle is most contracted; the diastolic pressure occurs when the left ventricle is most relaxed prior to the next contraction. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60–90 mmHg diastolic. Hypertension is present if the blood pressure is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg for most adults; different numbers apply to children
