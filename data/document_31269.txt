A product that contains 30 billion CFU of 6 strains of shelf-stable Bifidobacterium (2-B. lactis strains, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis and B. longum) is Ultimate Flora RTS Senior Care Probiotic from Renew Life. It is gluten-and dairy-free at can be found at.
The chromosomes of Bifidobacterium longum contain 60% Guanine cytosine bonds. This microbe has a genome length of 2.26Mb. Often found as a supplement in yogurts or other fermented foods, Bifidobacterium longum converts sugars into lactic acid via fermentation. This helps to lower the pH in the lower intestine.
Probiotics are healthy bacteria that help protect you from unhealthy bacteria and aid in the digestive process. Bifidobacterium lactis is a type of probiotic found in the intestines. Several foods also contain this bacteria, including some types of fermented milk products like yogurt. Since it can survive the digestive process, foods containing this bacteria may provide some health benefits.
Like other Bifidobacterium species, B. longum is a lactic-acid bacteria that also produces acetic acid, ethanol, and formic acid. B. longum is capable of producing succinic acid, too, as long as it is consuming nutrients. The succinic acid is involved in energy production in your body.
Lactobacillus bacteria belong to a class of bacteria known as lactic acid bacteria. Bifidobacterium produce lactic acid as an end product of fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria ferment foods, which lowers the pH level and prevents harmful bacterial growth. In some cases, such as certain types of yogurt, fermented foods contain live bacteria cultures that might have beneficial intestinal effects.
Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are two microorganisms that can metabolize lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. These two bacteria have also demonstrated effectiveness in a number of health-related applications and are referred to as friendly bacteria or probiotics.
