Penguin eating habits. Penguins are some of the most interesting birds and, while there are many different varieties of penguins, most eat the same things and about 2 pounds of food a day. Considering a penguin' s size and how many of them flock together, it can be difficult for them all to find enough food everyday

Penguins get squid to eat less often than either krill or fish because squid don't frequent arctic waters. When a penguin is lucky enough to spot a few (penguins eat small squid, around 4 to 5 inches long), he'll dive or slide into the water, swim quickly after the squid, and catch the squid in his mouth. Penguins are some of the most interesting birds and, while there are many different varieties of penguins, most eat the same things and about 2 pounds of food a day.
Where Penguins Get Their Food. Young penguins depend on their parents for food. While the males spend much of their time on land, either protecting the eggs or tending babies, the females are busy eating food and storing it in a special place in their body. What Penguins Eat. Like most creatures, other than human and other animal babies who get food that others give to them, penguins find their food. In this case, food is found in the ocean, which is the penguins' main habitat
Penguins play a cat-and-mouse-game with their prey. They start looking for fish by diving at a rate of 5 till 10 km/hr and under an angle of 5 degree till 85 degrees. On a certain depth they either swim a while horizontally or they ascend again under the same angle. Of course the fish tries to escape. While penguins need air to breath, they have to go to the surface of the water after a few minutes. Luckily for them, their prey can't dive deeper either, because the lack on oxygen and food so deep in the water. To find out when and where penguins eat what, scientists of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut fuer Für-polar Und meeresforschung developed a special. Sensor a penguin is an-warm blooded (animal body temperature is about°39), c but their prey has only a temperature of -about °2 c + till °13. c
All types of penguins are meat eaters and so they scan the waters to gain access to live food. What they will consume depends on where they live and what is readily available. In many areas the food source can be scarce at times so the penguins will consume anything they can get their mouths on in the water. The primary sources of food for penguins include krill, small fish, squid, and crustaceans. Many species of penguins prefer to hunt near the shoreline. They will dive deeply though to find their food sources if they need to. The depth they can go to depends on the type of penguin that is being referred to
How They Drink. Penguins drink the same way most birds do: by swallowing water. Although that's nothing special, penguins often have little choice but to swallow saltwater. When they're swimming in the ocean, they use their strong beaks to catch fish and other prey. Some even eat snow as a source of water. Penguins in zoos live in fresh water, and some species, such as rockhopper penguins, prefer to live around fresh water instead of saltwater. The supraorbital gland serves only one purpose -- to filter salt from the blood -- so it's not used when penguins drink only fresh water.
When Adelie penguins are on their nest sometimes for days at a time, they do not eat, instead they live off the fat layers that have formed from lots of previous eating. 11.
