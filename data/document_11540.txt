You can predict how much power a given solar panel can generate by multiplying the watt rating of a solar panel by the number of peak sun hours for your location. Note that the sun hours will vary by season, and are lowest during the winter. For homeowners and small businesses, roof-mounted panels are a typical option. Solar panels rated at 100 to 200 watts cover about 10 square feet (1 square meter).
All solar panels are rated by the DC power produced in standard test conditions. A typical solar panel produces about 200 watts of electricity based on the efficiency and size of what’s installed. For example, if you have 25 panels installed, you may have an output of about 5 kilowatt hours (kWh). 
Report Abuse. Solar panels produce electric power according to their size, efficiency and how much sunlight they receive. For homeowners and small businesses, roof-mounted panels are a typical option. Solar panels rated at 100 to 200 watts cover about 10 square feet (1 square meter). Most solar panels today operate at around 12 - 14 % efficiency, meaning they convert about 1/8 of the suns energy to electricity, the rest just heats up the panel. That might sound terrible, but consider many of our current day technologies.
Save. Solar panels produce electric power according to their size, efficiency and how much sunlight they receive. For homeowners and small businesses, roof-mounted panels are a typical option. Solar panels rated at 100 to 200 watts cover about 10 square feet (1 square meter). The power you get from a 100-watt solar panel depends on how much sunlight it receives, and on a daily basis the total power is much less than the rated wattage.

Typically, a 3 to 4 kW solar panel system will produce enough energy for a family sized home, while a 2 to 3 kW will typically be the right size for a smaller household. An average 4 kW solar panel system will generate around 3,400kWh of free electricity a year. That’s enough electricity to individually power: 1  4,857 hours of the washing machine. 2  97,143 hours of the fridge. 3  1,880 hours of boiling the kettle. 4  1,417 hours of the oven. 
Generally, a solar energy system will provide output for about 5 hours per day. So, if you have a 1.8 kW system size and it produces for 5 hours a day, 365 days a year: This solar energy system will produce 3,285 kWh in a year (1.8 kW x 5 hours x 365 days). If the PV panels are shaded for part of the day, the output would be reduced in accordance to the shading percentage. 
Solar Panels are a form of active solar power, a term that describes how solar panels make use of the sun's energy: solar panels harvest sunlight and actively convert it to electricity. Solar Cells, or photovoltaic cells, are arranged in a grid-like pattern on the surface of the solar panel. 
Left on for 10 hours, it will consume 1000 watt-hours, which is the same as 1 kilowatt-hour, or 1 kWh. Similarly (and under ideal conditions), if a 345 watt solar panel is left in the brightest sun for 1 hour, it will generate 345 watt-hours of energy. Under those same ideal conditions, after three hours, it will generate a little over 1 kWh.
High end solar panels generate 200 watts at 18 volts. Households (USA) require 120 volts, so you would need 7 panels each at 18 volts, to match the energy usage of 200 watts at 120 volts. The cost for 7 panels is about $6000. Report Abuse. Specifically, the amount of energy a solar panel can generate is it's peak rating (in watts) times the insolation averaged over an entire day (in hours), giving a value in watt-hours. For example: A 100 watt panel gets an average of 5 hours of good sun/day. It would generate 500 watt-hours, or 0.5 KWH
