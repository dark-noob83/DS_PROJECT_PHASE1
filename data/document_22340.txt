**** Rainforests by Michael G. 2001 In an average year the climate in a tropical rain forest is very humid because of all the rainfall. A tropical rainforest gets about 150 cm of rain per year. It gets lots of rain because it is very hot and wet in rain forests. The hotter the air, the more water vapor it can hold. The tropical rain forest is a forest of tall trees in a region of year-round warmth. An average of 50 to 260 inches (125 to 660 cm.) of rain falls yearly. Rain forests belong to the tropical wet climate group. The temperature in a rain forest rarely gets higher than 93 °F (34 °C) or drops below 68 °F (20 °C); average humidity is between 77 and 88%; rainfall is often more than 100 inches a year
Whats the average amount of rainfall in the tropical rainforest per year? In an average year in a tropical rainforest, the climate is very humid do to all of the rain which amounts to about 250cm per year. add me: shizukayoshiro@yahoo.com oh, a … nd me to ;) mad1990@live.com, my facebook is cartoon artist maarij faruqi. my google is Maarij12345@gmail.com.
A average tropical rainforest recieves more than 150cm of rain a year. This is almost 1/8 of an inch per day. Although the rainforest recieves large amounts of rain, not all of it makes it to the forest floor. In fact, less than 30% of the rain fall reaches the forest ground. Seasons in a tropical rainforest are not depicted by the type of weather but by the amount of rainfall. In the chart shown below, March is the most rainiest month for part of the Amazon in Manaus Brazil with about 325 mm

In an average year in a tropical rain forest, the climate is very humid because of all the rainfall, which amounts to about 250 cm per year. The rain forest has lots of rain because it is very hot and wet. This climate is found near the equator. 
Rainforests are characterized by heavy annual rainfall, thick vegetation and diverse plant and animal species. At a minimum, a true tropical rainforest receives 80 inches of rainfall annually. Most receive much more. The state of Kentucky, by comparison, receives an average of 40 to 50 inches of rain per year. This means even the driest of rainforests get twice the rainfall Kentucky does. True tropical rainforest -- equatorial evergreen rainforest -- typically receives at least 2,000 millimeters (80 in.) of annual rainfall, but the wettest may get 10,000 millimeters (304 in.) or more. The rain falls year-round, because there are no warm and cool seasonal changes to affect rainfall amount
The tropical rainforest has a relatively constant temperature throughout the year. The average temperature is 22°C (70°F) and it usually stays within a 2.2°C range. The monthly precipitation in tropical rainforests varies greatly depending on the season. The annual precipitation is 262 cm (103 in).
