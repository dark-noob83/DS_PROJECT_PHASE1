1 Epoxy is a class of resin derived by polymerization from epoxides. 2  Epoxies are used chiefly in adhesives and coatings. 3  Epoxy is a thermosetting resin capable of forming tightly linked cross-polymer structures. 4  Epoxy is characterized by toughness and strong adhesion, especially when used for floor coatings.
When considering the effectiveness of an epoxy adhesive, it is useful to analyze the general formulation of the compounds that constitute it. Epoxies are created by polymerizing a mixture of two starting compounds, the resin and the hardener. When resin is mixed with a specified catalyst, curing is initiated. Curing is the process by which molecular chains react at chemically active sites, resulting in an exothermic reaction.
Carpenters glue (or wood glue) is made of (note: some brands may substitute or replace items on this list):   Homologues Homologues are chemicals added to wood glue to incr â€¦ ease bond strength. This ingredient is derived from animal tissue to make gelatin.
There are three main types of simple organic glue derived from animal bones, hides, and fish; the collagen protein contained in bones, skin, sinews and connective tissues of animals provides the properties of these adhesives. Glue can also be produced from blood albumen, vegetable extracts, and milk solids.
Basics. Epoxy resin is a hard substance created when two substances, a epoxide and a polyamine, are combined. It most cases the two chemicals are epichlorahydrin and bisphenol-A. The epoxy is used in many different applications such as creating molds, strengthening fiberglass and in heat-resistant situations.
Epoxy is a term used to denote both the basic components and the cured end products of epoxy resins, as well as a colloquial name for the epoxide functional group.
