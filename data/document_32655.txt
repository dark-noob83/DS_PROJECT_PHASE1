Carb grams/day range*: 180–308 grams. Carb grams/meal range (3 meals per day): 60–103 grams. *Based on 45%–­65% of calories from carbohydrate. Note: These recommendations are the same for a woman of small stature who wants to maintain weight. The biggest problem is too many total calories and the types of calories consumed. Research shows Americans eat too much added sugar (22 teaspoons a day, which translates to about 350 calories!) and not enough fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day. You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label. 
Each meal and snack will contain a specific total number of grams of carbohydrate. For example: Each gram of carbohydrate provides 4 calories. A person with diabetes on a 1,600 calorie diet should get 50% of these calories from carbohydrates. This would be a total of 800 calories of carbohydrates (at 4 calories per gram) spread out over the day.
What to Limit. Carbohydrates. Your goal should be to limit your carb intake to between 45 and 65 percent of total calories per day. In other words, if you are consuming 2200 calories per day, no more than 1430 of that should come from carbohydrates. In addition, you should aim to eat at least 130 grams of carbs every day, split evenly throughout the day. To make things even easier, our recipe filter uses a point system, whereby every 15 grams of carbohydrates are worth 1 “carbohydrate choice.” The idea is that you can then determine how many carb choices you get per day, and “use” them as you like.
Per Meal. Women should have between 2 and 3.5 carbohydrate servings per meal, while men can have between 3 and 4. A carbohydrate serving is considered 15 grams, meaning that the total number of carbohydrates a woman should have at one sitting is between 30 and 55 grams and for men is 50 to 65. Save. A diabetic's daily carbohydrate intake varies based on age, weight, gender, activity level and goal. An individual diabetic's needs can also vary, if he is to be active one day, but resting the next. Roughly half of all calories should come from carbohydrates, regardless of the day's carbohydrate total.
Carb grams/day range*: 259–455 grams. Carb grams/meal range (3 meals per day): 86–151 grams. *Based on 45%–65% of calories from carbohydrate. Note: Men who are under 65 years of age, moderate to large in stature, at a healthy weight, and get a lot of exercise may need more calories and grams of carbohydrate. The biggest problem is too many total calories and the types of calories consumed. Research shows Americans eat too much added sugar (22 teaspoons a day, which translates to about 350 calories!) and not enough fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods.

Intake Recommendations. If you have prediabetes, carbohydrates should comprise about 50 percent to 60 percent of your total daily caloric intake. Carbohydrates contain 4 calories per gram. Based on a 2,000 calorie diet, this means you should consume approximately 1,000 to 1,200 calories from carbohydrates. This amounts to 250 g to 300 g of carbohydrates daily. In general, most women should consume between 1,800 and 2,200 total calories per day. 
If on a 180-gram carbohydrate diet, but you can't consume 60 grams of carbohydrates per meal three times a day, try smaller meals, say four 40-gram carbohydrate meals and a 20-gram snack. Always add grams from snacks to your daily carbohydrate total. Save. A diabetic's daily carbohydrate intake varies based on age, weight, gender, activity level and goal. An individual diabetic's needs can also vary, if he is to be active one day, but resting the next. Roughly half of all calories should come from carbohydrates, regardless of the day's carbohydrate total.
