It depends upon the flower. Some flowers are beautiful to attract insects or birds. Some flowers look like the mate of the insect that pollinates them. Some flowers have prett â€¦ y colors to guide the insects to where the nectar is, kind of like a person waving flags on a runway for planes. The insects are looking for nectar and the plant wants to be pollinated. so it puts the pollen very close to the nectar so the insect gets pollen on it while gathering the nectar. The nectar is the insect's reward for picking up the pollen.
Flowers produce nectar as a reward for pollination, the process of transferring pollen from flower to flower. Many flowers need pollen to reproduce. However, because plants are immobile they need help with pollen transfer. An animal that transfers pollen from flower to flower is called a pollinator. By rewarding pollinators with nectar, the animals inadvertently help the plant with pollen transfer. This monarch, covered with sticky grains of pollen, is serving as a pollinator. Nectar is a sweet liquid secreted by plants, and especially by flowers. Nectars range in sweetness from as little as 8% to as high as 50%. The concentration of sugar in Coca-cola is only 10%, for comparison.
Bees do not get sticky for the same reason you do not when you drink something sweet. Unless you use your hands to eat. They get pollen all over their feet and face but drink the nectar through a tongue like structure. Pollen is collected inadvertently on the hairs of the feet. It would be no more sticky to bees than it would if you got pollen on your hands. Next time you see a daisy rub your finger on the yellow center. Buhjones is mistaken; pollen is *not* made into honey. Pollen particles are dry and powdery. They brush off the flower onto the bee (bees are very fuzzy -- they even have hairs on their eyes!) The bee uses her legs to brush the pollen off herself.
Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Nectar secretion increases as the flower is visited by pollinators. After pollination, the nectar is frequently reabsorbed into the plant.
Many flowers force insects to come in contact with pollen while foraging for nectar by positioning the anthers in such a place that the insects will brush up against them. The pollen grains will stick the body of the insect, especially if it is hairy and electrostatically charged, as bees are. Pollen is used to fertilize the plant via the process of pollination, which is defined specifically as the transfer of pollen from the male anthers to the flower's stigma, the female part of the plant. Pollination produces fruit and seed. Pollen contains the plant's genetic code.
Nectar by Neckbeard. Sticky caramel and creamy vanilla spiked with the perfect touch of mild, toasted tobacco. A completely new take on the classic RY4, Nectar is a well-balanced, savory, and sweet candied tobacco. 
Cuckoo bees, Coelioxys spp. are true nectar thieves. The have no pollen-collecting structures on their legs. They only visit flowers for nectar because they are cleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bees. This particular cuckoo bee is a cleptoparasite of leafcutter bees, Megachile spp. Pollen is aggregated in sac-like bundles called pollinia, located on either side of the stigmatic chamber. The two bundles are strung together with a gland (filament) at the top of the stigmatic chamber. Bees, wasps, flies, beetles and butterflies visit the flowers for nectar. Milkweed plants typically produce a lot of nectar, it is replenished overnight, to the delight of nocturnal moths, and the remaining nectar is ready for the first diurnal visitors in the morning
