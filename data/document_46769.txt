the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis introduction rheumatoid arthritis ra is considered to develop as a result of interactions between inherited genetic factors and environmental factors things that we are exposed to in the environment such as cigarette smoking
rheumatoid arthritis is a disease where the immune system attacks the lining of some joints this cause pain and swelling in those joints the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not completely understood we know that it effects women more than men and that it is more common in people that smoke
as with many diseases the causes of rheumatoid arthritis appear to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors the genetic factors that affect the development of rheumatoid arthritis cannot be changed but the environmental factors can
rheumatoid arthritis ra is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting 0 5 1 % of the population worldwide the disease has a heterogeneous character including clinical subsets of anti citrullinated protein antibody acpa positive and apca negative disease
a arthritis means inflammation in a joint that inflammation causes redness warmth swelling and pain within the joint rheumatoid arthritis affects joints on both sides of the body such as both hands both wrists or both knees this symmetry helps to set it apart from other types of arthritis
the research also suggests a shared disease pathway for ra and lupus for this complex disease rheumatoid arthritis this is the first instance of a genetic linkage study leading to a chromosomal location which then in a genetic association study identified a disease susceptibility gene says dr gregersen
a genetic variation has been identified that increases the risk of two chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases rheumatoid arthritis ra and systemic lupus erythematosus lupus
rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body s immune system attacks joints and other tissues the pattern of joints affected is usually symmetrical involves the hands and other joints and is worse in the morning
