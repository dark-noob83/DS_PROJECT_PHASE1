Best Answer: It depends on the type of the bacteria .Some grow well in 20degrees Celsius and other 85 degrees.The optimum growing temperature is different for distinct bacterial groups.It really depens on the microbe some grow very well in warm temp (thermphiles).
The best temperature for bacterial growth is around the same temperature as the human body, 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C).
The temperature range in which most bacteria grow is between 40 degrees F (5 degrees C) and 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Raw and cooked foods should not be kept in this danger zone any longer than absolutely necessary. Undercooking or improper processing of home-canned foods can cause very serious food poisoning.
1 Temperature-Bacteria grow best in the temperature range between 4ºC and 60ºC. 2  Temperature below 4ºC, and temperature between 60ºC and 74ºC, will not kill bacteria, but it will not allow them to multiply enough times to cause an illness.
