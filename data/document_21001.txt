The parathyroids produce a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTHPTH-parathyroid hormone raises the blood calcium level by: 1  breaking down the bone (where most of the body's calcium is stored) and causing calcium release. 2  increasing the body's ability to absorb calcium from food.
Parathyroid gland. parathyroid gland. (Science: anatomy, endocrinology) Four small endocrine glands lying close or embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. They secrete the hormone parathormone. Please contribute to this project, if you have more information about this term feel free to edit this page.

The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands, located in the neck, that control the body's calcium levels. Each gland is about the size of a grain of rice (weighs approximately 30 milligrams and is 3-4 millimeters in diameter). PTHPTH-parathyroid hormone raises the blood calcium level by: 1  breaking down the bone (where most of the body's calcium is stored) and causing calcium release. 2  increasing the body's ability to absorb calcium from food.
1 If calcium levels are low and PTH levels are normal or low, then PTH is not responding properly and the person tested probably has hypoparathyroidism. 2  Hypoparathyroidism is a failure of the parathyroid glands to produce sufficient PTH. The so-called intact PTH is the most frequently ordered parathyroid hormone test. It is used to help diagnose the cause of a low or high calcium level and to help distinguish between parathyroid-related and non-parathyroid-related causes.
The parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, variably located on the back of the thyroid gland, although considerable variation exists. Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin (one of the hormones made by the thyroid gland) have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones. The parathyroid glands are two pairs of glands usually positioned behind the left and right lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6 mm long and 3 to 4 mm wide, and 1 to 2 mm anteroposteriorly.
Parathyroid Glands. Parathyroid glands are small tissue masses located on the posterior side of the thyroid. These glands vary in number, but typically two or more may be found in the thyroid. Parathyroid glands contain many cells that secrete hormones and have access to extensive blood capillary systems. Parathyroid glands produce and secrete parathyroid hormone. This hormone helps to regulate calcium concentrations by increasing blood calcium levels when these levels dip below normal. Parathyroid hormone counteracts calcitonin, which decreases blood calcium levels
1 If calcium levels are high and PTH levels are high, then the parathyroid glands are producing inappropriately high amounts of PTH. 2  A health practitioner may order X-rays or other imaging studies to help determine the cause and evaluate the severity of hyperparathyroidism. The so-called intact PTH is the most frequently ordered parathyroid hormone test. It is used to help diagnose the cause of a low or high calcium level and to help distinguish between parathyroid-related and non-parathyroid-related causes.
As a component of the endocrine system, the thyroid secretes hormones that control important functions including metabolism, growth, heart rate, and body temperature. Found within thyroid tissue are structures known as parathyroid glands. Parathyroid glands contain many cells that secrete hormones and have access to extensive blood capillary systems. Parathyroid glands produce and secrete parathyroid hormone. This hormone helps to regulate calcium concentrations by increasing blood calcium levels when these levels dip below normal.
The parathyroid glands are variable in number: three or more small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are two pairs of glands usually positioned behind the left and right lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6 mm long and 3 to 4 mm wide, and 1 to 2 mm anteroposteriorly.
Thyroid gland: A gland that makes and stores hormones that help regulate the heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and the rate at which food is converted into energy. Thyroid hormones are essential for the function of every cell in the body. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland, acts to stimulate hormone production by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland also makes the hormone calcitonin, which is involved in calcium metabolism and stimulating bone cells to add calcium to bone.
