Contribution limits and restrictions. The annual contribution limit for Coverdell ESAs is $2,000 per beneficiary. That's considerably less than you can contribute to most 529 plans (most plans have lifetime contribution limits of at least $300,000 total). So the more money you have to invest, the more attractive a 529 plan becomes.
Taxpayers with an income above $220,000 for a joint return and $110,000 for all others cannot contribute to anyone’s Coverdell Education Savings Account.• Family members can coordinate their contributions. If parents don’t qualify, a grandparent can make the contribution.
Grandparents can either contribute to an existing educational IRA or open a new one for the grandchild as long as the account is in the grandchild's name. The total annual contributions for any one grandchild, however, cannot exceed $2,000.
Who Can Contribute. Subject to the income limitation described below, anyone can contribute to a Coverdell account for a particular child. Parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles — even a friend of the family can set one up. The child can even contribute to his or her own Coverdell account.
What's more, if someone else has contributed to a Coverdell account for the same child, the amount you can contribute is reduced. The $2,000 limit applies to all contributions from all contributors to all Coverdell accounts for any one child for a given year.
But in 2001, federal lawmakers renamed the educational IRA to the Coverdell Education Savings Account, and they raised the annual contribution ceiling to $2,000. Grandparents can make contributions to these educational accounts up the child's 18th birthday.
