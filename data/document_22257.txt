Chlamydia is curable and treatment is easy. If you test positive for chlamydia, a doctor can prescribe antibiotics to kill the chlamydia bacteria. Remember, both you and your partner must be treated for chlamydia before you can have any kind of sex again. It's the best way to avoid getting re-infected. The Chlamydia Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) Test is a urine test, offered in both of the test panels. This test is highly recommended by the CDC for its accuracy. There's no swabbing-all you do is pee in a cup.
Until the legal system changes, only a positive culture result proving infection with chlamydia is admissible in court. Other chlamydia tests include direct fluorescent antibody stain (DFA), which detects chlamydia antigens, and DNA probe, another test that looks for chlamydia DNA but that is less sensitive than NAAT. Testing for both chlamydia and gonorrhea may be done when a newborn has symptoms of conjunctivitis, such as redness and swelling of the eye, and discharge.
Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. Tests used to find a chlamydia infection include: 1  Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) . 2  These tests find the genetic material (DNA) of chlamydia bacteria. 3  These tests are very good at identifying chlamydia. If your chlamydia test is being done on a: 1  Urine sample: Do not urinate for 2 hours before a urine sample is collected. 2  Direct sample (usually from the cervix): A woman should not douche or use vaginal creams or medicines for 24 hours before having a chlamydia test.
Description: This test uses a urine sample to screen for Genital Chlamydia, a common bacterial infection transmitted through sexual contact. Unlike a swab test, a urine collection is pain free and allows the patient to collect their own specimen in privacy. The Chlamydia urine test is also included in our comprehensive Peace of Mind STD package. Turnaround time for Chlamydia testing results is typically 1-3 business days. Note: Result turn around times are an estimate and are not guaranteed.

A test for chlamydia is done to: 1  See whether symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) are caused by a chlamydia infection. 2  Check people who are at high risk for being infected with chlamydia. 3  A chlamydia infection does not always cause symptoms. If your chlamydia test is being done on a: 1  Urine sample: Do not urinate for 2 hours before a urine sample is collected. 2  Direct sample (usually from the cervix): A woman should not douche or use vaginal creams or medicines for 24 hours before having a chlamydia test.
1 These tests are very good at identifying chlamydia. 2  A test that is positive almost always means the problem is there and is unlikely to be a false-positive test result. 3  A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is an example of a nucleic acid amplification test. 4  This test can also be done on a urine sample. If your chlamydia test is being done on a: 1  Urine sample: Do not urinate for 2 hours before a urine sample is collected. 2  Direct sample (usually from the cervix): A woman should not douche or use vaginal creams or medicines for 24 hours before having a chlamydia test.
