This progressive process silently and slowly blocks arteries, putting blood flow at risk. Atherosclerosis is the usual cause of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease -- what together are called  cardiovascular disease .. Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer in America, with more than 800,000 deaths in 2005.
Usually aortic atherosclerosis is not as clinically apparent as coronary, peripheral, or even carotid artery atherosclerosis. Occlusive disease of the aorta occurs only rarely, and the principal disease of aortic atherosclerosis, although rare, often presents as a medical catastrophe.
Peripheral Arterial Disease. Peripheral arterial disease (P.A.D.) occurs if plaque builds up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your legs, arms, and pelvis. If blood flow to these parts of your body is reduced or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and, sometimes, dangerous infections.
Overview. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), or atherosclerosis of peripheral vessels, is the most common cause of symptomatic stenosis in the human vascular tree. The pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to PVD are similar to those of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Atherosclerosis is a major cause of abdominal aortic aneurysm and is the most common kind of arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. This disease process can be seen in any blood vessel in the body and is the cause of coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) .
