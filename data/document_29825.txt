A Perl subroutine or function is a group of statements that together performs a task. You can divide up your code into separate subroutines. How you divide up your code among different subroutines is up to you, but logically the division usually is so each function performs a specific task.
PL/Perl Functions and Arguments. To create a function in the PL/Perl language, use the standard CREATE FUNCTION syntax: The body of the function is ordinary Perl code. In fact, the PL/Perl glue code wraps it inside a Perl subroutine. A PL/Perl function must always return a scalar value.
To create a function in the PL/Perl language, use the standard CREATE FUNCTION syntax: The body of the function is ordinary Perl code. In fact, the PL/Perl glue code wraps it inside a Perl subroutine. A PL/Perl function is called in a scalar context, so it can't return a list.
I am trying to create a hash using a function in perl. Actually i was working on creating a binary search tree in perl. Below is the code : The trouble is that when i am printing the original hash, the data key gets replaced by whatever i am passing to the newhash function. The output:

Before getting into the Perl array examples, here's the code for a Perl function (subroutine) that I will use in all of the later examples to print the arrays I create: This is a simple Perl function, and just prints each array element that is passed in to it.
