These cells come off the stratified squamous epithelial tissue on the inner surface of the cheek. These cells show the irregular, flat shape characteristic of typical squamous cells.. The nucleus (A) is centrally located, the cell membrane (C) is very thin, and the cell is filled with cytoplasm (B).
Microscope at 100X. A stratified epithelium is an epithelium that is made up of a number of layers of cells. A stratified squamous epithelium is made up of a number of layers and the cells of the outer layers are flat (squamous). In the deepest layer new cells are produced by the division of stem cells.
Squamous. Squamous means scale-like. simple squamous epithelium is a single layer of flat scale-shaped cells. Both the endothelial lining of blood vessels and the mesothelial lining of the body cavities are simple squamous epithelium. Try to identify the simple squamous epithelia in these pictures.
The term epithelium refers to layers of cells that line hollow organs and glands. It is also those cells that make up the outer surface of the body. Epithelial cells help to protect or enclose organs.
