Introduction DOWANOL TPM glycol ether is an ideal choice when high polymer solvency and extended system residence time are required. It can maintain rheological properties over time in products such as stamp pads and ball point pen inks.
With very high water solubility and active solvency, DOWANOL ™ PM glycol ether is widely used in coating and cleaning applications. It offers better viscosity reduction than heavier molecular weight glycol ethers and is particularly effective in epoxy and high solids acrylic systems.
Glycol Ether Acetates: DOWANOL PMA propylene glycol methyl ether acetate is the reaction product of DOWANOL PM with acetic acid or anhydride. In this case, the “PM” designates propylene glycol methyl ether and the “A” designates the acetate resulting from esterification
Dow's DOWANOL™ product line provides hydrophilic glycol ethers used in a broad range of applications, including coatings, cleaners, and printing inks.
DOWANOL™ PPh Glycol Ether. DOWANOL™ PPh is a slow evaporating, very hydrophobic glycol ether. With its aromatic structure, this product is an excellent match for phenolic coatings and linings; it is also an excellent coalescent for acrylic-based latexes.
Di Methoxy Propanol (DPM). Dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether (also known as Methoxy Propoxy Propanol, Oxybispropanol, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, DPM, and Dowanol DPM) is a propylene oxide-based, or P series, glycol ether and has the formula C 7 H 16 O 3.
CHOHCH. 3. (major isomer). Product Description. DOWANOL™ PM glycol ether is the fastest evaporating solvent in the DOWANOL™. glycol ether family. With very high water solubility and active solvency, DOWANOL ™. PM glycol ether is widely used in coating and cleaning applications.
