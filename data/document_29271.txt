Installing an underground sprinkler system varies from region to region, but the cost depends on two main factors: the size of the lawn (the amount of pipe and number of sprinkler heads needed) and the quality of the parts used. For an average sized 2,500 square foot lawn the price ranges from $2,000 to $3,000. With a bigger lawn, one way to estimate the underground sprinkler system cost is to price it by zone. Routine maintenance on underground sprinkler systems includes replacing the timer ($100), valves ($25 apiece), valve boxes ($20), rotor heads ($25) and spray heads ($10). To replace most of these components, with labour, could cost $750-$1000. New pipes cost more. Doing it yourself would lower the cost
1 $300 per zone for a bare-bones drip system added to a sprinkler installation: Jeremy Walla of Aspen Ridge Lawn and Landscape in Rapid City, SD estimates it could be as low as $300 per zone, since you’d simply be plugging into an existing timer and setup. 1 $650-750 per zone for an average drip system with a varied planting, according to Andy Villaescusa of A-Plus Sprinkler and Landscape in Crestline, CA.
That is to say the cost of a sprinkler system for a property that is twice the size of another is not necessarily twice the price. This is because sprinkler systems run in zones. A zone is an area with pipe and approximately 5-10 sprinkler heads. One of the largest factors in the cost of your sprinkler system is the size of your property. The more pipe that needs to be laid and the more sprinkler heads that you need will make the price of your system rise.
1 Prices for underground sprinkler systems vary considerably by region and climate, but for an average 2,500-square-foot (50-x-50-foot) front yard, it's about $1,500-$2,500, while a sprinkler system for 5,000 square feet (front and back yards) costs about $2,500-$3,500. Installer: None yet. I have just received two estimates for a sprinkler system at my new (as of Oct. 2011) residence. House was built in 66 and new had a system. 1st quote seemed high at $6,000 then I got the second one for $10,000.
Bearing in mind these cost factors, the average cost of a professionally-installed lawn irrigation system is $500-$1,000 per zone, or around $2,500 to $5,000 for a typical ½ acre lot. Note, however, that zones are, proportional to the entire system cost, cheaper to install. This means that sprinkler system installation on a 4,000 sq. ft. lawn, for example, isn’t necessary twice as expensive as on a 2,000 sq. ft. lawn. Not only will a sprinkler system save you time, but it also conserves water (up to 25%) through its more efficient delivery system. Sprinkler system installation is cheaper than most homeowners think and DIY installation can save homeowners 30 to 40 percent over professional installation.
If you're tired of dragging that old lawn sprinkler around every few days, you may want to consider installing your own underground sprinkler system. By doing the job yourself, you can save 30 to 40 percent of the cost of a professional installation, and today's sprinkler components are easier than ever to assemble.

For example, a 40×40 lawn professionally installed with PVC can cost anywhere from $1200-$1600 (approx $400 or 25% of this is sprinkler parts) – this is a conservative estimate and it is best to call for an estimate but this will give you an idea. In comparison a Lawn Belt System can water a 40×40 square for about $240 with extra Lawn Belt to spare. (Custom Kit With Rotors $180 + $45 for extra LB and coupler and then shipping cost) or about 15 cents per square foot..
