Teacher professional development and classroom resources across the curriculum. Solid Waste Every year, the United States generates approximately 230 million tons of trash--about 4.6 pounds per person per day. Less than one-quarter of it is recycled; the rest is incinerated or buried in landfills.
The total amount of waste generated per year in this region is 160 million tonnes, with per capita values ranging from 0.1 to 14 kg/capita/day, and an average of 1.1 kg/capita/day. Current global MSW generation levels are approximately 1.3 billion tonnes per year, and are expected to increase to approximately 2.2 billion tonnes per year by 2025. This represents a signif-icant increase in per capita waste generation rates, from 1.2 to 1.42 kg per person per day in the next fifteen years.
Here are the biggest zingers I learned: • Consumers in North America and Europe waste about 209 to 253 pounds of food per person every year. The USDA says the average person in the U.S. eats 4.7 pounds of food per day. So that means the amount of food we each waste in the U.S. per year would feed us for about one and a half to two months (44 to 54 days to be exact). 
show more I am trying to work out what the average litreage of waste water (inc. sewage) produced per person per day in a typical domestic home. The reason is that I have to select an appropriately sized sewage/waste water pump tank to pump waste water from new house being built up by 3 metres to connect to main sewer. 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average American produces about 4.4 pounds (2 kg) of garbage a day, or a total of 29 pounds (13 kg) per week and 1,600 pounds (726 kg) a year. This only takes into consideration the average household member and does not count industrial waste or commercial trash. 
How much water does one person need to drink per day? you should drink at least 7 to 10 average sized glasses of water each day.   One average sized glass is about eight ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pint, 2 pints in a quar … t, and 4 quarts in a gallon, so, mathematically, there are about 128 ounces in a gallon.   If the eight ounces is divided by the 128 ounces, then the average person drinks roughly 0.625 gallons of water per day. Oh Crap! On average, people produce 1 ounce of fecal matter, or 'poop,' for each 12 pounds of body weight, so it depends on your weight. If we assume the average person weighs 150 pounds, that's about 12 oz (1.5 ilbs or a little under a kilogram).
Solid Waste. Every year, the United States generates approximately 230 million tons of trash--about 4.6 pounds per person per day. Less than one-quarter of it is recycled; the rest is incinerated or buried in landfills.
(April 2014). As a nation, Americans generate more waste than any other nation in the world with 4.6 pounds (2.04 kg) of municipal solid waste (MSW) per person per day, fifty five percent of which is contributed as residential garbage. 
On average humans excrete 128 g of fresh feces per person per day with a pH value of around 6.6. Fresh feces contains around 75% water and the remaining solid fraction is 84-93% organic solids.
