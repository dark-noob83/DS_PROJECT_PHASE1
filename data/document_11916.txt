You will want to double this amount because we used the 100 pound column and your recommended rate was 200 pounds per acre. So you will need to apply 2.76 pounds of N per 100 LBF. If your fertilizer is 25% N then you will apply 11.04 pounds of fertilizer
3. Tomatoes on 6-foot Centers with a 12-ft Wide Ditch/Access Road Every 6 Beds. In this example, neither the crop, bed spacing, nor fertilizer rate has changed. The bed spacing is 6-feet and the recommended N rate is still 200 pounds per acre. Therefore, the recommended N rate is still 2.76 pounds per 100 LBF.
4 Examples 1. Tomato on 6-foot bed centersYour nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendation is 200 pounds per acre. Using Table 2, you would go down the left-most column to the row with 6-foot typical bed spacing. Go across that row until you come to the column with the recommended fertilizer rate of 1
If your soil test report recommends applying 1.5 lb of nitrogen, 0.5 lb of phosphate, and 0.5 lb of potash per 1000 sq ft, you should apply a fertilizer with a ratio of 3-1-1 since you need three times as much nitrogen as phosphate and three times as much nitrogen as potash.

The rate of application will vary with the size of the tree. Two methods of determining fertilizer rates are commonly used for deciduous trees. 1  Diameter of Trunk-Apply 3 to 5 lb of 10-6-4 (or similar analysis fertilizer) for each inch of trunk diameter measured at 4 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 feet above ground.
Tomato on 5-foot Centers. Your nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendation is 200 pounds per acre. Using Table 2, proceed down the left-most column to the row with 6-foot typical bed spacing. Go across that row until you come to the column with the recommended fertilizer rate of 1
Your nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendation is 200 pounds per acre. Using Table 2, you would go down the left-most column to the row with 6-foot typical bed spacing. Go across that row until you come to the column with the recommended fertilizer rate of 1
The recommended N rate for watermelon is 150 pounds per acre for the typical bed spacing of 8 feet (Figure 3). From Tables 1 and 2, you must read down the 100 pound per acre column until you come to the 8-foot spacing row in Table 2.
