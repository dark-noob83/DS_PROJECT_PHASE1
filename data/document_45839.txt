Importantly, California’s salary requirement may be changing soon as a result of a minimum wage increase. As mentioned above, the current minimum wage is $8.00/hour, which means an exempt employee must normally earn twice that amount of minimum wage for a 40-hour work week (or $640 per week). A few days before this blog post was written, however, the California State Legislature passed an increase to the minimum wage. Full time employment in this context means the rate that the employee would make if they worked a full 40 hours per week. Currently, the minimum wage is set at $8.00/hour. So, the minimum salary for an exempt employee must be about $640 per week (or around $33,280 per year). Primary duties are exempt duties.
Since the state minimum wage is currently $9 an hour, that means an exempt employee must make an equivalent of more than $18 an hour, assuming a 40 hour work week, or more than $37,440 annually. California law does not require employers to pay overtime rates, provide breaks or track employee time for exempt workers. That means that an exempt California employee will be paid the same salary whether he works 40 hours or 70 hours in a week.
