SecurActive Performance Vision. A trunk is a line or link designed to handle many signal s simultaneously, and that connects major switching centers or node s in a communications system. The transmitted data can be voice (as in the conventional telephone system) data, computer programs, images, video or control signals. A trunk can also be a broadband wireless link. The use and management of trunks in a communications system is known as trunking. It minimizes the number of physical signal paths, and thus the total amount of cable hardware, required to serve a given number of subscribers in a network.
SIP is used to create and control the communications sessions that are the basis of VoIP telephony. SIP is also used for instant messaging, presence updates, multimedia, conferencing, and other real-time services that can traverse a SIP trunk. RTP manages the actual voice data in a VoIP calls. Determining which Type of Connection to Use for your SIP Trunk. A SIP trunk can be deployed over the Internet or over a line that is dedicated to your organization and that may or may not share bandwidth with other IP traffic.
A trunk line is a circuit connecting telephone switchboards (or other switching equipment), as distinguished from local loop circuit which extends from telephone exchange switching equipment to individual telephones or information origination/termination equipment. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI.
So, a SIP Trunk is a virtual IP based trunk line that uses the Internet to make calls / receive calls to land-line numbers, cell phone numbers and other VOIP numbers. The SIP Trunk is terminated on the PBX (both IP PBX and supported Analog-Mixed PBX models) and the user’s call can be sent over the Internet. 1 SIP Trunks come with their own telephone numbers, just like PSTN phone numbers which can be reached from anywhere. 2  It is possible to get a local phone number with a local area code (and) toll free numbers. 3  For each IP call, it is recommended to provision at least 80 kbps of upload / download Internet bandwidth.
In telecommunications, trunking is a method for a system to provide network access to many clients by sharing a set of lines or frequencies instead of providing them individually. This is analogous to the structure of a tree with one trunk and many branches. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI.
A SIP trunk is a direct connection between your organization and an Internet telephony service provider (ITSP). It enables you to extend voice over IP (VoIP) telephony beyond your organization’s firewall without the need for an IP-PSTN gateway. Determining which Type of Connection to Use for your SIP Trunk. A SIP trunk can be deployed over the Internet or over a line that is dedicated to your organization and that may or may not share bandwidth with other IP traffic.

In most countries the making of a domestic out-of-area or Trunk telephone call requires the dialing of a Trunk Access code (usually, a single digit) followed by an Area Code before dialing the customer's local area number. In most countries the Trunk Access code is 0. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A trunk prefix is a digit sequence to be dialed before a domestic telephone number to initiate a telephone call for the purpose of selecting an appropriate longer distant telecommunications circuit by which the call is to be routed.
