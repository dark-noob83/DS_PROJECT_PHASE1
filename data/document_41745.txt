Cellulitis can be caused by many types of bacteria. The most common is staph (Staphylococcus aureus), followed by strep (Group A Streptococcus). A form of cellulitis caused by strep is called erysipelas; it is characterised by a spreading hot, bright red circumscribed area on the skin with a sharp raised border.
The majority of cellulitis infections are caused by infection with either strep (Streptococcus) or staph (Staphylococcus) bacteria. The most common bacteria that cause cellulitis are beta-hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, G, and F).
Causes. Cellulitis occurs when bacteria, most commonly streptococcus and staphylococcus, enter through a crack or break in your skin. The incidence of a more serious staphylococcus infection called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasing.

In 50 to 60 percent of cases, skin injuries such as cuts, insect bites, or surgical incisions are the cause of the infection. Certain factors also increase risk for developing cellulitis.
