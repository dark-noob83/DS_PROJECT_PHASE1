Teppanyaki grills are commonly confused with the hibachi barbecue grill, which has a charcoal or gas flame and is made with an open grate design. With a solid griddle type cook surface, the teppanyaki is more suitable for smaller ingredients, such as rice, egg, and finely chopped vegetables. Soybean oil is typically used to cook the ingredients. Japanese-style teppanyaki may also use noodles (yakisoba) or cabbage with sliced meat or seafood (okonomiyaki), which are cooked using vegetable oil, animal fat, or a mixture.

I am curious as to what kind of oil they use at Japanese hibachi grills such as Benihana where they light it on fire and dip their hands in it and then transfer the burning oil to your hand. I need an oil that will flame easily but won't be so hot I can't touch it. Thanks.

Chef preparing a flaming onion volcano. Teppanyaki (鉄板焼き, teppan-yaki) is a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food. The word teppanyaki is derived from teppan (鉄板), which means iron plate, and yaki (焼き), which means grilled, broiled, or pan-fried. In Japan, teppanyaki refers to dishes cooked using an iron plate, including steak, shrimp, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, and monjayaki. Soybean oil is typically used to cook the ingredients. Japanese-style teppanyaki may also use noodles (yakisoba) or cabbage with sliced meat or seafood (okonomiyaki), which are cooked using vegetable oil, animal fat, or a mixture.
Like Hibachi steak, this chicken goes well with rice. Heat 1 tbsp. of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place 1 1/2 lbs. of bite-size boneless chicken pieces and mushrooms into skillet and cook until chicken is no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Add in 2 tbsp. of lemon juice and 2 tbsp. of sesame seeds. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. In a small bowl, combine 3 tbsp. of dry mustard and 2 tbsp. of hot water. The mixture will form a paste. Place the paste into a blender with the toasted sesame seeds, 3/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of crushed garlic. Blend on the highest setting for about one minute.
