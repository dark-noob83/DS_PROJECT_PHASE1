Advertisement. Prostate infection or prostatitis is the infection of the prostate gland that usually leads to inflammation and pain. Generally, the infection is caused by bacteria that reside in the large intestine.
How the prostate becomes infected is not clear. The bacteria that cause prostatitis may get into the prostate from the urethra by backward flow of infected urine or stool from the rectum. At one time, prostatitis was believed to be a sexually transmitted disease, but more recent research suggests that only a small number of cases are passed on through sex.
Chronic bacterial prostatitis is caused by an underlying problem in the prostate, such as prostate stones or BPH (enlarged prostate), which becomes the focus for bacteria in the urinary tract. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a common cause of frequent urinary tract infections in men.
Prostatitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection of the prostate gland. Any bacteria that can cause a urinary tract infection can cause acute bacterial prostatitis. Some sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can cause bacterial prostatitis. These include chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Prostate infections may irritate the prostate and cause inflammation and swelling of the gland. Prostate infections occur most often in men aged 30-50 years but can occur in older men.
This type of prostate infection is caused by bacteria in the prostate gland. A prostate infection might recur because antibiotics aren't able to get deep enough into the prostate tissue to destroy all of the bacteria or because the antibiotic isn't effective against the type of bacterium causing the prostate infection.
