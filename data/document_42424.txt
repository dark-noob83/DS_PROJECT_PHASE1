Mini muffins will take anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes while jumbo muffins will bake from 20 to 40 minutes. Check jumbo muffins for doneness after 20 minutes, then every 5 to 10 minutes. Keep in mind that the baking time will vary according to the recipe. The variation is due to the oven temperature and the amount of batter in each muffin cup.
