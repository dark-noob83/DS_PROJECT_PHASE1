Most of the time, this bleeding will happen 6 to 12 days after you ovulate and fertilization occurs. This is about one or two days after the blastocyst arrives in the uterus. You shouldnâ€™t mistake this implantation spotting for your period as it will happen earlier and with a flow that is significantly lighter.
The Association estimates that ovulation occurs anywhere between 11-21 days after the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), or 12-16 days from when you expect the next menstrual period to start. Order a Fertility Kit or Monitor.

Consider the timing. This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected.

Implantation typically occurs 6 to 10 days after ovulation, or day 20 to 24 of a menstrual cycle. However, it can happen a few days earlier or later. In an average 28-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14 with the first day of a woman's period being considered day 1 in a cycle.
