There are three primary sources of genetic variation, which we will learn more about: 1  Mutations are changes in the DNA. 2  Gene flow is any movement of genes from one population to another and is an important source of genetic variation. 3  Sex can introduce new gene combinations into a population. 1 A single mutation can have a large effect, but in many cases, evolutionary change is based on the accumulation of many mutations
A genetically modified organism, or GMO, is an organism that has had its DNA altered or modified in some way through genetic engineering. In most cases, GMOs have been altered with DNA from another organism, be it a bacterium, plant, virus or animal; these organisms are sometimes referred to as transgenic organisms. A gene from a spider that helps the arachnid produce silk, for example, could be inserted into the DNA of an ordinary goat
Acquired (or somatic) mutations occur at some time during a personâ€™s life and are present only in certain cells, not in every cell in the body. These changes can be caused by environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation from the sun, or can occur if a mistake is made as DNA copies itself during cell division. Acquired mutations in somatic cells (cells other than sperm and egg cells) cannot be passed on to the next generation. A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome that includes multiple genes
Most of the mutations are not harmful because they are not transcribed to the genes due to a mechanism called DNA repair mechanism. The causes of mutations are so many, but there are tow types of the causes 1- Spontaneous mutations caused by mutagens. 2- Induced mutations caused by radiation, some chemicals. Answers. Best Answer: At the nucleotide level (point mutations): - Substitutions-Insertions-Deletions-Frameshifts This site explains these using illustrations better than I can here: http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/ev...
A change to the DNA in a gene can alter a protein's amino acid sequence, thereby changing its shape and function and rendering the protein ineffective or even malignant (e.g. sickle cell anemia). Changes to genes are called mutations. A single 'gene' is most similar to a single 'word' in the English language. The nucleotides (molecules) that make up genes can be seen as 'letters' in the English language. Nucleotides are named according to which of the four nitrogenous bases they contain. The four bases are cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine.

The DNA sequence of a gene can be altered in a number of ways. Gene mutations have varying effects on health, depending on where they occur and whether they alter the function of essential proteins. The types of mutations include: This type of mutation is a change in one DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein made by a gene.
