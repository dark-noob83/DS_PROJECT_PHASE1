Look at it this way. If you weighed about 200 pounds and you climbed a 10 foot section of stairs in about 1 millionth of a second it would take a gigawatt for you perform this feat. Report Abuse. One billion watts, One watt is one joule of energy per second. The joule is a derived unit defined as the work done or energy required, to exert a force of one newton for a distance of one metre, so the same quantity may be referred to as a newton metre or newton-metre with the symbol N·m.
The gigawatt is equal to one billion (10 9) watts or 1 gigawatt = 1000 megawatts. This unit is often used for large power plants or power grids. For example, by the end of 2010 power shortages in China's Shanxi province were expected to increase to 5–6 GW and the installed capacity of wind power in Germany was 25.8 GW. The watt (symbol: W) is a derived unit of power in the International System of Units (SI), named after the Scottish engineer James Watt (1736–1819). The unit is defined as joule per second and can be used to express the rate of energy conversion or transfer with respect to time. It has dimensions of L 2 M T −3.
Roughly 750,000 to 1,000,000 depending on where that gigawatt is being used. Most US states will be on the lower end, whereas states with high-efficiency, conservation measure … s, and low per-capita consumption rates like California will be on the upper end. Energy = power * time. It's important to note that it's 'megawatt hour' and not megawatt/hou … r (ie. it's not megawatt per hour).  A gigawatt has 1000 times the power of a megawatt.
1000. A megawatt-hour is the energy you'd get with a megawatt of power for 1 hour. Energy = power * time. It's important to note that it's 'megawatt hour' and not megawatt/hou … r (ie. it's not megawatt per hour).  A gigawatt has 1000 times the power of a megawatt. Thus, since the time is the same (both 1 hour), a gigawatt-hour = 1000 megawatt hours
Properties of a gigawatt. 53 pages on this wiki. A gigawatt (GW) is of course 1000 megawatts (MW), 1 million (10^6) kilowatts (kW), 1 billion (10^9) joules per second (J/s). This is a few times more than a typical large scale power plant puts out. In BTU units, a GW is about 3.4 Gbtu/hour, and about 1 quad (10^15 BTU) in 33 years. 
Gigawatt The gigawatt is equal to one billion (109) watts or 1 gigawatt = 1000 megawatts. This unit is sometimes used for large power plants or power grids. Energy = power * time. It's important to note that it's 'megawatt hour' and not megawatt/hou … r (ie. it's not megawatt per hour).  A gigawatt has 1000 times the power of a megawatt.
Best Answer: Nuclear reactors to produce electricity usually put out between 500 megawatt and 1 gigawatt; so 1.21 gigawatt is a huge value, but not totally crazy. What is delicate is to get it in a package that is not the size of a large house. For the record, power is not energy, the professor never mentioned for how long he required that 1.21 GW, and a bank of high discharge condenser can provide that much power for a very short time. A regular light bulb is around 100 watt, so 1.21 gigawatt (billion of watt) is enough to power to light up 12.1 million light bulb. And for the record, Michale Dine C is way off about the movie Back to the Future having a made up name.
So 1 gigawatt = 10 9 watts. The definition of a watt is as follows: The watt (symbol: W) is the SI derived unit for power. It is equivalent to one joule per second (1 J/s), or in electrical units, one volt ampere (1 V A). The SI derived unit for power is the watt. 1 watt is equal to 1.0E-6 megawatt, or 1.0E-9 gigawatt. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results. Use this page to learn how to convert between megawatts and gigawatts.
One terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year. The watt second is a unit of energy, equal to the joule. One kilowatt hour is 3,600,000 watt seconds. The watt (symbol: W) is a derived unit of power in the International System of Units (SI), named after the Scottish engineer James Watt (1736–1819). The unit is defined as joule per second and can be used to express the rate of energy conversion or transfer with respect to time. It has dimensions of L 2 M T −3.
