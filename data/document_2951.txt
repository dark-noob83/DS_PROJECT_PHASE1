The important thing about Kabbalah is that unlike many other religions, it is not tied to a particular region, nationality or ideology. Throughout its history, it has always been a doctrine of those who do not stop learning and discovering. None of Kabbalah's truths are cut in stone.
In this sense Kabbalah was used in referring to all of known Oral Law. Kabbalah, according to the more recent use of the word, stresses the reasons and understanding of the commandments in the Torah, and the cause of events described in the Torah.
Kabbalah teaches universal principles that apply to all peoples of all faiths and all religions, regardless of ethnicity or where you come from. The beauty of studying Kabbalah is that you can't be forced to think in a particular way. There can be no coercion in spirituality.
Jewish Kabbalah uses numerology to interpret the Bible s message. Kabbalah concentrates the attention of Jewish mysticism towards the nature of divinity, the creation, the soul s beginnings and fate, and man s place in this world.
Kabbalah is a branch of Jewish mysticism, which is thought to have originated in the 13th century. Its teachings come from an ancient 23-volume book called the Zohar, which offers interpretations of the inner meaning of the Torah.
Kabbalah is an ancient paradigm for living. It teaches that all of the branches of our lives-health, relationships, careers-emanate from the same trunk and the same root. It's the technology of how the universe works at the core level.
We need the wisdom of Kabbalah more now than at any other time in our history. Kabbalah is not a religion, it's not dogma, and it's not a belief system that you have to buy into. Even more importantly, it's not anyone's personal opinion of how the universe works. It's simply knowledge that was always meant to be known and sharedâ€”the birthright of humanity.
