Ground turkey is a low-fat, healthy alternative to ground beef. Cooked correctly, it has a hearty, satisfying flavor that tastes great by itself or in soups and pasta dishes. Learn how to cook ground turkey by itself, in the form of burgers, or in the form of meatballs.
A turkey burger cooked to medium-well should take about eight minutes. Start with 1.5 lb. of ground turkey and form into four 1-inch-thick patties. Brush both sides of the burgers with canola or olive oil, season with salt and pepper or your spices of choice and cook for four minutes per side.
