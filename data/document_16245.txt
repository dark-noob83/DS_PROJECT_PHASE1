Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of a large magnet, radiofrequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body. Unlike X-rays or computed tomography (CT scans), MRI does not use ionizing radiation.
Guide. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to take pictures of the head. In many cases, MRI gives information that can't be seen on an X-ray, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT) scan.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - Head. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the brain and other cranial structures that are clearer and more detailed than other imaging methods.
A head MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the head is a imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the brain and surrounding nerve tissues.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head is a painless, noninvasive test that produces detailed images of your brain and brain stem. The test is carried out with an MRI machine, which produces the images using a magnetic field and radio waves. This test is also known as a brain MRI or a cranial MRI.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head is done to: 1  Look for the cause of headaches. 2  Help diagnose a stroke or blood vessel problems in the head. 3  Problems with blood vessels may include an aneurysm or abnormal twisted blood vessels that are present at birth (this is called an arteriovenous [AV] malformation).
