COMPOSITION OF BLOOD Blood is composed of a yellowish fluid, called plasma, in which are suspended the millions of cells that constitute about 45 per cent by volume of whole blood. It has a characteristic odour and a relative density between 1.056 and 1.066. In an average healthy adult, the volume of blood is one-eleventh of the body weight, or between 4.5 and 6 litres (5 and 6 qt). A great portion of the plasma is composed of water, a medium that facilitates the circulation of the many indispensable factors of which blood is composed
