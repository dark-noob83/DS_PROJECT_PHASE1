Healthy toddlers between the ages of 1 and 3 need 0.55 grams of protein per pound of body weight. For a toddler weighing 30 pounds this translates to 16.5 grams of protein per day. As a child increases in age, protein needs decrease.
Protein requirements for children ages 9 and older vary based on the childâ€™s age and gender. The Institute of Medicine encourages children ages 9 to 13 to eat at least 34 grams of protein every day; girls ages 14 to 18 need 46 grams of protein; and boys ages 14 to 18 require at least 52 grams of protein each day.
Children between 4 and 6 need 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight so a 45-pound 5-year-old requires 22.5 grams of protein. Children between 7 and 14 require 0.45 grams of protein per body weight. For a 12-year-old weighing 90 pounds, this translates to 40.5 grams of protein daily.
