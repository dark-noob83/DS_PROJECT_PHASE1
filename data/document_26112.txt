Baby Back Ribs. Barbecuing spare ribs that are tender, juicy and succulent is a time-consuming but very simple and rewarding process. Ribs need to be cooked a long time over a slow, indirect heat. I cook on either my Traeger or Memphis pellet grills, generally with 100% Hickory pellets. Increase the heat to 350F. Brush the ribs with warm sauce and grill for 5 minutes. Make sure the ribs don't burn! If you sauce earlier, the sugar in the sauce will burn while cooking, which is not a pretty sight. You can cook the ribs a couple hours before eating and then reheat a couple of different way
Slow cooking baby back ribs on a Traeger. These are the absolute best. Known as 3-2-1 (or 321) ribs, because of the hours involved in each step of cooking. YOU can make fall off the bone ribs using this method. Caution: your favorite rib house can't compete with this. 
Baby back ribs take about 4 - 4 1/2 hours and spare ribs about 5 hours. You can wrap the ribs in foil after two hours of cooking. I've found that this keeps the ribs juicier. At the two hour mark wrap each slab separately and put back on the smoker. Increase the heat to 350F. Brush the ribs with warm sauce and grill for 5 minutes. Make sure the ribs don't burn!

On Sunday I fired up the Traeger, put the ribs on “smoke” level (~170 deg) for about an hour, and then bumped them to 225 for another 3 hours. From time to time I’d squirt a little apple juice on them to keep them moist, but they really didn’t need it. 
Have a question regarding the ribs cooked today. This was the first cook on the Traeger Texas for ribs since I purchased it. The Traeger was set on 225 and the outside temp was around 40. The controller did a great job whenever I checked to be around this reading. The issue I have is the ribs cooked for 7.5 hours.

One way, I use is 180 setting for 5 hours, add sauce for the family, set temp to 300 and they are finished in about 6 hours. Secone way, I use 225 setting for 3 1/2 hours, foil for 1/2 hour, remove foil and sauce.
