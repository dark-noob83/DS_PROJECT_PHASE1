Definition and Formula. Interquartile range is defined as the difference between the upper and lower quartile values in a set of data. It is commonly referred to as IQR and is used as a measure of spread and variability in a data set. This topic is often discussed in statistics with similar topics such as mean deviation and distribution.
Inter quartile range is defined as the difference between the third and the first quartile. Quartiles are the partitional values which divide the whole series into 4 equal parts. So, there are 3 quartiles. First Quartile is denoted by $Q_{1}$, second Quartile denoted by $Q_{2}$ and third Quartile denoted by $Q_{3}$.
Definition: Interquartile range is the measure of dispersion which is the difference in the values of two quartiles. The Lower Quartile is denoted as Q 1 and the Upper Quartile is denoted as Q 3. The interquartile range is Q 3 - Q 1.
An Alternative Definition for IQR. In some texts, the interquartile range is defined differently. It is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values in the middle 50% of a set of data. To compute an interquartile range using this definition, first remove observations from the lower quartile. Then, remove observations from the upper quartile. Then, from the remaining observations, compute the difference between the largest and smallest values.
Difference between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of an ordered range of data. It contains middle 50 percent of the distribution and is unaffected by extreme values. Half of this range (25 percent or the distribution) is called semi-interquartile range.
The semi-interquartile range is a measure of dispersion. It is computed as one half the difference between the 75th percentile (Q 3) and the 25th percentile (Q 1). Semi-interquartile range is one-half the difference between the first and third quartiles. It is half the distance needed to cover half the scores.
