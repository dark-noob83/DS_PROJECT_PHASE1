Butalbital is a barbiturate, wheras hydrocodone is a derivitive of the naturally occurring opiate compound thebaine. Hydrocodone is a semi-synthetic opioid.
Im not a doctor but ive been on both hydrocodone and butalbital (generic vicodin and fioricet) for about 2 years now without any interacting symptoms. Oftentimes if you think you might be experiencing problems your body will release epinephrine (adrenaline) which could be causing your symptoms.
A. Let's look at the ingredients of each of these medications separately. Vicodin contains hydrocodone and acetaminophen. Fioricet contains acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine. I would be cautious in using both products, in order to prevent overdosing of acetaminophen. This medication, while safe as an over-the-counter medication, can cause damage to the liver at extreme doses.
Fioricet is a combination drug that includes butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine. Butalbital is a barbiturate and acetaminophen is the active ingredient in Tylenol. It is approved for the treatment of tension headaches and muscle contraction headaches. Vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) is a powerful opioid painkiller approved to relieve moderate to severe pain.
Hydrocodone is often in pill form as a acetaminophen (Tylenol)/low dose hydrocodone preperation. Do not drink after having taken even small doses of acetaminophen (tylonel) (found in almost all hydrocodone drug preperations) because it can cause moderate, severe or fatal liver damage.
Because butalbital is prepared in a acetaminophen (Tylenol)/ butalbital preperation & because Tylenol can cause fatal liver damage especially when combined with alcohol, butalbital should not be taken with alcohol.
