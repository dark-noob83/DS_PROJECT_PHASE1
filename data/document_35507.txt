2. Determine the size of oven to buy. 1  Most ovens come in a standard 4 cubic feet (1.22 cubic meters) size, but smaller ovens come in 2 to 3 cubic feet (0.61 to 0.91 cubic meters). 2  The size of oven to buy depends on the number of people in your household as well as the amount and size of foods you plan to cook.
Natural gas use is measured by volume in units of 100 cubic feet (ccf). For billing, ccf is converted into therms, a measure of heat content. One therm equals 100,000 British thermal units (Btu). One therm of natural gas is also roughly equal to one ccf.
Most single wall ovens have a volume of 3.1 cubic-feet, whereas most range ovens have a volume of between 4.2 and 4.8 cubic feet, generally. If you're a casual cook preparing simple meals a few times a week, the standard smaller oven is probably just fine for you.

Multiply the width by the height and depth to obtain the oven volume in cubic inches. For example, an oven with a depth of 20 inches, a width of 20 inches and a height of 30 inches has a capacity of 12,000 cubic inches -- 20 x 20 x 30 = 12,000. Divide the capacity in inches by 1,728, the number of cubic inches in 1 cubic foot. The result is the capacity of the oven expressed in cubic feet. To conclude the previous example, an oven with a 12,000-cubic-inch capacity has a 6.94 cubic foot capacity because 12,000 divided by 1,728 equals 6.94.
Size. The standard width of a residential range is 30 inches, but higher-end ranges can extend to 36 inches and beyond. The oven compartment on a typical range is 5 cubic feet, compared to just over 3 cubic feet in a typical wall oven.
