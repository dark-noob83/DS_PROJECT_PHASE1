If you take a qualified withdrawal from your Roth IRA, the entire distribution is tax-free. Qualified withdrawals for Roth IRAs must meet two criteria. One, your Roth IRA must have been open for five years. Two, you must be either 59 1/2 years old, permanently disabled, or using up to $10,000 to buy a first home. For example, if you have a Roth IRA containing $35,000 of contributions and $10,000 of earnings, you can withdraw up to $35,000 tax-free and penalty-free any time you want.
A non-qualified distribution is subject to taxation of earnings and a 10% additional tax unless an exception applies. For Roth IRAs, you can always remove post-tax penalty contributions (also known as basis) from your Roth IRA without penalty. A qualified distribution from a Roth IRA is tax-free and penalty-free, provided that the five-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: 1  Over age 59½. 2  Death or disability.
Penalties on Earnings from Contributions. Unless an exception applies, most distributions from a Roth IRA before the owner reaches age 59 1/2 will be subject to an early withdrawal penalty of 10% on the amount of the distribution. In 2005, Jim's Roth IRA has a balance of $3,500. Jim decides to close his Roth IRA in a non-qualified distribution that year. Since the distribution is non-qualified, Jim will owe taxes on his Roth earnings of $1,500, and will pay tax on this amount at his marginal tax rate.
A non-qualified distribution is subject to taxation of earnings and a 10% additional tax unless an exception applies. For Roth IRAs, you can always remove post-tax penalty contributions (also known as basis) from your Roth IRA without penalty. Consult your tax advisor about your particular situation. 
The tax treatment of a Roth IRA distributions depends on whether the distribution is qualified. Qualified distributions from Roth IRAs are tax and penalty free, but nonqualified distributions may be subjected to tax and an early distribution penalty. Roth IRA distributions can come from the following four sources: 1  A regular contribution. 2  a Roth conversion of taxable Traditional IRA assets (Traditional IRA assets for which a tax deduction was allowed) or a rollover of taxable assets from a qualified plan, 403(b) or governmental 457(b) plan.
If, however, you opened your Roth IRA less than five years ago, the withdrawal is an early distribution. As with a traditional IRA early withdrawal, a Roth holder can use the first-home exception to avoid the 10 percent penalty but might owe tax on earnings that are withdrawn. 
Defining Qualified Distribution. Distributions from a Roth IRA that are not qualified may be subject to income tax and an additional 10% early-distribution penalty. A qualified distribution meets both of the following two categories of requirements: 1. If John takes a distribution of $25,000, the first $10,000 comes from his regular Roth IRA contributions and is therefore tax and penalty free. The additional $15,000, however, comes from his taxable conversion assets.
In 2001, before he is age 59 1/2, Paul withdraws $10,000 from the Roth IRA. Paul will have no tax to pay on this withdrawal because he paid income taxes on the full $20,000 he converted in 1998; however, he WILL have to pay a 10% penalty (or $1,000) unless one of the IRA early withdrawal exceptions apply. In 2005, Jim's Roth IRA has a balance of $3,500. Jim decides to close his Roth IRA in a non-qualified distribution that year. Since the distribution is non-qualified, Jim will owe taxes on his Roth earnings of $1,500, and will pay tax on this amount at his marginal tax rate.
1 She'll also pay a 10% penalty, but only on the $2,000 taxable distribution. 2  The other $2,000 is tax-and penalty-free since it came from prior non-deductible contributions to the IRA. 3  She can convert the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and then take the $4,000 distribution. 4  This is a bad choice for Karin. In 2005, Jim's Roth IRA has a balance of $3,500. Jim decides to close his Roth IRA in a non-qualified distribution that year. Since the distribution is non-qualified, Jim will owe taxes on his Roth earnings of $1,500, and will pay tax on this amount at his marginal tax rate.
If you take a distribution from the conversion money in your Roth IRA within five years after the conversion, the early distribution penalty will apply even though the distribution isn’t taxable. Example: You convert your traditional IRA, with a value of $20,000, to a Roth IRA, paying tax on the entire amount. Two years later, when you are under age 59½, you withdraw $5,000 from the Roth IRA, and the distribution comes from conversion money because you haven’t made any regular contributions to your Roth IRA. You convert this IRA to a Roth IRA, paying tax on $6,000. Two years later you make a regular contribution of $2,000 to a different Roth IRA. A year after that, you withdraw $3,000 from the conversion Roth IRA.
