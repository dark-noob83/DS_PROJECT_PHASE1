The symptoms of digoxin toxicity range from obvious to non-specific. Obvious signs of digoxin poisoning may include vomiting, nausea, hypotension, or hypothyroidism.
Signs and symptoms of poisoning depend on the amount and type of toxin, the form of exposure (e.g., ingestion, skin absorption, inhalation), and the age and overall health of the person. In some cases, poisoning does not cause noticeable symptoms.
Some signs and symptoms of poisoning can imitate signs and symptoms of common illnesses. 1  For example, nausea and vomiting are a sign (vomiting) and symptom (nausea) of poisoning. 2  However, nausea and vomiting can also be found in many illnesses that have nothing to do with poisoning. 3  Examples include:
In adults, the signs and symptoms of toxicity are similar to those described in Adverse Reactions (6) but may be more frequent and severe. The most common signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity are nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue that occur in 30 to 70% of patients who are overdosed. Extremely high serum concentrations produce hyperkalemia especially in patients with impaired renal function.
Signs and symptoms [edit]. Digoxin toxicity is often divided into acute or chronic toxicity. In both of these toxicity, cardiac effects are of the greatest concern. With an acute ingestion, symptoms such as nausea, vertigo, and vomiting are prominent.
Signs and Symptoms in Adults and Children. The signs and symptoms of toxicity are generally similar to those described in the Adverse Reactions (6.1) but may be more frequent and can be more severe. Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity become more frequent with levels above 2 ng/mL.
Children. In pediatric patients, signs and symptoms of toxicity can occur during or shortly after the dose of digoxin. Frequent non-cardiac effects are similar to those observed in adults although nausea and vomiting are not seen frequently in infants and small pediatric patients.
