1 Lipase from the pancreas digests lipids to fatty acids and glycerol in our small intestine. 2  Pepsin is a protease that begins digestion of proteins, breaking them into peptides and amino acids. 3  Pepsinogen, is secreted by gastric glands of the stomach into the stomach.
Lipids are digested by lipases. A lipase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of a lipid (triglyceride) molecule into one molecule of glycerol and three molecules â€¦ of fatty acid. + 13 others found this useful. Isaak Mweulinale.
Lipase. Lipase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids, the ester bonds in triglycerides, to form fatty acids and glycerol. While too much fat in our diet can cause severe health conditions including heart disease and cancer, some fat is absolutely required.
Lipids are digested by lipases. A lipase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of a lipid (triglyceride) molecule into one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acid.
Lipase. Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down dietary fats into smaller molecules called fatty acids and glycerol. A small amount of lipase, called gastric lipase, is made by cells in your stomach. This enzyme specifically digests butter fat in your food. The main source of lipase in your digestive tract is your pancreas, which makes pancreatic lipase that acts in your small intestine. First, bile made in your liver and released into your intestine converts dietary fat into small fatty globules.
