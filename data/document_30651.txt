In 2014, the value of one withholding allowance for a Biweekly Payroll Period is $151.90. The 2014 withholding adjustment for nonresident aliens is $86.50 for biweekly tax calculation purposes only. This amount is added to the wage calculation solely for the purpose of calculating income tax withholding on the wages. Note that nonresident alien students from India are not subject to this procedure.
Most people pay their income taxes through paycheck withholding. If you have taxes withheld from your pay, then a percentage of every paycheck is sent by your employer to the IRS to be credited against your tax bill for the year. If you end up with a tax refund, it might be because you had too much tax withheld.
To determine the amount of wages subject to federal tax, you must first add any taxable fringe benefits and taxable employer-paid deductions to your gross pay amount. You can then subtract $151.90 from the total biweekly taxable gross pay for each withholding allowance claimed.
The Federal income tax is a graduated tax so the rate will rise as your pay rises. Most employers will base the withholding upon your gross pay for the pay period as opposed to annualizing it so a high pay pay period can result in a significantly different rate of tax than a low pay one will.
And this bracketâ€™s at 25%, so the federal income tax must be 25% of the $40,000.. That is not how a tax bracket works. The way it works is you pay 10% on the first $8,925. Then 15% on the increment up to $36,250. And then 25% on the amount that is above $36,250.
The overtime is added to your taxable wages, bringing them to $886.16. The 25 percent tax bracket starts at $764 for single filers, so your employer takes out 25 percent on $122.16 of the overtime pay for federal income tax.
And so your taxable income at the federal level is going to be $50,000 minus this stuff. So this stuff adds up to $10,000 of deductions and exemptions. So your taxable income is $40,000. Now, from this $40,000, we can figure out how much you pay in federal income taxes.
