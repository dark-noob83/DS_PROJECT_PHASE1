The hectare, however, remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units, mentioned in Section 4.1 of the SI Brochure as a unit whose use is expected to continue indefinitely. The hectare (/ˈhɛktɛər/ or /ˈhɛktɑːr/ ; symbol ha), although not strictly a unit of SI, is the only named unit of area that is accepted for use within the SI.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The hectare (/ˈhɛktɛər/ or /ˈhɛktɑr/ ; symbol ha) is an SI accepted metric system unit of area equal to 100 ares (10,000 m 2) and primarily used in the measurement of land. An acre is about 0.4047 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres. In 1795, when the metric system was introduced, the are was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare ( hecto-  + are) was thus 100 ares or 1⁄100 km 2. The hectare (/ˈhɛktɛər/ or /ˈhɛktɑːr/ ; symbol ha), although not strictly a unit of SI, is the only named unit of area that is accepted for use within the SI.
Hectare. A hectare (ha) is an area equal to a square that is 100 meters on each side. So a hectare has 100 m × 100 m = 10,000 m 2 (square meters). Hectares are commonly used to measure land. A square kilometer is kilometer × kilometer, which is written km 2.
