In general, the normal body temperature for animals is higher than for humans. The normal rectal temperature of a dog is 99.5° to 102.5°F. The normal temperature of a puppy at birth is 96-97°F. The temperature gradually increases with age until it is 100°F at 4 weeks of age. 
The normal body temperature for dogs is between 101 and 102.5 F, compared to 97.6 to 99.6 F for humans. This means your dog may feel feverish to you even when his temperature is completely normal. The word “fever” is typically used to describe elevated body temperature caused by infection or inflammation. A temperature of more than 103 F is considered a dog fever. When dogs have high temperatures that are the result of hot external temperatures or excessive exercise in humid conditions, the condition is referred to as hyperthermia or heat stroke. When temperatures reach 106 F, serious and fatal complications can occur.
Temperature. The body functions normally at a given temperature range; this is true for humans and for dogs. A dog’s body is set to a normal temperature of 100 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The average canine body temperature is 101.3. Puppies can vary a little outside these ranges. For instance, newborn pups have a body temperature of 94 to 97 degrees and may not reach normal body temperature until they are about a month old. 
Pyrexia in Dogs. Fever, referred to medically as pyrexia, can be defined as a higher than normal body temperature in dogs. With the normal range falling between 99.5-102.5 Fahrenheit, a body temperature of at least 103.5 ° F (39.7° C) can be considered a fever. The cause of the fever is not always obvious. 
A temperature of 100.5° to 102°F degrees is normal. Taking your dog's temperature by ear. When used properly, ear thermometers are a reliable and less invasive way to take your dog's temperature. An ear thermometer works by measuring infrared heat waves that are emitted from the dog's eardrum area. 
The normal body temperature for a dog falls within the range of 100°F to 102.5°F (about 38°C to 39.2°C). If your dog's temperature is outside of this range, you should contact your veterinarian. Body temperature over 104°F or under 99°F indicates an emergency situation. In general, the most accurate way to measure a dog's body temperature is rectally.
D og temperature can be indicative of the animal's general health. The average temperature of a dog is 101 degrees F or 38 degrees C. A temperature that is above normal range can mean that the dog is sick and a vet needs to be consulted. Normal Dog Temperature Range. Dogs are warm blooded (homothermic) mammals, and they manage to keep their temperature at normal levels regardless of the environment. The normal temperature range of an adult canine is between 100 and 102.5 degrees F, or 37.8 and 39.2 degrees C. Typically, the most accurate results will be obtained by taking the dog's temperature rectally, but the temperature can also be taken in the ears, using a digital thermometer
A Toy or small dog breed's normal temperature usually is 101 to 102 F or 38 to 39 C. It's a good idea to take your dog's temperature when you know he's well or at a routine vet visit so you see what's typical for your dog. Normal range for most dogs is 100 to 102 F. Anything outside that range requires veterinary care and a temperature of 103 or higher is a medical emergency. If you use a non-rectal thermometer, always take his temperature in the same area of his body.
Dogs have higher body temperature than we do. Therefore, even if your dog may feel hot or feverish to you, his body temperature may still be within normal limit. The normal dog temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C). A body temperature of 102°F (38.9°C) or above is considered a fever. Dogs can run a high fever of 104°F (40°C) and sometimes up to 105°F (40.5°C). According to many holistic veterinarians, we need not be alarmed unless the dog body temperature reaches 103°F, since a fever is generally a good sign-read Dog Fever below.
