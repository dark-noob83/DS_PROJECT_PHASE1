The bottom number, called the diastolic pressure, is the measurement as the heart relaxes between beats. Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension. A blood pressure level between normal and hypertension, is called prehypertension, meaning it is higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered hypertension.
1 if your top number is 140 or more-then you may have high blood pressure, regardless of your bottom number. 2  if your bottom number is 90 or more-then you may have high blood pressure, regardless your top number. 3  if your top number is 90 or less-then you may have low blood pressure, regardless of your bottom number. 1 More than 120 over 80 and less than 140 over 90 (120/80-140/90): You have a normal blood pressure reading but it is a little higher than it should be, and you should try to lower it. 2  Make healthy changes to your lifestyle.
Here's a look at the four blood pressure categories and what they mean for you. If your readings fall into two different categories, your correct blood pressure category is the higher category. For example, if your blood pressure reading is 125/95 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), you have stage 1 hypertension. Blood pressure readings fall into four general categories, ranging from normal to stage 2 high blood pressure (hypertension). The level of your blood pressure determines what kind of treatment you may need.
Now a blood pressure of 120/80 is considered normal, and blood pressure readings of 130â€“139 are considered pre-hypertension. Readings above 140/90 are considered high blood pressure, and the current thinking is that anyone falling into this category should be taking medication to lower blood pressure. A blood pressure reading gives two numbers (for example, 140/90). The top number is called the systolic pressure. It is the amount of pressure inside the arteries when the heart contracts. The bottom number is called the dia
Using this blood pressure chart: To work out what your blood pressure readings mean, just find your top number (systolic) on the left side of the blood pressure chart and read across, and your bottom number (diastolic) on the bottom of the blood pressure chart. Where the two meet is your blood pressure. 1 More than 120 over 80 and less than 140 over 90 (120/80-140/90): You have a normal blood pressure reading but it is a little higher than it should be, and you should try to lower it. 2  Make healthy changes to your lifestyle.
Ideally, we should all have a blood pressure below 120 over 80 (120/80). This is the ideal blood pressure for people wishing to have good health. At this level, we have a much lower risk of heart disease or stroke. If your blood pressure is optimal, this is great news. If your blood pressure is above 120/80mmHg, you will need to lower it. Most adults in the UK have blood pressure readings in the range from 120 over 80 (120/80) to 140 over 90 (140/90). If your blood pressure is within this range, you should be taking steps to bring it down or to stop it rising any further. Our five top tips will show you how
Use the blood pressure chart below to see what your blood pressure means. The blood pressure chart is suitable for adults of any age. (The level for high blood pressure does not change with age.). Blood pressure readings have two numbers, for example 140/90mmHg. The top number is your systolic blood pressure. 1 More than 120 over 80 and less than 140 over 90 (120/80-140/90): You have a normal blood pressure reading but it is a little higher than it should be, and you should try to lower it. 2  Make healthy changes to your lifestyle.
Normal Blood Pressure. Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. 
Healthcare providers consider a normal blood pressure reading to be 120/80 or below. However, it can actually fall anywhere in a range from 90/60 to 120/80 -- it's not just one set number. The number on top of the reading is called the systolic pressure.
