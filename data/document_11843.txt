Definition and causes to Muscle tumors â€“ Muscle cancer. A tumor growth in the skeletal muscles is a rare condition, and it will in most cases involve a benign tumor. There are only a few of the malignant tumors (muscle cancer) annually with less than one such case per one million inhabitants. The tumor arises from increased and/or altered growth of muscle cells.
There are many types of soft tissue tumors, and not all of them are cancerous. When the term sarcoma is part of the name of a disease, it means the tumor is malignant (cancer). Some soft tissue tumors behave in way in between a cancer and a non-cancer.
A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops from certain tissues, like bone or muscle. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main types of sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from soft tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. They can be found in any part of the body.
Myosarcoma. Myosarcoma is categorized as one of the four major types of cancer and is defined as a sarcoma or cancer of the muscle tissue; it is a malignant tumor derived from myogenic cells. Myosarcoma can occur in the prostate and bladder, and the small and large intestines.
A tumor, also known as a neoplasm, is an abnormal mass of tissue which may be solid or fluid-filled. A tumor does not mean cancer-tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). There are many different types of tumors and a variety of names for them-their names usually reflect their shape and the kind of tissue they appear in.
