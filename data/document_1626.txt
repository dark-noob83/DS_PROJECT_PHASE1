The viscosity of a fluid is basically a measure of how sticky it is. Water has a fairly low viscosity; things like shampoo or syrup have higher viscosities. Viscosity also depends on temperature: engine oil, for instance, is much less viscous at high temperatures than it is in a cold engine in the middle of winter.
To determine how fluid a liquid really is by measuring its viscosity. Viscosity is an internal property of a fluid that offers resistance to flow. For example, pushing a spoon with a small force moves it easily through a bowl of water, but the same force moves mashed potatoes very slowly.
Viscosity is the measure of a substance's resistance to motion under an applied force. The formula for measuring viscosity is fairly simple: viscosity = shear stress / shear rate. The result is typically expressed in centipoise (cP), which is the equivalent of 1 mPa s (millipascal second).
Thus, water is thin, having alower viscosity, while honey is thick, having a higher viscosity. Put simply, the less viscous the fluid is, the greaterits ease of movement (fluidity). [1] Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction.
A fluid s viscosity is important because it is directly related to its load-carrying capabilities. The greater a fluid s viscosity, the greater the loads it can withstand. The viscosity of a fluid must be adequate to separate moving parts under normal operating conditions (temperature and speed).
What is Viscosity? Viscosity is the measure of a substance's resistance to motion under an applied force.

Viscosity: A lubricant’s most important characteristic Introduction For any oil lubrication system, oil viscosity is considered as the most important parameter. One should always ensure that the viscosity of the oil in use meets OEM recommendations.
The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of the difficulty which molecules have passing each other in a fluid. It is dependent upon the size and shape of the molecules and by the magnitude of the cohesive forces and intermolecular bonds such as hydrogen bonding.
Dynamic Viscosity is defined as a fluid’s resistance to flow, or the fluid’s resistance to deform when. subjected to a force 1. An easy way to visualise this is to imagine stirring two liquids, water and honey, in two separate containers.
