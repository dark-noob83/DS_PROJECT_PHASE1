When you’re trying to decide how to fuel up before and after a run, your go-to strategy may be to down a sports drink and chomp on an energy bar or piece of fruit. However, another option is chocolate. When subjects ate the chocolate bars, they also showed other indicators — such as a lower rate of perceived exertion and favorable blood lactate levels — which showed researchers that having a chocolate bar before exercise can help boost exercise stamina and improve recovery.

Milk contains carbohydrates, which are your muscle's fuel during your run. Carbohydrates are stored in small amounts in the body and constantly need to be replenished. The protein content in chocolate milk helps to repair muscle tissues, and optimizes enzyme production and immune function. Low-fat chocolate milk contains 170 calories. Each 8-oz. serving contains 8 g of fat, 24 g of carbohydrates, and 8 g of protein. Each serving provides 30 percent of daily recommended calcium, and 25 percent of your daily recommended vitamin D intake. It also provides significant sources of vitamin A, and vitamin C.
It's not as if you have to do a lot, but things like running in the morning, even if it's just around the block, not only can keep you healthy and fit, but it will wake your body up very well. Stretching can be a big help, or if you're feeling foggy, heading to the gym can get you going. It's a fatty food, so it's not something you want to indulge in frequently. But if no coffee is present, a simple chocolate bar does have enough within to make you wake up. The moment you put chocolate in your body, it can give close to immediate comfort, but also drive up energy.
Coming from the cocoa bean, chocolate at least starts as something all natural. It's a fatty food, so it's not something you want to indulge in frequently. But if no coffee is present, a simple chocolate bar does have enough within to make you wake up. The moment you put chocolate in your body, it can give close to immediate comfort, but also drive up energy.
The answer is no, it makes you poop. I was in need of a chocolate fix yesterday afternoon, a mix of down in the dumps and just that sweet tooth craving. I found a bag of dark chocolate M&Ms I had bought for Chipper Nettie, aka Annette, to take to Nashville when she runs the Marathon, I guess I saved her some calories. It was just in the nick of time, I don’t think I could have gone any further, it was miserable!! So lesson learned, no more chocolate before running, it only makes you run faster to the port-a-potty. When I came out of the port-a-potty I expected to see Kim flying around the corner in her Honda, I walked up to the top of the hill which was just 30 or 40 feet away and I could see her coming, fast

Do you love your chocolate but think it is having a negative effect on your running....think again, as some evidence suggests that consuming moderate amounts of chocolate could actually boost your performance during exercise and may also help improve your recovery afterward. In a study published in 1996 in “Biomedical and Environmental Sciences,” 16 male college-age students who ate a chocolate bar before a moderate-intensity run had higher blood sugar levels 15 minutes into their run and all the way through 30 minutes after their run than when they had a placebo supplement.
After a long race, many runners are picking up a bottle of chocolate milk instead of a bottle of water or sports drink. Turns out, chocolate milk doesn’t just quench your thirst; it may also help improve the body's recovery after those miles on the road. Milk does more than just help muscles recover. Ivy found that you can build more muscle and lose fat during training if you drink chocolate milk after a workout.
Just because having some chocolate may help boost your running performance doesn’t mean you should feel free to chomp or guzzle it down. Chocolate is packed with sugar, and many Americans have more than is recommended. When subjects ate the chocolate bars, they also showed other indicators — such as a lower rate of perceived exertion and favorable blood lactate levels — which showed researchers that having a chocolate bar before exercise can help boost exercise stamina and improve recovery.
