Hi, I just switched from ATT dsl to a Time Warner cable modem. It turns out that the time warner isn't wireless....which is pretty inconvenient! The Time Warner guy told me I could use my ATT wireless router to get the wireless. it's not working, so I am wondering if anyone knows if it is, in fact, possible.
Computer I am using is a Dell Inspiron....the ATT cable modem is a 2wire Gateway 2701HG-B and the ATT model is a motorola sb5101 surfboard cable modem...the Time Warner guy's instruction was to plug the ethernet cable into the wireless modem rather than the computer.
If that doesn't work and you don't know how to configure the ATT dsl modem/wireless router then you need a wireless router to hook up to the Motorola Surfboard Cable Modem with Time Warner Service.
The only thing worse than paying out the tuchus for unreliable internet from Time Warner Cable and Comcast is being forced pay a monthly rental fee for a modem you need to access that crappy internet.
Unplug the ethernet cable from the Time Warner modem and plug it into the ethernet port of the new modem. (From the modem, the ethernet cable will connect to a PC or a wireless router, depending on your setup. But you don't need to change any of those connections.). 3.
No The ATT modem converts a DSL signal to an Ethernet signal and then adds a router processing, network switch, and 802.11 wireless LAN capability to the signal before feeding it out. A CATV modem must convert the CATV signal to an Ethernet signal.
You can use your Netgear router, and connect it to your Arris modem, using a CAT-5 Ethernet cable and Netgearâ€™s Smart Wizard installation CD. Step 1. Power down your PC. Step 2. Power down the Time Warner Arris cable modem and disconnect its power cord from the rear of the device and the outlet.
