What is biodegradation? Biodegradation is the process by which organic substances are broken down by living organisms (96% of Bacteria are aerobic-active in the presence of oxygen). There is therefore complete compatibility between the Bacterial floral and Oxobiodegradable degradation pathways. The oxo-biodegradation process uses two methods to start the biodegradation. These methods are photodegradation (UV) and thermal oxidation. The UV degradation uses UV light to fragment and degrade the product. The thermal oxidation process uses time, and heat to break down the plastic.

Note: Modified to exclude abiotic enzymatic processes. Biodegradation is the chemical dissolution of materials by bacteria, fungi, or other biological means. Although often conflated, biodegradable is distinct in meaning from compostable. In practice, almost all chemical compounds and materials are subject to biodegradation, the key is the relative rates of such processes-minutes, days, years, centuries... A number of factors determine the degradation rate of organic compounds. Salient factors include light, water and oxygen.
Biodegradation is a process where something breaks down into simple compounds as a result of the action of microorganisms (like bacteria, fungi, or algae). The term biodegradation is actually a contraction, short for biotic degradation.. Something is biodegradable if it can be broken down by this kind of process. In order to say that something biodegrades, it therefore has to meet the following requirements: 1  it has to break down (this is simply degradation). Because biodegradation requires microorganism to do something to a material, usually the material has to be broken up into smaller pieces first. As a result, most biodegradable materials become biodegradable after the action of another kind of
Degradation means decay, and the bio- prefix means that the decay is carried out by a huge assortment of bacteria, fungi, insects, worms, and other organisms that eat dead material and recycle it into new forms. In nature, there is no waste because everything gets recycled. . Biodegradation Links.

Some industry individuals compare the biodegradation of a leaf or a tree to plastic. Biodegradation of plastic takes a period of time. Plastic is found around the world and is the by-product of making oil. They turn monomers into polymers and take those polymers and turn them into plastic bags, bowls, etc.
