1 The most important example of a price floor is the minimum wage. 2  A price ceiling is a maximum price that can be charged for a product or service. 3  Rent control imposes a maximum price on apartments in many U.S. cities. 4  A price ceiling that is larger than the equilibrium price has no effect.
Maximum prices. A maximum price occurs when a government sets a legal limit on the price of a good or service – with the aim of reducing prices below the market equilibrium price. For example, the government may set a maximum price of bread of £1 – or a maximum price of a weekly rent of £150. 1  If the maximum price is set above the equilibrium price then it will have no effect. 2  If the maximum price is set below the equilibrium price, it will cause a shortage – demand will be greater than supply.
Let's take a closer look at an example. A price ceiling is the maximum price that can be charged. If the price is set below the equilibrium price, the price ceiling is said to be effective (or binding). For example, post World War II, many returning GI's were finding apartment costs in New York to be too high as the demand for apartments grew rapidly.
Consider, for example, a GMP under which a contractor agrees to build a patio in exchange for actual costs and a $3,000 flat fee, subject to a $10,000 maximum price. Upon completion of the work, the contractor will be paid for all costs so long as the total amount, including the fee, does not exceed $10,000.
A construction project, for example, is often governed by a guaranteed maximum price contract (GMP) . This type of legal agreement sets a ceiling or maximum price for which a person or entity will pay for a certain project.
