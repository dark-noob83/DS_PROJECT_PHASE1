The petrol light usually indicates about 5 litres left in the tank. How far a 1.2 Clio (or any car) can go on 5 litres varies depending on road and traffic conditions, speed, driving style and even the weather-could be as much as 70 miles, or as little as 25 miles.

To work out the cost per mile of owning a car simply take the annual car cost and divide by your yearly mileage rate. Typically this would be around 12,000 miles a year, but this obviously varies a great deal on how you use the car.
Cost per mile (p/mile)= Litres put in a tank x 105p / number of miles out of tank. Annual Running Cost (£) = Cost per mile x Average mileage /100. The Renault Clio takes about 40 litres to fill up and travels 400 miles on a full tank, giving it a respectable MPG of 45. This equates to around 10.5p/mile assuming that the Price of Petrol is around 105p per litlre. For a Renault Clio. Cost per mile = 40 x 105 / 400 = 10.5p per mile. Annual Running Cost = 10.5p x 12,000 / 100 = £1260. Note that if you had one of the poorest performing cars in terms of MPG then your cost per mile could be much higher.
