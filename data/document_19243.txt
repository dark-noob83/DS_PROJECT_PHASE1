Real numbers do not stop Certain sets of numbers do If i said write down all negative integers greater than -20, this would stop they would be -19, -18, -17 ..... -3, -2, -1 But in real numbers, there is always exists an Y that is greater than any given X. Bill F · 9 years ago. Thumbs up.

Suppose you said that numbers should stop at some value N. N can be huge-more than the number of atoms in the whole universe. Bigger than any number I can name. But I could … still say, What about N+1 - the next number? Surely, that is a number and it is bigger than your N?.
