Eating 1 cup of wheat bran flakes takes up about 11 percent of your calorie allotment when eating 1,200 calories a day and 8 percent of your allotment when following a 1,600-calorie weight-loss plan.
When it comes to healthy foods, wheat bran flakes are near the top of the list. This cereal is not only nutrient-dense, but it can help you lose weight if you eat it in moderation. As you incorporate wheat bran flakes into your diet, remember that your overall diet, not just a single food, determines your daily calorie totals and whether you lose weight.
Flakes When You're Awake. Eating a breakfast that includes a high-fiber cereal can help you lose weight, and other possible benefits include a lower risk for chronic conditions such as type-2 diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular disease, according to Harvard University.
Cut Calories With Bran Flakes. Losing weight requires you to consume fewer calories than you expend, and eating wheat bran instead of higher-calorie foods can help reduce your total calorie consumption so that you lose weight.
Potential Disadvantages. If weight loss is your primary goal, the All-Bran diet may not be for you. There is no research to support the idea that adding a serving of breakfast cereal to your daily routine will help you lose weight, even if it is a low-sugar, low-calorie, high-fiber cereal.
Adding wheat bran flakes to your weight-loss plan can help you shed pounds, if you eat recommended amounts of this ready-to-eat breakfast cereal as part of a well-balanced, reduced-calorie diet.
Overindulging in Cereal. Although eating wheat bran flakes in place of sugary cereals is a healthy way to shed pounds, eating too many carbs -- abundant in cereals -- and not enough protein can hinder weight loss.
