Average Monthly Household Grocery Bill. Find out how much Canadian spend on grocery each month. About three months ago, I posted an article on Average Monthly Grocery Bill.

Young adults' average weekly food spending is $173, more than what older Americans say they spend. Those with incomes of $75,000 or more per year are averaging $180 per week, compared with $144 for those with incomes of $30,000 to $74,999, and $127 for the lowest income group. One in 10 Americans say they spend $300 or more per week and, at the other extreme, 8% spend less than $50. Gallup has asked a version of this question as far back as 1943, but has not asked it since 1987. In 1943, an average of $15 per week was spent on food.
I grew up in a family with 7... my parents on average would spend 200 to 400 dollars every 2 weeks...that was normally at sams or warehouse club meat dairy and poultry they bought at regular grocery store. I would guess about 700 to 900 dollars was spent a month on food. 
Photo: Rain0975. If there is such a thing as an average family of four, there’s nothing average about how much that family spends on groceries. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a family of four with two kids under age 11 spends anywhere from $654.20 to $1,302.20 per month on food.

So, how much does the average American spend on groceries each month? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics charts a wide variety of areas including employment, inflation, average pay and benefits, as well as consumer spending. In 2009, they found that the average American spent $6,443 annually food. 
Typical grocery spending According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American family spent $4,000 per year on groceries in 2013, or about $330 each month. In the context of a yearly budget, groceries count for about 8% of typical family spending, above health care (7%), entertainment (5%), and clothing (3%). Meanwhile, annual grocery spending is up by $140 since 2011.

We spend about $22.00 per week per person. That is for my husband and myself. We actually budget $50.00 per week for everything including toiletries, paper items, detergents, shampoos, health products, birthday cards, food, etc. I figure on average, out of that $50.00 per week, approximately $44.00 goes for food. It’s hard to figure out monthly how much we spend since I do weekly budgets. I budget about $95 a week for my husband and me. I do things a bit differently than the author because I do buy toiletries with this money. I clip coupons and a lot of those coupons are for toiletries that I buy at the grocery store.
