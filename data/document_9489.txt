A child's baby teeth (primary teeth) begin to loosen and fall out to make room for permanent teeth at about age 6. The first baby teeth to fall out are typically the two bottom front teeth (lower central incisors) and the two top front teeth (upper central incisors), followed by the lateral incisors, molars and canines. Molars typically fall out between ages 9 and 12 and are replaced by permanent teeth by about age 13.
