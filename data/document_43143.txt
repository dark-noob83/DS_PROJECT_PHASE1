Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) or shin splints is a common injury that affects athletes who engage in running. This condition is characterized by pain in the lower part of the leg between the knee and the ankle. MTSS is caused by repeated trauma to the connective muscle tissue surrounding the tibia (shinbone).
Anterior ankle impingement. Ankle impingement is caused by the joint capsule around the ankle being ‘pinched’ when running usually between the bones of the lower leg and the foot. It is an uncommon running injury but when it does occur it is extremely painful.
Your legs are made up of bones, blood vessels, muscles, and other connective tissue. They are important for motion and standing. Playing sports, running, falling, or having an accident can damage your legs. Common leg injuries include sprains and strains, joint dislocations, and fractures. These injuries can affect the entire leg, or just the foot, ankle, knee, or hip.
Shin splints (see Shin Splints), ankle sprains (see Ankle Sprains), Achilles tendinitis (see Achilles Tendinitis), tears of the Achilles tendon (see Achilles Tendon Tears), and stress fractures of the foot (see Stress Fractures of the Foot) are common injuries to the lower leg.
On this page you will a directory of the most common running injuries affecting the foot, ankle, lower leg, knee and upper leg. A brief synopsis of each injury is discussed.
In this case, the affected bone is the shin bone, or tibia. Shin splints are usually accompanied by pain and swelling in the front of the lower leg. Most frequent in runners, this overuse injury is caused by the repetitive stress of running on hard surfaces.
Prevention of running injuries. The biomechanics of the foot, ankle and lower leg are a complex and controlled sequence of events when running. However if there is a slight biomechanical abnormality occurring anywhere along the chain of motion then the chances of running injuries are much greater.
