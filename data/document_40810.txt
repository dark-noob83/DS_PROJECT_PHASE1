ATU 1555 workers, who include station agents and train operators, get an average of $62,774 in wages and $29,412 in benefits, for a total of $92,156, BART says.
U.S. Department of Labor statistics indicate the median pay for subway and streetcar operators of all kinds in the U.S. is $30.16 an hour, and $31.62 in California-right about what BART pays its train drivers and station agents, $30.58 an hour.
BART had the second-highest-paid train operators at $64,296 maximum a year, compared with those working at 12 other agencies, which paid an average of $49,848 maximum, according to the study. Highest was the Port Authority Trans-Hudson in New York at $64,932 maximum per year.
Bart Salary. Bart average salary is $63,738, median salary is $57,138 with a salary range from $20,000 to $339,997. Bart salaries are collected from government agencies and companies. Each salary is associated with a real job position. Bart salary statistics is not exclusive and is for reference only.
For instance, while a train operator's hourly pay in Chicago is virtually identical to BART's at $30 and change, the prices of living are worlds apart. Median home prices in San Francisco top $1 million-in Chicago, the median is $234,000.
On the other hand, BART's train operators come in no better than fourth in the nation in pay, behind their counterparts in New York, Boston and Chicago. And salaries for the transit system's station agents fall far short of what Muni station agents make in San Francisco.
Just down the road, Amalgamated Transit Union employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority pay a flat $35 a month for health care and nothing toward their pension. In New York, where train operators make more than BART's, the health plan cost ranges from $50 to $76 a month.
Mr. Mallett goes on to state that BART train operators are paid to run two round-trips each day. This takes 4.5 hours on average, but the operators are paid for eight. The effective pay rate according to Mr. Mallett is a little over $50.00 per hour.
