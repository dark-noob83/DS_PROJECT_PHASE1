Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere.

The Berlin Wall. During the early years of the Cold War, West Berlin was a geographical loophole through which thousands of East Germans fled to the democratic West. In response, the Communist East German authorities built a wall that totally encircled West Berlin. It was thrown up overnight, on 13 August 1961. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere.
The key factor in the wallâ€™s construction, however, was the impact on East Germans of the connection between West Berlin and the increasing freedom in West Germany and Western Europe. In 1950, with certain exemptions related to military service, West Berlin became a part of the FRG. 
The Berlin Wall Debate. The Berlin Wall separated East and West Germany both physically and politically. The wall also didn't allow people to leave or come into East or West Germany. The wall also affected the people in Germany. The Germans could not visit their family and friends on the other side of the Berlin Wall. Families were separated and they would not see each other again for a long time. People who worked on either side of the wall suddenly lost their jobs because they could not go to the other side. Then by losing their jobs, they could not buy food for their families. It separated the people from freedom. -http://dualshockers.com/2010/10/04/game-based-around-the-berlin-wall-gets-postponed/.
