If your horse gets an abscess in his foot, you'll have a vet cost of $75-150. If your horse gets a reaction to a vaccination and gets a stiff neck or sore spot, you'll pay for meds for that every time you have vaccinations. my vet charges me a $40 farm call and $45 for a exam. and i only pay $30 for a farrier but thats because he is bare. if you need shoes it will run anywhere from $60-$100 and thats if your horse just needs a basic trim and shoe and nothin special.

Tweet. Comments (7). The price of horses varies according to what they will be used for--Trail Riding, Rodeo/barrel racing or English jumping--and how much training the animal has. The basic rule of thumb is the more training and experience a horse has, the more it will cost. 1 Quarter horses are also used for rodeo/barrel racing or working cattle, along with Arabians and Thoroughbreds. 2  These trained animals average $2,500-$7,000, but exceptional animals cost a great deal more.
He's very good but does tend to be expensive. Another farrier at a friend's barn charges $35 for a trim, $95 for 2 shoes. 4) I have my vet check my horse's teeth when he comes for spring and fall shots. Usually your horse will only actually need the teeth floated once a year. Depends on the vet. 3. My farrier trims all four feet for $25, shoes horses for there first time for $60 (four feet) and does horses who have been shod before for $50 4. Once a year, some horses need it every six month and I pay $150. A different dentist does it for $350 and isn't good at all ! 5. Around $1 000.
