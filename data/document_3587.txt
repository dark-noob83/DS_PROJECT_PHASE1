The photosynthetic partner algae may be a bacteria such as cyanobacteria or blue green algae, or a plant such as green algae. They are usually classed as members of the fungi kingdom. Mycorrhizae are the fungus root partnership that develops in almost all plants both vascular and non vascular.
The two organisms share symbiotic relationship, means both live together and helps each other. in which, The alga uses the sunlight to produce food. The fungus gives the alga with minerals and water, that fungus absorbs. So, in this way fungus gets food produced by Algae..
Lichen is the product of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism, usually a photosynthetic bacteria or algae. The photosynthetic organism gains … a place to live and protection.
Lichens. Symbiotic associations between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner Cyanobacteria, green algae, or sometimes both Most are mutualistic Fungus are 9/10 ascomycetes. Ascomycetes are found in all but about 20 of the 15,000 lichen species.
Lichens have been described as dual organisms because they are symbiotic associations between two (or sometimes more) entirely different types of microorganism 1  -. a fungus (termed the mycobiont). 2  a green alga or a cyanobacterium (termed the photobiont).
A lichen is also an example of a mutualistic relationship. Because lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in new ecosystems. This tree is covered in lichen, a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a bacterium or an alga.
A lichen is made up of fungus cells for support and algae cells which fix carbon via photosynth … esis. The algae and fungi species that make up a give lichen species are only found as lichen, they don't live on their own. This is a very tight symbiosis. An even tighter one can be seen in every eukaryotic cell.
