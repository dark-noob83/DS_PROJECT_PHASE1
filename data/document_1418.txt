Mollusks also have a radula or file-like organ for feeding, a mantle that may secrete a shell, and a muscular foot for locomotion. Clams are marine mollusks with two valves or shells. Like all mollusks, a clam has a mantle which surrounds its soft body. It also has a muscular foot which enables the clam to burrow itself in mud or sand. The soft tissue above the foot is called the visceral mass and contains the clam's body organs.
Body Plan. Mollusks have a thin layer of tissue called the mantle. The mantle covers the body organs, which are located in the visceral mass. Between the soft body and the mantle is a space called the mantle cavity. Mollusks contain gills. Gills are organs in which carbon dioxide from the mollusk is exchanged for oxygen in the water.
In general, mollusks have 3 body regions: a head, a visceral mass, and a foot.. The head contains the sense organs and brain, while the visceral mass contains the internal organs. The foot is the muscular lower part of the body which is in contact with the substrate. Mollusks usually have a shell (although some do not).
• The visceral mass is the central section of the mollusk’s body that contains the mollusk’s organs. • Outside of the visceral mass is a heavy fold of tissue called the mantle that forms the outer layer of the body and that secretes the mollusk’s shell.
