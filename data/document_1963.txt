A percentile salary tells how much a certain percentage of an overall population in a geographic area or withing a given industry or field makes. The most commonly-used percentile salaries are the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles. As an example, if the 10th percentile wage for a job was $10,000 annually, 10 percent of the people made $10,000 per year, while the remaining 90 percent made more than $10,000. Mean. The 50th percentile salary is also known as the median salary. Half of the population, industry or occupation represented in a group of salary statistics make less than the median while the other half makes more than the median. Sometimes people incorrectly use the terms median salary with the term mean salary.
The hourly wage estimates in this example indicate that: 1  10% of employees earn less than $11.00 per hour; therefore the remaining 90% earn more than $11.00 per hour. 2  25% earn less than $15.00; 75% earn more than $15.00. 3  50% earn less than $20.00; 50% earn more than $20.00 (The 50th percentile is called the Median). 1 25% earn less than $15.00; 75% earn more than $15.00. 2  50% earn less than $20.00; 50% earn more than $20.00 (The 50th percentile is called the Median). 3  75% earn less than $24.00; 25% earn more than $24.00. 4  90% earn less than $29.00; 10% earn more than $29.00.
Percentile means where, if you lined all the data up from lowest to highest. 25th percentile means 25% of the way from the bottom. So for salary, line up all the people in order of salary from nothing to the richest guy, then walk 25% of the way from the bottom and ask that guy how much he makes.
Answers. Best Answer: 10th percentile means that 10% of people make that much or less. 90th percentile-only 10% of people in that job make that much. Median-if you listed all the people in their sample in order of salary, the median is the amount the middle person on the list would make. Source(s): Judy Â· 5 years ago

The term percentile and the related term percentile rank are often used in the reporting of scores from norm-referenced tests. For example, if a score is in the 86th percentile, it is higher than 86% of the other scores. 
1 The 10th Percentile is the boundary between the lowest paid 10 percent and the highest paid 90 percent of workers in that occupation. 2  Ten percent of the workers in a given occupation earn less than the 10th percentile wage and 90 percent of the workers earn more than the 10th percentile wage. 1 The 90th Percentile is the boundary between the lowest paid 90 percent and the highest paid 10 percent of workers in that occupation. 2  Ninety percent of the workers in a given occupation earn less than the 90th Percentile wage and 10 percent of the workers earn more than the 90th percentile wage.
Absolutely, and that is what we use in PayScale salary reports. The range of salaries between the 25th and 75th percentile is what most (50%) of employees are paid. If you want a broader concept of most, look at the range between the 10th and 90th percentiles: 80% of people are paid in this range. nb. Percentile is a simple concept: If the 25th percentile nurse salary is $40,000, that means 25% of nurses (25 out of 100) make less than $40,000, and 75% make more than $40,000. The median is also called the 50th percentile: 50% of nurses make less than the $48,000 median, and 50% make more.
