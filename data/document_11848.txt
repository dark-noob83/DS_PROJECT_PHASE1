The magnetic north pole is currently shifting at a faster rate than at any time in human history — almost 40 miles a year — and some experts believe that it may be the beginning of a complete pole reversal, according to the Independent.
The North Magnetic Pole is cur … rently located in the Arctic Ocean north of Canada and is moving north west at an average of 10 km per year since 1903. In the last couple of years, this movement has speeded up, it is now moving towards Russia at a rate of 40 miles (60 km) per year.
The magnetic north pole had moved little from the time scientists first located it in 1831. Then in 1904, the pole began shifting northeastward at a steady pace of about 9 miles (15 kilometers) a year.
It also has magnetic north and south poles, based on the planet's magnetic field. When you use a compass, it points to the magnetic north pole, not the geographic North Pole. The Earth's magnetic poles move. The magnetic North Pole moves in loops of up to 50 miles (80 km) per day. But its actual location, an average of all these loops, is also moving at around 25 miles a year [ ref ]. In the last 150 years, the pole has wandered a total of about 685 miles (1102 kilometers).
The North Pole is at 90 degrees N latitude. The North Magnetic Pole is currently at about 83 degrees N latitude and 116 degrees W longitude. The North Magnetic Pole is cur … rently located in the Arctic Ocean north of Canada and is moving north west at an average of 10 km per year since 1903.
The rapid shifting of the pole's position has prompted some experts to speculate that the Earth's entire magnetic field may be preparing to flip, whereby all compasses invert and point south instead of north. It may sound radical, but in geological time, pole reversals are relatively common.
