What the Numbers Mean. A fasting blood sugar of 99 mg/dL or less is considered within the normal range. A person is prediabetic if fasting blood sugar is between 100 to 125 mg/dL. Diabetes is diagnosed at 126 mg/dL or greater. It's important to note that one high blood sugar does not automatically make you diabetic
Hello, Children under five years old have a normal blood glucose range of 80 to 200 mg/dL. Five to eleven year old children have a range between 70 and 180 mg/dL. Children who are 12 years and older have a blood sugar range of 70 to 150 mg/dL. 
Answer: Now, in a normal individual we measure blood sugar under different circumstances. What we call fasting blood sugar or blood glucose levels is usually done six to eight hours after the last meal. So it's most commonly done before breakfast in the morning; and the normal range there is 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. 
When you measure blood sugar after fasting for at least eight hours, commonly before breakfast, this is called normal fasting blood sugar level. And you must look for these ranges: 70-100 mg/dl. After taking a meal, your blood sugar will rise. In a normal adult it will not pass the ranges of 135-140 mg/dl. Now, you can see that there exists only a narrow range of blood sugar all the day for a normal adult. In case you’re a diabetic, there will be a huge or oscillated range of blood sugar throughout the day.
The normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L (70 to 100 mg/dL). The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. 
Best Answer: In EMS, we consider anything under 60 mg/dl as treatable with glucose. A normal blood sugar is anywhere around 100 mg/dl. Probably in a healthy adult without diabetes you may see a range of 80-120 depending on when they have eaten. If this sounds somewhat subjective you are right
A normal fasting blood glucose target range for an individual without diabetes is 70-100 mg/dL (3.9-5.6 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70–130 mg/dL (3.9-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). A person with prediabetes has a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl. If the blood glucose level rises to 126 mg/dl or above, a person has diabetes.&quot; and &quot;•An A1C 5.6% or below is normal. In prediabetes, A1C levels range between 5.7%-6.4%
Adults. A normal blood sugar level is between 72 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (4 to 6 mmol/L) for a healthy person. The concentration of glucose in the blood of a healthy person in the morning on an empty stomach is between 68 mg/dL and 108 mg/dL (3.8 and 6.0 mmol/L). Blood sugar level (or blood sugar concentration) is the amount of glucose (a source of energy) present in your blood at any given time. A normal blood glucose level for a healthy person is somewhere between 72 mg/dL (3.8 to 4 mmol/L) and 108 mg/dL (5.8 to 6 mmol/L).
