The information here contains how to build a simple electric powered mini motor from scratch and place this motor to a mini car. The power produced by the motor is depends on the formula and quality of the material that used to build it. The difficulty to build a small motor is only 3/10.
Place the motor on the car while the car is on a flat surface. Move it towards the gears until the gears engage. Mark the location of the motor. Avoid too much pressure on the gears because it will increase the friction and make it difficult for the car to move.
An electric car is driven by a DC electric motor, powered by one or two batteries. Transmission of force from the motor to the car axle is accomplished using two pulleys and one rubber band acting as a belt. A simple switch made of a paper clip is used to connect or disconnect the circuit.
You must need a regulated power supply of 5 volt to do this one because TSOP requires 5v for its operation. Below is the circuit diagram and working of remote controlled dc motor for car using T sop infrared detector circuit. Note: TSOP voltage should not exceed 5V.
- 1 small 1 1/2 volt motor or a similar one (make sure that the motor has a small pulley, if not you will have to get one). - A small wire to connect the solar cells to the motor (may be included with the motor and/or cell when you buy it...if not you will need
Mount the battery holder. Place the battery holder on the car, secure it in place with some glue. Connect the black wire of the battery holder directly to the motor. Connect the red wire of the battery holder to the switch, then connect another small piece of wire from the switch to the motor. Insert the batteries while the switch is open.
To make the mini car go fasters, you can build some gears attached to the motor then only go to the car wheel. This will expand the motor power to the car. It is just fun and meaningful to build a mini car motor.
