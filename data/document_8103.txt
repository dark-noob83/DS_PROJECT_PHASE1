1 Soil-transmitted helminth infections are caused by different species of parasitic worms. 2  They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces, which contaminate the soil in areas where sanitation is poor.
Soil-transmitted helminths refer to the intestinal worms infecting humans that are transmitted through contaminated soil (helminth means parasitic worm): Ascaris lumbricoides (sometimes called just . Ascaris ), whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), and hookworm (Anclostoma duodenale and Necator americanus).
