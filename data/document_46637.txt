Landlord is charging us $7.00/1000 gal + $10fee + sewer on water bill, when the city’s rate is only $3.95/1000 gal for water, I called the city and they know he is doing this to all his tenants but say they can’t do anything about it. I didn’t pay attention to the “rate” on our first bills because even though they were higher than what we pay at our house they were only $10 higher and I chalked this up to the “fee”. But when we get the bill for $103 that’s when we stopped to take notice.

So keep that in mind. Your silver lining is that you don’t have to worry much about heating costs.
