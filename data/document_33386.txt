The Herring Gull is a large gull that can easily be confused with almost any of the other large gull species. The adult wears the typical gull-like plumage of slate-gray back and wings, a white body and head, and black wingtips spotted with white. The legs of the Herring Gull are pink, and the eyes are yellow. The beak is yellow with a red spot on the lower mandible, as in most large gulls. In breeding plumage, the eye has a narrow, fleshy, red ring. Juvenile plumage has a varying degree of mottled brown and white.
Fig 3) This one looks like a Herring Gull in mantle and primaries, but a Glaucous-winged in the head and bill. Not the small, dark eye, very thick bill (with dark mark), and light head smudging (somewhat washed out here). The rather pale mantle suggests the other parent is Herring, not Western.

Adult birds can look superficially like Vega Gulls-- a Herring-like gull with a slightly darker mantle, a dark eye, and a red orbital ring. One key difference, evident here, is the underside of P10 on the far right edge of the photo.
The breeding American Herring Gull has gray back and wing-tops; white underparts, head, neck, tail; pink legs; yellow bill with red spot; yellow eyes with orange orbital ring. Some primary wing feathers have white spots (mirrors) at tips. Nonbreeding adult has brown speckled head and neck.
