Now that you know how to grow a pomegranate tree from seed, you should be aware that your seeds may not grow true to the cultivar it came from. Still, your new pomegranate tree will produce fruit in one to three years and nothing tastes better than something you have grown yourself.
Choose a variety of pomegranate. Punica granatum is a small deciduous tree. It will grow to about 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) tall, with orange flowers during the summer season. The dwarf variety Nana will grow shorter, to about 1 metre (3.2 feet) and are the best for growing in containers.
1 Water the pomegranate every 7-to-10 days once it is established. 2  A soil ring around the tree's base will aid it in retaining moisture. 3  For best results, remove all competing growth from the pomegranate's permanent planting site for 1-to-2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) on all sides of the trunk.
The pomegranate plant generally grows as a multi-stemmed bush or small tree that can reach a height of 10 to 12 feet at maturity. The branches have thorns or small spines and produce dark green glossy leaves that dry and drop over the winter months.
It will take your pomegranate tree 4 to 5 years to mature and start bearing fruit, although this early fruit will take longer to ripen. Once established, pomegranate trees can live for at least 200 years with the best production occurring during the tree's first 20 years.
Pomegranates are hardy and easy to grow. A shrub that can be trained to a 15- to 20-foot tree, pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is an eye-catching, extremely long-lived plant that produces striking red flowers and the signature round fruit full of hundred of seed sacs.
The seeds should be cleaned of the fleshy aril surrounding them and should be planted in loose soil with a covering layer about a 1/2 inch (1.5 cm). Heat should be second on your pomegranate seed care list. These seeds will germinate at normal room temperature in about 30-40 days.
