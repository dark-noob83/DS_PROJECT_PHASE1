Fireflies are not flies at all, but they are kinds of beetles. They are also called lightning bugs. Firefly eggs hatch into little wormlike creatures called larvae. Some kinds of larvae glow in the dark, and those that do are called glowworms. The glowworms eat very small creatures such as other insects, snails, and slugs. Some adult fireflies also eat other insects. Some eat pollen and other flower parts, and some probably do not eat anything at all.
As adults, dragonflies feed on other live insects. They aren't picky eaters. They'll eat any insect they can catch, including other dragonflies. Midges and mosquitoes make up the bulk of their diet, but dragonflies will also prey on flies, bees, beetles, moths, butterflies, and other flying insects.
Other insects eat things that are naturally decaying. Certain kinds of insects, like lice, also get their food by living off other animals. Many insects will also eat human foods. Roaches and flies, for example, are particularly known to love crumbs and garbage.
Like other wild animals, trout feed on other aquatic animals including water-dwelling insects, minnows and crayfish. Some fish are cannibalistic, and will eat smaller members of their own species! Trout get sick in polluted water, as do the aquatic animals they eat for food.
