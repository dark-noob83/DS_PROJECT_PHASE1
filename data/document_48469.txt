Grill the chops. Add the lamb chops to the grill and grill over high heat with the lid open. If you get any flareups, move the chop to a cooler part of the grill until the flames die down. After about 4 minutes, turn the chops over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes. As always, this varies based on the temperature outside, the temp and thickness of the meat, and the grill temp. If you use a instant read thermometer, 155° F is medium.
Cook until done. Lower the heat to medium, cover the skillet, and let the chops cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. 1  To accurately determine whether or not the pork chops are safe to eat, check the center of the thickest chop with a meat thermometer. Add the pork chops and sear them in the hot pan. Sear the chops for 2 minutes on each side, or until each side is well-browned. 1  Pork chops are notorious for drying out when cooked, but there are a few ways to prevent this. 2  Searing the meat is one of the simplest ways.
Grill the chops for 8 to 9 minutes. Place the chops directly above the hottest part of the grill and cook over high heat with the lid open. Use tongs to flip the chops once after 4 minutes and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. 1 You can also spray the pan with a coating of nonstick cooking spray to ensure that the chops will not stick. 2  Give the pan 1 or 2 minutes to heat up. 3  To test whether or not the pan is hot enough, sprinkle 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water into the skillet.
Cook the chops for 7 to 8 minutes, turning once. Place the lamb chops in the skillet and flip them over after 3 1/2 to 4 minutes using tongs.

1 4 Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until the chops register 130°F on an instant-read thermometer for medium rare, about 8 to 10 minutes. 2  Remove from the oven and transfer the chops to a cutting board or serving platter. 3  Tent with foil and let rest 5 minutes before serving. 
Cooking time will be 6 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the chops, how cool they were at the start of cooking, and whether they were brined. Start checking the chops at 6 minutes and continue checking every minute or two until the chops are cooked through. Cover the dish and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. Heat the oven and skillet: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400°F. Place the skillet in the oven to preheat as well. Season the pork chops: While the oven heats, prepare the pork chops.
1 Grill chops on the preheated grill, basting with the reserved marinade until meat is browned, no longer pink inside, and shows good grill marks, 8 to 10 minutes per side. 2  A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 1 Pour remaining reserved marinade into a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. 2  Cook the marinade until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly; serve sauce with chops.
Season with sea salt and black pepper and rub in. Warm a frying pan or griddle over a medium heat until it is hot. Place the pork chop in the pan, fatty side down to brown it. Then lay the chop flat and cook for around five minutes for a 3cm/1¼in chop. Turn the chop over so that it is well-browned on both sides. You can fry a flattened clove of garlic to cook alongside the chop to flavour it very gently
Place the pork chops in a shallow dish and pour the brine over top. The brine should cover the chops — if not, add additional water and salt (1 cup water to 1 tablespoon salt) until the chops are submerged. Cover the dish and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. Heat the oven and skillet: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400°F.
