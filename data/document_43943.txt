Bake the Brisket. 1  Place a fat-trimmed 3- to 3-1/2-pound fresh beef brisket in a 13x9x2-inch baking pan. 2  Cover the pan with foil. 3  Bake in a 325 degrees F oven about 3 hours or until tender, turning once halfway through cooking time.
Allow the brisket to come to room temperature. 3. In a large roasting pan, add the slivered onions, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup of the liquid smoke, 1/4 cup black coffee, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and half the sliced jalapenos.
Expect to cook a brisket anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours per pound depending on the temperature. Typically, when oven roasting a brisket, the temperature is set to 300 degrees F., for 30 to 45 minutes per pound. When smoking a brisket, it is cooked at 225 degrees F., for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hour
Step 4. Bake the brisket in a preheated oven at 300 F for 4 to 6 hours, turning it every 90 minutes so each side is immersed in the cooking liquid approximately half of the time. It's done when you can easily slide a fork or the tip of a paring knife into the meat.

Cover the pan tightly with foil, and bake in the oven for four hours. At this point, if you want a more pronounced smoky taste, pour another 1/4 cup of the liquid smoke over the brisket. Otherwise, just continue cooking for another hour, or roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes per pound.
