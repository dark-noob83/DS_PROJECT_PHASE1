Humus is not just soil, it is a community of living things. Organic matter is a breeding ground for many types of microbes, including bacteria and fungi which break down plant material, and for other microorganisms that help plants roots absorb necessary nutrients.
Humus soil is soil made up of decayed organic material. Popularly, it refers to soil that is light in texture, dark brown or black in color, and sweet-smelling. It is considered the richest soil and is usually described as the ideal soil type.
Adorable animal families that will make you aww. Humus soil is soil made up of decayed organic material. Popularly, it refers to soil that is light in texture, dark brown or black in color, and sweet-smelling. It is considered the richest soil and is usually described as the ideal soil type.
Soil is also made of minerals and water, but the humus makes minerals into plant food. Humus is still rotting, and so is covered with bacteria and fungi. When earthworms are tunneling, this is what they are eating.
Humus is inactive organic material, usually decomposed plants. Most soil has humus in varying amounts, which gives it the distinctive dark brown color. Humus is complex and is made up of a variety of substances that have decomposed to the point of being impossible to identify.
Humus is not a soil type but is in fact a mature compost, either made through a composting process or found in nature, such as the rich topsoil found in some forests.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Rich soil is made up of sand, silt, clay and organic matter (compost) in various stages of decomposition. Humus is the stable remains of decayed organic matter, carbon remains of unknown sorts that attach themselves to clay to improve soil structure. Humus has the ability to increase the soil's water retention, buffer PH, and helps the plant use nutrients although humus is not fertilizer but humic acids and humins.
Soil is made up of a mixture of organic material and minerals. The organic matter comes from dead plants and many of the minerals come from the rocks underground. These rocks, which are part of the lithosphere, are referred to as bedrock.
