2 General description: Anoles (lizards in the genus Anolis) are the most common and abundant lizards found in Miami. The Green Anole is the only species native to the United States. The other anoles present in Miami are non-native, resulting from deliberate or accidental introductions of species from Caribbean islands.
Overview. The green anole or Carolina anole (Anolis carolinensis) is common in pet stores where it is sometimes identified as the American chameleon because of its ability to change color from green to brown. It is important to note, though, that these lizards are not actually a type of chameleon.
Prey: Anoles eat a wide variety of insects, spiders, and other invertebrates. Reproduction: Throughout the warm months, female green anoles lay single, round, eggs, in moist soil or rotten wood. Young resemble miniature adults. Abundance: Green anoles are generally common in almost all habitats.
Range and Habitat: The green anole is a common lizard throughout Georgia and South Carolina, but is absent from some areas in the mountains. Anoles are generally arboreal (living in trees) but can be found almost anywhere.
