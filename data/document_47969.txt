” All post offices and federal offices of any kind will be closed for the holiday, which means that no businesses nor homes will get mail. This also counts out USPS packages. According to USPS, because it is a federal holiday, all federal offices are closed. However, all federal workers are still paid for the day. FedEx will still be open for Veterans Day as will UPS, as they recognize but do not observe the holiday.
Veterans Day is observed on November 11 each year, but there is always confusion about what’s open on the federal holiday. While federal offices close down on Tuesday, retail stores and restaurants will be open for business, with many offering discounts and freebies for Veterans and active U.S. Military.
