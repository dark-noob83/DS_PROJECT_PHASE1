The autoimmune neuromuscular disorder known as myasthenia gravis is accompanied by muscle weakness along with drooping eyelids and double vision. Metabolic disorders, such as Addison’s disease and hyperthyroidism, can lead to weakness in one muscle or a group of muscles.
Hemiparesis is partial paralysis of one side of the body. Hemiparesis usually indicates a neurological insult involving the brain, such as a stroke (CVA) or Transient Ischemia … (TIA) It may also result from a blow to one side of the head.
Muscle weakness can progress to paralysis, loss of the ability to move the muscles. Paralysis symptoms can occur anywhere in the body. They may occur on both sides of the body (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). Paralysis occurring in the lower half of the body, below the midsection, is known as paraplegia.
Muscle weakness, or myasthenia, is a decrease in strength in one or more muscles. It is a common symptom of muscular, neurological and metabolic disorders. Muscular diseases, such as muscular dystrophy and dermatomyositis (disorder characterized by muscle inflammation), are common causes of muscle weakness.
1. Myoparesis=weak or slight muscle paralysis 2. Hemiparesis=slight paralysis or weakness affecting one side of the body 3. Hemiplegia=total paralysis affecting one side of the body 4. Paraplegia=paralysis of both legs and the lower part of the body 5.
17. The weakness or slight paralysis of a muscle is known as __________. myoparesis. 18. Symptoms of __________ syndrome occur when the tendons that pass through the carpal tunnel are chronically overused and become inflamed and swollen. carpal tunnel.
Depending on the cause, weakness may occur in one muscle, a group of muscles, or all the muscles, and it may be accompanied by pain, atrophy, cramping, or other types of muscular symptoms. In some cases, muscle weakness that happens suddenly, especially on one side of the body, can be a sign of stroke.
Paralysis is usually on the side of the body opposite the side of the brain damaged by stroke, and may affect any part of the body. You may experience one-sided paralysis, known as hemiplegia, or one-sided weakness, known as hemiparesis.
