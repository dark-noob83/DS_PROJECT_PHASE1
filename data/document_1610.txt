Overview. Receptors are nature's transducersâ€”they detect circulating hormones or substances released by nerve activity and elicit a biological response. Our research centers on specialized types of receptors called synaptic receptors, found on the surfaces of cells in close proximity to nerve terminals.
Receptor proteins are located in the cytoplasm, cell membrane, or nuclear membrane. 1. Cytoplasmic receptor proteins include those that respond to steroid hormones. Ligand activated receptors may enter the cell nucleus where they modulate gene expression. 2.
Receptor: 1. In cell biology, a structure on the surface of a cell (or inside a cell) that selectively receives and binds a specific substance. There are many receptors. There is a receptor for (insulin; there is a receptor for low-density lipoproteins (LDL); etc. To take an example, the receptor for substance P, a molecule that acts as a messenger for the sensation of pain, is a unique harbor on the cell surface where substance P docks.
In cell biology, receptors are special structures that can be found in cell membranes. These are made of protein molecules such as glycoproteins. Receptors bind (attach) to specialised molecules. If the receptor has this molecule, it is activated, but if it does not it is deactivated.
Cell surface receptors (membrane receptors, transmembrane receptors) take part in communication between the cell and the outside world. Extracellular signalling molecules (usually hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, growth factors or cell recognition molecules) attach to the receptor.
