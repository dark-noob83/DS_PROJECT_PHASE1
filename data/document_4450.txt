Save. Developed by Autodesk in the early 1980s, AutoCAD is a software program for 2D and 3D drafting and design. CAD stands for either computer aided drafting or computer aided design.. The main difference between AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT is that AutoCAD has both 2D and 3D capabilities. AutoCAD LT maintains the 2D elements of AutoCAD, but AutoCAD LT has less features.
The AutoCAD also allows for 3D printing! Furthermore, unlike the AutoCAD, its LT version cannot be used over a network on multiple machines due to unavailability of network licensing. Other differences between the two include customization options, management and automation capabilities, and CAD standards.
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are quite similar but not identical. In this extra Part of Tens are the ten (okay, eleven) most significant differences between the AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT programs.
To begin with, AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD have considerable difference in their price. AutoCAD is the full or complete version and its price level is greater than AutoCAD LT. This is because the LT version is made to be a lost cost version of AutoCAD that has reduced capabilities, that is, can perform fewer functions.
What are the difference between AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. Can anyone tell me the difference between AutoCAD 2008 and AutoCAD 2008 LT version. LT is different than normal version.
Another difference between the two is that while the AutoCAD can only be purchased from official Autodesk dealers, you can buy AutoCAD LT from a number of computer stores where it is available.
