Best Answer: Voyager 1 is travelling at 17 km/s and the 3 RTG's that power Voyager 1 are expected to last until 2025. RTG power plants are designed to last for decades, but once the 238Pu isotopes that power the RTG reach half life power production drops by about half of what the output was when the RTG was activated. Report Abuse. There was some instance that the speed of Voyager 1 was measured at around 39,000 miles per hour when it departed our Solar System on Feb. 17, 1998. At the same time, Voyager 2 (its twin) was 5.1 billion miles from Earth and was departing the Solar System at a speed of 35,000 miles per hour.
Voyager 2 is a space probe launched by NASA on August 20, 1977 to study the outer planets. Part of the Voyager program, it was launched 16 days before its twin, Voyager 1, on a trajectory that took longer to reach Jupiter and Saturn but enabled further encounters with Uranus and Neptune. It is the only spacecraft to have ever visited either of the ice gian
Voyager 1 has since become the fastest and most distant man-made object in the Universe, travelling at around 61,500km/h at a distance of 17.6 billion km from the Earth. Perhaps most incredible of all, NASA is still in communication with it, despite radio signals taking 16 hors to reach it. 
Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. Part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System, Voyager 1 launched 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. Having operated for 38 years, 1 month and 14 days, the spacecraft still communicates with the Deep Space Network to receive routine commands and return data. New Horizons is traveling at about 15 km/s, 2 km/s slower than Voyager 1, and is still slowing down. When New Horizons reaches the same distance from the Sun as Voyager 1 is now, its speed will be about 13 km/s (8 mi/s).
The nearest star, Proxima centauri is 4.22 light years away. Light travels at a speed of 186, 000 miles/sec. = 186,000 x 3600 x 24 x 365 = 5.865 trillion miles per light year. To travel the distance of one light year, Voyager will have to travel for 5.865 trillion miles/(35,000x 24 x 365) = 19,130 years. (Another way to calculate is speed of light/sec divided by speed of voyage/sec = 186,000/(35,000 X 3600) = 19,130 years). For 4.22 light years = 4.22 x 19,130 = 80,730 years. As of August 10, 2007, Voyager 2 is at a distance of around 83.5 AU from the Sun, traveling outward at roughly 3.3 AUs a year. A light year is 63,240 AU-the nearest star is Proxima Centauri at 4.3 light years (therefore 271,932 AU away). Voyager is already 83.5 AU from the sun, so Prox. Cent. would be 271,847 AU away.
On February 17, 1998, Voyager 1 reached a distance of 69 AU from the Sun and overtook Pioneer 10 as the most distant spacecraft from Earth. Travelling at about 17 kilometers per second (11 mi/s) it has the fastest heliocentric recession speed of any spacecraft. New Horizons is traveling at about 15 km/s, 2 km/s slower than Voyager 1, and is still slowing down. When New Horizons reaches the same distance from the Sun as Voyager 1 is now, its speed will be about 13 km/s (8 mi/s).
Calling Them Takes a While. Both spacecraft are still sending scientific information about their surroundings through NASA's Deep Space Network. A signal from the ground, traveling at the speed of light, takes about 13 hours one way to reach Voyager 2, and 16 hours to reach Voyager 1. 
Voyager's fuel efficiency (in terms of mpg) is quite impressive. Even though most of the launch vehicle's 700 ton weight is due to rocket fuel, Voyager 2's great travel distance of 7.1 billion km (4.4 billion mi) from launch to Neptune resultsed in a fuel economy of about 13,000 km per liter (30,000 mi per gallon).
FAST FACTS. Location: Voyager 1 is in Interstellar space and Voyager 2 is currently in the Heliosheath -- the outermost layer of the heliosphere where the solar wind is slowed by the pressure of interstellar gas. Launch & Exploration: NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft was launched in September 1977 and flew by Jupiter and Saturn before continuing on toward interstellar space. NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft also flew by Jupiter and Saturn and went on to explore Uranus and Neptune.
