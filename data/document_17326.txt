The term Level Of Confidence (LOC) is used to describe the percentage of instances that a set of similarly constructed tests will capture the true mean (accuracy) of the system being tested within a specified range of values around the measured accuracy value of each test.
Description Major levels of linguistic structure.svg. English: Major levels of linguistic structure Linguistics defines the levels of structure based on analysis across and within languages, and computational linguistics provides the methods for assigning structure to textual data.
There are different ways to define levels of business organization such as the terms used in business process modeling. This method has three levels of organization -- the organizational level, the process level and the business activity level. Each level offers a different perspective of an organization's activities. In business process modeling, levels of organization help managers analyze how to increase efficiency.
The same number of test sets is used in each of the 1,000 tests. In this example, each test is conducted with 100 test sets. Each test set is constructed in the same manner but each test has a different set of test data.
At the organizational level, it's important to consider all major functions of the business. An organizational-level analysis might include listing functions that support each product family in a manufacturing company. Listing the functions helps to define the business's overall capacity to serve its customers.
