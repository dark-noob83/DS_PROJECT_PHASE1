A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in a planet's surface from which geothermally heated water issues. Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and hotspots.
Hydrothermal Vent Creatures. Travel to a world of perpetual night--the deep ocean hydrothermal vents near the Galapagos Rift where life thrives around superheated water spewing from deep inside the Earth. Discovered only in 1977, hydrothermal vents are home to dozens of previously unknown species.
Like hot springs and geysers on land, hydrothermal vents form in volcanically active areas—often on mid-ocean ridges, where Earth’s tectonic plates are spreading apart and where magma wells up to the surface or close beneath the seafloor.
Hydrothermal vents. Hydrothermal vents-black smokers, white smokers and warm water vents-are areas on the sea floor where water heated by volcanic activity under the seabed gushes out. Unusually, the animal communities down here don't use the sun to get their energy. Instead, chemicals in the hot waters form the basis of the food chain.
While they're not the same thing, they are related; the hot water that spews from hydrothermal vents is heated by the same magma that forms submarine volcanoes. You see, as mid-ocean ridges form, the sea floor spreads away from the ridge; as it cools and solidifies, cracks and fissures form along its surface.
Hydrothermal vents. Hot springs on the ocean floor are called hydrothermal vents. The most numerous and spectacular hydrothermal vents are found along worlds mid-ocean ridges. The heat source for these springs is the magma (molten rock) beneath the volcanic ridge system.
Hydrothermal vents exist because the earth is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common land types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. Under the sea, hydrothermal vents may form features called black smokers.
