Global Warming and Polar Bears. The chief threat to the polar bear is the loss of its sea ice habitat due to global warming. As suggested by its specific scientific name (Ursus maritimus), the polar bear is actually a marine mammal that spends far more time at sea than it does on land. It is on the Arctic ice that the polar bear makes its living, which is why global warming is such a serious threat to its well-being.
In 2008, the polar bear was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act primarily because of the decline of its primary habitat: sea ice.
Polar bears have evolved something else that is different from their ancestor brown or grizzly bears: most polar bears don’t den, however all brown or grizzly bears do. When grizzly bear food is covered in snow during the winter, this species must den because there is nothing to eat. In contrast, most polar bears have access to their food of seals all winter long, so there is no need for them to den. The exception to this is pregnant adult females.
A symbol of the Arctic, polar bears are the world’s largest land predator and biggest member of the bear family. With heavy fur, blubber up to four inches thick and black skin that absorbs heat from the sun, polar bears are amazingly well adapted to the Arctic climate.
Because of ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change, polar bears were listed as a threatened species in the US under the Endangered Species Act in May 2008. The survival and the protection of the polar bear habitat are urgent issues for WWF.
Polar Bears. Polar bear populations are distributed across the five Arctic coastal states (Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the United States). It is estimated that the total population is 20,000 to 25,000 bears. The species is not evenly distributed throughout the Arctic.
