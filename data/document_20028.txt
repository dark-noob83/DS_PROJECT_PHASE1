show more My dentist prescribed an antibiotic for toothache. I had root canal 4 days ago and the pain is still here so as he is out of the country, the nurse said take the prescription (which he had given a week prior to the root canal treatment but I hadn't taken).

It varies pending the complexity of the procedure, condition of the tooth prior to the root canal-was there a possible fracture or presence of infection. Pain medications and/or antibiotics may help with alleviating this discomfort. If a root canal is successful, the sensitivity should be subsided in about 7-10 days.

The exascerbation of your pain is probably that the antibotic prescribed has not cleared you infection and the infection has got worse. See your dentist/doctor.
He said the x-ray showed no infection in the tooth and no decay. He prescribed me amoxicillin (500 mg, 3x per day for 6 days, and a refill if necessary. He said if the pain doesn't go away then I might need a root canal or have the tooth pulled anyway.
My dentist perscribed penacillian for a badly decayed tooth that will need to be extracted. I started taking the antibiotic on Thursday and the pain isn't getting any better. It's going to be at least a week before I can get the tooth
Antibiotics usually work within 4 days. If it is still painful, then it may be that you left it too long and now the antibiotics won't clear it up. I have had several abcesses and it has always resulted in having the tooth pulled out.
Yes, they can. As with any other medicine, antibiotics have side effects and tooth pain may be one of them. Once you're off the antibiotics you'll be able to tell if it was a correlation as the pain should go within a few days.
