It's a tax efficient way for you to invest for your retirement because HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) adds basic rate tax relief to the payments you make into your plan. For example, if basic rate tax is 20% and you make a payment of £160, the taxman will add £40 so the total invested into your plan is £200.
With the Personal Pension from Aviva, you get choice both now and at retirement. 1  Choose from more than 250 funds from some of the top names in investment. 2  Choose from regular and/or one-off payments. 3  Choose to stop, restart or change your payments to suit your circumstances.
You can start an Aviva Personal Pension plan with as little as £200 per month or you can make a one-off payment starting from £10,000. If you make further payments you can choose to make one-off payments of £1,000 if you pay in £200 or more a month.
To be eligible for an Aviva Personal Pension plan you need to be under 75 years of age, eligible for tax relief on the payments you make and resident in the UK. You're classed as 'resident' if you live in the UK all or most of the time – if you're not sure, you can ask your local tax office.
