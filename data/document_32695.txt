You could weld threaded, or non-threaded rods (studs) to the bottom of the beam. Then drill holes in the top plate to align with the rods (studs). If you used threaded rods, use a washer and nut to attach the top plate.
When you want to attach wood to a steel I-beam, there are two acceptable ways to do it. The first and most traditional way is to pack the web between the I-beam flanges with multiple pieces of wood, then bolt them together. This is a very strong connection, but it wastes a lot of time and raw materials in the process.
I have a horizontal steel I beam that I need to attach a 2x4 to in the webbing area of the beam. I have a Hilti DX400 .27 caliber powder actuated gun. I have Hilti 1 7/8 nails that say on the package: for attaching 2x4 to steel up to 1/2 thick. I tried about 12 nails.
Hold the board in place, flush with the bottom of the steel I-beam flange, and mark the locations of the holes from the board onto the I-beam. Fit a drill with a 1/4-inch metal bit and drill holes through the I-beam flange that correspond with the holes in the board. Put the board back in place and insert 1/4-by-3 1/2-inch carriage bolts from the bottom of the board through the holes in the I-beam. Attach the washers and nuts that came with the bolts and tighten them in place with a wrench. The top wall plate is now in place.
A steel I-beam runs the length the of the basement with vertical steel columns spaced periodically across the span. The beam is 5 wide and 8 tall. I'm considering constructing a 2x4, non-load bearing wall directly under the beam but I'm not sure how to attach the 2x4 framing to the underside of the beam.
Cut 2-by lumber with a circular saw to match the desired length of the new wall. The flange width on standard steel I-beams varies, so use lumber that is the same width as the bottom flange of the I-beam. For example, if the flange is 5 1/2 inches wide, use 2-by-6 lumber to frame the wall.
