m/s The standard unit for speed is meters per second (m/s). Speed is also given in kilometers per hour (km/h). In the United States, where the English system of measurem â€¦ ent is still used, speeds are often given in miles per hour (mi/h or mph). One mile per hour is equal to 0.45 m/s. 
IEEE 802.11 is a set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication in the 2.4, 3.6, 5, and 60 GHz frequency bands. They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN / MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The 802.11 family consists of a series of half-duplex over-the-air modulation techniques that use the same basic protocol. 802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac.
Bits per second. Internet speed is measured in bits per second (bps), which is the standard for describing the speed of computer communications. One Kbps (kilobits-per-second) equals 1,000 bits per second and 1 Mbps (megabits-per-second) equals 1,000,000 bits per second. 1 Verify that one end of the Ethernet cable is securely connected to the modem's Ethernet port and that the other is securely connected to the computer's Ethernet port. 2  If using a router, securely connect the Ethernet cable to the router's Internet, WAN or modem port.
1 802.11a specified speeds of up to 54Mbps in the 5GHz band, but most commonly, communication takes place at 6Mbps, 12Mbps, or 24Mbps. 2  802.11a is incompatible with the 802.11b and 802.11g wireless standards. 3  IEEE 802.11b: The 802.11b standard provides for a maximum transmission speed of 11Mbps. 1 IEEE 802.11n: The newest of the wireless standards listed in the Network+ objectives is 802.11n. 2  The goal of the 802.11n standard is to significantly increase throughput in both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz frequency range.
In essence, 802.11ac is a supercharged version of 802.11n (the current WiFi standard that your smartphone and laptop probably use), offering link speeds ranging from 433 megabits-per-second (Mbps), all the way through to several gigabits per second. 
1 IEEE 802.11b: The 802.11b standard provides for a maximum transmission speed of 11Mbps. 2  However, devices are designed to be backward-compatible with previous 802.11 standards that provided for speeds of 1, 2, and 5.5Mbps. 3  802.11b uses a 2.4GHz RF range and is compatible with 802.11g. 1 IEEE 802.11n: The newest of the wireless standards listed in the Network+ objectives is 802.11n. 2  The goal of the 802.11n standard is to significantly increase throughput in both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz frequency range.
1 IEEE 802.11a: In terms of speed, the 802.11a standard was far ahead of the original 802.11 standards. 2  802.11a specified speeds of up to 54Mbps in the 5GHz band, but most commonly, communication takes place at 6Mbps, 12Mbps, or 24Mbps. 3  802.11a is incompatible with the 802.11b and 802.11g wireless standards. 1 IEEE 802.11n: The newest of the wireless standards listed in the Network+ objectives is 802.11n. 2  The goal of the 802.11n standard is to significantly increase throughput in both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz frequency range.
1 Pros of 802.11n-fastest maximum speed and best signal range; more resistant to signal interference from outside sources. 2  Cons of 802.11n-standard is not yet finalized; costs more than 802.11g; the use of multiple signals may greatly interfere with nearby 802.11b/g based networks. 802.11a supports bandwidth up to 54 Mbps and signals in a regulated frequency spectrum around 5 GHz. This higher frequency compared to 802.11b shortens the range of 802.11a networks. The higher frequency also means 802.11a signals have more difficulty penetrating walls and other obstructions.
The 802.11 wireless standards can differ in terms of speed, transmission ranges, and frequency used, but in terms of actual implementation they are similar. All standards can use either an infrastructure or ad hoc network design, and each can use the same security protocols. 1 IEEE 802.11n: The newest of the wireless standards listed in the Network+ objectives is 802.11n. 2  The goal of the 802.11n standard is to significantly increase throughput in both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz frequency range.
IEEE 802.11ay is a standard that is being developed. It is an amendment that defines a new physical layer for 802.11 networks to operate in the 60 GHz millimeter wave spectrum. It will be an extension of the existing 11ad, aimed to extend the throughput, range and use-cases. The 802.11 family consists of a series of half-duplex over-the-air modulation techniques that use the same basic protocol. 802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac.
