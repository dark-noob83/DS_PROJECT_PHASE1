Hydrocarbons that have a double bond between two carbon atoms are called alkenes. These are more reactive than alkanes. Electron-poor molecules react at the pi bond of alkenes. Hydrocarbons that have a triple bond between two carbon atoms are called alkynes.
An important class of binary compounds are the hydrocarbons. As the name implies hydrocarbons consist of only hydrogen and carbon atoms. There are thousands of possible hydrocarbon molecules. However, the simplest type are called alkanes. Alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2, where n = 1,2,3 etc.. For example for n=1 we have CH4, for n=2 we have C2H6 etc..
Alkanes are the simplest organic molecules, consisting of only carbon and hydrogen and with only single bonds between carbon atoms. Alkanes are used as the basis for naming the majority of organic compounds (their nomenclature). Alkanes have the general formula C n H 2n+2.
Hydrocarbons and alkanes. Most of the compounds in crude oil are hydrocarbons. This means that they only contain hydrogen and carbon atoms, joined together by chemical bonds. There are different types of hydrocarbon, but most of the ones in crude oil are alkanes.
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. Saturated means that the hydrocarbon has only single bonds and that the hydrocarbon contains the maximum number of hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom. Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain multiple bonding and contain less than the maximum number of hydrogens per carbon.
Hydrocarbons. Most of the compounds in crude oil are hydrocarbons. This means that they only contain hydrogen and carbon atoms, joined together by chemical bonds. There are different types of hydrocarbon, but most of the ones in crude oil are alkanes.
There are three types of homologous families of hydrocarbons: alkanes, alkenes and alkynes. Alkanes contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. Alkenes contain at least one double bond.
