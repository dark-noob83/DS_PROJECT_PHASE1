Inventors of the Modern Computer. The First Freely Programmable Computer invented by Konrad Zuse. By Mary Bellis. In 1941, the Z3 contained almost all of the features of a modern computer as defined by John von Neumann and his colleagues in 1946. The only exception was the ability to store the program in the memory together with the data. Konrad Zuse completed the Z3 in 1941, with recycled materials donated by fellow university staff and students. This was the world's first electronic, fully programmable digital computer based on a binary floating-point number and switching system.
We could argue that the first computer was the abacus or its descendant, the slide rule, invented by William Oughtred in 1622. But the first computer resembling today's modern machines was the Analytical Engine, a device conceived and designed by British mathematician Charles Babbage between 1833 and 1871. 
First programmable computer. The Z1 was created by German Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room between 1936 and 1938. It is considered to be the first electro-mechanical binary programmable computer, and the first really functional modern computer. Built at the Victoria University of Manchester, the first version of the Mark 1 computer became operational in April 1949. Mark 1 was used to run a program to search for Mersenne primes for nine hours without error on June 16 and 17 that same year.
The ENIAC was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania and began construction in 1943 and was not completed until 1946. It occupied about 1,800 square feet and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons. Built at the Victoria University of Manchester, the first version of the Mark 1 computer became operational in April 1949. Mark 1 was used to run a program to search for Mersenne primes for nine hours without error on June 16 and 17 that same year.
The IBM 5100 is the first portable computer, which was released on September 1975. The computer weighed 55 pounds and had a five inch CRT display, tape drive, 1.9MHz PALM processor, and 64KB of RAM.

Cambridge, England.. is where the 1st Computer was invented by Charles Babbage. Meanwhile Ada Lovelace is credited as the first Computer programmer since she was writing programs-that is, manipulating symbols according to rules-for Babbages machine. I think it was Charles Babbage who invented the first programmable computer. answer 2 Atanasoff, at Iowa State developed an electronic digital computer in 1936, with associat … e Berry.
While it was Babbage who invented the first Computer in Cambridge, another Englishman Alan Turing the Father of modern computer science provided an influential formalisation of the concept of the algorithm and computation with the Turing machine in 1936.

1 The first working computer (in the modern sense) was invented by Konrad Zuse. 2  But others had created machines or ideas close to it before. 3  These were people like Pascal, Leibniz and Turing. 4  The first patent for a working computer (outside the military) was the UNIVAC, created by Drs. Many say the first computer is the difference engine.. The first of these devices was conceived in 1786 by J.H. Ma¼ller. Mã¼ller it was never. Built difference engines were forgotten and then rediscovered in 1822 By Englishman Charles..babbage who is known as the father of The. computer
Who invented the first computer is not a question with a simple answer. There have been a lot of major milestones throughout history that warrant mentioning. The adventure starts in the year 1936. 1936- Konrad Zuse invented the Z1 Computer. This was the first computer that was freely programmable. 1942- John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry created the ABC Computer. 1944- John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly came up with the idea for the ENIAC 1 computer. It was the first real scenario where vacuum tubes were used.
