* Phaseout levels: Income of $94,200 or higher for a family of four, $78,000 for a family of three, $62,000 for a married couple with no kids, and $45,960 for single individuals will no longer receive government health care subsidies. The basic math is 4X the poverty level as determined by the government.
The lower your income, the larger your subsidy. For instance, those making $17,235 a year will pay no more than 4% of income, or $57 a month, while those with incomes between $34,470 and $45,960 will pay a maximum of 9.5% of income, or $364 a month. The federal government will cover the rest.
Tax Credits and Exemptions. If your income is 400% or less of the Federal Poverty Level, you may qualify for a tax credit. To give you an idea, you'll get the credit if your income is $45,960 or less if you're a single taxpayer, and up to $94,200 for a family of four.
Qualification is determined based on household income (more about what household income is in a minute). Those with household income between 133 and 400 percent of the federal poverty line will qualify for a subsidy. Those below 133 percent qualify for Medicare.
In addition to the standard subsidy if your income is below 250% of poverty line, which is about $29,000 for a single person and $59,000 for a family of four, you will qualify for extra subsidies that will lower your out-of-pocket costs like co-payments and deductibles.
The maximum income that you can make must be at or lower than 400% of the poverty line to be eligible for the Obamacare subsidies. This means that as an individual you can make up to $45,960 or as a family of four you can make up to $94,200.
If your income is 138% or less of the poverty level ($15,281 for an individual, or $31,321.50 for a family of four), you won't have to pay the tax. In most states, you will also be eligible for Medicaid. Find out if you qualify
Businesses. Less than 25 employees-If you provide health insurance, you may qualify for a tax credit of up to 50% of the cost. You are eligible if the average wage of your employees is less than $50,000, and you pay at least half of the premiums. That doesn't apply to the health insurance costs of owners.
For example, if you make between 100 percent and 133 percent of the poverty line, you’ll pay, at most, 2 percent of your income toward health insurance. If you make between 300 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level, you’ll pay a maximum of 9.5 percent of your income in insurance premiums.
