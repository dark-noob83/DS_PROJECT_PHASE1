An inoculation loop, also called a smear loop, inoculation wand or microstreaker, is a simple tool used mainly by microbiologists to retrieve an inoculum from a culture of microorganisms. The loop is used in the cultivation of microbes on plates by transferring inoculum for streaking.

Microbiological Inoculation. According to microbiologists, to inoculate means simply to introduce -- or insert -- one substance into another. For example, you could inoculate a bacteria culture with a certain chemical compound -- in other words, you introduce the chemical compound into the bacteria culture. This holds true for vaccinations. If the doctor inoculates you for polio, he introduces a weakened form of polio into your system via injection.
