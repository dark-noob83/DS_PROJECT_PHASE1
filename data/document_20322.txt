In general usage, symmetry most often refers to mirror or reflective symmetry; that is, a line (in 2-D) or plane (in 3-D) can be drawn through an object such that the two halves are mirror images of each other. An isosceles triangle and a human face are examples.
Symmetry comes from a Greek word meaning 'to measure together' and is widely used in the study of geometry. Mathematically, symmetry means that one shape becomes exactly like another when you move it in some way: turn, flip or slide.
Teacher professional development and classroom resources across the curriculum. Symmetry is one of the most important ideas in mathematics. There can be symmetry in an algebraic calculation, in a proof, or in a geometric design. It's such a powerful idea that when it's used in solving a problem, we say that we exploit the symmetry of the situation.
Reflection Symmetry. The simplest symmetry is Reflection Symmetry (sometimes called Line Symmetry or Mirror Symmetry). It is easy to see, because one half is the reflection of the other half.
