A jet flight (at sufficient altitude) from Los Angeles (West) to New York (East) is assisted by the high-altitude tailwind of the Jet Stream, a strong West to East atmospher … ic wind which often exceeds 100 mph. How long is a flight from New York to Los Angeles? Flight: New York, NY (LGA or JFK) to Los Angeles, CA (LAX) Flight Duration 5 hours 45 mins Distance: The direct distance between New York to Los Angeles is 2462 miles (396 … 1 km). The driving distance from New York to Los Angeles is 2,776 mi-about 1 day 17 hours.
An ATR-72, a typical turboprop aircraft. A turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller. In contrast to a turbojet, the engine's exhaust gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust, since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller. The first American turboprop engine was the General Electric XT31, first used in the experimental Consolidated Vultee XP-81. The XP-81 first flew in December 1945, the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power.
On a sector that takes 2 hours for the ATR 72 to fly, the Q400 can easily fly in under 1 hour 40 minutes, slower than a jet by only around 15 minutes. While the ATR 72 struggles to climb to its service ceiling of 25,000ft (FL250), the Q400 reaches this altitude in minutes. The Q400’s performance is simply amazing for a regional turboprop; it behaves more like a jet. The aircraft can fly at a maximum true airspeed of 360kts at FL200 (20,000ft above sea level), while the ATR 72 hits its maximum of 276kts at FL170. This speed advantage lends the Q400 tremendous flexibility.
Propellers lose efficiency as aircraft speed increases, so turboprops are normally not used on high-speed aircraft above Mach 0.6-0.7. However, propfan engines, which are very similar to turboprop engines, can cruise at flight speeds approaching Mach 0.75. The first American turboprop engine was the General Electric XT31, first used in the experimental Consolidated Vultee XP-81. The XP-81 first flew in December 1945, the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power.
Best Answer: Excluding ultralights and light sport aircraft, 4 to 4.5 hours is a typical endurance figure and distance depends on the speed of the aircraft (factoring in wind). There are civilian prop planes that fly 300 mph and planes that fly less than 100 mph at cruise speed. Some aircraft have an endurance of up to 7 hours and others only 3 hours. Maximum ranges in single engine aircraft can vary from 250 miles to over 1,000. I used to fly a twin engine turboprop (a corporate aircraft) that cruised at 300 mph and had a range of 1,600 miles. The Pilatus PC-12, a single engine turboprop (costs about $5 million) has a maximum range of over 2,000 miles
A turboprop engine is a jet engine attached to a propeller. The turbine at the back is turned by the hot gases, and this turns a shaft that drives the propeller. Some small airliners and transport aircraft are powered by turboprops. As featured on NASA's Destination Tomorrow. Jet engines move the airplane forward with a great force that is produced by a tremendous thrust and causes the plane to fly very fast. All jet engines, which are also called gas turbines, work on the same principle. The engine sucks air in at the front with a fan. A compressor raises the pressure of the air
The propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop. Turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below 725 km/h (450 mph; 390 knots) because the jet velocity of the propeller (and exhaust) is relatively low. The first American turboprop engine was the General Electric XT31, first used in the experimental Consolidated Vultee XP-81. The XP-81 first flew in December 1945, the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power.
Some commercial aircraft with turboprop engines include the Bombardier Dash 8, ATR 42, ATR 72, BAe Jetstream 31, Beechcraft 1900, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner, Dornier 328, Saab 340 and 2000, Xian MA60, Xian MA600, and Xian MA700, Fokker 27, 50 and 60.
