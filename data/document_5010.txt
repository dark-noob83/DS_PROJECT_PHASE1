FIGURE 1-11 Body Cavities. (a) The dorsal body cavity is bounded by the bones of the skull and vertebral column. The muscular diaphragm divides the ventral body cavity into a superior thoracic (chest) cavity and an inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The pericardial cavity is inside the chest cavity. These changes lead to the subdivision of the ventral body cavity, or coelom. The diaphragm, a flat muscular sheet, divides the ventral body cavity into a superior thoracic cavity, bounded by the chest wall, and an inferior abdominopelvic cavity, enclosed by the abdominal wall and by the bones and muscles of the pelvis.
The cranial cavity cushions and protects the brain within a rigid skull. The other body cavities also cushion internal organs, but instead of being rigid, they have to be flexible for the heart, lungs, digestive organs, and reproductive organs to expand. A body cavity can be defined as the space that remains after the organs inside it are removed, but this definition does not do justice to the variety and. functions of body cavities.
The Central Nervous System. The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, which are located in the dorsal body cavity. The brain is surrounded by the cranium, and the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae.
Together the cranial cavity and vertebral cavity can be referred to as the dorsal body cavity. In the posterior (dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal cord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities that house them are also continuous. A coelom is a cavity lined by an epithelium derived from mesoderm. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.
The dorsal (posterior) cavity and the ventral (anterior) cavity are the largest body compartments. These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and the ventral cavity allows for significant changes in the size and shape of the organs as they perform their functions. A coelom is a cavity lined by an epithelium derived from mesoderm. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.
Schematic diagrams of the bodies of animals with coeloms, with pseudocoeloms, or without body cavities. In humans all but the cranial cavity develop from the coelom (pronounced SEE-lum). A coelom is a cavity that is entirely enclosed within cells derived from the middle layer of embryonic tissue. A few groups of animals, such as roundworms (Nematoda), have a body cavity that is only partly enclosed by tissue from the middle layer. Such a body cavity is called a pseudocoelom (pronounced SOO-doe-SEE-lum). In a few other groups, such as flatworms (Platyhelminthes), there is no body cavity. A body cavity can be defined as the space that remains after the organs inside it are removed, but this definition does not do justice to the variety and. functions of
The cavities include: 1  Dorsal body cavity. 2  cranial cavity, enclosed by the skull and contains the brain. 3  spinal canal, enclosed by the spine and contains the spinal cord. 4  Ventral body cavity. 5  thoracic cavity, enclosed by the ribcage and contains the lungs and heart. 6  abdominopelvic cavity. A coelom is a cavity lined by an epithelium derived from mesoderm. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.
the ventral cavity contains the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities(abdominal and pelvic cavities) the cranial cavity holds the brain and part of the spinal cord. 2 people found this useful.

Dorsal body cavity. The dorsal body cavity protects organs of the nervous system and has two subdivisions. The cranial cavity is the area within the skull and encloses the brain. The spinal (vertebral) cavity encases the vertebral column and spinal cord. Like the dorsal cavity, the ventral cavity has two subdivisions. The superior division is called the thoracic cavity. The thoracic cavity is surrounded by the ribs and muscles in the chest. Itâ€™s further su divided into lateral pleural cavities (each pleural cavity envelopes a lung) and the mediastinum.
