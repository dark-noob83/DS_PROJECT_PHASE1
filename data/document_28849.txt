Home. The genetic code had to be a language — using the DNA alphabet of A, T, C, and G — that produced enough DNA words to specify each of the 20 known amino acids. Simple math showed that only 16 words are possible from a two-letter combination, but a three-letter code produces 64 words.
Superimpose code. The genetic code by which DNA stores the genetic information consists of codons of three nucleotides. The functional segments of DNA which code for the transfer of genetic information are called genes. With four possible bases, the three nucleotides can give 4 3 = 64 different possibilities, and these combinations are used to specify the 20 different amino acids used by living organisms.
The Genetic Code is ... ... stored on one of the two strands of a DNA molecules as a linear, non-overlapping sequence of the nitrogenous bases Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C) and Thymine (T). These are the alphabet of letters that are used to write the code words.
Genes and proteins are written in different languages.. Genes are encoded within DNA, which are made of nucleotides, while proteins are constructed out of amino acids. In order for a biological cell to make proteins, the genetic information from DNA has to be translated.
Before we can understand what degeneracy of the genetic code means, we must first understand some basics about the genetic code. A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a protein. A gene in DNA is encoded as a sequence of nucleotides.
Concept 22 DNA words are three letters long. The genetic code had to be a language — using the DNA alphabet of A, T, C, and G — that produced enough DNA words to specify each of the 20 known amino acids. Simple math showed that only 16 words are possible from a two-letter combination, but a three-letter code produces 64 words.
