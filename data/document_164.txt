Pyroclastic flows commonly are produced either by the fallback and downslope movement of fragments from an eruption column or by the direct frothing over at the vent of magma undergoing rapid gas loss. Volcanic froth so formed is called pumice. The term pyroclastic''--derived from the Greek words pyro (fire) and klastos (broken)--describes materials formed by the fragmentation of magma and rock by explosive volcanic activity.
In the dark, these pyroclastic flows glowed red. Pyroclastic flows that contain a much higher proportion of gas to rock are known as fully dilute pyroclastic density currents or pyroclastic surges. The lower density sometimes allows them to flow over higher topographic features such as ridges and hills. 508 pages on this wiki. A pyroclastic flow (also known scientifically as a pyroclastic density current) is a fast-moving current of hot gas and rock (collectively known as tephra), which reaches speeds moving away from a volcano of up to 700 km/h (450 mph). The gas can reach temperatures of about Template:Convert.
A pyroclastic flow (also known scientifically as a pyroclastic density current) is a fast-moving current of hot gas and rock (collectively known as tephra), which reaches speeds moving away from a volcano of up to 700 km/h (450 mph). The gas can reach temperatures of about 1,000 °C (1,830 °F). Pyroclastic flows normally hug the ground and travel downhill, or spread laterally under gravity. Their speed depends upon the density of the current, the volcanic output rate, and the gradient of the slope. They are a common and devastating result of certain explosive volcanic eruptions
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. A pyroclastic flow is a fluidized mixture of solid to semi-solid fragments and hot, expanding gases that flows down the flank of a volcanic edifice. PUMICE FLOWS. Pumice flows are pumice-rich pyroclastic flows derived from the collapse of an eruption column. The lowermost part of the eruption column is called the gas thrust region. Here, the density of the eruption column is greater than the density of the surrounding air.
Pyroclastic flows are one kind of sediment gravity flow. Sediment gravity flows are unique fluids because properties such as density and viscosity can change as they move, unlike fluids such as water or air within which density and viscosity change very little, if at all, during movement. Volcanologists first became aware of pyroclastic flows in 1902 at Mont Pelee Pelée martinique 29,000 29000 people. LaCroix (lacroix) 1904 applied the name nuee nuée ardente to, the flows pointing out-the co existence of a basal (glowing avalanche higher density) basal flow and a dilute upper lower density. glowing cloud
The terminology of pyroclastic flows and pyroclastic flow deposits can be complex and confusing. In general, there are two end-member types of flows: 1  NUEE NUéE -- ardentes these contain dense lava fragments derived from the collapse of a growing lava dome or dome, flow.  and PUMICE FLOWS. Pumice flows are pumice-rich pyroclastic flows derived from the collapse of an eruption column. The lowermost part of the eruption column is called the gas thrust region. Here, the density of the eruption column is greater than the density of the surrounding air.
Pyroclastic Flow. There is another type of flow that comes from a volcanic eruption that is much more dangerous than a lava flow, and that is a pyroclastic flow. A pyroclastic flow is a dense collection of fragments and gases from a volcanic eruption that flows down the slope of a volcano. You can recall this term by remembering that the prefix 'pyro' means 'fire,' and the suffix 'clastic' means 'fragments.' So a pyroclastic flow is literally the 'flow of fiery fragments.'
A pyroclastic flow is essentially an avalanche of ash, rock, and gas that flows down the slopes of a volcano at great speed. Temperatures inside these flows can be well over 1 … ,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is unsurvivable for any human, plant, or animal.

They flow down the volcano's side at tremendous speeds.
