Facts about the human brain. 1  The human brain is the largest brain of all vertebrates relative to body size. 2  It weighs about 3.3 pounds (1.5 kilograms). 3  The brain makes up about 2 percent of a human's body weight. 1 The brain makes up about 2 percent of a human's body weight. 2  The cerebrum makes up 85 percent of the brain's weight. 3  It contains about 86 billion nerve cells (neurons), the gray matter.
Based on more than 8000 autopsies of male and female patients without brain diseases the normal brain weight of adult males and females in relation to sex, age, body-weight, and body-height as well as Body Mass Index were calculated. The average brain weight of the adult male was 1336 gr; for the adult female 1198 gr. With increasing age, brain weight decreases by 2.7 gr in males, and by 2.2 gr in females per year. Per centimeter body height brain weight increases independent of sex by an average of about 3.7 gr. Body Mass Index is of minor importance and only relevant in males. Based on these data the independent variables, age and height, were for the first time combined in a nomogram for the calculation of brain weight. 
The size of the modern human adult brain is about 1350 cc.. 1,350 g. The mass of a newborn human brain is about 350-400g. The mass of an adult human brain is about 1,300 to 1,400 g. The brain makes up about two percent of the humans mass. Its average width is about 140 mm, average length is about 167 mm, and average height about 93 mm.
Males have bigger brains .. ­. ­Men do in fact have bigger brains than women. The average human brain weighs in at 2.7 pounds, or 1,200 grams, which is about 2 percent of our body weight [source: Bryner ]. Males, though, have about a 100 g advantage after accounting for differences in total body weight [source: Schoenemann ].

The largest brains are those of sperm whales, weighing about 8 kg (18 lb). An elephant 's brain weighs just over 5 kg (11 lb), a bottlenose dolphin 's 1.5 to 1.7 kg (3.3 to 3.7 lb), whereas a human brain is around 1.3 to 1.5 kg (2.9 to 3.3 lb). Brain size tends to vary according to body size. The relationship is not proportional, though: the brain-to-body mass ratio varies
The adult human brain weighs on average about 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) with a volume of around 1130 cubic centimetres cm 3 in women and 1260 cm 3 in men, although there is substantial individual variation. An elephant 's brain weighs just over 5 kg (11 lb), a bottlenose dolphin 's 1.5 to 1.7 kg (3.3 to 3.7 lb), whereas a human brain is around 1.3 to 1.5 kg (2.9 to 3.3 lb). Brain size tends to vary according to body size.
The balance of findings for human brain size, largely based on participants of European ancestry, indicates an average adult brain volume of 1130 cubic centimeters (cm 3) for women and 1260 cm 3 for men. An elephant 's brain weighs just over 5 kg (11 lb), a bottlenose dolphin 's 1.5 to 1.7 kg (3.3 to 3.7 lb), whereas a human brain is around 1.3 to 1.5 kg (2.9 to 3.3 lb). Brain size tends to vary according to body size.
The average adult human brain weighs about 3 pounds – the same weight as the average brain of a dolphin (which is also a very intelligent animal). But there are animals with larger brains that are not considered to be as intelligent as a dolphin. For instance, a sperm whale has a brain that weighs about 17 pounds. The relationship between brain size and intelligence doesn’t have to do with actual brain weight. It has to do with the RATIO of brain weight to the entire body weight. For example, human beings have a ration of about 1-to-50. Most other mammals have a ratio of 1-to-180. For birds, the ratio is 1-to-220.
Although the human brain represents only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The male brain has decreased from 1,500 cm 3 to 1,350 cm 3 while the female brain has shrunk by the same relative proportion. For comparison, Homo erectus, a relative of humans, had a brain size of 1,100 cm 3.
