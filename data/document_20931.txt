177 degrees Celsius x 9 = 1593 1593 / 5 = 318.6 318.6 +32 = 350.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which can be rounded to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll often come across a recipe that we would love to make, but find the oven temperature listed in the recipe is not what we are used to. Here, in the United States we use Fahrenheit. To convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, you will need to subtract 32 to the Fahrenheit temperature, multiply by 5, then divide by 9. For example, to convert 350 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius you would complete the following equation: 350 degrees Fahrenheit – 32 = 318. 318 x 5 = 1590.
OVEN TEMPERATURES Found a recipe you want to try but, unfortunately, it only gives oven temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and you cook by gas-what is the gas mark equivalent? 
°C To °F. To convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, simply multiply the Celsius temperature by 1.8 and add 32. Or, simply use the handy temperature conversion calculator below. About Oven Baking Temperatures. Checking Oven Temperature. You'll find that oven temperature conversions are often needed when baking, because the old fashioned baking recipes originated in the 1800s and early 1900s when wood stoves were common in household kitchens.
You can read each method below, or use the convection oven conversion calculator. Method 1: Reduce the Temperature Only. For breads, cakes, and other desserts, the rule of thumb for convection oven conversion is to reduce the temperature by 25°F and keep the time constant. For example, if a conventional oven recipe calls for the bread to be baked at 325°F for 1 hour, then in a convection oven you should cook it at 300°F for 1 hour. Method 2: Reduce the Time Only. For roasting meats, the rule of thumb for convection oven cooking is to reduce the time by 25%, but keep the temperature the same. For example, suppose a recipe calls for chicken to be cooked at 350°F for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Below we have shared a conversion chart that shows the conversions for Fahrenheit, Celsius and gas marks. Depending on you oven, you may need to round to the closest option your oven provides you. For example, 177 degrees C can be rounded to 200 degrees Celsius. To convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, you will need to subtract 32 to the Fahrenheit temperature, multiply by 5, then divide by 9. For example, to convert 350 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius you would complete the following equation: 350 degrees Fahrenheit – 32 = 318. 318 x 5 = 1590.
Basic oven temperature conversion places a moderate oven at 375°F. Ultimately, all you can do is use the recipe's suggested time and temperature, if given; but before your baked item is expected to be done, begin to check it visually for doneness. About Oven Baking Temperatures. Checking Oven Temperature. You'll find that oven temperature conversions are often needed when baking, because the old fashioned baking recipes originated in the 1800s and early 1900s when wood stoves were common in household kitchens.
1 When converting recipes from conventional to convection, use the temperature and time from the original recipe as a guideline, checking for doneness after three-quarters of the baking time has elapsed. 2  Or, the original baking temperature may be reduced by 25 degrees F in general. 1 For covered long-baking recipes designed for a standard oven, you may reduce the temperature by 25 degrees F to 50 degrees F when using a convection oven. 2  Follow the user's manual for manufacturer's recommendations for preheat
A convection oven cooks food not only by heating the air inside the oven, but also by moving that air around the food. Because a convection oven circulates this hot air around the food, food can be cooked for less time and at a lower temperature than in a conventional oven. Method 2: Reduce the Time Only. For roasting meats, the rule of thumb for convection oven cooking is to reduce the time by 25%, but keep the temperature the same. For example, suppose a recipe calls for chicken to be cooked at 350°F for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
