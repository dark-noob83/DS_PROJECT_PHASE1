How Big is a Billion? would be 6,500 gallons, which equals approximately 1 billion.5. Ask how many gallons of rice it would take to equal 6 billion (the approximate number of people on the planet). Answer: It would take approximately 39,000 gallons of rice to equal 6 billion!.6. How Big is a Billion? 54 © 2006 FACING THE FUTURE: PEOPLE AND THE PLANET www.facingthefuture.orgHOW BIG IS A BILLION? ENGAGING STUDENTS THROUGH GLOBAL ISSUES A short demonstration of how much 1 billion is, using increasing amounts of rice to represent the world’s population.
If we wanted to make a book with a billion dollar signs, printed 1000 per page as before and with pages printed on both sides, our book would be 500,000 pages long.Now that's a very long book! Interestingly, in England, the British define a billion as a million million. That would be 1,000,000 times 1,000,000 which would be written like this: You can find out more about the British numbering system at the following website called Numbering Systems and Place Value:
In Britain, however, one billion is defined as 1,000,000 million (one million million, or what we in the U.S. call a trillion). So in Britain, the analysis would look like this: 1  answer: 2,737,850.787 years (2 million 737 thousand 850 years, 9 months, 13 days). 1 answer: 2,737.85 years (2,737 years, 10 months, 7 days). 2  This means that if the payments had begun on the first day of the common era (January 1, year 1 on the Gregorian calendar), it would be November 7, 2738 before the $1 billion would accumulate.
the answer: 2.73785 years (2 years, 8 months, 26 days). To complicate things a bit (but once again show the importance of stressing processes rather than answers), the answer to the starting question shown above is correct as long as one is in the U.S. where one billion is defined as a thousand million. 1 answer: 2,737.85 years (2,737 years, 10 months, 7 days). 2  This means that if the payments had begun on the first day of the common era (January 1, year 1 on the Gregorian calendar), it would be November 7, 2738 before the $1 billion would accumulate.
Working out how big these numbers are is made harder because, traditionally, the United States and the United Kingdom meant different amounts when each one talked about a billion. The old UK meaning of a billion was a million million, or one followed by twelve noughts (1,000,000,000,000). The USA meaning of a billion is a thousand million, or one followed by nine noughts (1,000,000,000). The UK government has been using the American meaning of billion since 1974 for the numbers it gives out. Even the smaller American billion is a huge number, and hard to imagine, so we have tried to find a way to show how big it is using some every day objects. The object we chose was a cheesy wotsit.
The Moon: one billion people away. But even in short scale, a billion is indeed real money. Saving the same annual amount as before, joining the billionaires club would take you 40,000 years. Even counting to a billion would take you more than three decades. In the short scale, every new term greater than one million is one thousand times larger than the previous one, So a billion was understood as a thousand millions (1,000,000,000), a trillion as a thousand billions (1,000,000,000,000), etc. A billion :1,000,000,000. Under the long scale, each new term is one million times larger than the previous, with a billon understood as a million millions (1,000,000,000,000). So what would be a billion in long scale would be a trillion in short scale.
1 One billion is a 1 with nine zeros after it, denoted by 1,000,000,000. 2  One billion seconds is about 31 and a half years. 3  One billion pennies stacked on top of each other would make a tower almost 870 miles high. 4  If you earn $45,000 a year, it would take 22,000 years to amass a fortune of one billion dollars. Billions. Next up is one billion: 1  One billion is a thousand millions. 2  One billion is a 1 with nine zeros after it, denoted by 1,000,000,000. 3  One billion seconds is about 31 and a half years. 4  One billion pennies stacked on top of each other would make a tower almost 870 miles high
