Proxima is the closest star to Earth. Faint red Proxima Centauri – at only 3,100 K and 500 times less bright than our sun – is nearly a fifth of a light year from Alpha Centauri A and B. This great distance is what calls into question its status as part of a triple star system. 
The second nearest star is Proxima … Centauri approximately 4.2 light-years away. It is in the Alpha Centauri star system.   It's size is 1/7 that of the sun but it is about 40 times more dense.   There is a tie for third. The same distance as Earth's nearest star-roughly 90 million miles; it is the Sun.       Since the Moon is in the same relative position as earth (separated by on … ly 1.2 light SECONDS) it would be Proxima Centauri at 4.2 light Years.     EDIT: looks like I fail since it is the Sun and not Proxima Centaur.
The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is 4.3 light-years away. 4.3 light year. Taylor, Stuart Ross. Solar System Evolution. USA: Lunar and Planetary Institute, 1992: 41. The nearest star is about 4.3 light years. 4.3 light year. The Sun is about 93 million miles from the earth. The star nearest to the Sun is Proxima Centauri. Astronomers measure the distance between stars in units called light-years. A light-year equals 5.88 million million miles (9.46 million million kilometers)
Hubble image of Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun. NASA. The Sun is the closest star to Earth, about 93 million miles away. The Sun’s nearest neighbor, Alpha Centauri, is actually a triple-star system —three stars bound together by gravity. Alpha Centauri A and B are two bright, closely orbiting stars with a distant, dim companion, Proxima Centauri. 
Alpha Centauri A is just a little more massive and brighter than the Sun, and Alpha Centauri B is slightly less massive than the Sun. Then there’s a third member of this system, the faint red dwarf star, Proxima Centauri. Alpha Centaur System. It’s the closest star to our Sun, located just a short 4.24 light-years away. You can only really measure the distance to the nearest stars this way, since it only works to about 100 light-years. The 20 Closest Stars. Here is a list of the 20 closest star systems and their distance in light-years. Some of these have multiple stars, but they’re part of the same system. 1  Alpha Centauri – 4.2.
The second nearest star is Proxima … Centauri approximately 4.2 light-years away. It is in the Alpha Centauri star system.   It's size is 1/7 that of the sun but it is about 40 times more dense.   There is a tie for third. The nearest star (besides our sun) is 4.24 light-years from earth. This means that light emitted for this star takes 4.24 years to reach earth. Some stars are over millions of light-years away. The closest star is the sun. Beyond that is Proxima Centauri, at 4.24 light-years away. Alpha Centauri is at 4.37 light-years, and beyond that is Barnard's star at 5.97 light-years away
The Sun is really the closest star at 150,000,000 km (93,000,000 miles). Proxima Centauri is the closest star to us, at a distance of approximately 4.2 light years. (Proxima is Latin for next to or nearest to). Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to us at a distance of approximately 4.3 light years. The same distance as Earth's nearest star-roughly 90 million miles; it is the Sun.       Since the Moon is in the same relative position as earth (separated by on … ly 1.2 light SECONDS) it would be Proxima Centauri at 4.2 light Years.     EDIT: looks like I fail since it is the Sun and not Proxima Centaur.
Proxima Centauri has been the nearest star for about 32,000 years, and it will hold this record for another 33,000 years. It will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 26,700 years, getting to within 3.11 light-years of Earth. After 33,000 years from now, the nearest star will be Ross 248. You can only really measure the distance to the nearest stars this way, since it only works to about 100 light-years. The 20 Closest Stars. Here is a list of the 20 closest star systems and their distance in light-years. Some of these have multiple stars, but they’re part of the same system. 1  Alpha Centauri – 4.2.
