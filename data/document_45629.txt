The concepts are manifest and latent content, unit of analysis, meaning unit, condensing, abstracting, content area, code, category and theme. A basic issue when performing qualitative content analysis is to decide whether the analysis should focus on manifest or latent content.

The method has been widely used across the social, behavioural and more applied (clinical, health, education, etc.) sciences.
