In 2015, you can make a contribution of up to $24,000 to your 401(k), 403(b) or governmental 457(b) plan ($18,000 regular and $6,000 catch-up contributions) and $6,500 to a Roth IRA ($5,500 regular and $1,000 catch-up IRA contributions) for a total of $30,500 for 2015.
Best Answer: No, rollovers do not count against the annual IRA contribution limit, which in 2006 is $4,000 or $4,500 if you are over age 50.
Roth IRA contributions do not count for federal tax deductions. You can contribute the same amount as with a traditional IRA. Instead of getting an up-font tax deduction, you get a tax break when you retire.
Rollover transactions are treated differently than contributions. Your rollover does not count towards the annual $5,000 contribution limit ($6,000 for those over 50) normally allowed for Roth contributions and deductible contributions to traditional IRAs.
Retirement Â». Millions of employees have had the option to make after-tax contributions to their traditional 401(k) plans for many years -- long before the Roth 401(k) came on the scene. Now, a recent IRS ruling makes it easier to do an after-tax 401(k) rollover to a Roth IRA.
The limits are the same for Roth 401(k)s, though the contributions do count toward income and all gains are tax-free. But employees can sock away a lot more retirement cash if their company plan offers an after-tax option in a traditional 401(k).
A rollover is considered an entirely different action from a contribution. Thus, the amount of a rollover has no impact on the contribution limit for the year. If you roll $100,000 from a traditional IRA to a Roth in 2013, you can still contribute $5,500, or $6,500 if you are 50 or older, to the Roth.
Coordination With Income. While your rollover doesn't count as a contribution, a rollover from a 401k plan or traditional IRA, SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA into a Roth IRA may affect your ability to make a contribution to a retirement plan that year.
Rollover Added to Income. If your rollover is taxable, you add it to your income when you file your return. For example, if you roll $100,000 from a traditional IRA to a Roth, your income will be increased by $100,000 for that year.
