The length of the program also affects its overall cost. A short program could last for two weeks to 30 days, so it would cost less than a program that lasts 90-days or even six months. The cost of a program is determined primarily by the length of stay, so it's important to take this into consideration.
Figuring Out How Much You'll Pay. The cost of a rehab program depends on a number of factors, such as what kind of treatment you choose, where it's located and how long you stay. Inpatient can range from $2,000 - $25,000 for a 30-day program. Outpatient can range from free to $10,000. Detox can range from $300-$800 a day. Keep in mind that the cost of treatment will likely outweigh the cost of an addiction in the long run. Don't let cost stop you from getting help, and don't shortchange your recovery by picking a lower-cost program that might not give you the help you need.
A good way to look at the cost of an inpatient rehab program is in terms of the level of care: basic, standard and premium/luxury. Inpatient programs can last anywhere from 30 days to 60 days to 90 days or longer.
However, the cost of standard drug and alcohol treatment programs is much less expensive because these programs focus less on luxury and only on providing patients with drug and alcohol treatment. Standard drug treatment facilities cost between $10,000 and $20,000 per month.
The study has found that the average cost per day is $667 for a 28-30 day stay. This daily average has risen almost 5.5% from 2010 and continues to increase annually. The average alcohol rehab cost can vary anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of dollars per day depending on the type of facility.
If you are searching for a drug or alcohol treatment center, you likely want to know how much your treatment program will cost. The price that each patient pays to receive drug treatment generally depends on the location of the facility, its amenities and the treatment programs it offers.
If we assumed 5 days to be the average length of detox, and added this cost to the average 28 day program without onsite detox ($15,491) then this would raise our price to $19,241- still $8,158 below the average price of a 28 day rehab with onsite detox.
