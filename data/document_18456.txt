For many clinical purposes BSA is a better indicator of metabolic mass than body weight because it is less affected by abnormal adipose mass. This page is about the meanings of the acronym/abbreviation/shorthand BSA in the Medical field in general and in the Oncology terminology in particular.

For many clinical purposes BSA is a better indicator of metabolic mass than body weight because it is less affected by abnormal adipose mass. Among them the average BSA for men was 1.91 m2 and for women was 1.71 m2. However, there is some evidence that BSA values are less accurate at extremes of height and weight, where Body Mass Index may be a better estimate.
