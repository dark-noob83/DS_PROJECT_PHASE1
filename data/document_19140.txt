We could argue that the first computer was the abacus or its descendant, the slide rule, invented by William Oughtred in 1622. But the first computer resembling today's modern machines was the Analytical Engine, a device conceived and designed by British mathematician Charles Babbage between 1833 and 1871. 
Who invented the first computer is not a question with a simple answer. There have been a lot of major milestones throughout history that warrant mentioning. The adventure starts in the year 1936. 1936- Konrad Zuse invented the Z1 Computer. This was the first computer that was freely programmable. 1942- John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry created the ABC Computer. 1944- John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly came up with the idea for the ENIAC 1 computer. It was the first real scenario where vacuum tubes were used.
The answer to this question depends on your definition of a computer. The earliest computers were mechanical devices used to help people count. The first known counting devices or tools were Tally Sticks from about 35,000 BCE. The abacus was invented, possibly by the Babylonians or the Chinese in about 2400 BCE. The first of the modern computers was invented during World War II, in 1941 by a German engineer named Konrad Zuse. The computer was called the Z3 and was used to help design German airplanes and missles.
When was First Computer Invented, 10.0 out of 10 based on 2 ratings. When was first computer invented is the question that comes to your mind after having a look of the computer. The answer to this question is not the simple enough. But the invention of the computer is basically a story of long term success. It involves the success of great inventors of the world. 
In 1939, John V. Atanasoff and Clifford Berry developed the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) at Iowa State University, which was regarded as the first electronic digital computer. The ABC was built by hand and the design used over 300 Vacuum Tubes and had capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory. | Filed Under: Inventions 39 Comments. The answer to the question “who invented the first computer” depends of your definition of a computer. The first known counting devices or tools were Tally Sticks from about 35,000 BC. The Abacus was then invented by the Babylonians in 2400 BC
In 1975, Ed Roberts coined the term personal computer when he introduced the Altair 8800. Although the first personal computer is considered by many to be the KENBAK-1, which was first introduced for $750 in 1971. First programmable computer. The Z1 was created by German Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room between 1936 and 1938. It is considered to be the first electro-mechanical binary programmable computer, and the first really functional modern computer.
There is no easy answer to this question due to the many different classifications of computers. The first mechanical computer, created by Charles Babbage in 1822, doesn't really resemble what most would consider a computer today. First programmable computer. The Z1 was created by German Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room between 1936 and 1938. It is considered to be the first electro-mechanical binary programmable computer, and the first really functional modern computer.
The ENIAC was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania and began construction in 1943 and was not completed until 1946. It occupied about 1,800 square feet and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons. First programmable computer. The Z1 was created by German Konrad Zuse in his parents' living room between 1936 and 1938. It is considered to be the first electro-mechanical binary programmable computer, and the first really functional modern computer.
