It varies, but generally along these lines. Residential brick masonry labor costs about $425 to $500 per thousand brick for flat walls. That includes buff or grey mortar, sand and brick ties. Arches, chimney details, decorative designs and rowlocks add a small amount to that. 
I use the figures of 7 bricks/SF for standard size and 5.8/SF for oversize. Standard and oversize are both ~8 long with mortar joint. 3 standard size bricks will make up an 8 course, whereas 5 oversize bricks will make up two courses. Our material costs are typically around $450-500 per thousand. Here, brick is $225 to $300 a thousand, depending on what you pick out, and I estimate modular brick at 7 brick per sq ft which includes waste. Then you gotta add in the sand-maybe $225 for 12 yds delivered, ~1 yd per 1000 brick and $7 a bag for mortar. I think it's 7 bags per 1000 bricks
