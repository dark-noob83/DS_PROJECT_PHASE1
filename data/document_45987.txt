Skeletal muscles are voluntary. You can move any part of your body freely with these muscles, unless you are paralized in which your skeletal muscles are damaged, the nerve cells from those muscles to the spine are damaged, or the spine itself is damaged. Skeletal muscles are found in all of the body.
A voluntary muscle, often called a skeletal muscle, is one of three types of muscle in the body. Most voluntary muscles are used to move bones, though some, such as the muscles in the face, are used to create movements below the skin.
Most of the major muscle groups used or movement and communication are voluntary. Involuntary muscles would be things like your heart and the muscles around your intestines, which you generally cannot consciously control. The skeletal is called voluntary muscle because it is usually subject to conscious control.
Most voluntary muscles are connected to bones and help people move around. Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles, while cardiac and smooth muscles are not. Voluntary muscles are connected throughout the skeletal system. The tongue is a voluntary muscle. A voluntary muscle also is called a skeletal muscle. A slight movement by one or more of the 43 facial muscles results in one of the many different expressions that humans can make.
Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles because we have voluntary control over them. In other words, we largely decide when to move them and to what degree (i.e. a little force â€¦ vs a great force). Other muscles such as smooth muscle and cardiac muscle we cannot control voluntarily.
