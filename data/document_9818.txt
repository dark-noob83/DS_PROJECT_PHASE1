Honda's first vehicle with CarPlay will be the 2016 Honda Accord [Update]. At an event in Silicon Valley today, Honda revealed that the 2016 Honda Accord will be the first of its models to sport CarPlay, bringing the connected platform to both sedan and coupe models of the car.
For the road ahead. Android Auto was designed with safety in mind. With a simple and intuitive interface, integrated steering wheel controls, and powerful new voice actions, it's designed to minimize distraction so you can stay focused on the road.
2016 Honda HR-V - OEM Parts & Accessories. American Honda currently has top-selling Crossover vehicles in two of the three Crossover categories: 1  Mid-Size: Honda Pilot-will be totally refreshed for the 2016 model year-expected to be available late Summer 2015.
Custom Performance for Honda HR-V. While trying to decide what performance parts are right for your Honda HR-V, whether it be brake parts, spark plugs or a new suspension, you'll be inundated with a vast choice of performance upgrades at CARiD.
1 Mid-Size: Honda Pilot-will be totally refreshed for the 2016 model year-expected to be available late Summer 2015. 2  Compact: Honda CR-V - just refreshed last year, the 2015 CR-V was just awarded the 2014 Motor Vehicle Trend SUV of the year.
However, Android Auto and Car Play was just announced on the new Accord. The hardware side on the head units should be similar to the HR-V so a simple software upgrade should get those features on the HR-V. The question is if Honda wants to allow that or just have HR-V owners buy the next generation with Android Auto and Car Play. Personally, I wouldn't mind paying a small fee to update my HR-V head unit software.
