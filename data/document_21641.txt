This might seem really straight forward but the size of the battery is critical. An PBX-802 power bank battery charger with 8800maH will take longer to charge when compared to the PBX-203 portable charger battery with 2200maH. The second factor is the input flow. The input flow is the relative amount of electric charge required for the charging of the lithium battery.
