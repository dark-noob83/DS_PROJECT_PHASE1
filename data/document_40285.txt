Still, I am certain we will find that the Democrats received more votes than Republicans, McDonald said. Wasserman compiled his own tally of the national popular vote for House races. With the addition of late December data from New York, the Democratic advantage widened to 1.36 million votes. According to his breakdown, House Democratic candidates got 49.15 percent of the vote, Republicans got 48.03 percent, and other candidates got 2.81 percent. Still, they won just 46.21 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201. It was the second time in 70 years that a party won the majority of the vote but didn’t win a majority of the House seats, according to the analysis.
Older Americans vote in very high numbers. In 2008, 70.2 percent of people over age 65 voted, according to the Census Bureau. And in that election, older voters supported John McCain over President Obama by an eight-percentage-point margin, with 53 percent voting for Mr. McCain. And of those who did vote, a substantial chunk voted for John McCain, the Republican candidate: 25 percent of those making under $15,000, and 37 percent of those making $15,000 to $30,000.
Discounting New York City's votes, Obama still would have carried New York State, but by a closer margin. Excluding New York City, Obama's vote total in the state was 2,490,636 to Romney's 2,053,607, giving Obama a 54.03%-44.54% win outside of NYC. See full list of sources See full list of sources.

2010 Census Reapportionment: New York lost two electoral votes, giving it 29 through the 2020 presidential election. This is the 7th consecutive Census where New York has lost two or more electoral votes. New York, one of the 13 original colonies, joined the Union in July 1788. In the 1810 census, New York became the nation’s most populous state, and had the most electoral votes from the 1812 election until the 1972 election, when it relinquished that distinction to California. Texas surpassed New York in those numbers in 2004.
New York was one of only six states to swing in President Obama's favor from 2008 to 2012, giving him the largest percentage of the vote for any presidential candidate in the state since 1964 and the second largest Democratic vote share in the state in history. Excluding New York City, Obama's vote total in the state was 2,490,636 to Romney's 2,053,607, giving Obama a 54.03%-44.54% win outside of NYC.
The reason that victorious Democrats won 20 million more votes than victorious Republicans is that half of the victorious Democrats won in 2012, while 80 percent of the victorious Republicans won in 2010 or 2014. Presidential elections have higher turnout than midterm elections. For example, Heidi Heitkamp barely won her Senate seat in 2012 with 161,000 votes, for a one-point victory. Two years earlier, her co-senator, John Hoeven, won with over 70 percent of the vote. But because 80,000 fewer votes were cast in 2010 than in 2012, Hoeven received only 182,000 votes.
Obama took 1,995,241 votes in New York City, to Mitt Romney's 436,889, giving Obama 81.19% of the vote to Romney's 17.78%. No other presidential candidate of either party has ever received more than 80% of the vote in New York City. Excluding New York City, Obama's vote total in the state was 2,490,636 to Romney's 2,053,607, giving Obama a 54.03%-44.54% win outside of NYC.
By Cook’s calculations, House Democrats out-earned their Republican counterparts by 1.17 million votes. Read another way, Democrats won 50.59 percent of the two-party vote. Still, they won just 46.21 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201. It was the second time in 70 years that a party won the majority of the vote but didn’t win a majority of the House seats, according to the analysis.
In New York City, where Obama won 81 percent of the vote, Democrats won 11 of the 12 congressional districts with an average of 85 percent of the vote. “Democrats will win a lot of those districts with huge majorities, but they’re wasting a lot of votes,” Jacobson said. Democrats failed to regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives even though they won 1 million more votes than Republicans. The number of states backing Senate and presidential candidates of the same party grew to the largest in at least 60 years.
