The major organs of the immune system are bone marrow, thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. These organs produce lymphocytes required to destroy bacteria, virus, tumor cells, etc. This article dwells on these major immune system organs that protect the human body from infections.
Immune System The immune system is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from infection. Although scientists have learned much about the immune system, they continue to study how the body targets invading microbes, infected cells, and tumors while ignoring healthy tissues.
“Secondary organs” - these immune organs are spots or sites in which the lymphocytes localize, identify unfamiliar antigens and triggers reaction in opposition to it. It Contains tonsils, lymph nodes, Spleen, Peyer’s patches (in the small intestines), appendix and liver.
Organs of the immune system make cells, that either contribute in the immune response, or act as sites for the immune function. Major Organs of the Immune System. The main organs in the immune system are the bone marrow, thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Let us have a look at these immune system organs and functions. Bone Marrow: All the cells of the human immune system are formed in the bone marrow, found within the bones, by a process called hematopoiesis.
The organs involved with the immune system are called the lymphoid organs. They affect growth, development, and the release of lymphocytes (a certain type of white blood cell).
The immune system is made up of a complex network of cells and organs that protect the body from infection. The Immune System-Click to Enlarge. Lymph nodes are part of the immune system. They release lymphocytes, a certain type of white blood cell that fights infection. The blood vessels and lymph vessels carry the lymphocytes to and from different areas in the body. Each lymphoid organ plays a role in the production and activation of lymphocytes.
