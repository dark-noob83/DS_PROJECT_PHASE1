Many landlords set a percentage for a late fee. A standard amount for a late fee is 3 to 5 percent of the monthly rental amount. If you pay $750 per month, this would be about $23 to $38. This amount is typically considered an adequate amount to cover any late fees or other charges the landlord absorbs because your rent is late. Calculate the percentage to make sure the flat fee is a reasonable amount. For example, if you're paying $750 per month and the late fee is $75, that's a 10 percent fee. Although that high percentage may be legal in some states, it's higher than the standard 3 to 5 percent.
Landlords may choose to charge a flat fee instead of a percentage. Calculate the percentage to make sure the flat fee is a reasonable amount. For example, if you're paying $750 per month and the late fee is $75, that's a 10 percent fee. Although that high percentage may be legal in some states, it's higher than the standard 3 to 5 percent.
Typical late rent fees are 5% to 10% of the monthly rent (e.g. $50 to $100 late fee for $1000 of rent). Some landlords may also demand an additional fee for each day that the late is rent. (e.g. $15 additional charge per day). 
OTHER METHODS. DAILY AMOUNT-The landlord may charge a daily amount as a late fee ($10 per day, as an example). SIMPLE INTEREST-The Landlord may be able to charge simple interest, which is a percentage (use 6% as an example) of the rent that due. HOW MUCH SHOULD THE LATE FEE BE. Since not all states regulate LATE RENT PAYMENT FEES, it is up to the landlord to decide how much to charge. The general rule of thumb is a REASONABLE or FAIR fee, regardless of which method is used.
A landlord generally has the ability to charge a late fee if rent is not paid on the due date. However, the landlord must have included a late fee provision in the written lease agreement stating how much the late fee is and when the late fee is due.

Re: Late Fee-How much do you charge? by Jack (NY) on March 25, 2009 @13:42. My late fees are usually 10% of the rent or if the rental is over $1000, the initial late fee if not paid by the 5th would be a flat $100. with a $20. per day daily late fee after the 7th.
