Night minutes start at 9:01 and go until 5:59 the next morning. Weekend minutes start 9:01 Friday night and go until Monday morning at 5:59. All users on your family share plan will have unlimited night and weekend minutes. Night and weekend minutes do not count as the 700 mins that you get during the day time period. Hope this helped.
Best Answer: The National plans all have free night and weekends; Night Hours: Monday – Friday 9:01 p.m. – 5:59 a.m. Weekend Hours: (this actually start on Friday @ 9:01pm) 12:00 a.m. Saturday – 11:59 p.m. Sunday.
Hours. Verizon defines the times that fit within the unlimited nights and weekends plan. Unlimited night calling time begins at 9:01 p.m. and ends at 5:59 the next morning. These hours apply weekdays, Monday through Friday. Verizon considers weekend hours to begin at midnight Saturday through 11:59 p.m. Sunday.
I'm pretty sure all plans do, even if you have a family plan I'm pretty sure of it. Free nights start at 9:00 and end at 6:00 the next morning. Free weekends go from 9:00 on Friday night until Monday morning at 6:00. (Don't worry, I have Verizon, haha).
