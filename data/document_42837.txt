The large intestine consists of the cecum and colon. It begins at the right iliac region of the pelvis (the region just at or below the right waist) where is continues from the small intestine and continues up the abdomen.
The small intestine is a tubular structure within the abdominal cavity that carries the food in continuation with the stomach up to the colon from where the large intestine carries it to the rectum and out of the body via the anus.
Large quantities of water are secreted into the lumen of the small intestine during the digestive process. Almost all of this water is also reabsorbed in the small intestine. Regardless of whether it is being secreted or absorbed, water flows across the mucosa in response to osmotic gradients.
The large intestine consists of the colon, rectum, and anal canal. The wall of the large intestine has the same types of tissue that are found in other parts of the digestive tract but there are some distinguishing characteristics. The mucosa has a large number of goblet cells but does not have any villi.
Structure of the large intestine. The large intestine is made up of the colon and the rectum. The colon is a tubular structure that is around 1.5 m, about one quarter of the length of the small bowel. Its largest diameter is at the cecum (7.5 cm) and narrowest in the sigmoid (2.5 cm). The colon is continuous with the small intestine from the ileocecal valve and ends finally at the anal verge.
Goblet cells are scattered among the absorptive cells in the epithelium of the small intestine and colon. These epithelial cells are specialized for secretion of mucus, which facilitates passage of material through the bowel. The name goblet refers to the cell's shape, narrow at the base and bulging apically.
