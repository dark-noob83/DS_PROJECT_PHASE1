When we first moved in, I had given a cursory look into filling in the pool, and that cost was approximately $10,000. Hmmmmm $15,000 to fix a pool we seldom used + the $3000 yearly costs, versus $10,000 to fill it in and be done with the headache and regain a portion of our yard. Seemed like a no-brainer to me! Well, over the course of the winter hubby ruminated on the idea. When I got a quote of $9,900 to fill in the pool, I said “sold.” We have a young son, but in our case, the pool either had to be completely rehabbed or we had to fill it – and with filling being less than half the cost of a rehab…and with us hoping to send our son to college one day…that pretty much made our decision.
Ordering Your Fill. Swimming pools are fairly deep, and require large amounts of material to fill. That is why you want to purchase a low cost fill, topsoil will be needed, but only for the surface layer. Our fill is $12.00 per cubic yard. We have another material call tailings which cost only $5.00 per cubic yard. Tailings are small stones that are a byproduct of our topsoil screening process. For example if our pool is 30′ long, 20′ wide’ and 6′ deep, it has a total volume of 3,600 square feet (30x20x6). The total square footage divided by 27 is 133.33, this indicates that your pool will need 133.33 cubic yards of material to fill it in.
I'm hearing that for a pool around my size it will cost about $800 to fill from one of those truck services. But I just sat down with my quarterly water bill and determined I'm only paying about $0.03/cubic foot of water. Therefore, to fill a 22,500 gallon pool, if my math is correct (7.48 gallons per cubic foot)it should only cost me about $90 to fill my pool via my garden hose (albeit it will take about 25 hours to do so!).
