Jem and Scout find gifts in the knothole of the tree. Boo Radley has been placing these gifts there. It is a form of communication between Boo and Jem and Scout. It proves that Boo Radley is capable of kindness.

Scout is the first to find something in the knot-hole in the oak tree on the Radleys' property. She finds two sticks of Wrigley's Double-Mint gum. Scout was hesitant to eat it because she found it on the Radley's property but eventually she does.
2 pieces of chewing gum (Scout removed the wrapper from the gun when she removed it from the tree, Wrigley's Double Mint). 2 scrubbed and polished pennies, one on top of the other (confirmed to be a 1906 and 1900, both Indian-heads by Jem).
In chapter 4 of To Kill a Mockingbird, Jem and Scout begin finding objects left for them to discover inside a knot-hole of an oak tree at the Radley's. The first object Scout discovered was a piece of Wrigley's Double-Mint gum. The second object they find is a box with two polished Indian-head pennies.
