The National Pork Board recommends cooking pork chops, roasts, and tenderloin to an internal temperature between 145° F. (medium rare) and 160° F. (medium), followed by a 3 minute rest. Since large cuts increase approximately 10° F. while resting, remove them from the heat at 150° F. followed by a 10
It is necessary, therefore, that pork is cooked to an internal temperature of 176°F (77°C) for fresh loin roasts to 185°F (85°C) for other large fresh cuts. Cured and smoked products should reach an internal temperature of 160°F to 170°F (72°C to 85°C). 77–85 °C. Reichl, Ruth.
It says cooking raw pork, steaks, roasts, and chops to 145 degrees with the addition of a 3-minute rest time will result in a product that is microbiologically safe and at its best quality.
The desirable temperature while cooking pork seems to be around 163°C-191°C (325-375 °F). Many cookbooks suggest that they be cooked at that temperature for approximately 4-5 hours. Also, the inner temperature of the pork should be around 71 °C (160 °F) before it is safe to be eaten.
Today's pork can be safely enjoyed when cooked to an internal temperature of 145 °F as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming.

May 25, 2011 -- Just in time for the start of grilling season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has updated guidelines for safely preparing pork. The USDA recommends that pork be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. The federal agency says it is lowering the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 degrees to 145 degrees and adding a 3-minute rest time.
