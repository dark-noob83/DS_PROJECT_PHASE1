You can donate to people with A+, B+, AB+ or O+. You only get blood from someone that is O+ though. People with positive blood cannot donate to people with negative blood and vice versa. Like An O+ donor can give to A+, B+, or AB+, as long as the type, screen, and crossmatch is compatible. If in EXTREME emergencies, you can give O-blood to anyone, but ONLY O-because it lacks any red blood cell surface antigen,and therefore won't cause a hemolytic transfusion reaction. O-people are universal donors.

Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: An O+ person can only receive O+ or O-packed red cells. This is due to the fact that an O person has neither the A or B antigens on the surface of their red cells, and therefore can make A and/or B antibodies in their plasma. They can donate to an AB+, A+, B+, or another O+ person. This is why they are sometimes called the universal donor, but in reality it's O-that are the universal donors, because an O+ person can only give to another Rh+ person, whereas O-can give to anyone.
A person with type A blood can donate blood to a person with type A or type AB. A person with type B blood can donate blood to a person with type B or type AB.

The blood group O positive(O+) specifies that the person can donate  his/her blood to any other person of same or different blood group.  But, O+ can accept blood only from … a person having same blood group  (i.e O+) and not from any other group. + 41 others found this useful. 
If you have O+ blood you can donate to anyone who is also Rh + . You can donate to A+ , B+, AB+ and other O+ people. You can't donate whole blood to someone that is O-, because they lack the D antigen, and you have the D antigen on the surface of your red blood cells. Like An O+ donor can give to A+, B+, or AB+, as long as the type, screen, and crossmatch is compatible. If in EXTREME emergencies, you can give O-blood to anyone, but ONLY O-because it lacks any red blood cell surface antigen,and therefore won't cause a hemolytic transfusion reaction.
