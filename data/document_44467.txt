Carl Linnaeus, also known as Carl von Linne linné Or Carolus, linnaeus is often called The father Of. Taxonomy his system for, naming, ranking and classifying organisms is still in wide use (today with many). changes
Classification and Taxonomy Two scientific processes deal with classifying and naming living things.is the process of arranging organisms into groups basedon similarities. is the science of naming and classifyingorganisms. Classification and taxonomy are related studies.
Using Classification To classify organisms, scientists use similarities and differences amongspecies. Sometimes these differences are easy to see, such as whetheran animal has fur, feathers, or scales.
