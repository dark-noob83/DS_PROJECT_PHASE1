Of all the “superbugs” that can infect you, the one you’re most likely to get outside of a hospital setting is community-acquired MRSA (pronounced mer’-suh). The official name is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. I see it in the office fairly often, and it’s resistant to the antibiotics we commonly use for staph. For cases where you can’t get to a doctor, everyone should know how to treat MRSA.
An antibacterial cream can be used to remove MRSA from inside your nose, and an antibacterial shampoo can be used to remove it from your scalp.
