The perceived cost of a terabyte of enterprise storage is about 1.5 to 2.5 cents/MB ($150,000 to $250,000/TB). Depending on the specifics and various bells and whistles, the cost could shoot up to $800,000/TB, but even that price is significantly below the $1 million-plus cost of just a few years ago. That works out to be $7/GB or $7,000/TB and the company will have products that threaten to break the $1,000/TB barrier. And our cost includes no charge for support for three years, he adds. At that price, you can just toss it out after three years and buy new storage, which will likely cost even less.
There is a saying in the storage industry that capacity is free and performance costs. This is true to an extent because, for example, in raw capacity terms, the price (per TB) of a 15,000rpm high-performance drive can be 20x to 30x more than a SATA 7,200rpm device. A consumer can get a 4TB capacity drive for less than £100. That’s an incredible £0.025 per GB. But while raw drive prices are measured in pennies per gigabyte, the actual cost of storage for the enterprise is much higher, and more difficult to calculate.
Pricing out an R720XD on the Dell website, I found a server with 128GB of memory and twelve 1.2TB disks comes in at $15,276. That’s $1060 per terabyte. Cool. However, Hadoop needs two replicas of all data to provide basic high availability. But it quickly pays for itself. Chant: Dollars per Terabyte, Dollars per Terabyte ... The primary value proposition on the lips of the NoSQL and Hadoop vendors is always “cost per terabyte.” This is common with new products in new markets – we’ve heard it before from multiple of startup MPP vendors.
In the mid-tier, the VA is targeting a cost of $20 per GB for 50 TB of storage that meets 250 IOPS on SPC-1 and 25 MBPS on SPC-2. For its premium tier, the VA intends to keep the costs under $125 per GB per month for 50 TB of storage that offers 500 IOPS on SPC-1 and 25 MBPS on SPC-2. We will use the workload characteristics to determine which tier, says Yaple. With discount computer stores selling disk drives for a dollar per gigabyte, how can enterprise storage systems cost many times that amount? Fry's electronics, for example, recently advertised the Buffalo TeraStation at $1699 for 2 TB of NAS. That's $1.17 per GB
SAN will lower my costs. Myth #1: Storage is Getting Cheaper. While it is true that disk storage per Terabyte has been declining by 35% to 40% per year, the average amount of storage installed has increased by about 45% annually during the same period. In fact, storage is the fastest-growing capital cost within the data center. 
And because legacy data management technologies often store multiple copies of the same data on different systems, the total cost might be more like $30,000 to $40,000 per terabyte, Zedlewski claims. Pre-existing data management technologies, by comparison, might make big data projects uneconomical. If you look at network storage, it's not unreasonable to think of a number on the order of about $5,000 per terabyte, said Zedlewski. Sometimes it goes much higher than that.
Tweet. Hadoop systems, including hardware and software, cost about $1,000 a terabyte, or as little as one-twentieth the cost of other data management technologies, says Cloudera exec. Managing prodigious volumes of data is not only challenging from a technological standpoint, it's often expensive as well. Pre-existing data management technologies, by comparison, might make big data projects uneconomical. If you look at network storage, it's not unreasonable to think of a number on the order of about $5,000 per terabyte, said Zedlewski. Sometimes it goes much higher than that.
Because Google Cloud Storage Nearline is intended for infrequently accessed data, you will incur the following costs for data access and early deletion: 1  Data retrieval incurs a cost of $0.01 per GB. 2  Data deleted in less than 30 days incurs a minimum 30 day charge. On-Demand I/O is I/O you can purchase beyond the provisioned I/O for Google Cloud Storage Nearline. You are billed for bytes read in excess of the provisioned 4MB/s per TB per location at a rate of $0.00/GB.
One common way to express cost of storage is to produce a cost per gigabyte or terabyte figure. For example, if you purchased a SAN with 13 TB of RAW capacity for $39,000, you paid $3,000 per TB. For the cost conscious, that's not a bad metric, but performance shouldn't be ignored, lest a low price result in an unacceptable solution.
