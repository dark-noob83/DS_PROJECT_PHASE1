Size of a Solitary Confinement Cell. During Tuesday's Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on solitary confinement in U.S. prisons, Sen. Al Franken asked Charles Samuel, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons about the size of a cell. Here's the exchange as it happened.
What is the average size of a US home?   According to the National Association of Home Builders, the average home size in the United States was 2,330 square feet in 2004, up from 1,400 square feet in 1970.
The Standard Size of a Jail Cell. The standard size of jail cells is 6 feet by 8 feet. To prevent prisoners from escaping, every cell is equipped with heavy-duty door locks, which can only be opened from the outside. The different fixtures and furnishings available inside are designed not to be broken easily.
A confined space where prisoners are detained, a jail cell is sometimes called a holding cell or a prison cell. Commonly, it only has a single door, plus the wall is usually made from either brick or plastic. In Great Britain, police stations have cells with every door equipped with a sliding hatch. The primary purpose of this important feature is to give police officers the capacity to observe the prisoners inside the cells. In addition to these basic facts, it is also good to know the standard dimensions of a jail cell.
The typical prison cell is eight by six feet (about 2.5 by 1.8 meters), with a metal bed tray (either bolted to the wall or free-standing on metal legs), a sink and a toilet. There may be a window allowing a view outside the prison.
We used 80 square feet as an average size – and boy is that a small, small area. The waiting room was roughly three and a half times that size and I don’t think I could keep my sanity after spending one day locked in that room. I can’t imagine what it would be like to spend just one day in your average prison cell.
