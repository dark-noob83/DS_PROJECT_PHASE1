The electron transport chain (ETC) is located in a mitochondrion; in fact the mitochondrion has two membranes around it and the ETC is located within the inner membrane which is folded into cristae to increase the surface area for ATP synthesis.

B. to convert energy in electron carriers into ATP. C. To use energy from the passing of electrons in electron carriers into a high concentration of hydrogen ions. D. to return NAD+ and FAD to the rest of the reactions of energy extraction.
The electron transport chain converts energy stored in hydrogen ions and various other substances formed in early cellular respiration to produce high energy ATP in mitochondr … ia. Mitochondria contain both an inner and an outer membrane, and it is along the inner membrane that the actual reactions of the chain occur.
1. The electron transport chain in bacteria is located... in the cytoplasm. in the mitochondria. in the cell wall. in the cell membrane. in the plasmid. 2. During aerobic respiration, the last carrier protein transfers a pair of electrons to... water.
NADH 2 hydrogen intermembrane. STEP 2: ____ provides _ electrons to the first carrier in the chain. This process releases energy because the electrons are at a lower energy state after being passed to the first carrier. The energy released is used to drive the transport of ________ ions into the ______________ space.
In chloroplasts, light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and NADP+ to NADPH and a transfer of H+ ions. NADPH is used as an electron donor for carbon fixation. In mitochondria, it is the conversion of oxygen to water, NADH to NAD+ and succinate to fumarate that drives the
Electron transport requires oxygen directly. The electron transport chain is a series of electron carriers in the membrane of the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. Through a series of reactions, the high energy electrons are passed to oxygen. In the process, a gradient is formed, and ultimately ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation.
An electron transport chain(ETC) couples a chemical reaction between an electron donor (such as NADH) and an electron acceptor (such as O2) to the transfer of H+ ions across a … membrane, through a set of mediating biochemical reactions.
