This means on a $100,000 dollar construction cost project, the architectural fees would fall in the range of $8,000 to $15,000 range – pretty simple really but one of the things that can always cause confusion is what exactly counts as part of the cost of construction. That just leaves the last bit – the architectural fees. In our office, almost all of our contracts are based on a percentage of construction costs. Most architectural firms who subscribe to this way of determining their professional services fee fall into the 8% to 15% range.
Fees range from $2 to $5 per square foot for concept development and $1 to $4 per square foot for construction document production. Fees based on a percentage of construction cost is most commonly used in medium to large commercial projects. The average fees for a project of typical complexity is 10% -15% for renovations and 8%-12% for new construction. Fixed Fees is most commonly used in projects where the scope can be clearly defined.
