Average Cost and What Should Be Included. Granite tiles typically cost around $4 to $19 per square foot or $120 to $570 for 30 square feet of counter space. DIY kits that contain the tiles and backsplashes necessary are available for around $100-200 for each section (eg. 24 inch wide corner piece). Modular (or prefabricated) granite costs anywhere from $25 to $100 per sq. ft. (for materials only). Based on this, the average-sized kitchen counter is around $750 to $3,000 if you install it yourself. The sections should come already polished, sealed and sporting a standard shaped outer edge.
Land values do track one key figure: The price developers are charging for new condos. From 2013 to 2014, the price of new-construction units in Manhattan leapt 29 percent to an average of $1,851 per square foot, according to Miller Samuel. But even that rise could not match the 30 percent land-price jump. If a unit sells for $2,500 a square foot, Von Ancken said the developer needs to subtract $900 for hard and soft costs, like construction and advertising campaigns, and about $375 for the cost of common spaces, like lobbies and hallways. Once that’s done, he said, a developer is left with about $1,200 for the land.
