The geometric mean between 2 and 4 is x. The proportion 2:x=x:4 must be true hence. If we in the following triangle draw the altitude from the vertex of the right angle then the two triangles that are formed are similar to the triangle we had from the beginning. The two triangles formed are also similar to each other. Hence BD is the geometric mean of AD and DC. Also in our figure the measure of a leg of the triangle is the geometric mean between the measures of the hypotenuse and the segment of the hypotenuse adjacent to that leg.

As another example, the geometric mean of the three numbers 4, 1, and 1/32 is the cube root of their product (1/8), which is 1/2; that is. For example, the geometric mean of 2 and 8 can be calculated as: where is any base of a logarithm (commonly 2, or 10). The right-hand side formula above is generally the preferred alternative for implementation in computer languages.
The geometric mean is NOT the arithmetic mean and it is NOT a simple average. It is the nth root of the product of n numbers. That means you multiply a bunch of numbers together, and then take the nth root, where n is the number of values you just multiplied. Then take the third root (cube root) because there are 3 numbers. Naturally, the geometric mean can get very complicated. Here's a mathematical definition of the geometric mean: Remember that the capital PI symbol means to multiply a series of numbers. That definition says to multiply k numbers and then take the kth root
Geometric mean is used to find the $n^{th}$ root of the product of a set of data and relevant any time several quantities multiply together to produce a product. Geometric Mean is the square root of the product of the two numbers. When $a, b, c$ are in Geometric progression, $b$ is the geometric mean of $a$ and $c$.
The geometric mean of a data set is less than or equal to the data set's arithmetic mean (the two means are equal if and only if all members of the data set are equal). Geometric Mean is one of the measures of central tendency. The geometric mean of $n$ items is defined as the $n^{th}$ root of the product of the $n$ items. A measure of central tendency is a single value in the range of the data that is used to represent all the values in the series. Geometric Mean is the square root of the product of the two numbers. When $a, b, c$ are in Geometric progression, $b$ is the geometric mean of $a$ and $c$.
Geometric Mean Definition: Geometric mean is a kind of average of a set of numbers that is different from the arithmetic average. The geometric mean is well defined only for sets of positive real numbers. This is calculated by multiplying all the numbers (call the number of numbers n), and taking the nth root of the total. A common example of where the geometric mean is the correct choice is when averaging growth rates. Geometric Mean = ((X1)(X2)(X3)........(XN))1/N.
The geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers, i.e., for a set of numbers, the geometric mean is defined as. For instance, the geometric mean of two numbers, say 2 and 8, is just the square root of their product; that is. For example, the geometric mean of 2 and 8 can be calculated as: where is any base of a logarithm (commonly 2, or 10). The right-hand side formula above is generally the preferred alternative for implementation in computer languages.
