Lamictal Withdrawal Symptoms: List Of Possibilities. Lamictal (Lamotrigine) is a drug that is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It works as a sodium channel blocker by inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels. It is also thought to inhibit the release of glutamate at various areas throughout the limbic system. 
You shouldn't have to taper off of 25mg of Seroquel... it's a VERY low dosage, but if you are using it for sleep and have trouble sleeping when you stop taking it, try c … utting it in half and fourths until you don't need it anymore. 
I believe I can be of help with this issue. Lamictal is one of the harder medications to taper off from without having withdrawal symptoms.
