From planting to harvest depends on the type and whether they were started from sets (50 to 60 days), seeds (110-125 days), or transplants (70 to 90 days). Harvest when one-forth to one-half of the tops of the onions have fallen down.
Onions planted from seed are used as green onions within 40 to 50 days of planting. They are fully grown in 90 to 130 days, depending on the variety. Onions planted as soon as the soil can be worked in early spring are ready for the table by July.
Onion Seeds Germinating When it comes to onion seeds germinating, temperature plays an active role. While typically germination occurs within 7-10 days, soil temperature affects this process. For instance, the cooler the soil temperature, the longer it will take for onion seeds to germinate â€“ up to two weeks. Warm soil temperatures, on the other hand, can trigger onion seed germination in as little as four days.
For a shorter period between planting and harvest, you may choose to start the onion seeds indoors eight to 12 weeks before the last frost date for your area and transplant seedlings outdoors when they grow to 1/4 inch in diameter, about two to four weeks before the last frost date for your area.
Onions, planted from seed in full sun and well-draining soil, germinate within 21 days of planting. Harvest time depends on which type of onion is preferred.
Onion Seeds. Starting onion plants from seed takes the longest for onions to fully grow, but seeds give you the most choices in variety. It can take up to five months for plants to mature enough to harvest. When starting onion plants from seed, allow the soil temperature to warm to at least 50 degrees Fahrenheit before sowing. In areas with mild winters, you can plant varieties of short-day onions four weeks before the first frost in fall.
