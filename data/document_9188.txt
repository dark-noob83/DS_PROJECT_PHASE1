The proteins derived from fish, crustaceans and molluscs account for between 13.8% and 16.5% of the animal protein intake of the human population. The average apparent per capita consumption increased from about 9 kg per year in the early 1960s to 16 kg in 1997. The per capita availability of fish and fishery products has therefore nearly doubled in 40 years, outpacing population growth. Currently, two-thirds of the total food fish supply is obtained from capture fisheries in marine and inland waters, while the remaining one third is derived from aquaculture. The contribution of inland and marine capture fisheries to per capita food supply has stabilized, around 10 kg per capita in the period 1984-1998.
31 January 2011, Rome-The contribution of fish to global diets has reached a record of about 17 kg per person on average, supplying over three billion people with at least 15 percent of their average animal protein intake. Snapshot of the sector. Total world production of fish and fish products rose from 140 million tonnes in 2007 to 145 million tonnes in 2009, according to the FAO report. Much of the fish now comes from aquaculture, which is growing at the rate of almost seven percent a year.
The global consumption of fish has hit a record high, reaching an average of 17kg per person, a UN report has shown. Fisheries and aquaculture supplied the world with about 145m tonnes in 2009, providing about 16% of the population's animal protein intake. 
Fish consumption 21. Fish 22 consumption has undergone major changes in the past four decades. World apparent per capita fish consumption has been increasing steadily, from an average of 9.9 kg in the 1960s to 11.5 kg in the 1970s, 12.5 kg in the 1980s, 14.4 kg in the 1990s and reaching 16.4 kg in 2005. If China is excluded, per capita fish supply is about 14.0 kg, slightly higher than the average values of the mid-1990s, and lower than the maximum levels registered in the 1980s (14.6 kg). Preliminary estimates for 2006 indicate a slight increase in global per capita fish supply to about 16.7 kg.

Preliminary estimates for 2006 indicate a slight increase in global per capita fish supply to about 16.7 kg.
The average contribution of aquaculture to per capita fish available for human consumption rose from 14 percent in 1986, to 30 percent in 1996 and to 47 percent in 2006, and it can be expected to reach 50 percent in the next few years. If China is excluded, per capita fish supply is about 14.0 kg, slightly higher than the average values of the mid-1990s, and lower than the maximum levels registered in the 1980s (14.6 kg). Preliminary estimates for 2006 indicate a slight increase in global per capita fish supply to about 16.7 kg.
Per capita fish consumption in China has also increased dramatically, reaching about 31.9 kg in 2009, with an average annual growth rate of 4.3 percent in the period 1961–2009 and of 6.0 percent in the period 1990–2009. Annual per capita apparent fish consumption can vary from less than 1 kg in one country to more than 100 kg in another (Figure 34). Differences may also be significant within countries, with consumption usually higher in coastal, riverine and inland water areas.
As a valuable source of nutrients, globally fish provides about three billion people with almost 20 percent of their average per capita intake of animal protein, and 4.3 billion people with about 15 percent of such protein, according to the FAO's The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012 report. Annual per capita apparent fish consumption can vary from less than 1 kg in one country to more than 100 kg in another (Figure 34). Differences may also be significant within countries, with consumption usually higher in coastal, riverine and inland water areas.
China has been responsible for most of the increase in world per capita fish consumption, owing to the substantial increase in its fish production, in particular from aquaculture. China’s share in world fish production grew from 7 percent in 1961 to 34 percent in 2009. Annual per capita apparent fish consumption can vary from less than 1 kg in one country to more than 100 kg in another (Figure 34). Differences may also be significant within countries, with consumption usually higher in coastal, riverine and inland water areas.
