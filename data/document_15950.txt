The female reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, vulva, mammary glands and breasts. These organs are involved in the production and transportation of gametes and the production of sex hormones.
The female reproductive organs can be subdivided into the internal and external genitalia (see the images below). The internal genitalia are those organs that are within the true pelvis. These include the vagina, uterus, cervix, uterine tubes (oviducts or fallopian tubes), and ovaries.
Ovaries. Two female reproductive organs located in the pelvis. Fallopian tubes. Carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Cervix. The lower, narrow part of the uterus (womb) located between the bladder and the rectum. It forms a canal that opens into the vagina, which leads to the outside of the body. Vagina.
