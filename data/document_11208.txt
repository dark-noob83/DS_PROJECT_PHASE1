This article shares some of the costs models in project management, typical expense rates and a model for estimating the return on investment for project management. For example, on a recent project – we delivered the project on their behalf. We came in on time and 40% under budget. That is 40% cheaper than their internal costs.
4 The State of the PMO 2010 © 2010 Project Management Solutions, Inc. PMOs track portfolio performance (72%) and 36% even participate in portfolio strategy formulation. The PMO is looked to as a resource for understanding how the company is doing: 67% manage a port-folio dashboard or scoreboard. As PMOs grow in maturity from Levels 1-2 to 3-5 (see page 10), more of them perform portfolio governance and oversight (73% compared to 48%) and portfolio performance monitoring (84% com-pared to 66%). These mature PMOs are rewarded with bigger bud-gets (twice the budget of the average Level 1-2 PMO).
The cost to construct a single lane mile of the selected project ranged from $1.0 million to $8.5 million with an average cost of $2.3 million. The cost to construct this same lane mile in Washington State is $1.4 million. The cost to construct a single lane mile for this project in Washington State is $886,000 below the average cost nationwide.
3. Survey Results Project Cost For the purpose of the survey, the team used several standard unit bid items from the SE 192 nd Avenue project that they felt would give an apples-to-apples comparison. The calculated costs of the items ranged from $4.0 million to $26.7 million, with an average of $9.0 million nationwide. The cost in Washington was $6.1 million, $2.9 million below the nationwide average. The cost to construct this same lane mile in Washington State is $1.4 million. The cost to construct a single lane mile for this project in Washington State is $886,000 below the average cost
The State of the PMO 2012 5. 2012 Project Management Solutions, Inc. slightly: for example, overall the percentage participating in strategic planning has slipped from 62% to 48%. At the same time, PMO leaders list “defining the role of the PMO” and “demonstrating the value of the PMO” as two of their top challenges. Training in project management basics is still the focus of 84% of companies. PMO size has not, on average, increased, perhaps due to hiring constraints; however, PMOs report an increased reliance on contracted resources, both for managing projects and programs and for managing PMO operational functions.
The second reason is that for most company’s, where project management is not their core business, they lack a level of understanding of the real costs of managing a project and the typical cash flow burn rate of a project. For example, on a recent project – we delivered the project on their behalf. We came in on time and 40% under budget. That is 40% cheaper than their internal costs.
Page 4 of 28 Table 1 shows the project size (measured in squre feet) and total project cost (measured in dollars) for the project data used in all of the research. The table shows a wide range of project sizes (from 1,035 s.f. to 1,500,000 s.f.) and total project costs (from $80,000 to $350,000,000). The table also subdivides the data into projects managed by In-house and Outside Managers and projects without a manager.

To be honest, I went into this process expecting that PMO-related expenses would account for around five percent of project spend. What we found was different. The ratio of PMO expense compared to project management spend ranged in our benchmark from 0.8 percent to 3.7 percent. Where the numbers were available, we found that total project management spend ran from 4.4 percent to 10.4 percent. Knowing this specific metric can be helpful in several ways. Some of the PMO costs can be attributable to any project, no matter how simple or complex it is. But beyond those, dissecting PMO expense can give you a much clearer understanding of the drivers that will impact overall project spend. (Shortly, I'll share an example of this.)
