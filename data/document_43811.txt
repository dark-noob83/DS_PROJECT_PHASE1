1 The three parts of the iliopsoas attach the lower part of the spine and pelvis, then cross the joint and insert into the lesser trochanter of the femur. 2  Hamstrings: The three muscles at the back of the thigh are called the hamstrings. 3  All three attach to the lowest part of the pelvis.
lesser trochanter, one of a pair of conic projections on the shaft of the femur, just below the neck. It is the site of insertion of the psoas major muscle. Also called trochanter minor. Compare greater trochanter.
The various muscles which attach to or cover the hip joint generate the hipâ€™s movement. 1  Gluteals: The gluteals are the muscles in your buttocks. 2  The gluteals (gluteus maximus, gluteus minimus and gluteus medius) are the three muscles attached to back of the pelvis and insert into the greater trochanter of the femur.
It is a ball and socket joint at the juncture of the leg and pelvis. The rounded head of the femur (thighbone) forms the ball, which fits into the acetabulum (a cup-shaped socket in the pelvis). Ligaments connect the ball to the socket and usually provide tremendous stability to the joint.
If I just get rid of these two muscles now, we can take a look at the iliacus, which sits just a little bit inferior to it. The iliacus muscle sits in the iliac fossa. It joins the psoas muscle to insert into the lesser trochanter. You can see its insertion on the lesser trochanter here. You can see how it runs through and combines with this psoas major muscle. Collectively, the iliacus and the psoas major are referred to as the iliopsoas.
This serves the same function as the psoas major muscle. It flexes the thigh at the hip joint. It's innervated by the femoral nerve. You can see how both the distal ends of the iliacus and psoas major pass underneath this ligament, the inguinal ligament to insert onto the lesser trochanter of the femur. If we just rotate around to the back, we can see the quadratus lumborum muscle, which is this muscle here.
