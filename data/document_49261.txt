TULSA, OK -- You may be paying a lot more to renew your car tags if they're late. The state is increasing the late fee for tags by 300%. That means you could pay $100 rather than $25. The new fees go into effect next Wednesday, July 1st, so if your tag is overdue, you definitely want to go renew it before then. The old 25 cent a day fee for late tags will soon be $1 a day. The old maximum fine was $25, now it's going to $100. If your car tag is due in June, you get a 30 day grace period, and then the late fee of $1 a day starts racking up. The bottom line is, if you renew it on time, you won't have any late fees.
You must renew your vehicle registration within 1 month after it expires or you will be charged late fees. The Oklahoma DMV will charge you $1 per day until you reach a maximum late fee of $100.
