A basic charger usually charges at around 2 amps-and so needs 24 hours to deliver the 48 amps needed to fully charge a flat, 48 amp hour battery. But there is a wide range of chargers with different charge rates on the market-from 2 to 10 amps. The higher the charge output, the faster a flat battery is recharged.
12 volts is the normal car battery voltage in today’s vehicle and each of the battery has 6 cells with a voltage of 2.1. A fully charged car battery has 12.6 volts. There is a very big difference when a car battery voltage drops even a small amount of voltage. When a car drops, for instance, from 12.6 to 12.0, there will be 75% difference. Its power drops from 100% to 25%. At 12.4 volts, a car battery is 75% charged while at 12.2 volts its 50% charged.
1 This is the number of minutes a fully charged battery at 80°F will discharge 25 amps until the battery drops below 10.5 volts. 2  An Amp Hour (AH) is a rating usually found on deep cycle batteries. 3  If a battery is rated at 100 amp hours it should deliver 5 amps for 20 hours, 20 amps for 5 hours, etc.
The voltage is allowed to roam within a confined window while the charge current is set and will only moderate during saturation charge. The charge time of a sealed lead acid battery is 12–16 hours, up to 36–48 hours for large stationary batteries.
How to charge a battery. An average car battery has a capacity of around 48 amp hours which means that, fully charged, it delivers 1 amp for 48 hours, 2 amps for 24 hours, 8 amps for 6 hours and so on.
It uses mains current to replace the battery's lost. through positive and negative leads that clip to the corresponding battery posts. An average car battery has a capacity of around 48 amp hours which means that, fully charged, it delivers 1 amp for 48 hours, 2 amps for 24 hours, 8 amps for 6 hours and so on.
Do not charge any battery at more than 6 amps per hour. If you have a battery with removable battery caps, you can use a hydrometer to test the battery acid. The hydrometer should read a minimum of 1.260 before putting the battery back into service.
A fully charged “12 volt” battery will be at about 12.6V The charger may well take it up to 14.4 or so while charging. About 12.2 volts is 50% and 11.8 is approaching dead. (these voltages at no load, the battery at rest). Anything under 11.0 may indicate a dead cell.
Check the voltage of the battery to verifythat it is in a 100% fully-charged condition. If the open circuit(disconnected) voltage reading is below 12.7 V, charge thebattery and then chec k the voltage again after the batter y hasset for one to two hours.
