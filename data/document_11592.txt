The Bence-Jones protein urine test is used mainly to diagnose and monitor multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. An abnormal Bence-Jones test result is also linked with malignant lymphomas, which are cancers of the lymphatic system. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells.
Why the Test is Performed. Bence-Jones proteins are a part of regular antibodies called light chains. These proteins are not normally in urine. Sometimes, when your body makes too many antibodies, the level of light chains also rises. Bence-Jones proteins are small enough to be filtered out by the kidneys. Then they spill over into the urine.
The Bence Jones protein (BJP) test measures the level of BJP in your urine. These proteins are not present in healthy urine samples. Usually they are a sign of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a type of bone marrow cancer. BJP are named for Henry Bence-Jones. He first isolated them in 1847.
In addition to the test to check for Bence-Jones proteins in your urine, a health care provider may order blood tests and also tests on bone and bone marrow. Possible blood tests include: Complete blood count, or CBC.
