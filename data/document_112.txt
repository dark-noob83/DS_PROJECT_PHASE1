I said you can get a pretty good idea how much your closing costs will be by multiplying the loan amount by 3 percent (or 4 - 6 percent in high-cost areas). Let's see how it holds up here. If I multiply $300,000 by .03, I would get $9,000. If I multiply by .04 (4 percent), I would get $12,000. On a $250,000 mortgage loan, this would come out to around $7,500 (250,000 x .03 = 7,500). If you live in a high-cost area like New York or California, you might have to multiply by 5 - 6 percent to get a ballpark figure. Your lender should tell you how much your closing costs are when you apply for the loan.
Tip: Get the lender to pay the closing costs. If you're short on cash for the closing costs and can't roll the closing costs into the mortgage, some lenders will pay part or all of the closing costs, but in exchange you'll have to pay a higher interest rate on the loan, perhaps 0.25% or 0.50% higher.
Method 1 of 4: Negotiate with the Seller. Typical closing costs are around 2-5% of the purchase price of the home. So on a $100,000 home, the closing costs will be between $2,000 - $5,000. Add this amount to a typical down payment of 20%, or $20,000, and it is easy to see why a home buyer would want to limit closing costs as much as possible. 1  1 Edit step. Points on a loan are one of the largest closing costs. Loan points are paid to the lender and are equal to 1% of the total loan amount. Points are also known as the loan origination fee. On a $100,000 mortgage 1 Point equals $1,000.
If you don't have enough cash to pay the closing costs, you can often get the closing costs added to the amount of the loan. For example, if the loan amount is for $150,000, and the closing costs are $4500, you'd add the closing costs to the loan amount so you'd actually be borrowing $154,500 total. This is handy if you're short on cash after making your down payment. If you're short on cash for the closing costs and can't roll the closing costs into the mortgage, some lenders will pay part or all of the closing costs, but in exchange you'll have to pay a higher interest rate on the loan, perhaps 0.25% or 0.50% higher.
Typically, home buyers will pay between about 2 and 5 percent of the purchase price of their home in closing costs. So, if your home cost $150,000, you might pay between $3,000 and $7,500 in closing costs. On average, buyers pay roughly $3,700 in closing costs, according to a recent survey. Lenders are required by law to give you a good faith estimate (GFE) of what the closing costs on your home will be within three days of when you apply for a loan. Closing costs vary widely based on where you live and the property you buy. Closing costs often include things such as: 1  A fee for running your credit report. 2  A loan origination fee, which lenders charge for processing the loan paperwork for you. 3  Attorney’s fees.
In my experience, it's more accurate to multiply your loan amount by 3 percent. This will give you a rough idea how much your total closing costs will be. On a $250,000 mortgage loan, this would come out to around $7,500 (250,000 x .03 = 7,500). If you live in a high-cost area like New York or California, you might have to multiply by 5 - 6 percent to get a ballpark figure. Your lender should tell you how much your closing costs are when you apply for the loan. More specifically, they'll give you a written estimate of these costs. But your actual fees could be 5 - 10 percent more than the estimated figure. So you should plan for surprises
Closing costs. Bankrate.com researchers gathered closing-cost data from 8 to 10 lenders in all states and the District of Columbia. Click a state for a fee-by-fee breakdown of the average closing costs for a mortgage. The states with the highest closing costs in 2015 were Hawaii, New Jersey and Connecticut.
The average closing costs percentage is usually about 2-5% of the purchase price (e.g., ~$4500 on a $180,000 home), but 1-8% is not uncommon. And to be clear, nobody chooses a specific percentage number—the closing costs will just happen to add up to some percentage. If you're short on cash for the closing costs and can't roll the closing costs into the mortgage, some lenders will pay part or all of the closing costs, but in exchange you'll have to pay a higher interest rate on the loan, perhaps 0.25% or 0.50% higher.
