The first step of the femoral nerve block is to provide some sedation to the patient. This is usually the last part of the procedure you will remember. Once you are adequately sedated, the anesthesiologist will clean off your groin on the side of the planned surgery.
The femoral nerve block is an ideal block for surgeries of the hip, knee, or anterior thigh and is often combined with a sciatic nerve block for near complete lower-extremity analgesia.
A femoral nerve block is a type of regional anesthesia in which the femoral nerve, located in the groin area, is deadened to allow surgery in the leg or knee area.
A femoral nerve block may be used for a surgery on the leg or knee. The femoral nerve can be located by finding the femoral artery. A medical professiona can examine a patient for femoral nerve damage. The femoral artery supplies the femoral pulse.
A femoral nerve block is a quintessential nerve block technique that is easy to master, carries a low risk of complications, and has significant clinical application for surgical anesthesia and postoperative pain management.
Femoral Nerve Block, 3-in-1 Block Variation. The femoral nerve block provides anesthesia for the entire anterior thigh, the knee, and the femur. In addition, skin anesthesia is conferred over the medial aspect of the distal lower extremity via the terminal branches of the femoral nerve.
The purpose of this block is for diagnosis and treatment of femoral nerve/lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment or irritation. The injection consists of a mixture of a local anesthetic and steroid. The procedure involves inserting a needle through skin and deeper tissues. There is some discomfort involved.
