The Korean War: Containment in Asia. In Asia, as in Europe, Truman tried to contain the spread of communism. The U.S. denied the USSR any hand in the postwar reconstruction of Japan and occupied Japan until 1952, at which point the U.S. officially exited but left troops behind on American military bases.
Containment is a military strategy to stop the expansion of an enemy. It is best known as the Cold War policy of the United States and its allies to prevent the spread of communism abroad. In February 1946, the U.S. State Department asked George F. Kennan, then at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, why the Russians opposed the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
America was the captialist superpower and the USSR (Russia) was the communist superpower. The USSR also included most of what we now call east Europe (e.g. East Germany, Polan … d, Lithuania, Georgia, etc.) America 'won' the cold war when Russia gave up communism in 1991 due to economic failures. ___________________________________________________________________. Well, we fought two hot wars under containment: Korea and Vietnam. Containment obviously didn't work in SE Asai where South Vietnam vanished, Cambodia and Laos both went communist.
Containment, associated with the American diplomat George F. Kennan, was the central post-war concept of the US and its allies in dealing with the Soviet Union. Containment kept the cold war from being a hot war. What Kennan did, in his famous “Long Telegram” from Moscow in February 1946 and through a briefly anonymous article in Foreign Affairs in 1947 was to lay out a third path between the extremes of war and appeasement—containment. Stalin, he said, is not Hitler. He does not have a fixed timetable for aggression.
The US policy of containment, inextricably linked with the domino theory (one country goes communist, they all go communist) led them into one of the worst wars in their history, Vietnam. Containment lead to American administrations accepting a status quo with the Soviet Union and admitting to each having their own sphere of influence in the world. Containment lead to pointless bloody police action wars and spread false hopes over the Eastern Bloc via Radio Free Europe. Case in point: Hungary 1956
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The China containment policy is a political term referring to a claimed goal of U.S. foreign policy to diminish the economic and political growth of the People’s Republic of China. The term harkens back to the U.S. containment policy against communist countries during the Cold War. The theory asserts that the United States needs a weak, divided China to continue its hegemony in Asia. 
Yep. Containment worked. ___________________________________________________________________. Well, we fought two hot wars under containment: Korea and Vietnam. Containment obviously didn't work in SE Asai where South Vietnam vanished, Cambodia and Laos both went communist. It's hard to give a clear answer on whether it worked or not. The USSR didn't collapse due to containment. Communist just does not work as an economic model and so it collaps
