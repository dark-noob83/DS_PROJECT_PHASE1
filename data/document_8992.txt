One of the examples of sustainable forest management that a forest manager might employ to avoid the complete removal of a forest is to use selective logging. Selective logging is the practice of removing certain trees while preserving the balance of the woodland. Another benefit of sustainable forestry is economic stability. Sustainable forests help the economy of an area by providing jobs. The timber industry may provide employment in rural areas, and manufacturing businesses based on lumber and wood products provide additional economic stability for surrounding areas.
Sustainable management is a resource management technique that seeks to make any harvesting or consumption of natural resources as sustainable as possible. Thus, the main goal is to replenish any resources as fast as they are depleted. In order to accomplish its goal, sustainable management often looks at two different factors: the rate of consumption and the rate of replenishment. In many cases, the goal is to keep these two factors in equilibrium.

Sustainable forest management (SFM) is the management of forests according to the principles of sustainable development.

Sustainable management. Sustainable management takes the concepts from sustainability and synthesizes them with the concepts of management. Sustainability has three branches: the environment, the needs of present and future generations, and the economy. From this definition, sustainable management has been created to be defined as the application of sustainable practices in the categories of businesses, agriculture, society, environment, and personal life by managing them in a way that will benefit current generations and future generations.
Sustainable management is needed because it is an important part of the ability to successfully maintain the quality of life on our planet. Sustainable management can be applied to all aspects of our lives. For example, the practices of a business should be sustainable if they wish to stay in businesses, because if the business is unsustainable, then by the definition of sustainability they will cease to be able to be in competition. Communities are in a need of sustainable management, because if the community is to prosper, then the management must be sustainable. Forest and natural resources need to have sustainable management if they are to be able to be continually used by our generation and future generations
Sustainable forest management ensures that forest resources are preserved to meet the needs of future generations. Learn about sustainable forest management and see examples of how it is put into practice. Another benefit of sustainable forestry is economic stability. Sustainable forests help the economy of an area by providing jobs. The timber industry may provide employment in rural areas, and manufacturing businesses based on lumber and wood products provide additional economic stability for surrounding areas.
