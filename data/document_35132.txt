Much of this deep ocean water is between 0-3 degrees Celsius (32-37.5 degrees Fahrenheit)! It's really, really cold down there! There is a neat program that is measuring the temperature and salinity of ocean surface waters around the world. The polar seas (high latitude) can be as cold as -2 degrees Celsius (28.4 degrees Fahrenheit) while the Persian Gulf (low latitude) can be as warm as 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Ocean water, with an average salinity of 35 psu, freezes at -1.94 degrees Celsius (28.5 degrees Fahrenheit). That means at high latitudes sea ice can form. The average temperature of the ocean surface waters is about 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 90 % of the total volume of ocean is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean. The deep ocean is not well mixed. The deep ocean is made up of horizontal layers of equal density
I am confused by this number. -21°C = (-21)*(9/5)+32 = -5.8 °F but I thought the Fahrenheit scale was defined such that the lowest temperature achievable by a water/ice/salt mixture was 0 degrees F (-17.8 degrees C). Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit's temperature scale doesn't place 0°F at the lowest freezing point of salt water (which occurs at -21.12°C, or -6.02°F). There are at least three reasons for that. It always takes longer than you think it's going to take, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
While sea surface temperature is important for tropical cyclogenesis, it is also important in determining the formation of sea fog and sea breezes. Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as 35 kilometres (22 mi) to 40 kilometres (25 mi). On calm days, the temperature can vary by 6 °C (10 °F). The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
The highest temperature recorded in Michigan is 112°, Fahrenheit. This record high was recorded on July 13, 1936 at Mio. The lowest temperature in Michigan, -51°, was reco … rded on February 9, 1934 at Vanderbilt. Ocean water, with an average salinityvof 35 PSU, freezes at -1.94 degrees Celsius (28.5 degrees Fahrenheit). That means at high latitudes sea ice can form. The average temperature of the ocean surface waters is about 17 degrees Celsius (62.6
See Lowest temperature recorded on Earth for details. † It is reported by local news outlet that temperatures in Mt. Pulag in the Philippines which is 2,922 meters above sea level plunges as low as 2 °C (35.6 °F). The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009.) These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.
La Jolla Cove sea temperatures peak in the range 19 to 22°C (66 to 72°F) on around the 6th of September and are at their lowest on about the 5th of February, in the range 13 to 16°C (55 to 61°F). La Jolla Cove sea temperatures are highest in the first week of September. Surfers should use a 2mm long sleeve shorty or a 3/2mm spring wetsuit if the wind is up. The lowest sea temperatures at La Jolla Cove at the beginning of February are ideally suited to a 4/3mm wetsuit + 3mm boots, although a 5/3mm wetsuit may be preferable for longer sessions and cold windy days.
Sea surface temperature (SST) is the water temperature close to the ocean 's surface. The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between 1 millimetre (0.04 in) and 20 metres (70 ft) below the sea surface. Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore. On calm days, the temperature can vary by 6 °C (10 °F). The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
