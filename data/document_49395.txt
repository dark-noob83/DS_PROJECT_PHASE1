Cardiac enzyme studies are done to: 1  Determine whether you are having a heart attack or a threatened heart attack (unstable angina) if you have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and abnormal electrocardiography results.
Cardiac enzyme studies are done to: 1  Determine whether you are having a heart attack or acute coronary syndrome if you have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and abnormal electrocardiography results. 2  Check for injury to the heart from other causes, such as an infection.
Low levels of these enzymes and proteins are normally found in your blood, but if your heart muscle is injured, such as from a heart attack, the enzymes and proteins leak out of damaged heart muscle cells, and their levels in the bloodstream rise.
In such cases, repeated cardiac enzyme tests are normally conducted to confirm the diagnosis of a heart attack. Additionally, because some heart enzymes are also found in other body tissues, such as the brain or skeletal muscle, their blood levels may rise when these other tissues are damaged.
Cardiac Enzymes-definition. Cardiac Enzymes-proteins the HEART releases into the bloodstream when HEART ATTACK or other circumstances cause damage to the heart MUSCLE (MYOCARDIUM). BLOOD tests that measure the levels of these enzymes help doctors determine whether, and how long ago, a heart attack has taken place.
Cardiac enzymes are proteins in the body that are sometimes called heart damage markers because they are released into the bloodstream when heart muscle cells are damaged. There has been an increased emphasis on developing blood tests that detect injury in the heart muscle as early as possible.
Cardiac Enzyme Studies. Guide. Cardiac enzyme studies measure the levels of enzymes and proteins that are linked with injury of the heart muscle. These include the enzyme creatine kinase (CK), and the proteins troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (TnT).
