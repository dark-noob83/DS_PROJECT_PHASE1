A light-year (abbreviation: ly), sometimes written light year, is a unit of length used informally to express astronomical distances. It is approximately 9 trillion kilometres (or about 6 trillion miles). Definitions [edit]. As defined by the IAU, the light-year is the product of the Julian year (365.25 days as opposed to the 365.2425-day Gregorian year) and the speed of light (7008299792458000000♠299792458 m/s). Both these values are included in the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants, used since 1984.
A light year is a unit of distance. It is the distance that light can travel in a year’s time which is six trillion miles. Light moves at a velocity of roughly 300,000 kilometers in every second. So in one year, it can travel roughly about 10 trillion km. One light-year is equivalent to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. Well, it is quite convenient to measure the distances in space using light year. To take just one example, the distance to the next nearest big galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy, from earth is 21,000,000,000,000,000,000 km.
A light-year is a unit of distance. It is the distance that light can travel in one year. Light moves at a velocity of about 300,000 kilometers (km) each second. So in one year, it can travel about 10 trillion km. More p recisely, one light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. 
The light-year is most often used when expressing distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale, especially in non-specialist and popular science publications. Definitions [edit]. As defined by the IAU, the light-year is the product of the Julian year (365.25 days as opposed to the 365.2425-day Gregorian year) and the speed of light (7008299792458000000♠299792458 m/s).

Light year measure DISTANCE -- the distance light travels in one year -- 5,865,696,000,000 miles. A light year is approximately 6 TRILLION miles distance. As an example, the closest star to earth is our Sun. It is on the average 93 MILLION mile away - 93,000,000 miles. 
Hint: A light-year is a unit of distance, not time. A light-year is how astronomers measure distance in space. It’s defined by how far a beam of light travels in one year – a distance of six trillion miles. Think of it as the bigger, badder cousin of the inch, the mile, the kilometer, and the furlong. 
­So to measure really long distances, people use a unit called a light year. Light travels at 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometers per second). Therefore, a light second is 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers). Cool Fact. A light nanosecond -- the distance light can travel in a billionth of a second -- is about 1 foot (about 30 cm). Radar uses this fact to measure how far away something like an airplane is. A radar antenna sends out a short radio pulse and then waits for it to echo off an airplane or other target.
A light-year, also light year or lightyear (symbol: ly) is a unit of length, equal to just under 10 trillion kilometers (10×10 15 meters, 10 petameters or about 6 trillion miles). As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in a vacuum in one Julian year. The light-year is often used to measure distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale, especially in non-specialist and popular science publications. The preferred unit in astrometry is the parsec, because it can be more easily derived from, and compared with, observational data. 
A light year is a way of measuring distance. That doesn't make much sense because light year contains the word year, which is normally a unit of time. Even so, light years measure distance. You are used to measuring distances in either inches/feet/miles or centimeters/meters/kilometers, depending on where you live. Cool Fact. A light nanosecond -- the distance light can travel in a billionth of a second -- is about 1 foot (about 30 cm). Radar uses this fact to measure how far away something like an airplane is. A radar antenna sends out a short radio pulse and then waits for it to echo off an airplane or other target.
