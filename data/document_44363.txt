Surge Protector Joule Ratings. I was wondering-you can buy at the store lots of types of surge protectors, and the major difference (aside from # of connections, etc) is the Joule-rating that they have. Now I know what joules and all that are, but I have no scale to compare it to computer protection.
1 Energy absorption/dissipation-This rating, given in joules, tells you how much energy the surge protector can absorb before it fails. 2  A higher number indicates greater protection. 3  Look for a protector that is at least rated at 200 to 400 joules. 4  For better protection, look for a rating of 600 joules or more.
The power rating of a resistor defines the maximum energy a resistor can (safely) dissipate. As is stated by Jouleâ€™s first law, the generated electrical power is related to the voltage and current:
1 Look for a protector that is at least rated at 200 to 400 joules. 2  For better protection, look for a rating of 600 joules or more. 3  Response time-Surge protectors don't kick in immediately; there is a very slight delay as they respond to the power surge.

There are 2 Joule ratings for the amount of energy they can withstand. According to APC's website and the box it came in, it has a surge energy rating of 2030 Joules. It also states that it has an eP Joule rating of 3400 Joules.
