Curley's wife came into the barn to talk to Lennie and Lennie made a comment about his future rabbits. Lennie explained that he likes to touch soft things like the small animals. Curley's wife said she could relate because she likes to touch her soft hair sometimes. She then told Lennie to feel her hair.
Posted on. (Answer #1). Lennie kills Curley's wife by shaking her so hard that her neck breaks -- remember, he is a big strong man. He does not kill her on purpose. He is only shaking her like that because he wants her to stop yelling. She is yelling because he is holding on to her hair and won't let go.
Curley's wife is terribly lonely. She seeks companionship with the only person who will talk to her. She finds Lennie with his dead puppy in the barn. Lennie has smothered his puppy to death. Curley's wife allows Lennie to stroke her hair because she knows that Lennie likes to pet soft things. She basically entices Lennie with her coy invitations to touch her. Curley's wife is desperate for attention: even the attention of a mentally challenged man like Lennie.
