When most people think about wasps, they think about being stung. Indeed, wasps do sting, and wasp stings hurt! Just ask entomologist Justin Schmidt, who devised a scale to compare the pain inflicted by various stinging insects. To make matters worse, some wasps can be downright nuisances.
Of course we don't need wasps in any crudely material sense. They do eat other insects that are more directly pestilential, like flies and aphids; but the crop would not fail nor the roses wither for want of them. But we do need wasps, I suggest, as a test case. The conservation of other creatures matters.
So, it is not in the mouth of the wasp or bee. When a person is stung, they are poked by the stinger, not bit. Since the stinger is actually designed to lay or deposit eggs, only female bees and wasps can sting. Male bees and wasps cannot sting because they have no stinger and cannot lay eggs.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Wasps are actually beneficial insects for humans and the environment. They are one of the major natural scavengers, and they eat insects such as flies and caterpillars that are often considered pests to humans. They should be left alone if they are in a location where they are not bothering people. Some wasps pollinate plants and crops, but most do not.
