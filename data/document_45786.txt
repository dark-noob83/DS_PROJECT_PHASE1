MLS Salaries. Beginning and lower-echelon players in Major League Soccer make a minimum of $35,125 a year, by far the lowest minimum salary of major professional team sports in America. As of the end of the 2013 season, 154 players made less than $50,000 a year.
Average Salaries. The average salary of an NFL player works out to considerably less when not considering the top earners, but these players still make hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Bloomberg Businessweek says the average salary of an NFL player in 2011 was $1.9 million. The median salary was $770,000.
Professional soccer players, or footballers as they are known outside of the United States, can earn millions of dollars a year, although the majority will not make this much. Some national league bodies, such as the MLS, set salary regulations that dictate how much clubs can pay players.
The average annual salary for soccer players in the MLS for the 2013 season is $148,693.26. This average varies by player position. Goalkeepers earn an average of $85,296.48; defenders $109,119.61; midfielders $129,573.88; and forwards $251,805.21. League regulations, such as the designated player rule, affect overall averages. Designated players can make more than salary caps, making their salaries much higher than other players in the team. For example, the highest paid player in the MLS, Clint Dempsey, earns $4,913,004 per year, but the lowest salary in the league earns $31,125.
By Position. How much a player makes depends on the position he plays. While players at all positions make the league minimum, median pay is highest for forwards. In 2013, forwards made a median salary of $99,998. Goaltenders and mid-fielders made a median salary of $80,000, while defenders made two more dollars a year.
