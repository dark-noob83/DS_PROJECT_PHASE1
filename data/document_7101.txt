Spiramycin has been used in Europe since the year 2000 under the trade name Rovamycine, produced by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Famar Lyon, France and Eczacibasi Ilae, Turkey. It also goes under the name Rovamycine in Canada (distributed by OdanLaboratories), where it is mostly marketed to dentists for mouth infections.

Write your review. Rodogyl table. 20 tablets. This product is a combination of two antibiotics from the group of imidazole and macrolide. It is intended for the treatment of buccal-dental infections (dental abscesses, phlegmon, infection of the salivary glands).
Rodogyl is not particularly effective against dento-alveolar abscess, which constitutes the majority of acute dental infections. For this application, you would be better off with one of the semi-synthetic penicillins, such as penicillin V or amoxicillin.
Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic. It is used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues. Although used in Europe, Canada and Mexico, spiramycin is still considered an experimental drug in the United States, but can sometimes be obtained by special permission from the FDA for toxoplasmosis in the first trimester of pregnancy.
