Measures of variability indicate the degree to which the scores in a distribution are spread out. Larger numbers indicate greater variability of scores. Sometimes the word dispersion is substituted for variability, and you will find that term used in some statistics texts.
Variability is a measure of the spread of a data set. Learn more about the different measures of variability including the range, variance, and standard deviation, and how they are used in the field of Psychology.
An important use of statistics is to measure variability or the spread ofdata. For example, two measures of variability are the standard deviation andthe range. The standard deviation measures the spread of data from the mean orthe average score.

Measures of Variability. Variability refers to how spread apart the scores of the distribution are or how much the scores vary from each other. There are four major measures of variability, including the range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation.
MEASURES OF VARIABILITY. An important use of statistics is to measure variability or the spread ofdata. For example, two measures of variability are the standard deviation andthe range. The standard deviation measures the spread of data from the mean orthe average score.
A related measure of variability is called the semi-interquartile range. The semi-interquartile range is defined simply as the interquartile range divided by 2. If a distribution is symmetric, the median plus or minus the semi-interquartile range contains half the scores in the distribution.
