Symptoms of damage to the medulla oblongata is that the nerve  signals between the spinal cord and the brain would no longer be  working. The medulla helps to control vital … functions of the brain  such as breathing, blood pressure and regulating heart rate. 1 person found this useful. 
The medulla oblongata is key to understanding how general anesthesia works. Damage to the medulla oblongata can result in the need for a ventilator or other supportive equipment to keep the body working. The medulla oblongata is part of the brainstem, which helps connect the brain to the spinal cord. When life support is withdrawn from a person with catastrophic medulla oblongata damage, the body will cease to function. You won't believe these 10 facts about people. The medulla oblongata is a structure found in the brains of vertebrate animals, including humans. This structure controls a number of autonomic functions, including respiration and blood pressure, making it a very critical part of the brain.
The brain isconnected to the spinal cord by the brain stem. All motor and sensory information passes fromthe brain to the rest of the body. The brain stem is composed of three main sections: themidbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. Injury to the Medulla Oblongata of the Brainstem The Nature of the Medulla Oblongata The brain is the center of the nervous system and helps regulate all the systems and functionsof the body.
The medulla oblongata is responsible for regulating your rate of breathing, your heart rate, blood pressure, circulation and digestive system activity. It controls when these activities start, when they stop and how fast they go. This area is also where your sleep cycles are regulated.

Answers. Best Answer: The medulla contains the cardiac, respiratory, vomiting and vasomotor centers and deals with autonomic functions, such as breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. It is located at the base of the brain stem. If damaged it can change your breathing rate and/or heart rate. Our bodies need to have these functions with in a cretin range in order to function properly. It they are too slow or fast, it could make us sick or even di
Location: Lower part of the brain stemFunction: Carries out and regulates life sustaining functions such as breathing, swallowing and heart rate. The medulla is easily the most important part of the brain. It's functions are involuntary, or done without thought. We would not be able to live without the medulla because of the myriad of crucial tasks it performs including regulating blood pressure and breathing. As a part of the brain stem, it also helps transfer neural messages from the brain to the spinal cord.
