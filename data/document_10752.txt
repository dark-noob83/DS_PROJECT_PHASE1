The cost per claim is the total cost incurred for every claim divided by the total number of claims filed. YTD stands for year to date. This means you are looking at all the claims filed up to today, so the statistic calculates everything for the current year up to the current date.
In the example, the company might pay out a total of $300,000. Divide the amount the company pays out by the number of claims. In the example, $300,000 divided by 340 claims equals a year to date cost per claim of $882.36. This means on average, the company pays $882.36 each time someone files a claim.

Claims that close between two and three years incur average expenses of $36,792, when the medical-only proportion drops to 13%. After three years, when fewer than 10% of cases are medical-only claims, the average cost is $63,087.
We will assume that claims open for ten years will remain open, on average, for an additional twenty-five years. Then the “tail reserve” would be the product of the number of claims open after ten years times twenty-five times the annual cost of handling the claim.
Additional benefits of using per claim severity as a performance measure are: --- First, there is no need to compare per claim severity to payroll or number of employees for incentive contract purposes. --- Second, the industry average cost per claim by state is available from state rating bureaus.
We will assume that the countrywide duration for a workers compensation lost time claim (WCLT) claim is 15 months, the cost per month of handling a claim is $50, and there is no inflation. Then every reported claim will need to have a reserve of $750 (= 15 x $50) set aside.
The average cost of processing a clean electronic claim was 85 cents, nearly half the $1.58 cost of processing a clean paper claim. Pended claims requiring manual or other review cost $2.05 on average per claim to process.
