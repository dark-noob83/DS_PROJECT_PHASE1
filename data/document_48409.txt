Cost aside, your phone might not be capable of working in Thailand. Five of the seven largest cell phone providers in the U.S., including Verizon and Sprint, use CDMA technology. CDMA phones do not use SIM cards. Thailand’s cell network uses GSM technology, and phones there have a removable SIM card. Your CDMA phone will not work in Thailand. If you have a GSM cell phone from the U.S., your phone may be locked. Now that it’s illegal in the U.S. to unlock your cell phone without permission from your service provider, you can’t simply go abroad and unlock your phone without possible issues when returning home.
In other words, Verizon says that I will be able to put a Thai SIM into my Verizon Samsung Note 3 and it will work in Thailand. My Doubt. This is contradictory to what I'd previously thought about CDMA vs. GSM carriers-and I have doubts about spending $700 on a phone that won't work well
There are two different systems for mobile phones in Canada; CDMA and GSM, and they operate in the 800, 850 and 1900 MHz frequency range. That said, if you bring your foreign phone into Canada, it might not work in the Canadian Network. 1  Share on Facebook.
They said that I can get the phone unlocked by Verizon and pop in a True Move SIM card and the phone will work. From my knowledge this isn't true-that Verizon is CDMA and Thailand is GSM so it won't work. Yes, Verizon 4G LTE phones have a SIM card, but I thought that was only for the 4G LTE.
It appears that part of Thailand has CDMA voice service. And note the rate, $1.99 per minute. If you don't mind that, and are going to be in the part of Thailand without CDMA coverage, and if your trip is 21 days or less, you can get an international phone loaned to you by Verizon.
