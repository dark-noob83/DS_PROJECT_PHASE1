Identification: L. morrowii, L. tatarica, and L. maackii), are perennial shrubs; L. japonica is a perennial woody vine (although its leaves can remain green throughout mild winters). The shrub forms range from 6 to 15 feet in height, while vines can reach 30 feet in length.
Invasive Honeysuckles. Invasive honeysuckles are herbaceous shrubs native to Korea, Japan and China. In the late 1800's amur honeysuckles were introduced to North America to the Dominion Arboretum in Ottawa and to the Botanical Garden in New York for their attractive flowers.
Several species of honeysuckle found in NY are characterized as invasive, including: Morrowâ€™s honeysuckle (Lonicera morrowii), Tatarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tatarica), Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), and Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) .
Plant Type: Japanese honeysuckle is a deciduous vine in the North, but semi-evergreen or evergreen further south. We can also classify it as a flowering vine and as an invasive plant (see below under Caveats About Growing Japanese Honeysuckle). These plants are, more specifically, climbers.
Japanese honeysuckle is a woody semi-evergreen vine with opposite, oval leaves. The flowers grow in pairs, are white to yellow, and very fragrant. Fruits, also in pairs, are purple to black berries. This vine climbs and drapes over native vegetation, forming dense patches.
