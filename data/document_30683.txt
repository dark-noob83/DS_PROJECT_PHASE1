The term shipping originally referred to transport by sea, but is extended in American English to refer to transport by land or air (International English: carriage) as well. 1 Carriage and freight (now known in the US as cost and freight)(C&F, CFR, CNF): Insurance is payable by the importer, and the exporter pays all expenses incurred in transporting the cargo from its place of origin to the port/airport and ocean freight/air freight to the port/airport of destination.
Freight transport is the physical process of transporting commodities and merchandise goods and cargo. 1 Carriage and freight (now known in the US as cost and freight)(C&F, CFR, CNF): Insurance is payable by the importer, and the exporter pays all expenses incurred in transporting the cargo from its place of origin to the port/airport and ocean freight/air freight to the port/airport of destination.
Shipment of cargo by trucks, directly from the shipper's place to the destination, is known as a door to door shipment and more formally as multimodal transport. Trucks and trains make deliveries to sea and air ports where cargo is moved in bulk. 1 Carriage and freight (now known in the US as cost and freight)(C&F, CFR, CNF): Insurance is payable by the importer, and the exporter pays all expenses incurred in transporting the cargo from its place of origin to the port/airport and ocean freight/air freight to the port/airport of destination.
In addition to land solutions, freight transport is sometimes achieved by the use of waterways. With water freight transport, containers are filled with goods to be moved to a new location. The containers are stacked and secured in place, helping to minimize the potential for shifting during the transport process. A second land freight solution is the use of rail freight transport. This solution involves the use of railways to move goods. Freight cars or detachable containers are loaded with the goods, then moved through a network or railways until arriving at their destination.
A freight rate (historically and in ship chartering simply freight) is a price at which a certain cargo is delivered from one point to another. The price depends on the form of the cargo, the mode of transport (truck, ship, train, aircraft), the weight of the cargo, and the distance to the delivery destination. The main determining factors of freight rate are: mode of transportation (truck, ship, train, air craft) weight, size, distance, points of pickup and delivery, and the actual goods being shipped. One of the earliest forms of freight transportation was by water.
Here are some examples of the different incarnations of freight transport and what types of goods may be moved using these solutions. One of the more common modes of freight transportation involves moving the goods over land. There are two common means of accomplishing effective land-based freight transport. A second land freight solution is the use of rail freight transport. This solution involves the use of railways to move goods. Freight cars or detachable containers are loaded with the goods, then moved through a network or railways until arriving at their destination.
It is not unusual for freight transportation services to make use of more than one option to manage the timely and effective transportation of freight. Goods may be moved by truck or rail to a seaport, where they are then loaded onto a ship or barge and transported to a remote location. A second land freight solution is the use of rail freight transport. This solution involves the use of railways to move goods. Freight cars or detachable containers are loaded with the goods, then moved through a network or railways until arriving at their destination.
In air and sea shipments, ground transport is required to take the cargo from its place of origin to the airport or seaport and then to its destination because it is not always possible to establish a production facility near ports due to limited coastlines of countries. 1 Carriage and freight (now known in the US as cost and freight)(C&F, CFR, CNF): Insurance is payable by the importer, and the exporter pays all expenses incurred in transporting the cargo from its place of origin to the port/airport and ocean freight/air freight to the port/airport of destination.
Freight Rate, the cost of transporting goods is reflective of a number of factors aside from normal transportation costs. The main determining factors of freight rate are: mode of transportation (truck, ship, train, air craft) weight, size, distance, points of pickup and delivery, and the actual goods being shipped. One of the earliest forms of freight transportation was by water.
Freight transportation is the process of conveying different types of goods from one point to another using a variety of transport modes. The transport of freight can involve road solutions, air deliveries and even the use of waterways to move the freight from a point of origin to a destination. A second land freight solution is the use of rail freight transport. This solution involves the use of railways to move goods. Freight cars or detachable containers are loaded with the goods, then moved through a network or railways until arriving at their
