Definition of TETRAHEDRAL. 1. : being a polyhedral angle with four faces. 2. : relating to, forming, or having the form of a tetrahedron. — tet·ra·he·dral·ly \-drə-lē\ adverb.
Tetrahedral carbon: A carbon atom with four attachments, and bond angles of approximately 109.5 o. The overall shape is that of a tetrahedron (i.e., a pyramid with all faces being equilateral, or nearly equilateral, triangles). The carbon atoms uses sp3 orbitals to achieve this geometry. When all four attachments are different, the carbon is a stereocenter.

Tetrahedron The first of the platonic solids is the tetrahedron having 4 triangular sides and symbolizing the element of fire. Suggested Divinatory Meaning: the power of fire and the power present in the tetrahedron are beneficial for creating change but need to be handled with utmost care. Cube or Hexahedron The second platonic solid is the cube or hexahedron having 6 square sides and representing the element of earth.
By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Definition: Tetrahedral is a descriptor of the geometry of a molecule in which a central atom forms four bonds which are directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron.
