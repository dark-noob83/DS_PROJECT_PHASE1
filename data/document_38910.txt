Would you have guessed that the most expensive appliance you use is your oven? Using it for one hour a day will cost you 127.92 over a year. If you're serious about saving, you could try cooking two meals in the oven at the same time, then just microwaving the spare one the next day. Average usage: 1 hour every day. Amount of energy used per week: 13.65 kWh. Cost per week: 2.46. /wellbeing/galleries/34417/energy-bills-how-much-does-it-cost-to/7 /wellbeing/galleries/34417/energy-bills-how-much-does-it-cost-to/8 /wellbeing/galleries/34417/energy-bills-how-much-does-it-cost-to/9 ....
Keep in mind that you will need to account for the price of parts if you encounter any of these issues. Heating elements, for example, will cost anywhere between $30 and $200. You will also need to account for labor prices, which could cost between $30 and $100 per hour. See what you can do yourself to save some time and money.
If I used 600 CCF's of gas in 2009 and divide that by 365 I get 1.64 CCF of gas per day. At $.70 per CCF thats $1.15 per day. But if you have a natural gas oven, gas stovetop, gas hot water heater and gas furnace. SO that $1.15 per day does not tell me anything about how much fuel the furnace consumes. The purpose of the post was to determine how much natural gas my furnace consumes per hour and what the cost is. I ultimately determined the furnace consumes aboout 92 cubic feet of natural gas per hour. My natural gas supplier charges about $.70 for one hundred cubic foot of gas.
Ovens can use a lot of energy depending on the temperature set, most cooking is done at 300 to 425 Fahrenheit degrees. Ovens use 1000 to 5000 watts, with an average modern oven using around 2400 watts on medium to high heat. Hours Used Per Day: Enter how many hours the device is being used on average per a day, if the power consumption is lower than 1 hour per a day enter as a decimal.
So an oven that is rated at 11,000 watts uses 11 Kilowatts per hour or 11 KWH. The electric company bases their charges on KWH, mine is $.057/KWH. That means my electric oven costs 11 x $.057 = $.63 per hour to run. Propane and Natural Gas ovens are rated in BTU/hour (here anyway). My LP oven uses 60,000 BTU per hour. It takes approximately 1 gallon of propane to burn 90,000 BTU. So my oven uses (60,000/90,000) .67 of a gallon of propane to run for 1 hour. Since propane cost me $2.19 per gallon, my running cost per hour is .67 x $2.19 = $1.46 per hour. Of course these are approximates based on the manufacturer's specs, plus different ovens take longer to heat up than others and retain their heat more or less. There you go.
Microwaving for 10 minutes instead of oven cooking for an hour saves a massive 12.39 kWh per week, which works out as 2.24. Average usage: 1 hour every day. Amount of energy used per week: 13.65 kWh. Cost per week: 2.46. /wellbeing/galleries/34417/energy-bills-how-much-does-it-cost-to/7 .... Average usage: 1 hour every day. Amount of energy used per week: 13.65 kWh.

With this in mind, then the decision has to come down to the cost of the energy to raise the oven temperature to the desired levels. Gas costs around 6p per Kilowatt hour (KWh) and electricity 12p per KWh, so basically, it is cheaper to cook using mains gas. 
An electric stove top burner typically sits on top of the oven with 4 heating elements, normally two small and two large, and is used for heating or cooking food. The energy use of a stove top varies, smaller units will use 1000 watts while a larger heating element will go up to 3000 watts. Price (kWh): Enter the cost you are paying on average per a kilowatt hour, average price in North America is 10 cents. One trick to reduce the energy use when cooking is to heat water in an electric kettle.
To calculate the operating cost of an 18,000 BTU oven, for example, divide 18,000 by 100,000 to get 0.18. As of January 2013, the average price per therm of natural gas in California is $0.93, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Assuming you use your 18,000 BTU oven for one hour each day, the operating cost per day is $0.17 (0.18 times $0.93 times 1), or $61 per year. At the average price of $0.164 per kWh of electricity in California as of January 2013, a 1,500 watt oven costs $0.25 to operate for one hour each day.
Assuming a 1,500 watt oven, you would multiply 1,500 times 1 hour per day divided by 1,000 watts, resulting in 1.5 kWh of electricity used each day. At the average price of $0.164 per kWh of electricity in California as of January 2013, a 1,500 watt oven costs $0.25 to operate for one hour each day. This equates to an annual operating cost of $89.80
