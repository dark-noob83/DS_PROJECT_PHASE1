Page Content. Ohio law considers people who are 18 years of age or older to be capable of giving valid, legally enforceable consent to receive medical treatment. Generally, people under age 18 (minors) must have the consent of a parent or guardian before receiving medical care. However, there are several exceptions to this general rule. For example, emancipated minors and “mature minors” can give consent, and there are also certain statutory exceptions.
by Kirraley Bowles. Introduction. Consent to medical treatment can only be given by a person who is competent to consent. In general, Australian law recognises that individuals aged 18 years and over have full legal capacity, such that they are capable of making decisions relating to their own health care.
Informed consent for minor children with head injuries becomes problematic when the minor child turns 18 years old while a patient at a facility. At that age, he or she is considered an adult and, for purposes of medical treatment, is presumed competent to give consent.
A: Generally, only persons age 18 and over can give consent to their own routine medical and dental care. Youth under 18 need the consent of a parent or legal guardian to receive medical care. There are some exceptional circumstances in which youth under 18 can be treated without parental consent.
Prior to that age, parents (or legal guardians) are entitled to consent to their child's medical and dental treatment. A parent's authority in this respect is not, however, absolute, as the law in Australia recognises that children become increasingly competent as they move towards adulthood.
