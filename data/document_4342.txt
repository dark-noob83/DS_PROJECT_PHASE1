The itching can be severe and persistent, especially at night. Scratching the affected area of skin usually causes a rash. The rash is red and patchy and may be long-lasting (chronic) or come and go (recurring). The rash may: 1  Develop fluid-filled sores that can ooze fluid or crust over. 2  This can happen when the skin is rubbed or scratched or if a skin infection is present. 1 Babies (2 months to 2 years): The rash is often crusted or oozes fluid. 2  It's most commonly seen during the winter months as dry, red patches on the cheeks. 3  Children (2 years to 11 years): The rash is usually dry.
Like other diseases, eczema can be acute (happening relatively suddenly) or chronic (happening for a long time). Acute eczema usually comes with redness, oozing and weeping, and microscopic vesicles (fluid-filled pockets) in the epidermis (the outermost layer of our skin). Eczema is often an allergic reaction to something that contacts the skin, and people with eczema also tend to have allergic rhinitis, asthma, or both. The term eczema is generic: there are several different varieties, with different causes, different appearance, and sometimes different treatments. 1  Contact Dermatitis.

Knowledge center. Pus is a protein-rich fluid called liquor puris, usually whitish-yellow, yellow, or yellow brown in color. Pus consists of a buildup of dead leukocytes (white blood cells) from the body's immune system in response to infection. It accumulates at the site of inflammation. When the buildup is on or very near the surface of the skin it is called a pustule or pimple. An accumulation of pus in an enclosed tissue space is called an abscess.
