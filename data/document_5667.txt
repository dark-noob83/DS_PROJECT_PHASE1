Caddies usually take home between 6%-10% of a player's tournament earnings. Tiger earned a little less than $10 Million last year, so Steve Williams could have made about $1 m … illion last year. It is reported that Steve makes roughly 1 million per year. He gets a fixed rate, plus a percentage of Tigers winnings. Even non pro caddies can make over $1000 per week, as standard tips can be $50 or $100 per round per bag; considering TPC Sawgrass is $350 to play or one can pay over $500 to play Shadow Creek.
By Patrick Cameron. As of 2009, the best caddies in the business make $1,000 per week plus 5 percent of the tournament purse. They make 7 percent with a top 10 finish, and 10 percent for a victory. 
Cone estimates caddies can make $1,000 a week at the top clubs. After all, golfers paying $350 to play TPC Sawgrass or $500 to play Shadow Creek can generally spare $50 or $100 for a tip. But they do get paid. A lot. At the top end, caddy pay days can be better than many players in the field. Since June 2006, Tony Navarro, Adam Scott’s caddy, has pulled in $442,548; Allistair Matheson, who walks with Geoff Ogilvy, made $337,888.

Caddies are paid on the basis of how well their player performs: a base salary of $1,000 a week plus 5% of the tournament purse, 7% of a top 10 and 10% for a victory, according to Cone. But they do get paid. A lot. At the top end, caddy pay days can be better than many players in the field. Since June 2006, Tony Navarro, Adam Scott’s caddy, has pulled in $442,548; Allistair Matheson, who walks with Geoff Ogilvy, made $337,888.
Using the 2013 PGA Tour Money List, the minimum Tiger Woods' caddie would have received was $427,671. Because Tiger won five times in 2013, it's reasonable to assume the caddie made far more. In all, 33 golfers made more than $2 million in 2013. That means those caddies would receive a minimum of $100,000 in bonuses. Caddies don't have an annual salary like most people do. The President of the Professional Caddies Association (PCA) recently told reporters that high end caddies typically earn a base weekly salary of somewhere between $1,000-$1,500. Again, caddies negotiate this deal with the golfer on a case by case basis. Some could make more. Some could make less. The average PGA Tour player plays between 20-30 events per year, so it would make sense to assume that the average salary would range from $20,000-$45,000
Most PGA Tour caddies make between $1000 and $1500 per week, but they also make a percentage of what the player wins in the tournaments. This usually equates to 5 percent of any finish outside the top 10. Players breaking into the top 10, but not winning, will share 7 percent of their prize with their caddies.
