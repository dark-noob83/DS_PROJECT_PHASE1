The locational marginal price of power averaged $38/MWh in January, but spiked to $72/MWh in February. LMP then fell again to average $42/MWh in March and $30/MWh in April, Dotter said. Load-weighted LMP for April was $30/MWh, 25% lower than values seen in April 2013 and April 2014, the market report said. Energy use was about 2% below an average April. Congestion patterns have started to change with the end of winter, the
2014 State of the Market Report for PJM 389Section 11 Congestion and Marginal Losses 2015 Monitoring Analytics, LLC Congestion and Marginal Losses The locational marginal price (LMP) is the incremental price of energy at a bus. The total marginal loss cost in PJM for 2014 was $1,466.1 million, which was comprised of load loss payments of -$59.2 million, generation loss credits of -$1,581.3 million, explicit loss costs of -$56.0 million and inadvertent loss charges of $0.0 million.
This is known as locational marginal pricing (LMP) or nodal pricing and is used in some deregulated markets, most notably in the PJM Interconnection, ERCOT, New York, and New England markets in the USA, New Zealand and in Singapore. 
The marginal value files contain dates and times for binding constraints along with the marginal value, also called the shadow price, for those constraints in the Real-Time Energy Market. The PJM Energy Market procures electricity to meet consumers’ demands both in real time and in the near term. It includes the sale or purchase of energy in PJM’s Real-Time Energy Market (five minutes) and Day-Ahead Market (one day forward). Learn more about the energy market at the Learning Center.

Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) is a methodology for pricing electricity and managing transmission congestion that has been used by PJM and NY-ISO, and is likely to be adopted across the U.S. by Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) such as MISO and CAL-ISO and SeTrans. Locational Marginal Pricing is based on the cost of supplying the next megawatt of load at a specific location or node. It takes into account bid prices for generation, the flow of power within the transmission system and power transfer constraints.
LMP Electricity Markets Synapse Energy Economics Page 71 Price Differences between Locations Example locational prices, in this case for the various PJM-defined trading hubs, are shown in Figure 6.1 (on-peak hours, i.e., weekdays from 7 am to 11 pm) and Figure 6.2 (off-peak, i.e., all other hours). For example, in 2005 PJM reported a total of $5.6 billion in transmission costs from load, of which only about $100 million represented actual increases in the cost of producing electricity. However, both the uncertainty and the revenue surplus were addressed by the introduction of FTRs.
