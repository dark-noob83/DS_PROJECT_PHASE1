Tweet. Air temperature is a measure of how hot or cold the air is. It is the most commonly measured weather parameter. More specifically, temperature describes the kinetic energy, or energy of motion, of the gases that make up air. As gas molecules move more quickly, air temperature increases.
Temperature. The temperature of water changes slower than the temperature of the air because water has a higher heat capacity. Heat capacity is a property of a material that describes how much heat energy is required to change the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius.
In general, most people have their own concept of air temperature. Typical definitions of temperature includes how hot or cold it is relating to how they feel. They also associate sunny days with warmer weather and cloudy or rainy days with cooler.

If there is then further cooling of the air, say because the air parcel is rising to higher (and thus colder) levels in the atmosphere, even more water vapor must condense out as additional dew, fog, or cloud, so that the dew point temperature then falls along with the air temperature.
