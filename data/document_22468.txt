So, the most it can cost you to run a ceiling fan without lights is about $126 per year, which is equal to about $10 per month and the least it will cost you is $19 per year, which comes out to just $1 per month...which in either case, is amazingly cheap.
So, if you run the fan continuously for a month (there are 730 hours in a month), you would use 500 watts x 730 hours = 365,000 watt hours.
As you can see, the calculated cost to operate the fan with lights off is only $0.0029/hr. If you re-calculate it with the lights turned on, the cost increases by about 300% to $0.0091, but is still less than a penny per hour.
So it would cost about $44/mo to run the fan continuously. In the Auto mode the fan only comes on when the heating or AC comes on. The cost of running the fan intermittently will be less, but depends on the on/off ratio. If we assume 12 hours on and 12 hours off each day, the cost is reduced by 50%, or about $22/mo. If you do decide to run the fan continuously, there are a few important things you'll need to consider first.
It can be daisy chained in a line with 6 other air movers of the same type. The GFCI outlet protects each fan, and the low 2.3 amp draw eliminates the need for multiple outlets to plug in multiple fans. This is the dream fan for restoration experts.
The wattage of the light fixture can have a much greater impact on the cost than the motor. When calculating the cost to operate a fan with the lights on, you must add the wattage of the lights to that of the motor. The range of wattage for a ceiling fan light fixture is anywhere from 13 watts to 190 watts.
