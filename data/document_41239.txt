Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes (SADS) are genetic heart conditions that can cause sudden death in young, apparently healthy, people. These conditions can be treated and deaths can be prevented. 
Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS), is a term used as part of sudden unexpected death syndrome to describe sudden death due to cardiac arrest brought on by an arrhythmia in the presence or absence of any structural heart disease on autopsy. Sudden cardiac death is the cause of about half of deaths due to cardiovascular disease or about 15% of all deaths globally. About 80% of sudden cardiac death is the result of ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may occur at any age but are more common among older people.

Introduction: No studies in an unselected and nationwide setting have characterized the symptoms and medical history of patients with sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS).

A prolonged QT interval is a common thread among the various entities associated with sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. A number of drugs are known to cause QT prolongation (e.g., terfenadine), as are hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, myocarditis, and endocrine and nutritional disorders. 
Most sudden deaths are due to a heart condition and are known as sudden arrhythmia death or sudden cardiac death syndrome. Sudden arrhythmia death is most commonly due to a serious abnormal change to the heart's rhythm known as an arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia. Sudden cardiac death describes a sudden death as a result of an un-resuscitated cardiac arrest or heart attack. There are a number of heart conditions that can cause sudden death syndrome however the cause of sudden death can often remain unknown until a post-mortem has been performed. The majority of victims have no warning signs or prior symptoms.
