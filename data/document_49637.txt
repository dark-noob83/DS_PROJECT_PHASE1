Methanol is toxic by two mechanisms. First, methanol (whether it enters the body by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin) can be fatal due to its CNS depressant properties in the same manner as ethanol poisoning.
1 APPEARANCE: Colorless watery liquid. 2  DESCRIPTION: Methanol is a toxic alcohol that is used industrially as a solvent, pesticide, and alternative fuel source. 3  It also occurs naturally in humans, animals, and plants.
Complications. Vision loss. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is responsible for ocular toxicity in animal models and is rightly presumed to be responsible in human studies. (See Etiology and Pathophysiology.). Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury.
Methanol is metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to formaldehyde, which is further metabolised by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to formic acid. Formic acid is the main toxic metabolite responsible for the retinal, ophthalmic and neural toxicity seen with methanol ingestion.
Methanol is a highly toxic colorless liquid that may explode when exposed to flames. Other common names for methanol are methyl alcohol and wood alcohol. Methanol occurs naturally in wood and volcanic gases and is a product of decaying organic material such as vegetation.
Although any alcohol can be toxic if ingested in large enough quantities, the term toxic alcohol has traditionally referred to isopropanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol. Prompt recognition and treatment of patients intoxicated with these substances can reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these alcohols.
Background. Methanol, also known as wood alcohol, is a commonly used organic solvent that, because of its toxicity, can cause metabolic acidosis, neurologic sequelae, and even death, when ingested.
