Sorry but the first pulley was not invented by the Egyptians it was invented by Archimedes of Syracuse in around 250 BCE.
The origin of pulleys is not known, but there is evidence that they were used in the building of Stonehenge, in England. One of the first names we associate with pulleys is that of Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist born in Syracuse (a Greek seaport colony). Archimedes studied many areas of science and invented many devices, and it is said that he used pulleys to drag a ship out of the ocean and onto land.
Archimedes was a mathematician and an inventor. He invented such things as the Archimedes screw, the compound pulley and the lever. Some of his mathematical contributions are that he discovered, pi and the relation of the surface area and volume of a sphere to its circumscribing cylinder.
The block and tackle (or pulley system) was brought to us by  Archimedes (287BC - 212BC) in Greece, but neither Archimedes, nor  any who wrote about him and his extraordinar â€¦ y work dated the  invention.stupid answer.
The pulley looked like this: Archimedes invention, the Archimedes's screw, was used to remove water from the hold of a large ship. The Archimedes's screw looked like this: Archimedes also invented the burning mirror which was a weapon used in war.

Archimedes's Invention of the Compound Pulley. The famous Greek mathematician Archimedes is credited with dozens of discoveries and inventions, including the compound pulley, in which combinations of pulleys allow objects of great size and weight to be moved.
