DEFINITION OF EBD. Defining EBD is fraught with difficulty, and the federal definition of this category of disability is seriously flawed. Distinguishing “emotional disturbance” from “behavioral disorder” is impossible. PREVALENCE OF EBD. According to the U.S. Department of Education (2005) and the National Research Council (2002), about 1% of students in public schools in the United States receive special education under the ED (EBD) category.
Electronic brake-force distribution system also called as Electronic brake-force limitation is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies the amount of force applied to each of a vehicle’s brakes, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. EBD system is always coupled with anti-lock brake-force system. 
Difficulties must be displayed in multiple environments, one of which must be the school. Students with EBD require responses that may be different from regular behavioural management. Planning teams must formulate programs that address the child's entire behavioural system in a meaningful and permanent way.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies the amount of force applied to each of a vehicle's brakes, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. As per the technical paper published by Buschmann et al. The job of the EBD as a subsystem of the ABS system is to control the effective adhesion utilization by the rear wheels. The pressure of the rear wheels are approximated to the ideal brake force distribution in a partial braking operation.
EBD kids commonly lack the impulse control and the emotional balance that is necessary to handle social interactions with other students effectively. This can be challenging for a teacher, especially in an inclusive classroom where only a portion of the students have EBD. Your EBD students (as well as some of your more focused students) will most likely struggle if you impose a long list of complicated rules and demands upon them. Try to keep your classroom guidelines broad and simple — no more than 3 to 5 main rules.
