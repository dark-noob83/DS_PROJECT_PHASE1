The Fahaka Puffer has not been bred commercially in captivity, but there are reports of successful breeding by hobbyists. The difficulty with breeding these fish is that they will normally kill each other on sight and when they do breed it is normally at 50 feet or deeper in nature.
THEY WILL NOT EAT FLAKES AND PELLETS. They eat frozen blood Worms and live mini pond snails. They need the snails once a month as their beaks may overgrow but these puffers are so tiny they don't have problem's like the bigger puffers with their beaks. They are true fresh water and should not be in brackish water.
I bought 3 baby puffer fish and they don&#39;t seem to be eating pellets, flakes or bloodworms. Do they have a special diet??? Also, are all puffers aggresive? They were in the &quot;community&quot; section of the fish store...
Do not eat your pet puffer. In consequence of their peculiar body plan, puffers do not swim as do most fish by curving and flexing the body. Most slow swimming is performed by the pectoral fins, with steering and stability provided by the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins.
How Often Do You Feed Your Puffer? in the Puffers forums, part of the Freshwater Fish Forums category. Hello, I have a new Figure 8 Puffer. It's just a baby (about 1 1 inches long).
All puffers have a sharp beak in their mouths and the Fahaka Puffer will use it to remove pieces from just about any living thing that is in the tank with them. They are a type of carnivore called a molluscivore, meaning they eat all sorts of benthic organisms like oysters, mussels, scallops, clams, and krill.
The Fahaka puffer is not an easy species to breed at all, mainly due to its aggressive temperament. However reports of breeding successes in large aquaria do exist. Ideally a separate breeding aquarium should be used, but the fish may also spawn when kept in a small group in a very large tank.
