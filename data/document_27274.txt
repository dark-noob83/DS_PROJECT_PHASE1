Overview. Gallbladder disease is a term for several types of conditions that can affect your gallbladder, a small pear shaped sac located under the liver. Your gallbladderâ€™s main function is to store the bile produced in your liver and pass it along to the small intestine.
The gallbladder is a small sac found just under the liver. It stores bile made by the liver. Bile helps you digest fats. Bile moves from the gallbladder to the small intestine through tubes called the cystic duct and common bile duct. Gallstones are made from cholesterol and other things found in the bile.
