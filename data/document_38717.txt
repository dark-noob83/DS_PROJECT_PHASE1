Report Abuse. I have a chocolate lab and she slept loads as a puppy, she had 10 lab puppies and they slept loads as well. We had 3 of them untill 10 weeks and trust me she'll start to get a bit more awake. Puppies are like newborn babies eat, sleep and poo.
Our three Labs seem to sleep a lot but I think they just enjoy sleeping! Our 8 year old choccy boy take every opportunity to fall asleep, usually on the sofa or a pile of dogs beds (the comfier the better!).
Best Answer: dogs sleep about 18 hours a day... pups even more,,,, all your concerns about your puppy should be directed to your responsible breeder,,, they will be there for you always.
The amount of sleep needed for each person is different. Children  under 18 usually need more sleep, up to 10 hours a night. Adults  should get between 7-8 hours per night b … e fully rested for optimum  health.
Dogs naturally sleep for far longer periods of time each day, than people do. Many adult Labradors will sleep for well over half of every 24 hours, and puppies under four months old may sleep as much as 20 hours a day.
I was just googling how much sleep a four month old lab puppy should sleep in a 24 hour period and I found you guys! We have Luna, who is 4 months old, and she is just darling.
