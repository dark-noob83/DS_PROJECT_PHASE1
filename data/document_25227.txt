A buffer is simply a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. Buffers work by reacting with any added acid or base to control the pH. For example, let's consider the action of a buffer composed of the weak base ammonia, NH 3, and its conjugate acid, NH 4 + .
Share. Buffer Definition: A buffer is a solution containing either a weak acid and its salt or a weak base and its salt, which is resistant to changes in pH. Examples: blood, TRIS buffer, phosphate buffer. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.
A buffer is made by mixing a large volume of a weak acid or weak base together with its conjugate. A weak acid and its conjugate base can remain in solution without neutralizing each other.
Acid-base buffers confer resistance to a change in the pH of a solution when hydrogen ions (protons) or hydroxide ions are added or removed. An acid-base buffer typically consists of a weak acid, and its conjugate base (salt) (see Equations 2-4 in the blue box, below).
If a strong base is added to a buffer, the weak acid will give up its H + in order to transform the base (OH -) into water (H 2 O) and the conjugate base: HA + OH - â†’ A - + H 2 O. Since the added OH-is consumed by this reaction, the pH will change only slightly.

A buffer is an aqueous solution that has a highly stable pH. If you add acid or base to a buffered solution, its pH will not change significantly. Similarly, adding water to a buffer or allowing water to evaporate will not change the pH of a buffer.
