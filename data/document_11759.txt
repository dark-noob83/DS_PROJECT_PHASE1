Cnidocytes are important to cnidarians as these are the stinging cells used to catch prey and defend from enemies. It is a toxin which can disable prey and provide protection â€¦ from adversaries. This can be used as a harpoon, sticky surface or lasso type action. Answered.
How does the Cnidocyte of a Cnidarian Function? A cnidocyte, cnidoblast or nematocyte, is a type of venomous cell unique to the phylum Cnidaria (corals, sea anemones, hydrae, jellyfish, etc.).
A specialized cell containing a cnidocyst involved in capturing prey and defense mechanism against predators of the cnidarians. Supplement. Cnidocytes are a distinctive feature of cnidarians (jellyfishes, sea anemones, corals, hydrae, etc .). These are explosive cells used by cnidarians in order to capture their prey (e.g. fish and crustaceans). These cells shoot off threadlike, often toxic, tubule inside the cnidocyst.
A cnidocyte is a type of venomous cell that is found in  coelenterates. A nematocyst, meanwhile, is a specialized organelle  found inside the nematocysts of
A specialize cell unique to the phylum Cnidaria. It contains a capsule-like organelle housing a coiled thread that, when discharged, explodes outward and functions in prey capture or defense.
