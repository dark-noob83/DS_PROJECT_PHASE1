Determine the value of antique cuckoo clocks; 4 factors that defines a valuable cuckoo clock. 
One of the most beloved novelty clocks of all time, the cuckoo clock was created by Franz Anton Ketterer in 1730. Ketterer resided in a village in the Black Forest of Germany. Since then, the Black Forest has been synonymous with cuckoo clocks. Cuckoo clocks have weight-driven movements.
Do you want to determine how much your antique cuckoo clock is worth? The easiest way to assessing the probable market value of old cuckoo clocks is through an expert horologist or a clock appraiser. While this path may be convenient, it entails a risk. In any valuation, it is important to remember that your spending should be limited to what your purpose dictates.
One thing that makes original Black Forest cuckoo clocks distinct is the mechanical clock movement. These movements must be wound for the clock to continue working. There are basically two different types of clock movements. One is the 1-Day movement and the other is an 8-Day movement.
