The histologic diagnosis of UIP is based on temporal and spacial heterogeneity, which is the identification of fibrotic lesions at different stages (fibroblastic infiltrates, mature fibrosis, and honeycombing) within the same biopsy specimen 1.
Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) also known as ‘fibrosing alveolitis’, is a relatively common form of ‘interstitial lung disease’.
Of these disorders, the two entities that have provoked most discussion and debate are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; as currently defined with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern of pathology) and non‐specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). There are two key reasons for this.
Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) refers to a morphological pattern of interstitial lung disease.
Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is a form of lung disease characterized by progressive scarring of both lungs. The scarring (fibrosis) involves the supporting framework (interstitium) of the lung. UIP is thus classified as a form of interstitial lung disease. The term usual refers to the fact that UIP is the most common form of interstitial fibrosis. Pneumonia indicates lung abnormality, which includes fibrosis and inflammation.
