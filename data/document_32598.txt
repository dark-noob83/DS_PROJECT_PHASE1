The test detects the amino acid serine that has been cleaved from the hippuric acid. The second tube is positive for hippurate hemolysis and presumptive identification of GBS. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are generally beta hemolytic on blood agar plates (right hand side). The colonies of GBS are gray to whitish-gray surrounded by a weak zone of beta hemolysis of the red blood cells in the culture medium. These results indicate we have identified a group B Streptococcus. This is a picture of an agar plate with growth and hemolytic activity of group B streptococci (GBS) (on the left) and group A streptococci (GAS)(on the right).
A micrograph depicting Streptococcus agalactiae bacteria. Colonial Morphology and Identification: Colonial morphology of S. agalactiae in culture is typically gray to whitish-gray in colour when grown on sheep blood agar. This picture shows one of these tests. It is called the CAMP test. S. agalactiae infection is diagnosed using samples collected from blood, urine or spinal fluid. To identify this pathogen, vaginal and rectal swabs are typically culture on sheep blood agar medium and are identified using the CAMP test (Figure 2).
Group B streptococci. Colonies of Streptococcus agalactiae cultivated on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. Cultivation 24 hours in an aerobic atmosphere enriched with 5% carbon dioxide. Colonies are surroundend by a zone of beta-hemolysis. Streptococcus agalactiae is a member of the gastrointestinal normal flora in some humans and can spread to secondary sites-including the vagina in 10 30% of women. This is of clinical importance: S. agalactiae can be transferred to a neonate passing through the birth canal and can cause serious group B streptococcal infection. In the western world, S. agalactiae is the major cause of bacterial septicemia of the newborn, which can lead to death or long-term sequelae.
As mentioned, most strains of this organism are beta-hemolytic, suggesting that they are able to lyse red blood cells and grow on blood agar medium. In addition, the CAMP test is an important test for its identification (Figure 2). Mainly Streptococcus agalactiae bacteria are screened through this test. It is characterized by the presence of group B Lancefield antigen and by its ability to hydrolyze sodium hippurate. It is also sensitive to bile and will lyse in its presence. Figure 2. This picture shows one of these tests. It is called the CAMP test. S. agalactiae infection is diagnosed using samples collected from blood, urine or spinal fluid. To identify this pathogen, vaginal and rectal swabs are typically culture on sheep blood agar medium and are identified using the CAMP test
GBS grows readily on blood agar plates as colonies surrounded by a narrow zone of β- hemolysis. GBS is characterized by the presence in the cell wall of the antigen group B of Lancefield classification (Lancefield grouping) that can be detected directly in intact bacteria using latex agglutination tests.
Streptococcus agalactiae (also known as Group B streptococcus or GBS) is a gram-positive cocci with a tendency to form chains, streptococcus, beta-hemolytic, catalase-negative, and facultative anaerobe. GBS is characterized by the presence in the cell wall of the antigen group B of Lancefield classification (Lancefield grouping) that can be detected directly in intact bacteria using latex agglutination tests.
Streptococcus agalactiae is the species designation for streptococci belonging to the group B of the Rebecca Lancefield classification. GBS is encapsulated by a capsular exopolysacharide rich in sialic acid. GBS is characterized by the presence in the cell wall of the antigen group B of Lancefield classification (Lancefield grouping) that can be detected directly in intact bacteria using latex agglutination tests.
Overview: Streptococcus agalactiae (also known as group-B streptococcus or beta-strep) is a Gram-positive coccus, non-motile, non-spore-forming, catalase-negative, spherical or ovoid, and less than 2 µm (micrometres) in diameter; it is usually β-haemolytic and can grow in pairs or short chains (Figure 1). This picture shows one of these tests. It is called the CAMP test. S. agalactiae infection is diagnosed using samples collected from blood, urine or spinal fluid. To identify this pathogen, vaginal and rectal swabs are typically culture on sheep blood agar medium and are identified using the CAMP test (Figure 2).
Streptococcus agalactiae, often referred as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is one of four Beta-Hemolytic streptococci, which results in complete rupture of blood cells shown in wide and clear areas surrounding bacterial colonies on blood agar. [1 ]. Appearance: S. agalactiae is a diplococcal (a pair of cocci, circular, pair) gram-positive, non acid-fast bacterium (~2.0µm) that does not form spores, is not motile, and is catalase-free (catalase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide).
Principle And Interpretation Streptococcus agalactiae is a gram-positive Streptococcus characterized by the presence of group B Lancefield antigen.S. agalactiae exhibits beta haemolysic reaction. On Blood agar plate, it forms zones of haemolysis that are slightly bigger thanthe size of colonies formed. Group B streptococci hydrolyze sodium hippurate and give a positive response in the CAMP test.S. agalactiae is also sensitive to bile and will lyse in its presence. Please refer disclaimer Overleaf. Streptococcus Agalactiae Selective Agar Base M1257 Streptococcus Agalactiae Selective Agar is recommended for selective isolation of Streptococcus agalactiae from dairyproducts.
