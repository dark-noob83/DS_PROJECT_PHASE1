Neptune is currently the most distant planet from the Sun, with an orbital radius of 30 Astronomical Units and an orbital period of 165 years. Its diameter is about four times that of the Earth, which makes it the 4th largest planet.
Neptune. Neptune might be called the mathematicians' planet. German astronomer Johann Galle discovered it on September 23, 1846. The discovery was made possible, though, by the calculations of mathematicians Urbain Leverrier of France and John Couch Adams of England. Neptune At a Glance.
We can't see a lot of features in Neptune's atmosphere, but the features that astronomers can detect appear to come and go in a hurry. When the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past Neptune in August 1989, for example, it discovered the Great Dark Spot -- a dark, oval-shaped storm system as big as Earth.
The largest, Triton, orbits Neptune in a direction opposite to the direction of the planet's rotation. Triton is the coldest body yet visited in our solar systemâ€”temperatures on its surface are about -391 degrees Fahrenheit (-235 degrees Celsius).
Neptune probably has a rocky core wrapped in a layer of frozen water and other ices. The core is fairly large, so Neptune is actually the third most massive planet in the solar system. Traces of other elements form clouds at the top of its thick atmosphere.
Pluto Facts. Pluto orbits beyond the orbit of Neptune (usually). It is much smaller than any of the official planets and now classified as a dwarf planet. Pluto is smaller than seven of the solar system's moons (the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan and Triton).
The first of the planets to be discovered was named after the muse of Astronomy (Urania). Uranus is also the name of Saturn's father. Uranus was discovered by William Herschel in 1781, though it had been mistakenly mapped in the past as a star.
