succinylcholine. a short-acting depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent used as a muscle relaxant. Called also suxamethonium. succinylcholine bromide. the pharmaceutical form of succinylcholine; can cause death by cardiac arrest in even healthy horses.
Succinylcholine (also known as suxamethonium and abbreviated as SCh) was first synthesized in 1911 and clinically introduced in the early 1950's after its neuromuscular blocking properties were discovered in 1949. It usually has chloride as its halogen ion in solutions, although bromide and iodide forms also exist.
Definition of SUCCINYLCHOLINE. : a basic compound that is used intravenously chiefly in the form of a hydrated chloride C14H30Cl2N2O4·2H2O as a muscle relaxant in surgery. ADVERTISEMENT. noun suc·ci·nyl·cho·line \ˌsək-sən-əl-ˈkō-ˌlēn, -sə-ˌnil-\.

Noun. 1. succinylcholine-a muscle relaxant for striated muscle that is used as an adjunct to anesthesia during certain surgical procedures. muscle relaxant-a drug that reduces muscle contractility by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses or by decreasing the excitability of the motor end plate or by other actions.
Suxamethonium chloride (INN), also known as suxamethonium or succinylcholine, is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, used to induce muscle relaxation and short-term paralysis, usually to facilitate tracheal intubation.
The ED95 of succinylcholine is about 0.3 mg/kg; I've seen other sites that say 0.5. The dose for intubation is from 1-2 mg/kg. Occasionally in the ER, they'll call for 200 mg of it, which is just an entire 10cc syringe or an entire 10 mL vial, since succinylcholine is usually at a concentration of 20 mg/mL.
