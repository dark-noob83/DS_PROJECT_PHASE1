In some buildings, if you have a gas range, you’ll have to pay for the natural gas that you use during cooking. (And in some buildings, the natural gas will also provide your heat.) With cooking, the cost is minimal — $15 a month at most, usually quite a lot less. It really all depends how much you cook at home. Internet. Monthly, expect to pay about $45. Keep in mind that you can split the cost with as many other people as are using your connection, so if you have two roommates, that’s only $15 a person per month. The other thing to consider is bundling your Internet with your cable.
Last year the average American household pumped $2,512 worth of petroleum products into their cars. That was actually about $115 lower per household than 2013 as plunging oil prices saved American drivers a whopping $14 billion at the pump in 2014. 
If you’re like a majority of the respondents of a recent GasBuddy.com poll, you spend at least $101 each month in order to fill up your car. For most of us, that doesn’t seem like a whole heck of a lot, but for people who are just making it by, that’s a whole lot of money. I don’t care who you are, what kind of job you have, whatever, $3,600 is a lot of money to blow on gas each year. Unfortunately, it appears that things will only get worse in the future (here comes the political commentary) as we haven’t built a new refinery in this country in the last 30 years.
If the two of you make $1,200 a month, combined, and pay $200 a month for gas, there is no way you can pay $800 in rent plus utilities. You would have no money left over for such pretty important expenses as food! You need to be looking for a very inexpensive roommate share. This is too much, so start with your take-home of $2,800 and try to spend no more than 35% of that in rent, or $980. Add about $150-$200 for utilities and you will still have over $1,500 a month left for all other expenses and savings.
The national average for gas spending is about $220 a month and married couples my age with kids tend to spend about $250. That’s interesting, but how does my personal gas spending stack up? Unfortunately, we’re above average, even for our particular location. We typically spend right around $275-$290 each month on gas. It makes sense that people in our area spend more than the national average because it’s one of the most rural counties in the state. Since I move 1hour away from my job I spend about $400 in gas a month. It's a huge expense but it's the price to pay to have a nice house and a big land... I honestly don't even drive my car anywhere aside from work and school. The occasional run to the mall or somewhere for dinner. My gas price is about $90 each month.
The apartment costs $800 a month and the electric and heating are both not included. Would we be able to afford all costs including food, etc. We both make about $600 dollars a month and have to pay about 200 a month for gas. This is too much, so start with your take-home of $2,800 and try to spend no more than 35% of that in rent, or $980. Add about $150-$200 for utilities and you will still have over $1,500 a month left for all other expenses and savings.
It really blows my mind that 20% of people spend over $300 a month to fill up their cars. I don’t care who you are, what kind of job you have, whatever, $3,600 is a lot of money to blow on gas each year. Unfortunately, it appears that things will only get worse in the future (here comes the political commentary) as we haven’t built a new refinery in this country in the last 30 years.
