Wages and salaries in the United States have increased during the last decades. The median weekly earnings of a full-time wage and salary worker were about 241 U.S. dollars in 1979 and shifted up to 768 U.S. dollars in 2012.
Last year, the average salary in Beijing reached 39,867 yuan (5,679.1 U.S. dollars), trailing those in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen which all exceeded 30,000 (4,273.5 U.S. dollars).
According to CNN’s online global wage calculator, which uses data from the International Labor Organization, the average annual salary of a worker in China’s private sector was 28,752 yuan (about $4,755) in 2012, or 38% of the global average. That’s roughly the same as a cleaner in Thailand, according to CNN’s data.
In China, wages are benchmarked using the average salary. This page provides-China Average Yearly Wages-actual values, historical data, forecast, chart, statistics, economic calendar and news. Content for-China Average Yearly Wages-was last refreshed on Thursday, October 15, 2015.
Sound corporate performances and raised lowest salary levels lifted the average salary of China's employees working in cities and towns approach 25,000 yuan (3,561.3 U.S. dollars) in 2007, up 18.72 percent over the previous year, the biggest rise in the past six years.
Once they have the total wage bill for each country, they add them all together and divide by the total number of earners in the world. That gives you the answer-the world's average salary is $1,480 (£928) a month, which is just less than $18,000 (£11,291) a year. But these dollars are not normal US dollars.
On average, yes, the monthly salary in China is about 200 dollars, but since there are so many people in China, and people live on such a vast scale of living standards, you can't assume that having that amount works for everywhere.
Partly, it can be explained by China's cheaper workers: The average hourly wage for Chinese manufacturing workers is less than a tenth that of their average U.S. counterparts, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It being about twice as cheap to live in China, those lower Chinese wages go further.
Now the average salary minimum about $300 a month in China(Shanghai /Beijing / Guangzhou etc) unless you compare to those staying in the rural area which making about $100 or more doing farming but not those working or staying in the cities.
