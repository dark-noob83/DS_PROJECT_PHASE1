As a general rule, between 10 percent and 15 percent of your total calories should come from protein. So, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, at least 200 should come from protein, or about 50 grams. You should try to eat around one gram of protein per one kilogram of body weight, or around 0.4 grams per pound. An easier way to figure this out in your head is to take your weight, divide it in half, and subtract 10.
Therefore, if your weight-loss energy goal is 1,400 calories per day, multiply 1,400 by 0.45 and by 0.65 -- equaling 630 to 910 calories -- to determine how many of your total calories should be from carbohydrates. Then, divide each of these number by 4 calories, which is 157 to 228 grams of carbs per day. For example, if you’re eating 1,200 calories a day, aim for 135 to 195 grams of carbs -- and if your weight-loss calorie requirement is 1,600 calories daily, shoot for 180, but no more than 260, grams of carbs per day.

What to Limit. Carbohydrates. Your goal should be to limit your carb intake to between 45 and 65 percent of total calories per day. In other words, if you are consuming 2200 calories per day, no more than 1430 of that should come from carbohydrates. In addition, you should aim to eat at least 130 grams of carbs every day, split evenly throughout the day. 
Well, those calories will all come from carbs. And, since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, you’d just need to divide this left over amount of calories by 4 to figure out exactly how many grams of carbs you’d need to eat each day. Figure out how many calories are still left over after protein and fat are factored in, and then just divide that left over amount by 4. The answer you get is how many grams of carbs you should eat per day.
Sedentary women between the ages of 19 and 30 should consume between 1,800 and 2,000 calories per day. Carbohydrates should account for 810 to 1,300 of your calories each day. As there are 4 calories in 1 gram of carbohydrates, this amounts to 202.5 to 325 grams of carbohydrates per day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, you should consume 1,800 calories per day and 202.5 to 292.5 grams of carbohydrates. The number of calories that a woman should consume each day varies with her age and level of physical activity. Regardless of these differences, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates account for 45 to 65 percent of your total calories.
Moderately active women between the ages of 19 and 30 should try to eat 2,000 to 2,200 calories per day. As carbohydrates should account for 900 to 1,430 of these calories, you should eat 225 to 357.5 grams of carbs each day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, these values decrease to 2,000 calories and between 225 and 325 grams of carbs every day. The number of calories that a woman should consume each day varies with her age and level of physical activity. Regardless of these differences, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates account for 45 to 65 percent of your total calories.
Carb grams/day range*: 259–455 grams. Carb grams/meal range (3 meals per day): 86–151 grams. *Based on 45%–65% of calories from carbohydrate. Note: Men who are under 65 years of age, moderate to large in stature, at a healthy weight, and get a lot of exercise may need more calories and grams of carbohydrate. Carb grams/day range*: 180–308 grams. Carb grams/meal range (3 meals per day): 60–103 grams. *Based on 45%–­65% of calories from carbohydrate. Note: These recommendations are the same for a woman of small stature who wants to maintain weight.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day.
