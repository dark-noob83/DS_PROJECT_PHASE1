IBM states that the Clearcase client is only supported on the Red Hat Linux or SuSE Enterprise distributions but the only thing limiting you to this distribution is the kernel version, files, directory structure and the version of gcc. 1 - Installed. - 2  if client download is un-tarred to /opt/rational/clearcase. 3  A lower version of the Clearcase client will work with a higher version of the Clearcase view and VOB server or a matching version. 4  The client can not have a higher version than the server.
ClearCase supports two configuration management models: UCM (Unified Change Management) and base ClearCase. UCM provides an out-of-the-box model while base ClearCase provides a basic infrastructure (UCM is built on base ClearCase). Under base ClearCase, each view is controlled by its associated configuration specification, commonly referred to as a config spec. This is a collection of rules (stored internally in a text file, but compiled before use) that specifies what element versions (files or directories) are to be displayed in a view.
This tutorial is for software developers using IBM/Rational Clearcase for change management (CM) on Linux. Unlike many of the text file based CM systems like RCS and CVS, Clearcase used its Multi Version File System (MVFS) to hold various revisions of a file and control locking of files checked out to a developer. 1 - Installed. - 2  if client download is un-tarred to /opt/rational/clearcase. 3  A lower version of the Clearcase client will work with a higher version of the Clearcase view and VOB server or a matching version. 4  The client can not have a higher version than the server.
1 ClearCase Remote Client plugin: This is the way to go if you actually do not have the ClearCase software installed on your workstation/laptop and your ClearCase administrators, or the people in the know tell you that you have to use the ClearCase Remote Client functionality. ClearCase Remote Client Plugin Installation Procedure. This is the installation procedure for the ClearCase Remote Client (CCRC) Plugin, check the other installation procedure if what you need the regular ClearCase Plugin (that uses the ClearCase software already installed on your workstation/laptop).
110 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM Do not take incremental backup of ClearCase storage areas. Due to the way ClearCase stores the data in the storage structure, the incremental backups are often almost as large as the full backups. 80 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM Use stripe technology (RAID 0) for improved performance. Use mirroring (RAID 1) if high availability is desired. Avoid RAID 5, unless your benchmarks show equal performance to RAID (0+1).
246 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM Gateway shipping server The most secure implementation for using the shipping server through the firewall is to install a shipping-server-only configuration on a UNIX client. 80 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM Use stripe technology (RAID 0) for improved performance. Use mirroring (RAID 1) if high availability is desired. Avoid RAID 5, unless your benchmarks show equal performance to RAID (0+1).
Rational ClearCase is a family of computer software tools that supports software configuration management (SCM) of source code and other software development assets. It includes revision control. Under base ClearCase, each view is controlled by its associated configuration specification, commonly referred to as a config spec. This is a collection of rules (stored internally in a text file, but compiled before use) that specifies what element versions (files or directories) are to be displayed in a view.
1 This tar archive is good for installing Clearcase server and Clearcase client. 2  It is the options chosen during installation and configuration which differentiate a server installation from a client installation. 1 - Installed. - 2  if client download is un-tarred to /opt/rational/clearcase. 3  A lower version of the Clearcase client will work with a higher version of the Clearcase view and VOB server or a matching version. 4  The client can not have a higher version than the server.
268 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM If you can guarantee that a single site has the most current information in the family, restricting the restore to the single site is a good way to streamline the restore process. 80 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM Use stripe technology (RAID 0) for improved performance. Use mirroring (RAID 1) if high availability is desired. Avoid RAID 5, unless your benchmarks show equal performance to RAID (0+1).
