All animals are members of the Kingdom Animalia, also called Metazoa. This Kingdom does not contain prokaryotes (Kingdom Monera, includes bacteria, blue-green algae) or protists (Kingdom Protista, includes unicellular eukaryotic organisms).
Arthropoda, a phylum within Kingdom Animalia, is the most diverse of all the phyla. Fossil records indicate that arthropods evolved from annelids sometime in the Cambrian period, but molecular evidence indicates that they evolved separately from each other.

Click on link. The phyla of kingdom animalia are determined by evolutionary traits of an animal, and are grouped below the kingdom level. The largest phyla in kingdom animalia are phylums: Mollusca, Porifera, Cindaria, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, and Chordata, our own phylum. PHYLUM NEMATODA: Phylum nematoda consists of only roundworms, some that are parasitic.
1 Heterotrophic, which means they have to get their own food. 2  Plants are autotrophic because they make their own food through photosynthesis. 3  Because they cannot make their own food, members of the Animalia Kingdom must ingest, or eat, other organisms. 4  Eukaryotes: this is the type of cells animals have.
