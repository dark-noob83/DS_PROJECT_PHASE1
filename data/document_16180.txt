Keep in mind that it's physiologically impossible to gain more than one pound of lean muscle per week. For most weight-gainers, half a pound per week would be an even more realistic goal, because they reach their genetic limit.
Based on all of this, hereâ€™s how much muscle you can expect to gain on average over your entire lifespan: 1  Average Natural MAN: a total of about 40-50 pounds of muscle in their life. 2  Average Natural WOMAN: a total of about 20-25
My question is how much PURE muscle gain you can gain in 1 month naturally. All the research says 2lb per month on average. Or 25lb per year if you use an effective training program supported by the right diet. Obviously, your age, genetics, bodytype, training experience, and work ethic will affect your gains.
FROM Impatience is the biggest enemy for those of us trying to gain muscle weight. On 'average' the best anyone can do with a perfect diet, excellent & hard workout routines, and everything else being perfect, is about 0.454kg (454 grams = 1 pound) of muscle per week. Scientifically this is the maximum limit for human beings. We cannot gain more muscle than this per week. The only exception to this MAXIMUM rule of 454 grams per week for ANYONE is drugs, such as steroids and HGH (human growth hormone).
However, the old adage that one pound equates to 3,500 calories is right for fat but not muscle. If you want to gain one pound of fat, then you should be taking in an extra 3,500 calories per week. Now there's one way of putting on some weight!
The scientifically calculated average of 1 pound of muscle gain per week MAXIMUM for anyone includes this. But like I said, realistically you will be lucky to achieve 0.75 pounds of muscle gain per week. So, for example, if you're 150 pounds, and you want to be ripped at 185 pounds, that's 35 pounds have muscle to gain.
