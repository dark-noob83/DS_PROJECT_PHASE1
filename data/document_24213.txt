Homeobox gene: A gene containing a short DNA sequence of about 180 base pairs referred to as a homeobox. Homeobox genes encode proteins that bind and regulate the expression of DNA in multicellular organisms.
One of a group of genes with a common DNA sequence (a homeobox) that code for a homeodomain, and is involved in bodily segmentation and cell differentiation during embryonic development. Supplement. Hox gene is an example of a homeobox gene. The homeobox sequence codes for a 60 amino acid protein domain known as the homeodomain. The main role of homeodomain is to act as a switch that controls gene transcription. See also: Hox gene.

Hox is an abbreviation of homeobox, the name given to the region of DNA of 180 base pairs that codes for a protein domain called homeodomin. These are transcription factors that bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of genes. They are involved in a cascade of events that can turn genes on or off..
So note: homeobox genes are NOT Hox genes, Hox genes are a subset of homeobox genes. HOX cluster: The term Hox cluster refers to a group of clustered homeobox genes, named Hox genes in vertebrates, that play important roles in pattern formation along the anterior-posterior body axis.
DNA sequence (of about 180 base pairs) contained in a gene (e.g. hox gene), and code for a protein domain (of about 60 amino acids) that is highly conserved, and can bind to DNA to control gene expression. Supplement. An example of homeobox is the one found in homeotic genes.
Homeobox genes are a large family of similar genes that direct the formation of many body structures during early embryonic development. In humans, the homeobox gene family contains an estimated 235 functional genes and 65 pseudogenes (structurally similar genes that do not provide instructions for making proteins).
