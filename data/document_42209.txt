So, for example, 72 hours (3 days) is near the end of the time frame in which meth can be detected in saliva. It can be found as soon as 5-10 minutes after being used though. Meth can generally be detected in urine for 3-5 days after use. 2-5 hours after use the urine drug test detection period begins. A urine Meth Test is extremely accurate (more than 99%) and FDA Approved as well. Meth stays in your hair, however, for 90 days and longer (90 days is just the industry standard for a consumer hair drug test – labs can actually go back longer than that).
If an individual has used bennies or meth, the drug be detected in the urine for 48-72 hours. Methamphetamine can be detected for between 48-96 hours after use. The exact length of time that uppers can be detected is not an exact science.
