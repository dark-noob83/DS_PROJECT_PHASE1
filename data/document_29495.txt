The UK comes in sixth place, with people here consuming an average daily calorie intake of 3,440. Scroll down for video. Biggest eaters: A new infographic shows how many calories residents of various countries eat per day, with the U.S. coming in first place at 3,770 calories, followed closely by Austria at 3,760. The graph shows just how much the average American exceeds the recommended daily calorie intake. According to WebMD, women should consume about 2,000 calories per day while men should have no more than 2,40
Specific calorie needs are based on an athlete’s training regimen and their size. For example, researchers who conducted a study that was published in a 2009 edition of the “North American Journal of Sports Physical Therapy” found that the average energy intake of women collegiate swimmers is 3,229 calories per day. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 report that men ages 19 to 30 require 2,400 to 2,600 calories if they are sedentary, 2,600 to 2,800 calories if they are moderately active and about 3,000 calories each day if they are active. These are general calorie requirements, as individualized needs may vary.
Men should consume 6 to 10 percent more calories than women each day because they require more calories for the muscles to properly function and tend to burn a greater number of calories on average than women. Endurance athletes, particularly runners should consume more calories based on their body weight, gender and average amount of miles ran per day.
Recommended daily calorie intake varies from person to person, but there are guidelines for calorie requirements you can use as a starting point. UK Department of Health Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) are a daily calorie intake of 1940 calories per day for women and 2550 for men. How many calories are needed each day can vary greatly depending on lifestyle and other factors. In order to lose weight you need to eat less calories per day than your body needs. To lose 1lb a week you need a negative calorie balance of 500 calories per day. To lose weight at 2lb a week you need to reduce your calorie intake by 1000 calories a day.
Female Athletes. Since women athletes usually weigh less than male athletes, they generally require fewer calories as well. According to the University of Missouri, female athletes need about 20 to 23 calories per pound of body weight each day. This is equivalent to 2,600 to 2,990 calories a day for a 130-pound woman. However, women trying to increase muscle mass may need up to 27 calories per pound of body weight, which is equivalent to 3,510 calories per day for a 130-pound athlete, according to North Carolina State University.
The study, published in a 2009 edition of the “Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine,” reports that the average energy intake of elite Canadian athletes was 2,304 calories for women and 2,918 calories for men. However, women trying to increase muscle mass may need up to 27 calories per pound of body weight, which is equivalent to 3,510 calories per day for a 130-pound athlete, according to North Carolina State University.
On an average day, most human beings can properly fuel by eating the daily recommended intake of calories (2,000 - 2,500), fat (70g - 95g), carbohydrates (230g - 300g) and other nutrients. But elite athletes are a different breed. 
Consume more calories than your caloric expenditure in order to see muscle gain. For example, if you're a 150-pound man whose body fat is between 18 and 22 percent, you have a BMR of 1,620 calories. As a weightlifting athlete at the same weight, you should consume at least 2,120 calories per day to gain muscle. Endurance athletes, particularly runners should consume more calories based on their body weight, gender and average amount of miles ran per day.
