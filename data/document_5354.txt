A federated identity in information technology is the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems. The notion of identity federation is extremely broad, and also evolving. It could involve user-to-user and user-to-application as well as application-to-application use-case scenarios at both the browser tier as well as the web services or service-oriented architecture (SOA) tier.
Domain Namespace Requirements. To set up federated delegation for your on-premises Exchange 2010 organization, you must configure a domain proof of ownership record for any domains used for user e-mail accounts or for hosting user accounts in Microsoft Outlook Live or Microsoft Online Services. Step 2: Create TXT records for federated delegation. To provide proof of ownership of a registered Internet domain, you must create a text (TXT) record in the public Domain Name System (DNS) zone for each primary e-mail or SMTP proxy domain you want to federate.
In information technology (IT), federated identity management (FIdM) amounts to having a common set of policies, practices and protocols in place to manage the identity and trust into IT users and devices across organizations. The notion of identity federation is extremely broad, and also evolving. It could involve user-to-user and user-to-application as well as application-to-application use-case scenarios at both the browser tier as well as the web services or service-oriented architecture (SOA) tier.
SSO is a subset of federated identity management, as it relates only to authentication and is understood on the level of technical interoperability. The notion of identity federation is extremely broad, and also evolving. It could involve user-to-user and user-to-application as well as application-to-application use-case scenarios at both the browser tier as well as the web services or service-oriented architecture (SOA) tier.
Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is a software component developed by Microsoft that can be installed on Windows Server operating systems to provide users with single sign-on access to systems and applications located across organizational boundaries. This allows a system to provide controlled access to its resources or services to a user that belongs to another security realm without requiring the user to authenticate directly to the system and without the two systems sharing a database of user identities or passwords.
1 For example, adatum.com is the federated domain. 2  When you create a new user, you see that the default domain that's provided by Office 365 is listed as the first option in the drop-down box. 3  For example, the default domain is contoso.onmicrosoft.com. You create a new user in the Office 365 Admin Center in Office 365. However, when you try to assign a federated domain to the new user, the federated domain isn't listed in the user's list of domains. The following is an example scenario of what happens when you experience this issue: 1  In the Office 365 portal, single sign-on (SSO) and Active Directory synchronization are enabled

You can use the EMC or the Shell to configure domains for federated delegation. For detailed instructions, see Manage Federation. Step 4: Create an Autodiscover DNS record. You need to add an alias canonical name (CNAME) resource record to your public-facing DNS. Step 2: Create TXT records for federated delegation. To provide proof of ownership of a registered Internet domain, you must create a text (TXT) record in the public Domain Name System (DNS) zone for each primary e-mail or SMTP proxy domain you want to federate.
Related to federated identity is single sign-on (SSO), in which a user's single authentication ticket, or token, is trusted across multiple IT systems or even organizations. The notion of identity federation is extremely broad, and also evolving. It could involve user-to-user and user-to-application as well as application-to-application use-case scenarios at both the browser tier as well as the web services or service-oriented architecture (SOA) tier.
