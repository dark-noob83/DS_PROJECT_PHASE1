Slow Moving Gnats in Your House. The fungus gnat and the related fruit fly are drawn to yourhome because it is a welcoming environment. Also known as vinegar flies, thesegnats love the smell of rotten food, vinegar and overwatered plants.
Gnats and fruit flies are attracted to the smell of vinegar. Place some vinegar and sugar (dish washing detergent and vinegar also works) in a jar with a screw on cap. Punch holes in the cap like your childhood firefly jar large enough for the gnats to enter.
Make a homemade gnat trap. One easy way to rid yourself of a gnat infestation is with an easy and cheap do-it-yourself gnat trap. Find a used can or jar (Mason jars work especially well) and fill it with apple cider vinegar. Gnats are extremely attracted to the scent of vinegar.
I'm not a scientist, but I suspect the flies are attracted to the proteins that are in urine. They probably have learned to associate the smell with the benefit. I can't find any research on this, but that's my best guess. I think it is a sign of diabetes The sugar excreted in the urine attracts the flies.
You can trap and kill indoor fungus gnats and the related fruit fly with a simple homemade vinegar trap. It is important to do so before they lay their eggs. You should also elimate any decaying and rotten food and check other areas that food may accumulate.
Vinegar Soap. This is a great trick that attracts and then eliminates gnats. Fill a small dish with vinegar and then add a little dish soap. Because gnats are naturally attracted to the smell of vinegar they will be pulled right in. The residue of the soap will trap them into your dish, ending their days of annoying you. If you are hosting a party, or having over guests, make sure to replace the bowl often with fresh solution.
