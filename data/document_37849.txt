Foxglove flowers bloom in shades of white, pink and purple. When foxgloves (Digitalis purpurea) flower in early to midsummer, spikes of bell-shaped flowers make a bold statement in the garden. Plant foxgloves en masse in woodland gardens, cottage gardens and borders. When planted from seed, these biennials produce roots and leaves the first year but no flowers. During the second season, foxgloves produce a 2- to 5-foot-tall flower stalk and flowers.
Foxglove are showy, bell-shaped wildflowers native to the woods of northern Europe. Foxglove grow 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) tall and produce robust pink, purple, red, white and yellow blossoms.
Digitalis purpurea is a BIENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a medium rate. It is not frost tender.
How to Grow Foxgloves. Foxglove plants grow best in rich, well draining soil. Caring for foxglove plants will include keeping the soil moist. As a biennial or short lived perennial, the gardener can encourage re-growth of foxglove flowers by not allowing the soil to dry out or to get too soggy.
Tall and stately foxglove plants (Digitalis purpurea) have long been included in garden areas where vertical interest and lovely flowers are desired. Foxglove flowers grow on stems which may reach 6 feet in height, depending on variety.
