These values have mean of 17 and standard deviation of about 4.1. If instead we first calculate the range of our data as 25 – 12 = 13, and then divide this number by four we have our estimate of the standard deviation as 13/4 = 3.25.
By Courtney Taylor. The standard deviation and range are both measures of the spread of a data set. Each number tells us in its own way how spaced out the data are, as they are both a measure of variation. The range relies on a very simple formula of subtracting the minimum data value from the maximum.
When analysing normally distributed data, standard deviation can be used in conjunction with the mean in order to calculate data intervals. If = mean, S = standard deviation and x = a value in the data set, then. 1  about 68% of the data lie in the interval: . 2  about 95% of the data lie in the interval: + 2S. 3  about 99% of the data lie in the interval: + 3S.
Range is the the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of data. The Standard Deviation is a measure of how far the data points are spread out. One SD above and below the average represents about 68% of the data points (in a normal distribution).There is not a direct relationship between range and standard deviation.
The highest test score is 97 and the lowest is 67, therefore the range is 97-67 = 30. The standard deviation is another way to measure how close together the elements are in a set of data. The s.d. is the average distance between each data point and the mean.
The Range Rule. The range rule tells us that the standard deviation of a sample is approximately equal to one fourth of the range of the data. In other words s = (Maximum – Minimum)/4. This is a very straightforward formula to use, and should only be used as a very rough estimate of the standard deviation.
