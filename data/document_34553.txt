After six weeks, the nutritional value of the dog food is substantially lower than when the bag is first opened. To help you keep track, date the bag of dog food with a marker when you open it, and throw out any kibble remaining after six weeks. Never buy dog food with harmful artificial preservatives.
If you feed your dog wet food, don't let it stay out all day. Leave it out for about 20 minutes, then throw the rest away. Generally, he won't let any go to waste if he can help it. Tossing the food after 20 minutes helps prevent overeating and prevents it from spoiling in his dish.
Ideally, dry food should be consumed within six weeks of opening the bag, so pick your bag sizes appropriately. Kibble can be left out in bowls for a day or so, but make sure you donâ€™t offer more than what should be consumed in 24 hours.
Saving the Food. Not all dogs can or should eat an entire can of wet food in a single meal. When that's the case, you don't have to throw out the leftovers. Scoop out however much your dog should be eating from the can, then cover the can and refrigerate it until the next meal.
An unopened can of dog food can remain fresh for years when stored in a cool and dry location, but only buy the number of cans that can be used before they reach their best by dates. Once opened, canned food should be stored in the refrigerator for no longer than seven days.
Answer: The length of time you can leave canned cat food out depends on room temperature. In the summer, lacking air conditioning, I'd suggest leaving the food out no longer than 20 minutes, maximum. Likewise, in the winter, if the heater is on, or the food is in a warm kitchen, 20 minutes would apply.
Leaving It Out. If you feed your dog wet food, don't let it stay out all day. Leave it out for about 20 minutes, then throw the rest away. Generally, he won't let any go to waste if he can help it. Tossing the food after 20 minutes helps prevent overeating and prevents it from spoiling in his dish.
