Systematics – the systematic classification of organisms and the evolutionary relationships among them; taxonomy. Phylogeny – the evolutionary history of a group or lineage. Nomenclature – the system of scientific names applied to taxa (groups of organisms).
Evolutionary taxonomy, evolutionary systematics or Darwinian classification is a branch of biological classification that seeks to classify organisms using a combination of phylogenetic relationship (shared descent), progenitor-descendant relationship (serial descent), and degree of evolutionary change.
Evolutionary Systematics. Evolutionary Systematics, also called Gradistic Taxonomy, gives an a dynamic evolutionary slant to the static Linnean system. It is based on a combination of branching and divergence. Most old books on palaeontology were based on this paradigm.
