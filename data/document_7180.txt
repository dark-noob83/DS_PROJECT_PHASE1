In your first trimester, you will have a prenatal visit every month. The visits may be quick, but they are still important. It is OK to bring your partner or labor coach with you. During your visits, your doctor or midwife will: 1  Weigh you. 2  Check your blood pressure. 3  Check for fetal heart sounds.
At your first visit, your doctor or midwife will draw blood for a group of tests known as the prenatal panel. These tests are done to find problems or infections early in the pregnancy. This panel of tests includes, but is not limited to: 1  A complete blood count (CBC).
You'll get a blood test on your first prenatal visit. In your second trimester, you will get a blood test to check for diabetes and recheck your hemoglobin. If you are Rh negative, your antibodies will be rechecked. You may get other blood tests, depending on your preferences and health.
The first prenatal test for most moms-to-be is a simple do-it-yourself procedure: pee on a stick! And once that pink line (or plus sign or digital yes) on your at-home pregnancy test appears, you can look forward to nine more months of peeing on command for the purposes of science.
Report Abuse. On your first pregnancy appointment at the OB, they take what is called an Obstetric Panel. They test you for Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and HIV (and Sickle Cell if you are black). They also do your PAP cytology and run a urine culture to test for bacteria and a urine drug screen.
What the Test Does. When you first get pregnant, your doctor will take a blood sample. The lab will check for problems that could affect your baby. They include rubella, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, hepatitis B, many sexually transmitted diseases, and others.
