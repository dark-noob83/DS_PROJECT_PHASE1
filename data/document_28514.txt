At this time your hormone levels will decrease and your uterine lining will begin to shed about 12-16 days from ovulation. This is menstruation (menstrual period) and brings us back to day 1 of your cycle. The journey then begins all over again
If fertilization does not occur within 24 to 48 hours after ovulation, the egg disintegrates and is expelled with the uterus lining at the start of your next period, usually 12-16 days later.

The egg is fertilized by the sperms within 24 hours. The fertilized egg travels down the tube, sits around in there for about 3 days then heads to the uterus floating around looking for a nice cushion, finds it, and implants about five days after it heads out of the tubes. You ovulate once a month and the egg stays viable for 12-24 hours. If your trying to get pregnant, having sex before you ovulate makes conceiving more likely. Emily Â· 7 years ago. Thumbs up.
