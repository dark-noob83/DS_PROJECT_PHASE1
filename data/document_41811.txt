A New York City teacher was allegedly fired for using the word negro to describe a student in her Spanish class, which she claims was part of a lesson in translation.

A Bronx teacher has filed a lawsuit claiming she was fired for using the word 'negro' in class. 'Negro' is the Spanish word for the color black.
The term negro, literally meaning black, was used by the Spanish and Portuguese as a simple description to refer to the Bantu peoples that they encountered. From the 18th century to the late 1960s, negro (later capitalized) was considered to be the proper English-language term for people of black African origin.
The word Negro is used in the English-speaking world to refer to a person of black ancestry or appearance. Negro denotes black in Spanish and Portuguese, derived from the ancient Latin word niger, meaning black, which itself is probably from a Proto-Indo-European root *nekw- , to be dark, akin to *nokw- , night.
