Other scientists have argued that human beings originated in Africa before moving to other regions 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. Homo sapiens discovered in Middle Awash, Ethiopia, from 160,000 years ago were believed to be the oldest 'modern' human beings. Other remains previously found in Israeli caves are thought to have been more recent and 80,000 to 100,000 years old.
In paleoanthropology, the recent African origin of modern humans, or the out of Africa theory (OOA), is the most widely accepted model of the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans. However, the rate of interbreeding was found to be relatively low (1–10%) and other studies have suggested that the presence of Neanderthal or other archaic human genetic markers in modern humans can be attributed to shared ancestral traits originating from a common ancestor 500,000 to 800,000 years ago.
All people today are classified as Homo sapiens. Our species of humans first began to evolve nearly 200,000 years ago in association with technologies not unlike those of the early Neandertals. It is now clear that early Homo sapiens, or modern humans, did not come after the Neandertals but were their contemporaries. So far, the earliest finds of modern Homo sapiens skeletons come from Africa. They date to nearly 200,000 years ago on that continent. They appear in Southwest Asia around 100,000 years ago and elsewhere in the Old World by 60,000-40,000 years ago.
Until now, researchers believed that homo sapiens, the direct descendants of modern man, evolved in Africa about 200,000 years ago and gradually migrated north, through the Middle East, to Europe and Asia. Homo sapiens discovered in Middle Awash, Ethiopia, from 160,000 years ago were believed to be the oldest 'modern' human beings. Other remains previously found in Israeli caves are thought to have been more recent and 80,000 to 100,000 years old.
The findings of Professor Avi Gopher and Dr Ran Barkai of the Institute of Archeology at Tel Aviv University, published last week in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, suggest that modern man did not originate in Africa as previously believed, but in the Middle East. Homo sapiens discovered in Middle Awash, Ethiopia, from 160,000 years ago were believed to be the oldest 'modern' human beings. Other remains previously found in Israeli caves are thought to have been more recent and 80,000 to 100,000 years old.
1 Most of these point to Africa as the origin of this population. 2  DNA from contemporary humans can be used to produce maps of human movement throughout the world and show how long an indigenous population has lived in an area. 3  These indicate modern human origins in Africa. Although it is now known that interbreeding did occur between Neanderthals and some early modern humans, this is not on the scale that proponents of the Multiregional model claim. The amount of Neanderthal DNA found in some modern humans is too small to have made any significant difference.
Human ancestors are believed to have originated in middle Africa. Humans' skin color changed over time, because selection acted against some of the traits humans possess in re … lationship to the advantage of their survival and fitness. The term human, in the context of human evolution, refers to the genus Homo, but studies of human evolution usually include other hominins, such as the australopithecines.
Homo sapiens evolved in Africa around 150,000 years ago. The modern human, known as Homo sapiens sapiens, is a sub species of the original Home sapiens. We are constantly thinking about our origins. The first modern Humans came out of Africa 200,000 years ago. This theory believes that Homo sapiens sapiens evolved in Africa and were truly the first modern humans. (Lewin, 1987) They then moved North out of Africa for the second time around 60,000-45,000 years ago moving into other locations of the world
