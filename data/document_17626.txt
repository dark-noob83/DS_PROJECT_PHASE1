This tangle of blood vessels on the retinal surface is a crude attempt at vascularizing ischemic tissue. Retinal neovascularization lacks the bifurcating pattern of normal vessels. Poorly and hastily built, they bleed spontaneously or with minimal trauma.
The common causes of retinal neovascularization on or near the optic disc are diabetes, retinal vein occlusion, and radiation. Neovascularization in the peripheral retina (out of view of the direct ophthalmoscope) is most commonly caused by sickle cell disease and retinopathy of prematurity.
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) involves the growth of new blood vessels that originate from the choroid through a break in the Bruch membrane into the sub–retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) or subretinal space. CNV is a major cause of visual loss.

Both macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy can cause “blindness” from neovascularization. Both are diseases of the retina, both can lead to “blindness,” both increase with age/time and both can be associated with abnormal blood vessel formation known as “neovascularization.”.
