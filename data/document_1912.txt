Teeth and Bones-A History of X-Rays. An x-ray is a form of electromagnetic radiation and can produce an image of somethings internal composition, especially parts of the body. Today, x-rays are often used in hospitals and other medical facilities in helping to diagnose broken bones and other issues.
The First X-ray, 1895. The discovery of a new and mysterious form of radiation in the late 19th century led to a revolution in medical imaging. By Hannah Waters | July 1, 2011. Wilhelm Rontgen took this radiograph of his wife's left hand on December 22, 1895, shortly after his discovery of X-rays.

Another leap in X-ray technology came with the 1972 invention of the computed tomography scan (CAT scan) by Godfrey Hounsfield and Alan Cormack. The basic X-ray produces two-dimensional images that provide insights into the internal structure of the human body.
Medical X-rays. The images produced by X-rays are due to the different absorption rates of different tissues. Calcium in bones absorbs X-rays the most, so bones look white on a film recording of the X-ray image, called a radiograph. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less, and look gray.
It was soon discovered that Rontgenâ€™s Crookes tubes were unreliable and hindered the effectiveness of the X-ray. William Coolidge greatly contributed to the improvement of the X-ray with his 1913 invention of the Coolidge tube, which used a tungsten filament.
