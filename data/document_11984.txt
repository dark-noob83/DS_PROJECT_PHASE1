Introduction. Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is a method for assessing the total cost of facility ownership. It takes into account all costs of acquiring, owning, and disposing of a building or building system.
A life cycle cost analysis is a powerful tool used to make economic decisions for selection of building materials and design.
A life cycle cost analysis involves the analysis of the costs of a system or a component over its entire life span. Typical costs for a system may include: 1  Acquisition costs (or design and development costs).
A. Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) Method. The purpose of an LCCA is to estimate the overall costs of project alternatives and to select the design that ensures the facility will provide the lowest overall cost of ownership consistent with its quality and function.
Purpose. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is an important economic analysis used in the selection of alternatives that impact both pending and future costs. It compares initial investment options and identifies the least cost alternatives for a twenty year period.
Life cycle costing is a methodology for calculating the whole cost of a system from inception to disposal. The system will vary from industry to industry and could for instance be a building, a ship, a weapon system or a power station.
