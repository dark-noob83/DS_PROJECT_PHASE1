Farro is an ethnobotanical term derived from Italian Latin for a group of three wheat species: spelt (triticum spelta), emmer (triticum dicoccum), and einkorn (triticum monococcum) which are types of hulled wheat (wheat which cannot be threshed). Farro is a food composed of the grains of certain wheat species. The exact definition is debated. It is sold dried and is prepared by cooking in water until soft, but still crunchy (many recommend first soaking overnight).
Farro is a whole grain, much like other whole grains such as barley and wheat berries. While farro is a type of wheat, a few different kinds of wheat are sometimes called farro. Each type of farro, however, is a kind of wheat, so while farro is a whole grain, it is, never gluten-free.
