The endometrium is the inner layer lining the uterus. The uterus is an organ in the female pelvis, and it is where a baby grows and develops when a woman is pregnant. During pregnancy, the uterus undergoes an enormous increase in size.
Endometrial Cancer Overview. The endometrium is the tissue lining the inner cavity of the uterus (or womb). The uterus, a hollow organ about the size and shape of a pear, is found in a woman's pelvic region and is the organ where the fetus grows until birth.
The endometrium is the lining that is inside the uterus. It prevents the middle layer of the uterus, called the myometrium, from developing adhesions, and provides an area for the placenta to attach to the uterus during pregnancy. It consists of a layer of epithelial cells joined to the myometrium by connective tissue.
Endometrium and Cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. It is also called the neck of the uterus. The endometrium is the mucous membrane that lines the inside of the uterus (womb). The endometrium changes throughout the menstrual cycle. It becomes thick and rich with blood vessels to prepare for pregnancy. If the woman does not get pregnant, part of the endometrium is shed, causing menstrual bleeding.
The endometrium consists of a single layer of columnar epithelium plus the stroma on which it rests. The stroma is a layer of connective tissue that varies in thickness according to hormonal influences.
