Best Answer: A baby donkey is called a foal, regardless of gender, generally up to one year of age. Young male donkeys over the age of 1 are usually called a male jack or a male foal. Young female donkeys are called baby jenny or a female foal.
A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet;[3][4][5] a young donkey is a foal.[5] Jack donkeys are often used to produce mules. Asses were first domesticated around 3000 BC,[6] or 4000 BC, probably in Egypt or Mesopotamia,[7] and have spread around the world.
A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (called a jack) and a female horse (called a mare). Mules inherit desirable qualities from both donkeys and horses; from the horse they inherit strength and stamina, and like donkeys, mules are generally patient, sure-footed, intelligent and have an even temper.
Mules try their best to imitate the donkey's bray, but most have a unique sound that is a combination of the horse's whinny and the grunting of the wind-down of a bray. Most will start out-Whinee.....and end in -aw ah aw.
