It is often impossible to make a test perfectly fair, and each issue listed above may be more or less important for a particular test  but by considering each of these factors in how your test is designed, you can maximize the amount of useful information you get from the test. But all tests are not created equal. In order to figure out the real answers to such questions, you'll need to test your ideas in a fair way. Testing can help you pick the tastiest brand of chocolate chip, figure out why you're sneezing, or find out why your car won't start.
Conducting a fair test is one of the most important ingredients of doing good, scientifically valuable experiments. To insure that your experiment is a fair test, you must change only one factor at a time while keeping all other conditions the same. Scientists call the changing factors in an experiment variables. You conduct a fair test by making sure that you change one factor at a time while keeping all other conditions the same. For example, let's imagine that we want to measure which is the fastest toy car to coast down a sloping ramp.
The best way to make your a test a fair test, is simply repeat the test again and again until your answer for all the time's you repeated your test, is the same. Edit. Share to: Isaac McArdle. A fair test is, in short, a test with fair conditions. This means that each time the test is repeated, all of the conditions will be the same. That way, there is no advantage â€¦ /disadvantage to a set of results.

Doing a Fair Test. It is important for an experiment to be a fair test. You conduct a fair test by making sure that you change one factor at a time while keeping all other conditions the same. For example, let's imagine that we want to measure which is the fastest toy car to coast down a sloping ramp.
Question. In order to do an experiment, you need to have a science fair question that you are trying to answer. When you have a question in mind, you will want to identify an Independent Variable, your Dependent Variable(s), and your Controlled Variables. This is a very important step in order to make your science fair experiment valid. Put simply: Pick a some interesting aspect of your topic and choose a question about that which you can answer by doing a science fair experiment. When doing your experiment it will be very important for you to identify any Controlled Variables that might affect the outcome of you
So, for example, in your cookie test, you'd want to actually compare batches of cookies made with different brands of chocolate chips. You might also want to make a batch without any chocolate chips at all  just to make sure that the chocolate chips are really making a difference in the cookies' taste. But all tests are not created equal. In order to figure out the real answers to such questions, you'll need to test your ideas in a fair way. Testing can help you pick the tastiest brand of chocolate chip, figure out why you're sneezing, or find out why your car won't start.
1 The test measures what it claims to measure. 2  For example, a test of mental ability does in fact measure mental ability, and not some other characteristic. 3  The test is job-relevant. 4  In other words, the test measures one or more characteristics that are important to the job. 
The best way to make your a test a fair test, is simply repeat the test again and again until your answer for all the time's you repeated your test, is the same. Edit. Share to: JD Heyl.
