Pollination is the act of transferring pollen grains from the male anther of a flower to the female stigma. The goal of every living organism, including plants, is to create offspring for the next generation. One of the ways that plants can produce offspring is by making seeds. Pollen from the anthers of Flower 1 is deposited on the stigma of Flower 2. 0nce on the stigma, pollen may “germinate,” which means that a “ pollen tube ” forms on the sticky surface of the stigma and grows down into the ovule of the plant.

It's a rich source of calories and carbohydrates to provide you with a quick energy boost. Eating honey local to your region may even reduce the symptoms of annoying seasonal allergies. Wildflower Honey Basics. Bees collect nectar, which contains carbohydrates, from flowers and take it back to their hive. The nectar is partially digested into more simple sugars and stored in the honeycomb inside the hive.
Flower pollen is superior to bee pollen because it is pure and remains uncontaminated as it is transported for pollination; bee pollen, on the other hand, is contaminated with molds, spores, and bacteria as it is collected. Bees collect plant pollen from many different sources, then bring it back to the hive. So the major difference between bee pollen and flower pollen is that flower pollen extract is just the inside nutrients, not the outer shell; bee pollen contains the whole pollen grain, outer shell included.
Bee Pollen and Allergies. Ingesting flower pollen, on the other hand, is like eating just the nut inside of a walnut or pecan with the hard outer shell removed. Your system is able to absorb the full benefit of the nutrients inside. Since bee pollen contains the hard outer shell, people can be allergic to it. So the major difference between bee pollen and flower pollen is that flower pollen extract is just the inside nutrients, not the outer shell; bee pollen contains the whole pollen grain, outer shell included.
Pollen is created when plants produce flowers. It is the male germ seed (sperm) of plants. Pollination occurs when the pollen is carried by bees, butterflies, wind, or other means from the flower's stamen to the stigma of another flower's pistil. Fertilization results when the pollen reaches the pistil, the ovary of the plant. This is when a seed is created. Consider how life begins with pollen. Plant life begins with fertilization by microscopic pollen grains. Pollen is the transmitter of life, with more important bio-factors essential to life than any other nutrient source. Scientists have identified all 22 amino acids, 27 mineral salts, and many enzymes in pollen.
Explaining the differences between bee pollen and flower pollen. Flower pollen is created when plants produce flowers. It is the male germ seed (sperm) of plants. Pollination occurs when the pollen is carried by bees, wind, or other means from the flower's stamen to the stigma of another flower's pistil. So the major difference between bee pollen and flower pollen is that flower pollen extract is just the inside nutrients, not the outer shell; bee pollen contains the whole pollen grain, outer shell included.

Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male parts of a flower to the female parts of a flower of the same species, which results in fertilization of plant ovaries and the production of seeds. 
Raw wildflower honey or goldenrod honey is often used by pollen allergy sufferers to lessen their sensitivity to pollen by eating 1 to 2 tsp. of it each day. The idea is, that by introducing small amounts of pollen into their system by eating raw honey, a tolerance to pollen allergens is built up.
