Capillary circulation is the part of your overall blood circulatory system where oxygen, nutrients, and waste pass between your blood and parts of your body. Capillaries connect the arterial and venous circulatory subsystems. Capillaries are very small blood vessels.
How blood circulates. The blood moves around the body in the circulatory system. This is made up of blood vessels (tubes) called arteries, veins and capillaries. The blood keeps moving through these blood vessels because it is pumped by the heart. Arteries carry blood that is full of oxygen from the heart to all parts of the body.
Venous circulation is the part of your overall blood circulatory system that involves veins, like the vena cavae and pulmonary veins. Veins are blood vessels that carry blood to your heart. Veins have thinner walls than arteries. Veins can widen as the amount of blood passing through them increases.
Systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system which carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart.
Systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, through the arteries, to the capillaries in the tissues of the body. From the tissue capillaries, the deoxygenated blood returns through a system of veins to the right atrium of the heart.
The term circulation is most commonly associated with blood circulation in the body. Circulation is responsible for the action that moves nutrients, gases and wastes to and from cells, and helps stabilize body temperature and pH to maintain harmony. We cannot live without our blood circulating throughout our body.
Arterial Circulation (Arteries). Arterial circulation is the part of your overall blood circulatory system that involves arteries, like the aorta and pulmonary arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from your heart.
