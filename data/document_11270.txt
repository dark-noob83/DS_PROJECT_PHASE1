HealthDay Reporter. TUESDAY, May 21 (HealthDay News) -- Finding early signs of lung cancer was once next to impossible, but a new study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that screening with low-dose CT scans may help spot the beginnings of disease in high-risk patients.
People at high risk for lung cancer who benefit from annual screening with low-dose CT according to new guidelines published by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are between 55* and 80 years old, currently smoke or quit in the last 15 years, and smoked at least an estimated.
Screening means testing for a disease when there are no symptoms or history of that disease. Doctors recommend a screening test to find a disease early, when treatment may work better. The only recommended screening test for lung cancer is low-dose computed tomography (also called a low-dose CT scan, or LDCT).
In lung cancer screening, individuals who have a high risk of developing lung cancer but no signs or symptoms of the disease undergo low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scanning of the chest.
The type of low-dose CT scan that is recommended for lung cancer screening is a newer form of CT scan known as a low-dose spiral or helical CT scan. The low-dose spiral CT scan continuously rotates in a spiral motion and takes several 3-dimensional X-rays of the lungs.
A low-dose spiral CT (“cat”) scan is a type of medical test. It is used to look for early signs of lung cancer. If the test finds cancer, treatment can start early. But the test is not helpful for light smokers or people who quit smoking more than 15 years ago.
Compared to a conventional CT, the low-dose CT scan for lung cancer uses approximately 5 times less radiation. Depending on the size of the patient, a low-dose CT scan will typically deliver 1-4 millisieverts of radiation exposure. A conventional CT scan typically delivers between 5-20 millisieverts [4, 5].
