Remove stain that has not penetrated the wood with a clean cloth. Wipe in the direction of the grain using light to medium pressure to achieve even stain color. Note: For best results, do not allow cloth to become saturated with stain. Replace with a clean cloth as necessary.
Stains. When it simply has to be right, use the products that have made Minwax ® an American icon. Add colour and beauty to your wood—in oil or water-based stains. With Minwax ® wood stains, there's a colour for every style.
Do NOT use steel wool. Remove all sanding dust. Apply Minwax® Water Based Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner and allow to penetrate 1-5 minutes. This will help ensure even stain color penetration and reduce grain raising on soft and hard woods. Remove excess with a clean cloth.
The products that have made Minwax ® an American icon will add color and beauty to your wood – in oil or water-based stains. With Minwax ® wood stains, there's a color to suit every style.
When it comes to using Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner, the rule is easy: when in doubt, use it. All woods are unpredictable when you stain them. To avoid a case of blotchiness, first brush on a coat of Minwax® Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner.
Also, don't intermix use of an oil-based prestain with a water-based stain or, for that matter, water and oil-based stains and poly finish coats. Personally I like this product; I use it with Minwax oil-stains and Minwax oil-based wipe-on satin poly finish.
