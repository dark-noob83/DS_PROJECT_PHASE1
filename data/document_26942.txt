Gregor Mendel (1822-1884). Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. He deduced that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from each parent. Mendel tracked the segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits.
Synopsis. Gregor Mendel, known as the father of modern genetics, was born in Austria in 1822. A monk, Mendel discovered the basic principles of heredity through experiments in his monastery's garden.
Mendelâ€™s principles of inheritance. Mendel developed 3 principles of inheritance based on his experiments with pea plants. Gregor Mendel. Our understanding of how inherited traits are passed between generations comes from principles first proposed by Gregor Mendel in 1866.

Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk who discovered the basic principles of heredity through experiments in his garden. Mendel's observations became the foundation of modern genetics and the study of heredity, and he is widely considered a pioneer in the field of genetics.
Gregor Mendel's first principle of genetic inheritance. It states that, for any particular trait, the pair of genes of each parent separate (during the formation of sex cells) and only one gene from each parent passes on to an offspring. In other words, genes occur in pairs (because chromosomes occur in pairs).
