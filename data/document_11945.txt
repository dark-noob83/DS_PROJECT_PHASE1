the limiting position of a secant if such a limit exists is called the tangent tangent in mathematics 1 in geometry the tangent to a circle or sphere is a straight line that intersects the circle or sphere in one and only one point click the link for more information to the curve or surface at that point if it intersects the curve in two different points as in the secant of a circle circle closed plane curve consisting of all points at a given distance from some fixed point called the center a circle is a conic section cut by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone
the secant function is the reciprocal of the cosine function the abbreviation of secant is sec the cosecant function is the reciprocal of the sine function the abbreviation of cosecant is csc or cosec the cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function the abbreviation of cotangent is cot example given that and that θ is acute find without using a calculator the value of a sec θ b cot θ solution theta is in the first quadrant we can use pythagoras theorem to get the third side opposite sides adjacent sides and hypotenuse of a right triangle definition of cos sin tan csc sec cot you can use the mathway widget below to practice trigonometry or other math topics try the given examples or type in your own problem
a secant line is a straight line joining two points on a function see below it is also equivalent to the average rate of change or simply the slope between two points the average rate of change of a function between two points and the slope between two points are the same thing 
definition of secant 1 a straight line cutting a curve at two or more points 2 a straight line drawn from the center of a circle through one end of a circular arc to a tangent drawn from the other end of the arc 
definitions of tangent secant and cosecant let denote an angle definition the tangent of denoted is definition the secant of denoted is definition the cosecant of denoted is we summarize information about the domain and range of the six trig functions domain equals range equals 1 1 domain equals range equals 1 1 domain equals range equals domain equal
origin of secant geom any straight line intersecting a curve at two or more points trigonometry the reciprocal of the cosine specif the ratio of the hypotenuse to the adjacent side of a given acute angle in a right triangle 
definition of secant 1 a cutting dividing into two parts as a secant line 2 n a line that cuts another especially a straight line cutting a curve in two or more points 
in these lessons we will look at the reciprocal trigonometric functions secant cosecant and cotangent find the cosecant of an angle in a right triangle given any two sides of a right triangle you can find any of the 6 trigonometric ratios opposite sides adjacent sides and hypotenuse of a right triangle definition of cos sin tan csc sec cot you can use the mathway widget below to practice trigonometry or other math topics try the given examples or type in your own problem
the classical definition of the secant function for real arguments is the secant of an angle in a right angle triangle is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the adjacent leg this description of is valid for when this triangle is nondegenerate comparing the definition with the definition of the cosine function shows that the following formula can also be used as a definition of the secant function a quick look at the secant function here is a graphic of the secant function for real values of its argument
