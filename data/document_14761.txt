The ridge in the upper part of the picture is the high pressure of the upper esophageal sphincter which only opens for a short time to let water pass. Peristalsis is a radially symmetrical contraction and relaxation of muscles that propagates in a wave down a tube, in an anterograde direction. The large intestine does not use peristalsis to propel its contents, but general contractions. These occur one to three times per day in the large intestines and colon, and propel the chyme from the large intestine through the colon to the rectum.
Peristaltic movement comprises relaxation of circular smooth muscles, then their contraction behind the chewed material to keep it from moving backward, then longitudinal contraction to push it forward. Earthworms use a similar mechanism to drive their locomotion, and some modern machinery imitates this design. The large intestine does not use peristalsis to propel its contents, but general contractions. These occur one to three times per day in the large intestines and colon, and propel the chyme from the large intestine through the colon to the rectum.
GI Motitility In the Stomach. 1  Two types of movement (motility) occur in the stomach: peristalsis and segmentation (mixing). 2  The contractions occur about every 20 seconds and proceed from the body of the stomach toward the pyloric sphincter. 3  About 20% of the contractions in the stomach are peristaltic waves. When the motility is not appropriate for its specific function in digestion, it can cause symptoms such as bloating, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea which are associated with sensations such as pain, bloating, fullness, and urgency to have a bowel movement.

Segmentation contractions are a common type of mixing motility seen especially in the small intestine-segmental rings of contraction chop and mix the ingesta. Alternating contraction and relaxation of the longitudinal muscle in the wall of the gut also provides effective mixing of its contents. Early in life, children notice that strange gurgling sounds sporadically emanate from their stomachs, particularly in periods between meals. This simple observation reflects the fact that the digestive tube is quite muscular and that muscle contractions and motility are integral parts of digestive function.
Peristalsis is a distinctive pattern of smooth muscle contractions that propels foodstuffs distally through the esophagus and intestines. 1 One group of interneurons activates excitatory motor neurons above the bolus-these neurons, which contain acetylcholine and substance P, stimulate contraction of smooth muscle above the bolus. 2  Another group of interneurons activates inhibitory motor neurons that stimulate relaxation of smooth muscle below
1 Esophageal peristalsis results from sequential contraction of circular muscle, which serves to push the ingested food bolus toward the stomach. 2  Esophageal longitudinal muscle may also play a role in peristalsis. In addition, sequential contraction of longitudinal muscle also occurs during peristalsis. This serves to shorten the esophagus and increase the cross-sectional diameter, thereby facilitating bolus transport.
After food is chewed into a bolus, it is swallowed and moved through the esophagus. Smooth muscles contract behind the bolus to prevent it from being squeezed back into the mouth. Then rhythmic, unidirectional waves of contractions work to rapidly force the food into the stomach. The large intestine does not use peristalsis to propel its contents, but general contractions. These occur one to three times per day in the large intestines and colon, and propel the chyme from the large intestine through the colon to the rectum.
Gastrointestinal motility refers to the contraction of the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal tract is commonly divided into 5 parts: the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (colon). When the motility is not appropriate for its specific function in digestion, it can cause symptoms such as bloating, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea which are associated with sensations such as pain, bloating, fullness, and urgency to have a bowel movement.

Food is propelled through the small intestine by peristalsis, which is a wavelike series of muscular contractions. You might recall that peristalsis is also how food moves through the esophagus as it travels from the throat to the stomach. Segmentation is a localized contraction of circular smooth muscles that constricts the intestine into segments. Pendular movements are alternating contraction and relaxation of the longitudinal muscles causing a portion of the small intestine to shorten and lengthen.

Control of peristalsis in the smooth muscle segment of the esophagus is more complicated than in the adjacent striated muscle segment. In the latter, the central nervous system not only initiates the primary and secondary peristaltic wave, but also completely controls the sequential nature of the contraction. In addition, sequential contraction of longitudinal muscle also occurs during peristalsis. This serves to shorten the esophagus and increase the cross-sectional diameter, thereby facilitating bolus transport.
