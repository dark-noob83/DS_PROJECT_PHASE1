Step 1: Determine how long to recharge a battery by calculating how much capacity your battery has. For example, an Interstate battery with the part number MT-34 has 120 minutes reserve capacity (RC). In order to calculate the amount of amp-hours in a battery, multiply the reserve capacity by 0.6.
A jump start isn't the only way to recharge a car battery, and it's not necessarily the best way. You can recharge a car battery when your car refuses to start. On average, most batteries do not require a recharge for at least five years. That's if you're taking good care of your car.

The more discharged that a battery is, then the longer it will take to recharge it. Usually it takes several hours to effectively recharge a battery. If a battery is very discharged then it can take up to 12 hours or mor
Idling a car for 5-10 minutes will not recharge a battery. It MIGHT replace a bit of the charge lost to starting it in the first place, but even that is iffy. The alternator in your car will need to hit, roughly, 2000 engine rpm to push a charge back to the battery. Keep the top of the battery clean, not just the posts.
In order to recharge your car battery while driving you will need to operate the vehicle over 1,000 RPM’s for a sustained period of time. The longer the battery has been dead, the longer it will take to fully recharge it. However, by driving for at least a half an hour at 1,000 RPM’s, you should charge your battery enough that you will be able to restart the vehicle once you turn it off.
