SEARCH. The perimetrium, the myometrium, and the endometrium are layered accordingly to create the wall of the uterus. A thin, visceral peritoneum creates the outer serosal layer of the perimetrium. The broad ligament runs and creates a continuation right along the lateral segment of the uterine wall. 
The uterus is a female reproductive organ located between the bladder and the rectum, in the pelvic area. The uterus has three layers: the inner lining (endometrium); the middle muscular layer (myometrium); and the outer layer (perimetrium). The uterus is connected to the fallopian tubes, the cervix, and (via the cervix) the vagina. The main purpose of the uterus is to nourish a fetus prior to birth. In menstruating females, the ovaries release eggs that travel via the fallopian tubes to the uterus. If fertilized, the eggs will bind themselves to the wall of the uterus and the fetus will develop. The uterus nourishes and protects the fetus until birth. The myometrium layer assists with labor in pushing the baby out of the uterus via the cervix and
Fibroids are muscular tumors that grow in the wall of the uterus (womb). Another medical term for fibroids is leiomyoma (leye-oh-meye-OH-muh) or just myoma. Fibroids are almost always benign (not cancerous). Fibroids can grow as a single tumor, or there can be many of them in the uterus. 
Uterine Endometrium. The wall of the uterus has a thin inner layer called the endometrium. In the absence of pregnancy, this layer is largely shed each month when menstrual flow begins. The uterine wall also has a thick muscular layer called the myometrium. 
Adenomyosis, also referred to as “uterine endometriosis,” is a benign disease confined to the uterine muscle. Endometrial cells from the lining of the endometrial cavity, migrate from that lining, most commonly into the posterior side or back wall of the uterus. As these cells respond to monthly hormonal changes, blood can get trapped in the myometrium producing a hard and enlarged uterus.
The cervix (or neck of the uterus) is the link between the uterus and the vagina (or birth canal) and is found at the top of the vagina. It is a firm, smooth, rounded structure with a central opening which: 1  dilates (opens up) during labour. 2  allows menstrual blood to flow through it during your periods. 
The uterus, also commonly known as the womb, is a hollow muscular organ of the female reproductive system that is responsible for the development of the embryo and fetus during pregnancy. The walls of the body are much thicker than those of the cervix as they provide for the protection and support of the developing fetus and contain the muscles that propel the fetus out of the mother’s body during childbirth. Superior to the body is a domed region known as the fundus of the uterus.
The uterus (from Latin uterus, plural uteri) or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals, including humans. One end, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes, depending on the species. The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, attaches to a wall of the uterus, creates a placenta, and develops into a fetus (gestates) until childbirth. Due to anatomical barriers such as the pelvis, the uterus is pushed partially into the abdomen due to its expansion during pregnancy.
Uterine wall. uterine wall-the wall of the uterus. uterus (Also called the womb .) - the uterus is a hollow, pear-shaped organ located in a woman's lower abdomen, between the bladder and the rectum, ... After my uterine wall gets to the desired thickness, we'll schedule an FET. What it is: A uterine rupture occurs when a weakened spot on your uterine wall-almost always the site of a previous uterine surgery such as a C-section or fibroid removal-tears due to the strain put on it during labor and delivery.
