1) Benzene and its derivatives. 2) Hydrocarbon compounds in which the carbon atoms are connected by a ring structure that is planar and joined by sigma and pie bonds between the carbon atoms. An example of an aromatic compound is benzene, C6H6.
1. aromatic hydrocarbon-a hydrocarbon that contains one or more benzene rings that are characteristic of the benzene series of organic compounds. benzene, benzine, benzol-a colorless liquid hydrocarbon; highly inflammable; carcinogenic; the simplest of the aromat
An aromatic hydrocarbon or arene (or sometimes aryl hydrocarbon) is a hydrocarbon with sigma bonds and delocalized pi electrons between carbon atoms forming rings.
The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, benzene. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be monocyclic (MAH) or polycyclic (PAH). Some non-benzene-based compounds called heteroarenes, which follow Hueckel'hückel s (rule for monocyclic: rings when the number of its-π electrons equals+4n, 2 where=n,0,1,2.......), 3 are also called aromatic. compounds
