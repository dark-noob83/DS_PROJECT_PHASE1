No Sugar Homemade Taco Seasoning. 4 5. This is a great starter base, however I think it needed to be more spicy so I added 1/4 tsp (approx.) of ground cayenne pepper. I also added some dried minced onion as well. One batch seasoned 2 lbs. of ground beef.

Cinnamon is a low carb spice that fights carb cravings, reduces blood sugar and LDL cholesterol levels, and promotes healthier circulation. Cinnamon also prevents the metabolic syndrome commonly seen in pre-diabetics.
