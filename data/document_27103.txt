I think caricatures and cartoons are the same thing. The difference between the two that I see is this: a caricature is simply a cartoon of someone or something that the viewer can recognize as a specific someone or something. As soon as someone known by the viewer is seen in a cartoon, it becomes a caricature. Here's an example to the right. This is a cartoon of a basketball. If you take that basketball and draw a stovepipe hat on it and give it a beard, it goes from a cartoon of a basketball to a caricature of Abraham Lincoln.
In a caricature, like a portrait, the likeness is also achieved by drawing the features as they really look… but you change the relationship of the features based on your perceptions of the face. The relationships you change are as I listed before: distance, size and angle. February 14th, 2008 | Posted in Tutorials. This series of “How to Draw Caricatures” tutorials are a just a small taste of a larger and much more in-depth book I wrote called The Mad Art of Caricature!
A caricature is a type of drawing, or illustration, that is cartoonish in nature. Many caricatures are drawings of people, but they can also be drawings of places or things. Unlike regular drawings or portraits, caricatures are generally distorted somewhat. Usually, the main flaws in the subject are grossly over-exaggerated, but the subject is usually still recognizable.
And What You Need to Draw. Knowing 'what is a caricature' is the first thing you're going to need to understand in order to create some nice looking drawings. A caricature is really a marriage between portrait drawing in cartoon drawing. The difference between caricature and portrait drawing is that the proportions of the face are a lot cartoonier and the style is much simpler. The features of the face become exaggerated in order to give a more funny appearance.

A caricature is a rendered image showing the features of its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way. In literature, a caricature is a description of a person using exaggeration of some characteristics and oversimplification of others. Caricatures can be insulting or complimentary and can serve a political purpose or be drawn solely for entertainment. While the first book on caricature drawing to be published in England was Mary Darly's A Book of Caricaturas (c. 1762), the first known North American caricatures were drawn in 1759 during the battle for Quebec. These caricatures were the work of Brig.-Gen.
