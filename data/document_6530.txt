Venus revolves or orbits around the Sun once every 0.615 Earth years, or once every 224.7 Earth days. Venus travels at an average speed of 78,341 miles per hour or 126,077 kilometers per hour in its orbit around the Sun. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos. 2  Learn how. 
A planet's day is the time it takes the planet to rotate or spin once on its axis. Venus rotates much more slowly than Earth does, so a day on Venus is much longer than a day on Earth. A day on Venus lasts for 243 Earth days or 5,832 hours! A day on Earth is 23.943 hours. Venus also rotates backwards compared to the Earth and most of the other planets. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmo
Current space probes use various orbital paths to reach Venus, taking from 1 to 3 years. Manned missions such as the Apollo trip to the Moon would require 1 to 3 months at a minimum, to reach the planet's orbit. At the maximum velocity of any current spacecraft, a direct flight would require between 30 and 120 days, depending on Venus's position in its orbit.
by Fraser Cain on November 4, 2009. Venus orbits closer to the Sun than Earth, and so it takes less time to orbit the Sun. In fact, Venus takes only 224.7 days to orbit the Sun. Compare this with the Earth, which takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun. This means that a year on Venus lasts only 62% the length of a year on Earth. Unlike most of the planets in the Solar System, Venus has almost no axial tilt. Furthermore, its orbit is one of the most circular in the Solar System.
Venus takes 224.7 Earth days to travel around the sun. It makes its closest approach to Earth about once every 584 days, when the planets catch up to one another. On average, it is 25 million miles (40 million km) away at this point, though it can reach as close as 24 million miles (38 million km). On average, the distance to Venus from the sun is 67 million miles (108 million km). At its closest (perihelion), it is only 66.7 million miles away (107 million km); at its farthest (aphelion), only 67.7 million miles (108.9 million km) separate the two.
The closest Venus comes to Earth in its orbit around the Sun is about 25 million miles. If you were traveling to Venus in a rocket ship at a speed of 25,000 mil … es per hour, it would take you 1000 hours to get there, or 41.66 days. Manned missions such as the Apollo trip to the Moon would require 1 to 3 months at a minimum, to reach the planet's orbit. At the maximum velocity of any current spacecraft, a direct flight would require between 30 and 120 days, depending on Venus's position in its orbit.
Venus orbits the sun in approximately 225 Earth days. (224.70069 days) Strange as it may seem, Venus rotates so slowly that a day on Venus is longer than its year. It take … s Venus about 243 Earth days to spin once on its axis. The slow rotation is also in a retrograde (clockwise) direction, from east to west. Manned missions such as the Apollo trip to the Moon would require 1 to 3 months at a minimum, to reach the planet's orbit. At the maximum velocity of any current spacecraft, a direct flight would require between 30 and 120 days, depending on Venus's position in its orbit.
Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. 
The first spacecraft ever launched towards Venus was the Soviet Venera 1 spacecraft. It was launched on February 12, 1961 on course to Venus. Unfortunately, scientists lost contact with the spacecraft on February 17th. So that calculates to 110 days from launch to arrival at Venus. The most recent spacecraft to fly to Venus was ESA’s Venus Express. It was launched on November 9th, 2005, and took 153 days to make the journey to Venus.
The distance between Venus and Earth varies considerably because of their respective orbits. - At its closest point, Venus is about 38 million kilometres (23.7 million miles) from Earth. - At its farthest point, it is 261 million kilometres (162 million miles) from Earth. (see the related link).
