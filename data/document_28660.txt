When invertase is added to the sucrose solution, or when lactase is added to the lactose solution, the concentration of glucose should increase over time as the sugars are converted to glucose. However, after some amount of time, the concentration of glucose will appear to remain the same, or plateau. 
1- Lactose has no Fructose, instead is made up of the essential sugar Galactose. Milk sugar aka lactose has been shown to be very beneficial for the human body though. Unlike sucrose, lactose is made up of glucose and galactose. These sugars are the reason why lactose is a healthy sugar. **A Lactose molecule is made of 2 sugars glucose and galactose**. Lately there’s been a lot of talk these days about how sugar is bad for you. In fact, I recently wrote about the negative effects of sugar.
• Sucrose is produced from a glucose and a fructose molecule. Lactose is produced from a glucose and a galactose molecule. • Sucrose is the abundant sugar in fruits and vegetables, whereas lactose is abundant in milk. • Lactose is a reducing sugar, whereas sucrose is not. • Therefore, sucrose doesn’t answer to the Benedict’s test o Fehling’s test. Glucose, galactose, and fructose are monosaccharides. Disaccharides are formed by combining two monosaccharide molecules. This is a condensation reaction where a water molecule is eliminated. Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are few examples for di
Sucrose Chemistry. Like lactose, sucrose is a disaccharide. It's made up of the smaller sugar units glucose and fructose. As with lactose, you must break sucrose into its constituent units in the small intestine prior to absorption; your body can't absorb sucrose directly. The Difference Between Lactose & Sucrose. Sucrose is table sugar, while lactose is milk sugar. Lactose and sucrose are both common kinds of sugar that feature prominently in the typical American diet. Though chemically similar in many regards, your body digests them differently, using different digestive enzymes.
Sucrose is a disaccharide, meaning that it's made up of two smaller sugar units, called monosaccharides, that are chemically bonded together. In their book Biochemistry, Drs. Reginald Garrett and Charles Grisham explain that sucrose consists of a glucose and a fructose ring chemically linked together. Lactose and sucrose are both carbohydrates, which is one of the classes of macronutrient compounds. Humans require macronutrients -- carbohydrates, proteins, and fats -- in relatively large quantities, because they provide cells with energy.
Sugar cane is a natural source of sucrose, or table sugar. Sucrose, glucose and fructose are important carbohydrates, commonly referred to as simple sugars. Sugar is found naturally in whole foods and is often added to processed foods to sweeten them and increase flavor. Sucrose is commonly known as table sugar, and is obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets. Fruits and vegetables also naturally contain sucrose. When sucrose is consumed, the enzyme beta-fructosidase separates sucrose into its individual sugar units of glucose and fructose.
Glucose and fructose are monosaccharides and are the building blocks of sucrose, a disaccharide. Thus, disaccharides are just a pair of linked sugar molecules. They are formed when two monosaccharides are joined together and a molecule of water is removed -- a dehydration reaction. Sucrose is commonly known as table sugar, and is obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets. Fruits and vegetables also naturally contain sucrose. When sucrose is consumed, the enzyme beta-fructosidase separates sucrose into its individual sugar units of glucose and fructose.
Sucrose or HFCS is a disaccharide sugar, which is made up of two sugar molecules – Glucose and Fructose. Glucose is a natural sugar that your body needs. This is energy that is used by the cells so they can function correctly. Glucose has been considered to be a healthy, non-toxic sugar to the human body. These sugars are the reason why lactose is a healthy sugar. **A Lactose molecule is made of 2 sugars glucose and galactose**. Lately there’s been a lot of talk these days about how sugar is bad for you. In fact, I recently wrote about the negative effects of sugar.
Lactose is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. It is a disaccharide made up of glucose and galactose. Much attention is given to lactose since it is the component of dairy to which many people are intolerant. The body produces an enzyme called lactase which is supposed to break down any lactose consumed. Sucrose. Many disaccharides exist, but the most important for humans are sucrose, maltose and lactose. Sucrose, or table sugar, is a disaccharide formed when the monosaccharides glucose and fructose are linked together. It is found naturally in fruits and vegetables, but is most commonly obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets. Sucrose is used commercially as a sweetener for many different types of foods
