1 ton of coal costs $36 = $0.006 per KWH. 1 barrel of oil costs $70 = $0.05 per KWH. 1 cubic foot of gas $0.008 = $0.03 per KWH. In comparison to solar energy, the hydrocarbon fuel costs are significantly lower without rebates, tax benefits nor the cost of carbon emissions. A two–Kilowatt (KW) solar energy system costs about $45,000 and covers roughly half of a typical American household’s energy needs. Average solar energy system costs = $8.95 per watt. In order to compare the solar energy costs to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, we must covert the $8.95 per into KWH. Let’s make two calculations to measure the total electric energy output over the lifespan of the solar energy system.
Based on these assumptions, the levelized cost of solar today – without any incentives – varies from around $0.19 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in Los Angeles to $0.29 per kWh in Seattle. For more discussion on the cost of solar, see the Appendix or for some context, see the Sensitivity Analysis. The levelized cost of solar is calculated with the following assumptions. First, we use an installed cost for residential solar power of $4.00 per Watt. This number may seem low, as the average cost of residential solar installations in mid-2011 was $6.40.
At $45,000, a solar energy system equates to $9,000 a kilowatt. The $9,000 per KW for solar is not very helpful in comparing electric generation costs to other fuels like coal or gas. Since coal, oil, and gas can be measured on a cost per KWH, we should measure solar costs on a KWH basis. Average solar energy system costs = $8.95 per watt. In order to compare the solar energy costs to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, we must covert the $8.95 per into KWH. Let’s make two calculations to measure the total electric energy output over the lifespan of the solar energy system.
So, for example, if you use 10 kilowatt-hours a day, and the cost of power is about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, then you electrical costs would be about $1 per day (ten times 10 cents), or $30 per month. Also, we need to know how long the sun shines each day on average. Let this be denoted by Tsun, We will specify energy in units of kilowatt-hours: Energy = Power (in kilowatts) x Time (in hours) = # of kilowatt-hours. A good target for Eused for an energy efficient home is 10 kilowatt-hours. Electrical energy from the grid in the United States typically costs between 6 to 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.
The chart compares the cost of a residential solar installation to the cost of electricity for a residential property. The numbers are national averages, and do not reflect the wide variation in the cost of electricity (from $0.067 per kWh in Seattle to over $0.170 per kWh in New York City, for example). The levelized cost of solar is calculated with the following assumptions. First, we use an installed cost for residential solar power of $4.00 per Watt. This number may seem low, as the average cost of residential solar installations in mid-2011 was $6.40.
To achieve this goal, SunShot works to lower the price of solar electricity to $0.06 per kilowatt hour (KWh) -- a cost target that will make solar-generated power to be fully cost-competitive with traditional energy sources by the end of the decade. Since SunShot’s inception, the average price per kWh of a utility-scale PV project has dropped from about $0.21 to $0.11. Take a look at the interactive graph above, breaking down the falling cost of utility-scale PV over the past three years.
An $18,000 system ($12,600 after the tax credit) that produces 3800 kWh a year in a windy place with 12mph avg. windspeed will produce 76,000 kWh over its 20-year life, for a cost of $0.17 per kWh. That's much more than grid energy, and way more than solar. Wind power resources: Here's a quieter wind turbine, since many models are fairly loud. Average wind speed by city, and a wind map of the U.S. You need avg. windspeed of about 12mph (5.5 meters per second) to make wind power approach cost-effective.
Under this measure coal cost less than$0.01 per KWH. In comparison, a barrel of oil at $70/barrel produces 1,700 KWH at a cost approximately $0.05 per KWH. Let’s provide some measures to understand energy costs. Average solar energy system costs = $8.95 per watt. In order to compare the solar energy costs to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, we must covert the $8.95 per into KWH. Let’s make two calculations to measure the total electric energy output over the lifespan of the solar energy system.
The chart at the left shows the average cost of electricity for 2014 by consumer group per the EIA (the US Energy Information Administration). For 2014 the average residential cost was 12.50 cents per kilo-watt hour up 3.1% from 2013. Commercial was 10.75 cents and industrial 7.01 cents. Assuming an average 2015 residential electricity price in AZ of $.125 per kWh (excluding taxes and fees) yields a yearly savings of $1,006.25 (8,050 x $.125 not counting future inflation). The monthly savings would then be $83.85 ($1,006.25 divided by 12). This was rounded to $84.00 even.
