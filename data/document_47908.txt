It was prepared by thawing, then re-heating in the oven at 325 deg. for 90 minutes, then stuck in the fridge after the meal. We'd like to make some ham sandwiches this Sunday, which is 7 days of storage.

Cooked ham has been cured before so it can be left in the fridge for 4 - 5 days, but to be on the safe side it's best to have your ham, then cut off what you may want from the next nights meal and then slice the rest of the ham up and freeze.
You can help keep it fresh longer by storing it in your refrigerator immediately after use. Once prepared, it should be stored in a tightly closed container to keep out moisture and other contaminants. For a long-term option, you can freeze your ham while preserving its taste if you use a freezer safe container.

Sealed, prepackaged, fresh pork cuts can be kept in the refrigerator 2 to 4 days; sealed ground pork will keep in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. If you do plan on keeping fresh pork longer than 2 to 3 days before cooking it, store it well-wrapped in the freezer.
