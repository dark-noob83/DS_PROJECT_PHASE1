1 A rising heart rate does not cause your blood pressure to increase at the same rate. 2  Even though your heart is beating more times a minute, healthy blood vessels dilate (get larger) to allow more blood to flow through more easily. 3  When you exercise, your heart speeds up so the blood can reach your muscles.
When heart rate is high (out of normal range 60-100 beats per minute), there is no time for the heart to fill with blood (preload) resulting in low stroke volume; therefore, reduced blood pressure. Remember, the heart spends more time in diastolic (preload time) than systolic (contraction of the heart).
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: There are two components of 'blood pressure'. The first is diastolic pressure (Pd) which is essentially unrelated to heart rate directly, (that is, the heart rate does NOT affect diastolic pressure). There is no mathematical connection between heart rate and Pd.
High blood pressure makes the heart work harder, contributes to hardening of the arteries, and increases the frequency of angina (chest pain that is the heart's response to a lack of oxygen), as well as the risk of heart attack and stroke. Have your blood pressure checked.
