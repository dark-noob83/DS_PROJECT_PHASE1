Most feeders/finishers are slaughtered at around 18 to 24 months of age, however finisher cattle are slaughtered according to a particular target finish weight they have to reach, not by their age. This is because there are variations in how cattle are finished due to their breeding, genetics and sex. Continentals will take a shorter time to finish because they tend to reach target weight much sooner due to their high growth rates, and may be ready for slaughter by the time they are 12 to 18 months of age.

· just now. Report Abuse. Cattle are bred at the age of 15 months, and have their first calf at 2 years of age, at which time they begin to produce milk. Dairy cows are not slaughtered until they are too old to produce milk, which at our farm is usually after at least 5 lactations (or a little more than 5 years).
Several factors come into play when determining the proper age of cattle ready for slaughter, such as the current market, breed characteristics, and the degree of finish, or fat on the animal. Old cattle (bulls and cows), commonly referred to as canners or cutters, are generally slaughtered promptly after purchase.
