Eukaryotic DNA Replication. Unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a large amount DNA. Therefore, the replication of DNA in eukaryotes are quite complex and involve many biological processes. Since the DNA amount is large, there are few origins of replication points, which form the bubbles. The replication in the prokaryotic chromosome begins at the origin of replication. At the beginning of replication, enzyme breaks the hydrogen bonds between the two parent strands of DNA at the origin of replication, establishing the replication fork.
1 Most archaea have a single circular molecule of DNA, and several origins of replication along this circular chromosome. 2  Eukaryotes often have multiple origins of replication on each linear chromosome that initiate at different times (replication timing), with up to 100,000 present in a single human cell. In other eukaryotes, including humans, the DNA sequences at the replication origins vary. Despite this sequence variation, all the origins form a base for assembly of a group of proteins known collectively as the pre-replication complex (pre-RC):
1 Eukaryotes often have multiple origins of replication on each linear chromosome that initiate at different times (replication timing), with up to 100,000 present in a single human cell. 2  Having many origins of replication helps to speed the duplication of their (usually) much larger store of genetic material. In other eukaryotes, including humans, the DNA sequences at the replication origins vary. Despite this sequence variation, all the origins form a base for assembly of a group of proteins known collectively as the pre-replication complex (pre-RC):
The origin of replication (also called the replication origin) is a particular sequence in a genome at which replication is initiated. This can either involve the replication of DNA in living organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes, or that of DNA or RNA in viruses, such as double-stranded RNA viruses. In other eukaryotes, including humans, the DNA sequences at the replication origins vary. Despite this sequence variation, all the origins form a base for assembly of a group of proteins known collectively as the pre-replication complex (pre-RC):
Replication origin sequences vary among metazoans, but the functions of proteins that bind replication origins are conserved. Eukaryotic origins exhibit a modular structure. Modularity is detectable in single‐cell eukaryotes such as yeast and is more pronounced in metazoans, in which replication origins often cluster. Eukaryotic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication begins at specific genomic sites called replication origins that serve as assembly sites for prereplication complexes (preRCs).
The origin of replication (also called the replication origin) is a particular sequence in a genome at which replication is initiated. This can either involve the replication of DNA in living organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes, or that of DNA or RNA in viruses, such as double-stranded RNA viruses. Each budding yeast origin consists of a short (~11 bp) essential DNA sequence (called the ARS consensus sequence or ACS) that recruits replication proteins. In other eukaryotes, including humans, the DNA sequences at the replication origins vary.

Eukaryotic DNA replication is a conserved mechanism that restricts DNA replication to only once per cell cycle. Eukaryotic DNA replication of chromosomal DNA is central for the duplication of a cell and is necessary for the maintenance of the eukaryotic genome. DNA replication is the action of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original template strand. To synthesize DNA, the double-stranded DNA is unwound by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases, forming a replication fork containing two single-stranded templates.
DNA replication is initiated from specific sequences called origins of replication, and eukaryotic cells have multiple replication origins. To initiate DNA replication, multiple replicative proteins assemble on and dissociate from these replicative origins. DNA replication is the action of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original template strand. To synthesize DNA, the double-stranded DNA is unwound by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases, forming a replication fork containing two single-stranded templates.
IntroductionAt the onset of S phase, eukaryotic cells initiate DNAreplication at speciﬁc sites, origins of DNA replication, that arefound throughout the genome. How cis-and trans-actingregulators interact to promote the initiation of DNA replicationis best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae.
