DEFINITION of 'Itemized Deduction'. A deduction from a taxpayer's taxable adjusted gross income that is made up of deductions for money spent on certain goods and services throughout the year.
Itemized deductions are subject to certain restrictions; for example, some expenses must exceed a certain percentage of the adjusted gross income to be deductible.
Itemized Deduction. A deduction from one's taxable income as the result of a specific expense the taxpayer has had over the course of the tax year. Most medical expenses, for example, may be deducted from one's taxable income. The same is the case for interest on mortgages and business expenses.
In order to claim itemized deductions, you must file your income taxes using Form 1040 and list your itemized deductions on Schedule A. You cannot file your taxes using Forms 1040A or 1040EZ if you want to itemize your deductions; only the standard deduction can be taken on these shorter forms.
Alternative minimum tax implications. If you are subject to the alternative minimum tax, some or all of the itemized deductions that you claim may be reduced or eliminated. For example, your medical and dental expenses deduction is reduced and you cannot deduct the interest on home equity loans.
An incurred expense which reduces an individual's taxable income, in accordance with IRS regulations (specifically, such deductions are usually limited to 2% of adjusted gross income). Examples include mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable gifts, and medical deductions.
Usually, an itemized deduction is limited to a certain percentage of adjusted gross income. As an alternative to standard deduction, an itemized deduction requires taxpayers to keep track of each possible tax-reducing expense throughout the year.
