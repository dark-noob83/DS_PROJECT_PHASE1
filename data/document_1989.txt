The interpretation of a mixed DNA profile generated with any number of kits for the amplification of nuclear autosomal DNA can be simple and straightforward under the following scenario: 1  the DNA is from only two sources; and. 2  the two sources are unrelated and have no or few shared alleles; and.
Complex mixtures, which are defined here as biological samples containing DNA with three or more contributors, exhibit several significant challenges. First, allele sharing will occur at many of the loci tested, making it challenging to unambiguously discern the full genotypes of the mixture contributors.
A 9:1 mixture of DNA from two sources. 0.5ng of total DNA from a 9:1 mixture of DNA from the same two sources as in Figure 1 were amplified with the Promega PowerPlexÂ® 16 HS System and processed as in Figure 1. All alleles from both the major DNA source and minor DNA source are present.
DNA is a very large chemical compound, deoxyribonuclelic acid. DNA makes up every part of human and animal body chemistry.
Focus Area: Identity Knowledge. Description: Terrorists and criminals frequently leave DNA evidence at crime scenes or other locations that can be used to identify them and where they have been. The DNA identification techniques are now so powerful and sensitive that multiple sources of DNA are often found in a sample.
However, the identification of an individual in complex mixtures (usually more than two individuals), has been found to be challenging [3] and [4] . A number of studies have proposed to use bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for forensic identification [5] , [6] and [7] .
Abstract. Complex mixtures, which are defined here as biological samples containing DNA with three or more contributors, exhibit several significant challenges. First, allele sharing will occur at many of the loci tested, making it challenging to unambiguously discern the full genotypes of the mixture contributors.
