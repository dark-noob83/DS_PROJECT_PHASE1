RESULTS: Thirty-two children, ranging in age from 1 to 19 years, required high dose levetiracetam. The median dosage of levetiracetam was 146mg/kg/day (range, 70-275mg/kg/day), and the median maximum serum trough level was 43mcg/ml (range, 20-121mcg/ml). All but one patient were taking one or more other antiepileptic drugs.

A total of 1.7% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to behavioral adverse events, compared to 0.2% of placebo patients. The treatment dose was reduced in 0.8% of adult KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.5% of placebo patients. 
Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 100 0 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg BID). Dosage should be increased by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg.
