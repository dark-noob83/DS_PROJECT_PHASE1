Many of them are abundant, and some of them draw our attention because of their activities. In many ways, the animals I will discuss in this column, the amphipods, should fit into those animal groups discussed with the use of superlatives. There are three major, and one very minor, groups of amphipods, but representatives of only one of them are likely to be commonly found in our tanks. The common type of amphipod is called a Gammaridean amphipod, and belongs to a grouping named after one of the more common fresh-water amphipodan genera, Gammarus.
Amphipods belong to an order comprised of over 7,000 species, their habitats, characteristics and feeding habits vary. Most members of the amphipod species have flat bodies with large, compound eyes on the sides of their heads. Behavior, Diet & Habits. All amphipod species prefer moist habitats. Amphipods that live in water are primarily white, although some may also exhibit light brown, green, dark brown or black coloration. Most amphipods become red in color when they die.

Unlike the eyes of shrimps or crabs, these eyes are not on stalks, but are imbedded in their head. To make things a bit more interesting as well, although the name amphipod refers to two types of legs, these animals actually have a variety of leg structural types on any given animal. There are three major, and one very minor, groups of amphipods, but representatives of only one of them are likely to be commonly found in our tanks. The common type of amphipod is called a Gammaridean amphipod, and belongs to a grouping named after one of the more common fresh-water amphipodan genera, Gammarus.
As in the other amphipods, females have a brood pouch. In this case, it is located in the middle of the body as the animal stands up, and is often visible as a small white spot in the middle of some of the animals. They are typically pale amber or white, but may display other colors as well. There are three major, and one very minor, groups of amphipods, but representatives of only one of them are likely to be commonly found in our tanks. The common type of amphipod is called a Gammaridean amphipod, and belongs to a grouping named after one of the more common fresh-water amphipodan genera, Gammarus.
Breaking all of the taxonomic terms down into their meanings with regard to amphipods does tell us a lot about the animals, however. Amphipods are arthropods, and as such they possess the arthropodan features of a segmented body with jointed, segmented, appendages and an external skeleton, or integument. There are three major, and one very minor, groups of amphipods, but representatives of only one of them are likely to be commonly found in our tanks. The common type of amphipod is called a Gammaridean amphipod, and belongs to a grouping named after one of the more common fresh-water amphipodan genera, Gammarus.
Amphipods can thrive in marine settings and on moist land. Other species are found in home gardens and beneath flowerpots. Some amphipods are herbivores, while others are carnivores. Sand-, mud-and moist-soil-dwelling amphipods feed on bacteria. Other species are scavengers that feed on dead plants and animals. Behavior, Diet & Habits. All amphipod species prefer moist habitats. Amphipods that live in water are primarily white, although some may also exhibit light brown, green, dark brown or black coloration. Most amphipods become red in color when they die.
