A pregnancy is full term only in the narrower two-week window that starts at 39 weeks, under new definitions published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology and endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. • Full term: Between 39 weeks and 40 weeks, six days. • Late term: Between 41 weeks and 41 weeks, six days. • Post term: 42 weeks and beyond. The definitions were developed at a workshop in 2012 that included representatives from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and other medical groups.
Generations of mothers-to-be have heard that babies born any time between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy were at term — neither too early nor too late. But that is now officially outdated wisdom, two leading medical groups said Tuesday. • Full term: Between 39 weeks and 40 weeks, six days. • Late term: Between 41 weeks and 41 weeks, six days. • Post term: 42 weeks and beyond.

Exactly what it means for a pregnancy to have reached full term is changing, doctors say. Two leading groups of doctors announced today the label term pregnancy — which traditionally refers to a pregnancy between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation — should be discouraged. Instead, doctors should use four separate names when discussing this time period: early term, full term, late term and post-term.
They say a full-term pregnancy is between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days. An ‘early term’ or premature baby would be born between 37 weeks and 38 weeks and six days. A late term pregnancy reaches the 41st week and by 42 weeks the baby is ‘post term’ or in other words, long overdue. 
In light of recent research showing that each week of gestation affects newborn health, a leading doctors' group is redefining when a pregnancy is considered term.. Previously, a pregnancy was considered full term any time between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation. On average, a single-fetus pregnancy lasts 40 weeks from the date of the woman's last menstrual period. Fewer moms having C-sections before 39 weeks. Under the new definitions, the period between 37 weeks and 38 weeks, six days of gestation is considered early term.. Thirty-nine weeks to 40 weeks, six days is considered full term; between 41 weeks 0 days and 41 weeks, six days is late term; and 42 weeks and beyond is considered postterm..
'Full-term' pregnancy gets a new, narrower definition. Generations of mothers-to-be have heard that babies born any time between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy were at term – meaning they were neither too early nor too late. But that is now officially outdated wisdom, two leading medical groups said Tuesday. • Full term: Between 39 weeks and 40 weeks, six days. • Late term: Between 41 weeks and 41 weeks, six days. • Post term: 42 weeks and beyond.

Previously it was thought that infant mortality risk was similar for babies born between 37 and 41 weeks. But the new study shows that this risk is increased when babies are born between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation, and that this risk decreases with each additional week of pregnancy. Reviewed by Laura J. Martin, MD. May 23, 2011 -- Babies born between 39 and 41 weeks of pregnancy fare better than infants born during weeks 37 or 38, a study shows. A term birth is considered 37 to 41 weeks, but the new study suggests it is more of a continuum. The findings appear in Obstetrics & Gynecology.
Term pregnancy is 37 weeks to 41 weeks, with early term being 37 and 38 weeks, full term 39 and 40 weeks, and late term 41 weeks.
