A gas furnace made in the early 1970s typically has an AFUE of about 65 percent. The lowest efficiency allowed by law for new gas furnaces is 78 percent, and some new models achieve 97 percent--near-total efficiency. The price of a furnace generally rises in step with its fuel efficiency. A furnace with a 90 percent AFUE might cost $1,000 more than a similar size unit with an 80 percent AFUE
The cost for replacing a standard gas boiler is about $4,000. A high-efficiency model costs about $7,500. This cost estimate usually includes removal and disposal of the old unit, as well as all necessary lines, ducts and wiring needed for the new system to run properly. Replacing an oil-fired boiler is typically a bit more expensive. Depending on where you live they cost between $50 and $300. Some local governments also require a fire inspection before heating system replacements. The fees for these are dependent on the size of the boiler and tend to run between $40 and $75.
1 You may need a new chimney liner if you’re upgrading to higher efficiency boiler. 2  Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 3  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
BOILER INSTALLATION COSTS. If you’re replacing an old boiler, expect boiler installation costs for mid-efficiency system to cost about $2,500 to $4,000 (80 percent efficiency), and boiler installation costs for a high-efficiency system to cost between $5,000 to $9,000 (90 to 97 percent efficiency). 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
Boiler Costs by Type. If you have a boiler installed or replaced, you might pay anywhere between $3,111 and $7,204. On average, homeowners tend to pay $5,100. These prices are highly dependent on the type of boiler you choose. Depending on where you live they cost between $50 and $300. Some local governments also require a fire inspection before heating system replacements. The fees for these are dependent on the size of the boiler and tend to run between $40 and $75.
1 Installing a standard boiler (80%-85% annual fuel utilization efficiency) typically costs about $2,500-$5,000 for a gas-fired model and $3,000-$6,500 for an oil-fired unit (generally used in areas without municipal gas lines). Just received a quote of $5,700 (boiler, parts and labor) to install a Lennox new boiler with a tankless water heater coil. I called a local company to check the specs on the boiler and found out it is a $2,000 boiler.

However, there are other factors that could swing boiler installation costs higher or lower. 1  You may need a new chimney liner if you’re upgrading to higher efficiency boiler. 2  Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 3  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 1 Generally, this costs about $300 to $700 for gas and $700 to $1,800 for oil. 2  Removal of the old unit can range from $300 to $1,500 or more. 3  Boilers rated at 95 percent efficiency or higher are eligible for a $150 federal tax credit through Energy Star.
1 Replacing an old oil-fired boiler with a gas model can cost thousands of dollars more than replacing one oil-fired unit with another, because of the need to install new gas lines and to update the existing fittings, valves, piping system and other parts to work with the new boiler. Just received a quote of $5,700 (boiler, parts and labor) to install a Lennox new boiler with a tankless water heater coil. I called a local company to check the specs on the boiler and found out it is a $2,000 boiler.
Compare the cost of the repair to the cost of replacing. A repair averages between $300 and $500 for most common issues. A replacement can cost between $3,000 and $5,000 for the new equipment installation, inspections and removing the old system. Depending on where you live they cost between $50 and $300. Some local governments also require a fire inspection before heating system replacements. The fees for these are dependent on the size of the boiler and tend to run between $40 and $75.
