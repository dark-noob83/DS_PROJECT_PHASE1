Description. In this clip the structure and function of a ciliated epithelial cell is described. Cilia are tiny hair like structures on the surface of the cell. The hairs sweep hair, mucus, trapped dust and bacteria up to the back of the throat where it can be swallowed.
A ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium is a specialized form of pseudostratified columnar epithelium that contains cilia on the apical surface of the cells and contains goblet cells distributed throughout.
5. These are simple columnar epithelial cells. They. posses fine hair-like outgrowths, cilia on their free surfaces. The movement of the cilia in a certain direction causes the mucus, which is secreted by the goblet cells, to move in that. direction.
These are usually found in places that secrete mucus such as the stomach. They can also specialize to receive sensory information in places like taste buds on your tongue and inside of your nose. Cilliated columnar cells have their apical (or outside facing) surface covered with many tiny little hairs called cilia. These are used to push mucus and other particles along, making it flow in a specific direction. In addition to these shapes, epithelial cells can be described as being either simple or stratified.
It is also those cells that make up the outer surface of the body. Epithelial cells help to protect or enclose organs. Most produce mucus or other secretions. Certain types of epithelial cells have tiny hairs called cilia, which help remove foreign substances. Epithelial cells are arranged in single, or multiple layers, depending on the organ and location.
