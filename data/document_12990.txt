Some flies, like the fruit fly, eat and lay their eggs in rotting fruits and vegetables, while others suck the sap from trees using their proboscis, which is a tongue shaped like a straw. Some flies eat less savory items, such as rotting meat or animal feces. They then lay their eggs in the waste and their baby flies, called maggots, finish off the meal. This may seem gross, but flies and maggots are essential for cleaning up nature and preventing the spread of disease.
Best Answer: Different flies dine on different foods. Flies around the world eat nectar, plant sap, blood, other insects, and decaying matter.
Fireflies are not flies at all, but they are kinds of beetles. They are also called lightning bugs. Firefly eggs hatch into little wormlike creatures called larvae. Some kinds of larvae glow in the dark, and those that do are called glowworms. The glowworms eat very small creatures such as other insects, snails, and slugs. Some adult fireflies also eat other insects. Some eat pollen and other flower parts, and some probably do not eat anything at all.
Flies have mouth parts that absorb food like a sponge. Their food has to be in a liquid form in order for them to eat it. They have a tongue shaped like a drinking straw to slurp up their meals. Flies that eat nectar or blood do so by using their tongue which is called a proboscis. Even flies that eat other insects do so by sucking out the insides of their victims. When a housefly lands on our food, it vomits on the food.
