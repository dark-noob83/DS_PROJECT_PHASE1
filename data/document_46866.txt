The chemical process industry (CPI) is involved in the production of a wide variety of products that improve the quality of our lives and generate income for companies and their stockholders. The following narrative is taken from Kauffman [1] and describes a representative case history related to the development of a new chemical process. It shows how teams of engineers work together to provide a plant design and introduces the types of diagrams that will be explored in this chapter.
The most important characteristic of chemical control process is whether it is discrete or continuous. All the calculations for operations, measurements, and controls are based on chemical flow. Predicting continuous flow is difficult and requires engineering skill, but discrete operations are more common. The combination of operations, flow types, measurement tools, and control systems all contribute to determining the final type of chemical process control. Engineers use recorded data and math tools to predict the design of a chemical process control and determine ways to improve those already in use. Ad.
In this chapter, the focus is on three diagrams that are important to chemical engineers: block flow, process flow, and piping and instrumentation diagrams. Of these three diagrams, the most useful to chemical engineers is the PFD. The understanding of the PFD represents a central goal of this textbook. The following narrative is taken from Kauffman [1] and describes a representative case history related to the development of a new chemical process.

Processes can be characterized as one or more of the following forms: 1  Discrete – Found in many manufacturing, motion and packaging applications. 2  Robotic assembly, such as that found in automotive production, can be characterized as discrete process control. 1 Robotic assembly, such as that found in automotive production, can be characterized as discrete process control. 2  Most discrete manufacturing involves the production of discrete pieces of product, such as metal stamping.
Taking measurements for control processes has the most variety when discussing types of chemical process control. The combination of operations, flow types, measurement tools, and control systems all contribute to determining the final type of chemical process control. Engineers use recorded data and math tools to predict the design of a chemical process control and determine ways to improve those already in use. Ad.
419 pages. Chemical Reactor Design and Control uses process simulators like Matlab®, Aspen Plus, and Aspen Dynamics to study the design of chemical reactors and their dynamic control. There are numerous books that focus on steady-state reactor design. 
A chemical plant is an industrial process plant that manufactures (or otherwise processes) chemicals, usually on a large scale. The general objective of a chemical plant is to create new material wealth via the chemical or biological transformation and or separation of materials. Chemical plants use chemical processes, which are detailed industrial-scale methods, to transform feedstock chemicals into products. The same chemical process can be used at more than one chemical plant, with possibly differently scaled capacities at each plant.
1 Continuous – Often, a physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time. 2  The control of the water temperature in a heating jacket, for example, is an example of continuous process control. 3  Some important continuous processes are the production of fuels, chemicals and plastics. 1 Robotic assembly, such as that found in automotive production, can be characterized as discrete process control. 2  Most discrete manufacturing involves the production of discrete pieces of product, such as metal stamping.
Process control is an engineering discipline that deals with architectures, mechanisms and algorithms for maintaining the output of a specific process within a desired range. 1 Robotic assembly, such as that found in automotive production, can be characterized as discrete process control. 2  Most discrete manufacturing involves the production of discrete pieces of product, such as metal stamping.
There are many types of process controls, and most are unique to a specific manufacturing process of engineering. The main purposes of chemical process control are making and moving chemical products, like sulfuric acid. The combination of operations, flow types, measurement tools, and control systems all contribute to determining the final type of chemical process control. Engineers use recorded data and math tools to predict the design of a chemical process control and determine ways to improve those already in use. Ad.
