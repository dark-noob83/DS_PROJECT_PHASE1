Dethatching your lawn improves its overall health. When you dethatch, you actually cut through the thatch with knife-like blades and then removing the debris. It is a combinglike operation in which you comb out the debris. You can buy what’s called a thatching rake, which has knifelike blades rather than normal tines.
Rake up all the debris. If you haven’t used any pesticides on the lawn and it’s not a weedy grass like Bermuda grass, you can compost the debris or use it for mulch. Water and fertilize the lawn (according to your soil test results). Dethatching is pretty stressful on a lawn, and it can be on you, too.
Healthy thatch remains a half inch or less in thickness. That cushiony sensation you feel when you walk across your lawn is a thatch layer building below the grass blades. Composed of decaying stems, foliage and roots, thatch can easily build up over time.
Dethatching. For thatch layers that are between 1/2 inch and 1 inch, you can simply use a garden rake to remove some of the thatch from the turf -- this strategy causes less stress to the grass for faster recovery. Excessive thatch buildup thicker than 1 inch requires a dethatching machine, or vertical mower. These machines pull thatch out from the topsoil at various intervals. Because dethatching is extremely shocking for the grass, it is critical to perform this chore prior to active grass growth for a healthy recovery.
But soil that is clay, sandy, acidic or often wet and cold encourages thatch in many types of grass. Dethatching can leave your lawn looking like a disaster area, especially if the blades dig into the soil. If your lawn produces a lot of thatch, dethatch annually, so that it's not such a big job. If the thatch is no more than a half-inch (1.27 centimeters) deep, you can probably get by with every other year.
