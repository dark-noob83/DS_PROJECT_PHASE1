Prince definitely has embodied the male and female in his songwriting, it's fitting his symbol is a combination male/female, love/war, introspection/action. And it will pose an interesting dilema: The album's title is an unponouncable hieroglyph that merges the male and female sex symbols 2gether. Thus creating something that although Prince will use many times before, will now seen 2 represent 2 him-the perfect love. And yet, no one will know what 2 call this new symbol.

Prince and symbols used by artists. Long before Prince became the artist known by a symbol, English poets signed their work with a symbol. In fact, only two Old English poets are known by name, Cynewulf and Caedmon. Old English differed greatly from the English of today, it basically resembled modern German. The second known poet Cynewulf, of the 8th century, also signed his work with a symbol. Cynewulf used a kind of cypher, or anagram, made up of ancient figures called runes, an alphabet used by early Germanic tribes preceding the use of the Roman alphabet in England.
Haven't seen one of them in a while. Yeah, the symbol is a mix between the traditional male and female symbols along with and an alchemy/soapstone symbol. Alchemy is the ancient art of turning base metals into pure gold (which is, of course, impossible according to modern science) . Ahh, a good old   thread... 
Did the music for the movie Girl 6 (1996) as Prince. It was the only time he referred to himself as Prince from 1993 to 2000. The symbol he used as his name was also the name of his last Warner Bros. album as Prince, which was released just a few months before his name change. Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Mattie Della (Shaw), a jazz singer, and John L. Nelson, a lyricist and pianist. His parents were both from African-American families from the U.S. south.
Confidence votes 20. It is to my understanding that the Symbol Prince used for awhile are the glyph symbols of Mars(male) and Venus(female) combined. Prince's symbol is also essentially identical to an alchemic symbol for the substance soapstone, with a circle added and the whole symbol rotated 135 degrees clockwise. This symbol may be found on page 74 of Signs, Symbols and Signets by Ernst Leher, Dover, 1969, a republication of the original 1950 work
