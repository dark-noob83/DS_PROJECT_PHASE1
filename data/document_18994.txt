The link between HIV and cervical cancer is direct and deadly; HIV-infected women who are also infected with specific types of human papilloma virus (HPV) are 4-5 times more susceptible to cervical cancer than HIV-negative women.
1 Since 1997, over 33 000 women have died of cervical cancer in South Africa. This translates into roughly 3 000 per year. In addition, approximately 7000 women develop the disease every year. In 2000, a national cervical cancer screening policy was developed and put into place.
The highest burden of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is currently in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than half of the people infected are women who have no access to cervical cancer screening.
Every two minutes, a woman dies of cervical cancer-nobody notices that these women are dying unnecessarily from a cancer that is preventable. Every 7 minutes, a woman in Africa develops cervical cancer. Women who are HIV positive are at greater risk for cervical cancer. In Africa, less than 1% of women are being screened. Mrs. Ajaratu kinda, a mother of six children, didn't know about cervical cancer until it was too late.
Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in sub-Saharan Africa. The incidence is on the increase in some countries. Knowledge and awareness of this disease on the continent are very poor and mortality still very high.
