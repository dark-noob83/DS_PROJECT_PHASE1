Figure 6 reports the per capita cost of data breach for three root causes of the breach incident on a consolidated basis. These results show data breaches due to malicious or criminal attacks cost companies increased from and average of $157 in last year’s study to $159. Figure 3 presents the total average cost of data breach for ten country studies in this year’s study. As can be seen, the U.S. sample experienced the highest total average cost at more than $5.85 million, followed by Germany at $4.74million.
The average cost paid for each lost or stolen record containing sensitive and confidential information increased 6 percent, jumping from $145 in 2014 to $154 in 2015. The lowest cost per lost or stolen record is in the transportation industry, at $121, and the public sector, at $68. The second is the purchase of cyber insurance to mitigate the cost of a data breach. With the increasing volume and cost of data breaches, C-level executives have begun considering IT security a larger business risk.
IBM is proud to sponsor the tenth annual Cost of Data Breach Study, the industry’s gold-standard benchmark research independently conducted by Ponemon Institute. The study found the average consolidated total cost of a data breach is $3.8 million representing a 23% increase since 2013. The study also reports that the cost incurred for each lost or stolen record containing sensitive and confidential information increased six percent from a consolidated average of $145 to $154.

Ponemon Institute © Research Report Page 5 Average organizational cost of data breach declined. Figure 2 shows that the total average cost of data breach over seven years actually decreased from $7.2 million to $5.5 million – or, a 24 percent decline between 2010 and 2011 results. This suggests that organizations are making significant improvements in how they prevent and respond to a data breach. Figure 2. In this year’s study, the average per capita cost of data breach has declined from $214 to $194. Since Ponemon Institute began studying this issue, more than 45 states have enacted laws requiring the owners of personal information databases to inform affected individuals in the event of a data security breach.
IBM and Ponemon Institute are pleased to release the “ 2015 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Analysis .” According to our research, the average total cost of a data breach for the participating companies increased 23 percent over the past two years to $3.79 million. The second is the purchase of cyber insurance to mitigate the cost of a data breach. With the increasing volume and cost of data breaches, C-level executives have begun considering IT security a larger business risk.
The lowest average data breach cost is for government ($12,017) followed by retail ($3,620) and manufacturing ($44). The average cost of lost intellectual property varies by industry. Technology has the highest cost ($18,205) followed by healthcare ($17,999) and communications ($17,818). As more employees are provided laptops as their primary computer, the risk of a data breach due to a lost or stolen computer is increasing. The industries with the lowest average cost per lost laptop are retail ($8,756) consumer products ($2,194) and manufacturing ($2,184). The average data breach cost of a lost laptop also varies by industry. The highest average data breach cost is in the services industry ($108,699) followed by financial services ($68,862), healthcare ($43, 547) and pharmaceutical ($42,027)
IBM and Ponemon are pleased to releasethe ninth annual Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Study. According to the research, the average total cost of a data breach for the companies participating in this research increased 15 percent to$3.5 million. 2. Figure 3 presents the total average cost of data breach for ten country studies in this year’s study. As can be seen, the U.S. sample experienced the highest total average cost at more than $5.85 million, followed by Germany at $4.74million.
As revealed in the 2014 Cost of Data Breach Study: Global Analysis, sponsored by IBM, the average cost to a company was $3.5 million in US dollars and 15 percent more than what it cost last year.
