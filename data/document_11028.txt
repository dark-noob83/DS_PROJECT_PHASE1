How long does a USPS first class mail take from Florida to Oregon?

Best Answer: It depends on how far it needs to travel and how close the sender & recipient are to a major mail depot. Some cities, such as Houston, TX, take an extra day within Houston's system. It can also be affected by what day of the week it is mailed. I have mailed a birthday card in Dallas, TX on Monday and it was delivered to a town in NH 30 mi north of Boston, NA, by end of day Thurs. I have also sent a curd to same address later in the week, Wed. or Thurs. and it took 10 days to be delivered to the same address. You can log onto www.USpS.com and input both zip codes to get an estimate of how long the Postmaster thinks it should take. My experience has been that it varies widely.
Using First Class Mail International, deliveries generally take between 7-21 days to arrive, although the USPS does not guarantee delivery dates or times. Mail may travel to its destination by ground, air or a combination of both. As a cost example, sending a 12-ounce package from the United States to London would cost $40.89 by Priority Mail International, whereas it would only cost $14.40 to send by First Class Package International Service (Commercial Base rates).

Paying first class will not get the letter and if it does, it'll go as surface mail. Surface mail will take anything up to 3 months and the recipient will pay a surcharge for the privilege.
