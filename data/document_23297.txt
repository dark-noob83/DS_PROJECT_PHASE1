An important method for reducing the risk of microbial contamination is the HACCP approach. HACCP is a systematic approach to the identification and control of the biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with a particular food production process.
Microbial contamination can happen in any fuel. It is not uncommon for a fuel system or fuel tank to be contaminated with microbes or bugs. The single biggest cause of microbial contamination is free water at the bottom of fuel tanks. Almost all diesel fuels contain moisture or water.
Controlling the risk of microbial contamination. Microbial contamination can come from several sources. It can be introduced by the food handlers. It could be introduced directly from the hands, by sneezing or coughing onto the food or utensils and surfaces used around food. It may also be introduced indirectly by transfer from doors, tap or clothes.

Microbial contamination is the unintended introduction of bacteria into a controlled area (petri dish, stock media, work station). This often results in confounded research results and test results being unable to be interpreted with confidence.
Microbial excrement is acidic and can cause corrosion that can lead to failure of pumps, level detection devices and leakage in metal fuel tanks. This picture is representative of the inside of a fuel tank with microbial contamination. Diesel fuel is at the top, with water and microbial excrement at the bottom.
