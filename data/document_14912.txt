In economics, average cost and or unit cost is equal to total cost divided by the number of goods produced (the output quantity, Q). It is also equal to the sum of average variable costs (total variable costs divided by Q) plus average fixed costs (total fixed costs divided by Q). Average costs may be dependent on the time period considered (increasing production may be expensive or impossible in the short term, for example).

Continue reading the main story. In the battle over the pricing of electronic books, publishers appear to have won the first round. The price of many new releases and best sellers is about to go up, to as much as $14.99 from $9.99. But there may be an insurgency waiting to pounce: e-book buyers. 
The average cost of each book is the total cost divided by the number of books, and that's $116/3 = $38.66 plus 2/3rds cents per book. It might be written as 38 dollars and 66 and 2/3rds cents, or possibly $32.66666.... 9 people found this useful. Gerald Clay. 59,770 Contributions. 60+ years experience in auto repair. In this case, add up the prices of all 3 text books (32 + 45 + 3 … 9 = 116) then divide by 3 (books) to get 38.66, your average price.   If the textbooks cost $32 and $45 and $39, then the total, found by simply adding the individual costs, is $32 + $45 + $39 = $116 total cost.
Here at last, the numbers you’ve been waiting for—the list of average book prices for 2012 and 2013 to date—are ready, produced in partnership with Baker & Taylor. We know this data helps you make sound decisions. Look for the next iteration in Spring of 2014. The data, based on figures supplied by Baker & Taylor, shows average list prices for all books (including children’s books, young adult books, paperbacks and hardcover editions) that have been sold (not published) during the time frames listed.
Average cost is distinct from the price, and depends on the interaction with demand through elasticity of demand and an average cost due to marginal cost pricing. Short-run average cost will vary in relation to the quantity produced unless fixed costs are zero and variable costs constant. It is also equal to the sum of average variable costs (total variable costs divided by Q) plus average fixed costs (total fixed costs divided by Q). Average costs may be dependent on the time period considered (increasing production may be expensive or impossible in the short term, for example).
By: Jeremy Greenfield |. After weeks of slowly ticking up, getting more than halfway to the $7.00 mark, the average price of a best-selling ebook jumped this week to $7.49. At the end of January, the average price of a best-selling ebook was $5.36, just $0.09 off an all-time low, recorded in December 2013. Since then, it’s been steadily ticking up, with a slight hiccup a few weeks ago when the index dropped to $6.02 from $6.09. In just two months, the average price has increased more than $2.00, or a 40% rise.
Further, there are many books priced below $2.99 and even more priced in what we’re now observing as the most popular price range for best-selling ebooks: $3.00 to $7.99. As a result, the average price of a best-selling ebook is now $6.94, down $0.10 from last week when it was a hair above $7.00. Why this is significant is that consumers are now getting used to paying a relatively low price for best-selling ebooks. It came out in February after being pre-sold for $14.99. The price was lowered as soon as it hit the ebook shelves to $12.74. It dipped down to $7.49 in April and is now selling for $7.99. Savvy consumers are being taught that if they just wait a few months, they can get the next big best-seller for half price.
