In the 2005 TNT study, 10,001 people with stable heart disease received either maximum-dose 80-mg Lipitor速 or a standard dose of 10-mg Lipitor速 daily. 1 Maximum-dose Lipitor速 reduced levels of harmful low density lipoprotein (LDL) to an average of 77 mg/dL. This represented a substantial reduction in LDL. In comparison, standard-dose Lipitor速 reduced LDL to an average level of 101 mg/dL, which was also a good result. 1. Over the five years of the study, 434 people (8.7%) in the 80-mg group experienced another cardiovascular incident (such as a heart attack or stroke) versus 548 people (10.9%) in the 10-mg group.
Roughly half of the patients were given 80 mg of Lipitor and half were given 10 mg Lipitor. Cardiologists used high doses of Lipitor to achieve extremely low LDL levels, says LaRosa. After five years of high-dose Lipitor, the average LDL had fallen to 77 mg/dL compared with 101 mg/dl in the low-dose Lipitor group.
The recommended starting dose of LIPITOR is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of LIPITOR is 10 to 8
He or she may also decrease your Lipitor dosage if you experience side effects. The average daily dose for most people taking Lipitor is Lipitor 20 mg to Lipitor 40 mg once a day. In some situations, your healthcare provider may recommend taking Lipitor every other day, instead of every day.
On average, dosing for people taking atorvastatin to lower cholesterol ranges from 20 mg to 40 mg once a day. In some situations, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take your dose of atorvastatin every other day instead of every day. This is usually used as a cost-saving strategy.
