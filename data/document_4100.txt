Streptococcus. a genus of gram-positive, facultatively aerobic cocci (family Streptococcaceae) occurring in pairs or chains. It is separable into the pyogenic group, the viridans group, the enterococcus group, and the lactic group.
Streptococcus pneumoniae are Gram-positive bacteria in the shape of a slightly pointed cocci. They are usually found in pairs (diplococci), but are also found singly and in short chains.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcus, i s a non-spore forming, gram-positive alpha-hemolytic anaerobic diplococci bacteria. [1] There are more than 90 serotypes of S. pneumoniae that exists [6] S. pneumoniae is the most common cause and blood culture isolate for community acquired pneumonia (CAP).
