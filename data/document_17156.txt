Spacing of plants will influence size and yield of potatoes per plant. Ideally, tubers should be planted 3 to 4 inches deep and 6 to 8 inches apart, in rows that are 36 inches apart.

Potatoes can normally produce a harvest of 150 to 300 pounds of potatoes per 100-foot row of plants. Plants need to be spaced with 6 to 8 inches between them inside each row. This would yield 150 to 200 plants per row. Therefore, each plant would average .75 to 2 pounds of potatoes.
Potato. Grow 1 plant to yield 5 to 10 potatoes. Yield 10 to 20 pounds per 10-foot row. Space seed potatoes 10 to 14 inches apart in trenches 24 to 34 inches apart.
Spacing of potato plants influences the yield per square foot and can have an effect upon the yield per plant. Potato rows 30 to 39 inches apart with seed potato pieces planted 6 to 12 inches apart yield a harvest of medium potatoes, with each plant producing 3 to 5 pounds of potato tubers.
Yield in Pounds. Under good, weed-free growing conditions, you can expect to get about 50 pounds of potatoes per every 2 pounds of potato seed planted. So, a 10-foot row of potatoes can vary in yield from 15 to 60 pounds, depending on care, weather conditions and whether disease is present.
Yield Per Row. Spacing of plants will influence size and yield of potatoes per plant. Ideally, tubers should be planted 3 to 4 inches deep and 6 to 8 inches apart, in rows that are 36 inches apart.
