The systemic circulation is the portion of the circulatory system is the network of veins, arteries and blood vessels that transports blood from heart, services the body's cells and then re-enters the heart, the Mayo Clinic noted.
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.
The blood vessels transport blood to and from the heart, the heart pumps oxygenated blood to the body, and the oxygen, gases, and nutrients exchange in the capillaries. Anything that affects the integrity of the tubing can impair the health of the circulatory system.
The circulatory system, or cardiovascular system, is made up of the heart, veins, arteries and capillaries. This system is responsible for carrying oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body. Heart disease and other circulatory problems are major sources of disability and death.
Vascular disease includes any condition that affects the circulatory system. As the heart beats, it pumps blood through a system of blood vessels called the circulatory system. The vessels are elastic tubes that carry blood to every part of the body. Arteries carry blood away from the heart while veins return it.
Circulatory conditions can affect your veins, arteries, blood flow, and blood pressure. All of these circulatory system disorders are dangerous and should be diagnosed and treated by a doctor or physician immediately.
Heart Disease. Heart disease, or coronary artery disease, occurs when the blood vessels that supply oxygen to the heart narrow and stiffen. Smoking, an unhealthy diet, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle all increase the risk of heart disease. A heart attack or stroke can occur if the condition is untreated.
