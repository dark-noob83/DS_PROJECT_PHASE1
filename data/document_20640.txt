Find out how long it takes for the Passport Program to process your passport application. Processing times begin once we have received a complete application. They are based on how you applied and whether you requested express or urgent service.
If your name does not match the name on your birth certificate, you must also present documentation of your name change, such as a court order or marriage certificate. After your appointment at the passport acceptance facility, passport processing generally takes four to six weeks.

How long it takes. It should take 3 weeks to get the passport-use a different service if you need the passport urgently. It can take longer if more information is needed or your application hasn’t been filled out correctly. Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport-doing so is at your own risk.
An old passport serves as proof of citizenship and identification, as long as it's in your current name, was issued after you turned 16, is undamaged and less than 15 years old. Everyone else will have to prove citizenship and identification as a first-time applicant.
