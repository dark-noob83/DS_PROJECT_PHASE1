Divide the total rise by the typical rise per step. This will give you the total number of steps on your stairs. The typical rise per step is about 7 inches (17.8 cm), but you'll probably use a different height in your final construction. (See below for a handy rule of thumb.) If your total rise is 95 inches (231 cm), divide it by 7 inches to get 13.57. Round down to get the number of steps: 13.
