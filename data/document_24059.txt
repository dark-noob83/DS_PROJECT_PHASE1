4.5.1. Specificity of Enzymes and the Reaction Mechanism. Enzymes act on specific substances and catalyze specific reactions. This indicates that an enzyme has two types of specificity —a substrate specificity and a reaction specificity. An enzyme displays its catalytic activity by identifying and binding to its specific substrate.
User: The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the _____. enzyme substrate catalyst bufferWeegy: The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate. akoine|Points 2078|User: _____ modify the rate of enzyme activity. Cells Carbohydrates Nucleic acids Weegy: The answer is cells.
A substance produced by a living organism which acts as a catalyst to bring about a specific biochemical reaction. Example sentences. 1  They can act as real enzymes and, by analogy to protein enzymes, are called ribozymes. 2  It appears to be due, in large part, to the activity of a specific enzyme, cytokinin oxidase.
Enzymes act only on a specific substrate due to the active site of  the enzymes fits perfectly with the substrate. Like 2 puzzle  pieces, they can only go together and not w … ith anything else.    Enzymes catalyze or help a reaction take place.
In living cells, WHAT serve as biological catalysts. Each acts on a specific substance called the enzyme's substrate and each catalyzes only one reaction. As catalysts, enzymes typically accelerate chemical reactions. The enzyme molecule has an active site, a region that will interact with a specific chemical substance.
The molecule on which an enzyme acts is called a substrate. The  enzyme-substrate complex lowers the activation energy of a chemical  reaction. 2 people found this useful. Edit. Share to: Answered. In Biology.
