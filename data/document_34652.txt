The FAA Satellite Navigation Team provides satellite (GPS) based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services in the United States to enable performance-based (RNP/RNAV) operations for all phases of flight from en route, terminal, approach, and surface navigation.
Two GNSS systems are currently in operation: the United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Federation's Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). A third, Europe's Galileo, is slated to reach full operational capacity in 2008.
Depending on the particular technologies used, GNSS precision varies. For example, the United States Department of Defense originally used an intentional degradation (known as Selective Availability, or SA) of GPS signals to prevent potential military adversaries from using the positioning data.
Satellite-based navigation systems use a version of triangulation to locate the user, through calculations involving information from a number of satellites.
Europe is in the process of launching its own independent GNSS, Galileo. Since 2011, four Galileo satellites have been launched and used as part of the In-Orbit Validation phase, allowing the first autonomous position fix to be calculated based on Galileo-only signals in March 2013.
GNSS coordinates definition. In certain circumstances new deposited plans may be prepared where the boundaries being surveyed are defined by co-ordinates derived using Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS) techniques rather then the traditional method of ground survey from established marks and occupations.
The term ‘global navigation satellite system’ (GNSS) refers to a constellation of satellites providing signals from space transmitting positioning and timing data. By definition, a GNSS provides global coverage. GNSS receivers determine location by using the timing and positioning data encoded in the signals from space.
