Answer by Banana821. Confidence votes 2. Limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO3) which when heated to above 840°C decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) while releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) according to the equation: CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g). CaO is commonly known as lime, quicklime, or burnt lime.
Thermal decomposition. Limestone is an impure form of calcium carbonate. When calcium carbonate is heated to red-heat, it decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Calcium Carbonate = Calcium Oxide + Carbon Dioxide. CaCO3 = CaO + CO2 Calcium oxide is a base. It is known in everyday terms as 'quicklime'.

When limestone is heated it decomposes in thermal decomposition, to produce calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide thus weakening the building structure.
Limestone is calcium carbonate and is basic in nature. When added to dilute acid, limestone will dissolve, forming the corresponding calcium salt, water and carbon dioxide.
