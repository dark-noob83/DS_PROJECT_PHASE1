Since volcanic eruptions are caused by magma (a mixture of liquid rock, crystals, and dissolved gas) expelled onto the Earth's surface, we must first discuss the characteristics of magma and how magmas form in the Earth.
SURFACE STRUCTURE. Basaltic lava flows erupt primarily from shield volcanoes, fissure systems, scoria cones, and spatter cones. These fluid lava flows can be subdivided into two end-member structural types, based primarily on the nature of lava flow surfaces: 1  Pahoehoe Lava -- Surfaces are smooth, billowy, or ropy.
INTRODUCTION. Volumetrically, most lava is of basaltic composition. Basaltic melts have overall lower gas contents and are more fluid than their andesitic-to-rhyolitic counterparts. Their higher fluidity (lower viscosity) is a product of their lower SiO 2 (silica) contents.
This type of lava is generated by Basaltic magma, which is very fluid in nature and drives very fluid lava flows once on the surface. This type of magma allows gas to flow readily out of it making explosive eruptions a rather rare phenominon.
When magma reaches the surface of the earth, it is called lava. Since it its a liquid, it flows downhill in response to gravity as a lava flows. Different magma types behave differently as lava flows, depending on their temperature, viscosity, and gas content.
Kiluaea is classified as a shielf volcano which means that is produces very fluid lava flows giving it the distinct shape that it has today. This type of eruption is produced â€¦ by Basaltic magma. Basalt is a type of lava that is very fluid in nature and does not produce explosive eruptions on its own.
