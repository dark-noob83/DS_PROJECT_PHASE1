Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day.
1 An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 2  A forehead (temporal) scanner
99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) is the normal temperature for this method. Measuring body temperature orally is perhaps the most traditional means of measurement. Although 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the standard norm, healthy range can vary between 98.2 and 98.8 degrees (36.7-37.1 degrees Celsius).
You can take a temperature using the mouth (oral), anus (rectal), armpit (axillary), or ear (tympanic). But the temperature readings vary depending on which one you use, and you need an accurate body temperature to determine if a fever is present.
Generally, the correlation of temperature results are as follows: 1  The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic)
