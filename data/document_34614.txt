Film an ovenproof skillet with oil and sear the tenderloin over medium-high heat to brown all sides, about 5 minutes in all. If you’re using a glaze, apply it now. Place skillet in the oven and roast 15 to 20 minutes, until internal temperature is 145F degrees.

Since large cuts increase approximately 10° F. while resting, remove them from the heat at 150° F. followed by a 10
