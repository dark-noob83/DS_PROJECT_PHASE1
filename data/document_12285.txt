In conclusion, the executive membership is worth it for the first year as long as you remember to get cash back if your reward is less than $50 ($55 for 2012.) You will see how much money you spend at Costco in one year and you can adjust to the cheaper program or continue with the executive membership as you see fit.
Of course, what you really ought to try to do is earn at least $100 a year in rebates (via $5,000 total spending per year, or $417 a month) so that what way, your entire Costco membership can be obtained for free, rather than just a reimbursement of the additional Executive Membership portion.
Costco Executive Members receive a 2% Reward on most purchases. Reward is capped at, and will not exceed, $750 for any 12-month period. Only purchases made by the primary and primary household cardholder on the account will apply toward the Reward. Limit one Executive Membership per household or business.
1 If you buy $5,000 of stuff and get the 2% cashback, your membership fee is basically free ($100 minus $100). 2  If you remove membership fees, you’ll find their retail profit margin is actually a thin 1%. 3  I visualize this as the 3% overall margin minus 2% cashback. 4  That leaves them with 1% of $5,000 = $50 again.
A friend recently shared that he upgraded his regular $55 $50 Costco membership to the $110 $100 Executive plan, which immediately made me wonder how much money he will have to spend to make his yearly fee back. If he spends more, the upgrade was worth it. If he spends less, he should have stuck to the regular plan.
The Costco Executive membership costs an additional $55 per year and members get 2% back annually. This means you’d have to spend $2,750 per year in order for the Executive membership to be worth it (or $229 per month).
Assuming based on the operating margins that Costco prices are 3% cheaper than Wal-mart, you’d have to spend $1,833 a year (about $150 a month) at Costco instead of Wal-mart to pay for the $55 membership fee.
There are two kinds of membership. The Goldstar membership costs $50 per year and you get the privilege of shopping at Costco. The Executive membership costs $100 and you get 2% reward on most purchases in addition. The price of membership is going up in 2012 to $55 and $110, respectively.
If you spend more than $250 a month at Costco, then its executive membership is for you.
My friend has to spend $3,084 on general Costco merchandise in one year to break even. That breaks down to $257 every month or $119 every two weeks, which is entirely do-able for a lot of people. If my friend bought more Costco gas, he would need to spend less in the warehouse to make his Executive Membership back.
