Reminder: IRS Form 8606 must be filed for any tax years that you distribute assets from your Traditional IRA if any of your Traditional IRA balances include non-deductible contributions. IRS Form 8606 is used to help you determine the taxable portion of your distribution or conversion. When your Traditional IRA balance consists of deductible and non-deductible contributions, any amount distributed or converted from the Traditional IRA is pro-rated to include a taxable and non-taxable portion of the assets. You may figure the taxable amount by using the following formula: (Total Deductible Contribution/Total IRA Balance) x Distribution/Conversion Amount = Non-Taxable Amount. Let's say you have non-deductible contributions of $8,000 in a Traditional IRA that have grown to $100,000. The taxable amount would be:
If this is the case, then you can convert your entire Non-deductible IRA to a Roth IRA, and you'll only have to pay tax on the earnings portion. For example, Susan Smith is in a 30% tax bracket this year and she only has one IRA worth $100,000. At a 30% tax rate, she would owe $3,000 in tax to convert the entire $100,000 to Roth. If Smith had no earnings in this IRA, the entire $100,000 (all non-deductible contributions) could be converted with no tax liability.
Since you never received a tax deduction for these contributions, these non-deductible contribution amounts are not taxed when withdrawn from the IRA account and they are commonly known as basis.. Converting IRAs to Roth IRA. In 2010, Congress eliminated the $100,000 income limit on Roth IRA conversions. At a 30% tax rate, she would owe $3,000 in tax to convert the entire $100,000 to Roth. If Smith had no earnings in this IRA, the entire $100,000 (all non-deductible contributions) could be converted with no tax liability.
Instructions. Request a conversion from your traditional IRA containing non-deductible contributions to your Roth IRA by completing the Roth IRA conversion form available from your financial institution. Once you have submitted the form, the financial institution will automatically transfer the money. 
Deductible vs. nondeductible IRA contributions. In 2013, the maximum you can contribute to all of your traditional and Roth IRAs is the lesser of (a) $5,500 or (b) your taxable compensation for the year. If you're 50 or older, the limit is $6,500. You can make contributions to a traditional IRA until age 70-1/2. 
The IRA consists of $90,000 in non-deductible contributions and $10,000 in earnings. If she decides to convert the entire IRA to Roth, she would only have to pay tax on the earnings portion ($10,000). At a 30% tax rate, she would owe $3,000 in tax to convert the entire $100,000 to Roth. If Smith had no earnings in this IRA, the entire $100,000 (all non-deductible contributions) could be converted with no tax liability.
You can convert the contributions to a Roth IRA; however, a portion of the amount you convert to the Roth will be subject to income tax. When your Traditional IRA balance consists of deductible and non-deductible contributions, any amount distributed or converted from the Traditional IRA is pro-rated to include a taxable and non-taxable portion of the assets. You may figure the taxable amount by using the following formula: (Total Deductible Contribution/Total IRA Balance) x Distribution/Conversion Amount = Non-Taxable Amount. Let's say you have non-deductible contributions of $8,000 in a Traditional IRA that have grown to $100,000. The taxable amount would be:
If you decide to convert all $30,000 of your IRA money, then $15,000 (the amount you contributed to the non-deductible IRA on an after-tax basis) would not be taxable since youâ€™ve already paid the tax on that money. 
For example, if 5% of your non-Roth IRA are non-deductible contributions, then 5% of the conversion amount must be non-deductible contributions, and the rest must come from the deductible contributions, including earnings and rollover contributions. When you make non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, you'll have the basis, the amount of non-deductible contributions, reported on Form 8606. When you convert a part or all of your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the conversion amount must contain the non-deductible portion proportionally.
