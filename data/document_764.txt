Subtracting $563 of non-land costs gives an operator and land return for corn of $373 per acre. Soybeans are expected to yield 56 bushels per acre, resulting in $602 of gross revenue at a $10.75 soybean price. Subtracting $350 of non-land costs from $602 gross revenue gives $252 of operator and land return for soybeans. Herein, two-thirds of the acres are assumed to be planted to corn and one-third to soybeans.
In 2013, the total of all economic costs per acre for growing corn in Illinois averaged $1,033 in the northern section, $966 in the central section for farmland with high soil ratings, $951 in the central section for farmland with low soil ratings, and $872 in the southern section. In 2013, cash costs accounted for 49 percent of the total cost of production for corn, other nonland costs were 25 percent, and land costs were 26 percent. The average corn yield for all combined areas of the state was 192 bushels per acre resulting in a total cost of production of $5.03 per bushel.
Depending on the rotation, crop production costs vary. For corn following soybeans, with a medium yield of 180 bushels of corn per acre, $4.29 per bushel is the estimated corn production cost for 2014. For corn following corn, ISU estimates a cost of $4.97 per bushel. Cost of production for soybeans at the 50 bushel per acre yield level is $11.13 per bushel, according to ISU's estimate. That's perhaps up a couple percent from 2013, as soybeans don't share the fertilizer price decline as much as corn doesâ€”since corn is the heavier user of fertilizer.
Average soybean yields in the different areas ranged from 4 to 8 bushels per acre higher than the five-year average from 2010 to 2014. State Averages. Total costs to produce corn for all combined areas of the state were $989 per acre. This figure increased two percent compared to the year before. Variable costs decreased $11 per acre or 2 percent, other nonland costs increased $8 per acre and land costs increased $27 per acre. Total costs per acre were the highest on record and total costs per bushel were the lowest in the last four years. Total cost per acre to produce soybeans increased, from $697 per acre in 2013 to $727 per acre in 2014. Generally speaking, the same expenses that increased for corn also increased for soybeans.
In 2014, the total of all economic costs per acre for growing corn in Illinois averaged $1,045 in the northern section, $1,002 in the central section for farmland with high soil ratings, $955 in the central section for farmland with low soil ratings, and $895 in the southern section. Total costs per acre were the highest on record and total costs per bushel were the lowest in the last four years. Total cost per acre to produce soybeans increased, from $697 per acre in 2013 to $727 per acre in 2014. Generally speaking, the same expenses that increased for corn also increased for soybeans.
Soybean costs per acre were $745, $758, $685 and $664, respectively (see Table 1). Costs were lower in southern Illinois primarily because of lower land costs. The total of all economic costs per bushel in the different sections of the state ranged from $4.34 to $5.10 for corn and from $11.23 to $12.21 for soybeans. Average soybean yields in the different areas ranged from 4 to 8 bushels per acre higher than the five-year average from 2010 to 2014. State Averages Total costs to produce corn for all combined areas of the state were $989 per acre. This figure increased two percent compared to the year before.
Variable equipment costs have increased 26 to 30% for both corn and soybeans. Land costs increased 11%. In the corn divisions, depending upon year, the average maximum and minimum cost per acre is $215 to $260 in the cash grain division, and $187 to $234 in the dairy and livestock division (Table 1). Average costs per acre for soybean ranged from $168 to $204 and average cost per bushel ranged from $3.30 to $4.19.
The largest proportion of costs involve land, fertilizer and fixed + variable equipment (Fig. 1). In the cash corn division, the average cost per acre has been $238 (minimum = $215 during 1995; maximum = $260 during 1992). In the livestock corn division, the average cost per acre is $206 (minimum = $186 during 1993; maximum = $235 during 1987).
The average corn yield was the highest on record. Total costs per acre were the highest on record and total costs per bushel were the lowest in the last four years. Total cost per acre to produce soybeans increased, from $697 per acre in 2013 to $727 per acre in 2014. Generally speaking, the same expenses that increased for corn also increased for soybeans.
State Averages. Total costs to produce corn for all combined areas of the state were $965 per acre. This figure increased 5 percent compared to the year before. Variable costs increased $20 per acre, or 4 percent, other nonland costs increased $14 per acre and land costs increased $14 per acre. In 2013, cash costs accounted for 49 percent of the total cost of production for corn, other nonland costs were 25 percent, and land costs were 26 percent. The average corn yield for all combined areas of the state was 192 bushels per acre resulting in a total cost of production of $5.03 per bushel.
