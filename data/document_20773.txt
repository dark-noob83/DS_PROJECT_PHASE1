A lender's response to your new job can depend on what type of job it is. If your job is in the same industry that you've been working in, and has either the same or greater pay, the lender will have more confidence in your income than if you just switched to a completely new field.
All you need to be on a job for is 1 month, to get a full thirty days of paystubs before closing. Of course we need a two year history, but if you are salary then we can use your salary amount. We prefer you have some consistent earnings for the last two years, but every scenario is different.
It could be as short as 6 months or as long as 24 months. -- If the borrower is self-employed, then the automated underwriting systems will tell us how long they need to have the job, just as if they are paid commission. It could be anywhere from 6 months to 24 months. -- If the borrower is employed part-time or has a second job, then once again, the automated underwriting systems will tell us how long they need to have the job. Anything less than 24 months for a second job is generally unacceptable.
Time on the Job. If you plan to apply for a mortgage loan you should have at least two years of work history at the same job or in some cases just the same profession. The exact rules vary depending on each lender's underwriting policies but the general rule of thumb is two or more years.
If you're using non-job income to qualify for a mortgage, the lender will want proof that the income has been steady for a couple of years, and that you can expect it to continue for several more.
When you apply for a mortgage loan the lender needs to verify your income and income sources. If you've just secured a job last week it's very unlikely that the lender will approve the loan based on that income source. Know how much work history you need to get an approval.
