Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic and potentially fatal disease of the immune system. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks a specific type of white blood cell known as T-lymphocytes. These cells are measured in the blood as the CD4 count.

In stage I there is the acute HIV infection, and the immune system is intact. In this stage, autoimmune diseases may develop. Stage II describes the quiescent period without overt manifestations of AIDS.
Autoimmune diseases are not found. During stage III there is immunosuppression with a low CD4 count and the development of AIDS. CD8 T cells predominant and diseases such as psoriasis and diffuse immune lymphocytic syndrome (similar to Sjogren's syndrome) may present or even be the initial manifestation of AIDS.
The association of immune dysfunction in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS and the development of autoimmune diseases is intriguing. Yet, the spectrum of reported autoimmune phenomena in these patients is increasing.
