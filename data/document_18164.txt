Polyaniline was successfully synthesised using cyclic voltammetry. The redox properties of emeraldine base, a polyaniline derivative, were explored, and it was proved using UV-Vis spectroscopy that emeraldine salt exists in a coiled form when using DMF as a solvent, but in the extended chain form in m-cresol. Introduction. During the electrochemical polymerisation of polyaniline, there were several colour changes. This was due to the fact that the polymer was being oxidised and reduced in a cycle between leucoemeraldine, emeraldine and pernigraniline. The cyclic voltammogram of this process is shown in appendix 8.
Such compounds may have metallic conductivity or can be semiconductors. They combine the electrical and optical properties of metals/semiconuctors with the advantage of polymers such as smaller weight, greater workability, flexibility, toughness, malleability, elasticity, resistance to corrosion and lower cost.

Undoped polyaniline has a conductivity of 6991628000000000000♠6.28×10−9 S/m, while conductivities of 6995460000000000000♠4.60×10−5 S/m can be achieved by doping to 4% HBr. The same material can be prepared by oxidation of leucoemeraldine. The emeraldine (n = m = 0.5) form of polyaniline, often referred to as emeraldine base (EB), is neutral, if doped (protonated) it is called emeraldine salt (ES), with the imine nitrogens protonated by an acid. Protonation helps to delocalize the otherwise trapped diiminoquinone-diaminobenzene state.
This interest is due to the rediscovery of high electrical conductivity. Amongst the family of conducting polymers and organic semiconductors, polyaniline has many attractive processing properties. Because of its rich chemistry, polyaniline is one of the most studied conducting polymers of the past 50 years. The emeraldine (n = m = 0.5) form of polyaniline, often referred to as emeraldine base (EB), is neutral, if doped (protonated) it is called emeraldine salt (ES), with the imine nitrogens protonated by an acid. Protonation helps to delocalize the otherwise trapped diiminoquinone-diaminobenzene state.
Top 10 amazing movie makeup transformations. Polyaniline is among a family of conductive polymers, and has properties similar to some metals. It was discovered as “aniline black” in an organic form as part of melanin, a type of organic polymer, in 1934. Melanin does many things in nature, including protecting the skin by regulating UV exposure through a polyaniline interaction. In a natural form, polyaniline is usually found folded with other polymers. In the late 1990s, it became evident that it was a flexible and highly useful polymer, and could be used in applications ranging from intelligent windows to computer chips. This polymer is unusual because it is a type of semiconductor. Polyaniline can be configured to conduct across a wide range, from being utterly non-conductive for insulation use to highly conductive for other electrical purposes. Like other polymers, it is highly flexible, which makes it appealing for manufacturing use.
Polyaniline (PANI) is a conducting polymer of the semi-flexible rod polymer family. Although the compound itself was discovered over 150 years ago, only since the early 1980s has polyaniline captured the intense attention of the scientific community. The emeraldine (n = m = 0.5) form of polyaniline, often referred to as emeraldine base (EB), is neutral, if doped (protonated) it is called emeraldine salt (ES), with the imine nitrogens protonated by an acid. Protonation helps to delocalize the otherwise trapped diiminoquinone-diaminobenzene state.
Modified Polyaniline and Other Conductive Polymers. The following is a proposal for an alternate synthesis of polyaniline (the references are below, at the end of the page) . This conductive polymer is prepared by the oxidative polymerization of aniline : Note the nitrogen radical cations in the polymer. 
Mechanical properties of polyaniline blends have been reported, such as in the case of thermoplastic elastomer/polyaniline blends [6] and [7] . Wet-spun PANI fibres [8] and [9] and composite membranes [10] have also been tested with respect to mechanical parameters. Complex Young's modulus of polyaniline compressed into pellets was measured at room temperature and an influence of preparation conditions of the polyaniline pellets on mechanical properties was studied.
Conventional polymers such as plastics, rubbers, fibers, resins, etc. offer significant resistance to electric conduction and are either dielectrics or insulators. Since, from the invention of conducting polyacetylene in the year 1970, conducting polymers received attention from both academic and industries.
