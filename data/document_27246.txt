If you meet a girl, say at a bar, or at work, how can you tell if she's going to be confident, or insecure before you talk to her? Women say they can tell when guys are before the guy even talks, but I can't find any correlation to body size, posture, or any of that crap with women.

· just now. Report Abuse. Guys can tell that a female is insecure all the time if the girl is accusing the guy of looking at other girls, if the girl keeps saying that she does not like the way she looks, always accusing him of cheating when he's not.
