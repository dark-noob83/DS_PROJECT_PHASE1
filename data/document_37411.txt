The most actively working parts of the kidneys are tiny structures called nephrons. Each normal nephron, generally, works day and night to get rid of wastes in the blood. And each kidney has about 1 million tiny filtering units. Two major parts of the nephron are the renal corpuscle and the renal tubule. The corpuscle has the glomerulus (see illustration). Cleansing of the blood occurs in this part of the nephron. The glomerulus, which is a tuft of very small blood vessels, has tiny holes that act as a filter.
There are two parts of a kidney nephron: the renal corpuscle, and the renal tubule. (1) Renal Corpuscle. The renal corpuscle is the part of the kidney nephron in which blood plasma is filtered. The term corpuscle means tiny or small body.
Each nephron is composed of two main structures: the glomerulus and renal (kidney) tubule. The Glomerulus. The glomerulus is a tiny blood vessel or capillary, which looks like a ball of yarn. Actual filtering of your blood occurs in the glomerulus.
The Renal Corpuscle. Together, the glomerulus and its surrounding Bowman's capsule are called a renal corpuscle. This structure is located in the renal cortex. You should also be aware that the nephron is composed of two main parts: the renal tubule and the renal corpuscle. The renal corpuscle, in essence, is the first structure involved in the nephron's formation of urine, while the renal tubule takes over thereafter.
