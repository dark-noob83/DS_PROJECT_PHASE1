Justices uphold North Carolina's voting restrictions. For the second time in two weeks, the Supreme Court upheld a state law Wednesday restricting voters' access to the polls. The latest ruling affects North Carolina, scene of a tight Senate race in November.
RALEIGH – A North Carolina law passed last year that requires voters to present photo identification and eliminates same-day voter registration has been called one of the farthest-reaching overhauls to election rules in the country. Now a judge will decide whether it will stay that way.
My Vote. Beginning in 2016, North Carolina will require voters to show an acceptable form of photo identification when presenting to vote in person at the polls. This website contains information about both the requirement and the exceptions outlined in the law (S.L. 2013-381 and S.L. 2015-103).
Wisconsin’s law requires a photo identification be shown before a voter is allowed to cast a ballot. The law will not be enforced for the April 7 election but will take effect for subsequent elections. NCSL's History of Voter ID webpage contains a chronology of voter ID legislation from 2000 to the present.
The bill does provide for a free ID to be offered at DMVs, though the state estimates that between 203,351 and 318,643 voters registered in North Carolina lack ID, and that providing them with one would cost $834,200 in 2013 and 2014, and $24,100 every two years after that.
Voting rights advocates in North Carolina caught a lucky break on Thursday, where it was revealed that the panel of three judges who would consider that state’s comprehensive voter suppression law included one Clinton appointee, Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, and two Obama appointees, Judges James Wynn and Henry Floyd.
So much so that in the 2012 elections, nearly 51 percent of North Carolina voters picked a Democrat for the U.S. House, yet Republicans won nine of the state’s 13 House seats, as Chris Kromm and Sue Sturgis recently pointed out.
