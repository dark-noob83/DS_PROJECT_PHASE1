tc 5 9 tf 32 tc temperature in degrees celsius tf temperature in degrees fahrenheit for example assume you have a fahrenheit temperature of 98 6 degrees and you desire to convert it into degrees on the celsius scale assume that you have a celsius scale temperature of 100 degrees and you wish to convert it into degrees on the fahrenheit scale using the stated formula you first multiply the celsius scale temperature reading by nine fifths and get a result of 180
how to convert celsius to fahrenheit 0 degrees celsius is equal to 32 degrees fahrenheit 0 c 32 f the temperature t in degrees fahrenheit f is equal to the temperature t in degrees celsius c times 9 5 plus 32 t f t c 9 5 32 or
units of temperature from fahrenheit to celsius to kelvin and back degrees fahrenheit developed in the early 1700 s by g daniel fahrenheit are used to record surface temperature measurements by meteorologists in the united states 
a fever in celsius is a temperature greater than 38 degrees or the equivalent of 100 4 degrees fahrenheit also a temperature of 39 degrees celsius 102 degrees fahrenheit is not dangerous in and of itself although it should prompt the individual to seek medical attention if it persists fahrenheit is a temperature scale used for describing temperatures in fahrenheit degrees f it is most commonly used in the united states in weather forecasts and to describe temperatures inside houses offices etc
fahrenheit is a thermodynamic temperature scale where the freezing point of water is 32 degrees fahrenheit f and the boiling point 212 f at standard atmospheric pressure this puts the boiling and freezing points of water exactly 180 degrees apart 
the fahrenheit and celsius scales begin at a different number where 0 celsius is freezing that equivalent temperature in fahrenheit is 32 in addition to starting at a different temperature the two scales rise at different rates as well the range for freezing to boiling in celsius is 0 100 whereas it s 32 212 in fahrenheit this is the same as saying that for every 180 fahrenheit range there is only a 100 celsius range you can express that as 180 100 which when simplified equals 1 8 so to finish the conversion you must divide by 1 8
0 degrees fahrenheit is equal to 17 77778 degrees celsius 0 f 17 77778 c the temperature t in degrees celsius c is equal to the temperature t in degrees fahrenheit f minus 32 times 5 9 t c t f 32 5 9 or t c t f 32 9 5 
to convert a celsius temperature into degrees fahrenheit tf 9 5 tc 32 for example to convert a celsius temperature of 100 into degrees fahrenheit first multiply the celsius temperature reading by nine fifths to get 180 then add 32 to 180 and get 212 f the celsius temperature scale is still sometimes referred to as the centigrade scale 
therefore a degree on the fahrenheit scale is 1 180 of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point on the celsius scale the freezing and boiling points of water are 100 degrees apart a temperature interval of 1 f is equal to an interval of 5 9 degrees celsius the fahrenheit and celsius scales intersect at 40 40 f and 40 c represent the same temperature absolute zero is 273 15 c or 459 67 f
