Nelly Moser (Clematis Nelly Moser), for instance, has a large mauve flower and reaches only 6 to 10 feet tall with a spread of 1 to 3 feet in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 4 through 11. Sweet autumn clematis (Clematis terniflora), on the other hand, has tiny white flowers on aggressive vines that reach 15 feet tall with a spread of up to 6 feet in USDA zones 5 through 11. It requires a sturdy structure such as a fence, wall or pergola.

Experts suggest that support structures with a diameter of Â¾ inch or less are ideal for growing clematis on a pole or wall
Answers. Best Answer: Clematis need support to climb. If the wall is concrete, you could drill mortar screws in the mortar of the concrete and attach the vine to the screws with plant tape. The wall bricks should be more than sufficient support. 
Large-flowered clematis tend to have lightweight vines. Clematis (Clematis spp.) is a genus so varied that a gardener could fill every available garden space with creeping, climbing or sprawling vines and not have two alike. Sweet autumn clematis (Clematis terniflora), on the other hand, has tiny white flowers on aggressive vines that reach 15 feet tall with a spread of up to 6 feet in USDA zones 5 through 11. It requires a sturdy structure such as a fence, wall or pergola.
One important thing you need to know: Clematis climb by wrapping their leaf stems around small things. They do not cling, like Boston Ivy or Trumpet Vine do. Thus, they will NOT climb a building-or a rock wall-unless you provide something for them to wrap those leaves around. Don't worry-we'll tell you how! 
The standard clematis flower form is a large blossom with six or seven petals, measuring 5-6 across. There are also cultivars with smaller blossoms, double blossoms, and lovely bell-like flowers.

Clematis is a climbing plant that produces stunning blue, purple, pink, rose, yellow and white flowers all summer and into the fall. Certain cultivars can grow up to 20 feet (6.1 m) tall and live for over 80 years. Clematis require full sun on its blooms and cool shade over the roots in order to thrive. Clematis will not grow unless they have a vertical structure to climb. During the first year, the support that came with the clematis will be sufficient for the plant's needs, but after that you'll need to provide a larger support, like a trellis or arbor, to encourage it to grow bigger.
Make sure you provide it with something to climb on from day one. A clematis vine does not climb by twining around something, as a pole bean or a morning glory does. It climbs by wrapping its leaf stems around something. Because these leaf stems are not very long, anything that's more than about 1/2 inch in diameter is too wide for the leaf stem to twist around. The easiest things for a clematis to grab onto, are twine, fishing line, wire, thin branches, wooden dowels or steel rods.
