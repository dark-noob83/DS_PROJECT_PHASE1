From the Swedish words tung sten, which mean heavy stone.. Tungsten's chemical symbol comes from its eariler, Germanic name, Wolfram. The name Wolfram comes from the mineral wolframite, in which it was discovered. Wolframite means the devourer of tin since the mineral interferes with the smelting of tin.
Tungsten and Tungsten Wire History. The word “Tungsten” was probably first used by A. F. Cronstedt in 1755, who applied it to the mineral subsequently known as “scheelite,” which is the natural form of calcium tungstate.
Tungsten, also known as wolfram, is a chemical element with the chemical symbol W and atomic number 74. The word tungsten comes from the Swedish language tung sten directly translatable to heavy stone, though the name is volfram in Swedish to distinguish it from Scheelite, in Swedish alternatively named tungsten.
Boiling Point: 3,068.3 F (5,555C). Word origin: Tungsten comes from a Swedish term meaning heavy stone.. Tungsten's chemical symbol comes from its earlier name, wolfram. Wolfram comes from the mineral wolframite, in which it was discovered. Wolframite means the devourer of tin since the mineral interferes with the smelting of tin.
The two-name confusion arises from early mineralogy. The name 'tungsten' is derived from the old Swedish name for 'heavy stone', a name given to a known tungsten-containing mineral. The name 'wolfram' comes from a different mineral, wolframite, which also has a high content of the element we call tungsten.
