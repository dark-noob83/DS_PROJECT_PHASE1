Weight Watchers eTools is the Internet weight-loss companion that makes it easier to stay on track between meetings. It is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Once you log in at www.weightwatchers.com, you will be taken to the eTools area on the site. There you can:
Cost of traditional Weight Watchers is about $10 a week. However, this cost is likely to differ as per your state of residence. However, the difference is within the range of a couple of dollars. On an average, the cost of offline program is about $39.95.
If you attend Weight Watchers meetings (sorry, WW Online-only members can't attain Lifetime Member status, but read my comments at the end of this post and I'll tell you how you can!) and you reach your WW-approved goal weight, you will switch from weight loss mode to a 6 week maintenance period.
After attaining your weight loss goal and maintaining it for 6 weeks, you can become a life member for free. Online Weight Watchers is much cheaper with a monthly fee of $17.95. You are also charged $29.95 towards one time sign up fee. Thus, during the first month, you are expected to pay $47.90, whereas after that you are charged $17.95 each month, for three months.
There are the dining out guides, food companion, coupon for a free calculator plus other coupons, a cookbook, a carry case and I think the 3 month journal is included in it. I don't know the cost of the deluxe kit. If you buy the calculator alone, it is on sale for $5.95 for the first one in corporate areas.
