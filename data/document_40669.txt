Introduction. The 501(c) designation is an IRS tax code designation for a non-profit organization that receives some exemption from federal taxation. State taxation generally follows the same criteria as the federal government for tax exemption. Fraternal organizations and retirement funds may also be tax exempt if they are for the sole benefit of the dependants. These organization are covered in 501(c)(8 - 12). Several other narrow classifications exist for retirement and benefit trusts.
Many nonprofit organizations pursue 501(c), or exempt, status from the Internal Revenue Service for tax benefits, and in some cases, to increase donations to the nonprofit. While there are 28 different types of exempt organizations, among the most common include 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), and 501(c)(7) organizations. Depending on the type of 501(c) organization, the designation may bring additional benefits, such as tax-deductible donations. The IRS recognizes 28 different types of nonprofit organizations as exempt, each type with their own rules and regulations to qualify.
A 501(c)(3) or 501c3 organization, also colloquially known as a 501c3, is a United States nonprofit organization that has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service to be tax-exempt under the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations acquire 501(c)(3) tax exemption by filing IRS Form 1023. As of 2006 the form must be accompanied by a $850 filing fee if the yearly gross receipts for the organization are expected to average $10,000 or more.
A first important distinction to make is that granting nonprofit status is done by the state, while applying for tax-exempt designation (such as 501(c)(3), the charitable tax-exemption) is granted by the federal government in the form of the IRS. 
There are many kinds of nonprofits -- the Internal Revenue Code defines more than 25 categories of organizations that are exempt from federal income taxes. But for most people, a nonprofit refers to what the tax code classifies as a charitable or 501(c)(3) organization. 
Organizations that only operate charitable activities are classified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Many types of organizations are tax-exempt, but not all qualify for 501(c)(3) status. The 501(c)(3) designation is a legal designation reserved for organizations that are exclusively charitable. 
501(c) organizations are nonprofits that are designated as exempt by the Internal Revenue Service. Referring to an organization as exempt means the nonprofit does not have to pay certain federal income taxes. Depending on the type of 501(c) organization, the designation may bring additional benefits, such as tax-deductible donations. The IRS recognizes 28 different types of nonprofit organizations as exempt, each type with their own rules and regulations to qualify.
A 501(c) organization, also known colloquially as a 501(c) , is a tax-exempt nonprofit organization in the United States. Section 501(c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. § 501(c)) provides that 29 types of nonprofit organizations are exempt from some federal income taxes. Sections 503 through 505 set out the requirements for attaining such exemptions. Organizations acquire 501(c)(3) tax exemption by filing IRS Form 1023.

1 501(c)(3) is for charitable organizations, a designation that applies to educational groups, such as alumni associations and clubs. 2  A club with 501(c)(3) status is exempt from federal tax, and donations to the club, including membership dues, are tax-deductible. The most well-known type of non-profit is the IRS classification of 501(c)(3), a “charitable non-profit.”. Non-profit organizations need not be tax-exempt organizations. The pursuit of tax exemption is a voluntary choice and non-profit organizations are free to be taxable if they so choose.
