Uses of Boron. 1  Much boron is made into sodium tetraborate which is used to insulate fiberglass. 2  It is also used in many cleaning products-detergents and bleaches. 3  Most boron is used to produce glass and ceramics. 1 It is also used in many cleaning products-detergents and bleaches. 2  Most boron is used to produce glass and ceramics. 3  Borosilicate glass has a fantastic resistance to thermal shock (sudden changes in temperature which causes glass to break).
Boron compounds were known and used for thousands of years but the element was first discovered by Jons Jakob Berzelius, in 1824. Before that, it was isolated in the lab by combined efforts of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Louis Jacques Thenard, thénard And Sir Humphry. davy Boron has been useful to mankind in the form of different compounds. The existence of this element was first discovered by Joens Jöns Jakob. Berzelius it is known to have wide variety of uses from medical to industrial.

Boron is a mineral that is found in food and the environment. People take boron supplements as medicine. Boron is used for building strong bones, treating osteoarthritis, as an aid for building muscles and increasing testosterone levels, and for improving thinking skills and muscle coordination. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Boron is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant and breast-feeding women age 19-50 when used in doses less that 20 mg per day. Pregnant and breast-feeding women age 14 to 18 should not take more than 17

Boron compounds are also used as fertilizers in agriculture, and in sodium perborate bleaches. In minor uses, boron is an important dopant for semiconductors, and boron-containing reagents are used as intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent. In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods and are used as insecticides.
Boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics. Borosilicate, which is a type of glass with its main constituents being silica and boron oxide, shows good resistance to thermal shock because of its low coefficient of thermal expansion.

Boron is a non-metallic element which occurs in various forms. It is denoted by the symbol 'B' for chemical representation and its most common form is a dark powder known as amorphous boron. This form of boron is unreactive to oxygen, acids, water, and alkalis. Boron has been useful to mankind in the form of different compounds. The existence of this element was first discovered by Joens Jöns Jakob. Berzelius it is known to have wide variety of uses from medical to industrial.

Common uses of boron. Borax, the most common natural form of boron, has a wide variety of uses. Borax is used in cleaning compounds, glass and ceramics, fertilizers, papers and paints, and fire retardants. Borax is also used in enamels covering the steel of refrigerators, washing machines, and other like objects.
