Calculation: Here is the formula for FIP: FIP = ((13*HR)+(3*(BB+HBP))-(2*K))/IP + constant. The constant is solely to bring FIP onto an ERA scale and is generally around 3.10. You can find historical FIP constant values here, or you can derive the constant yourself.

It is calculated as follows: FIP = ((13*HR) + (3*(BB+HBP)) - (2*K)) / IP + cFIP. The variables are pretty straightforward: HR = home runs allowed, BB = walks allowed, HBP = hit-by-pitches allowed, K = strikeouts, and cFIP = league FIP constant.
Context: Please note that the following chart is meant as an estimate, and that league-average FIP varies on a year-by-year basis so that it is always the same as league-average ERA. To see the league-average FIP for every year from 1901 to the present, check the FanGraphs leaderboards.
To see why this creates a problem, consider how FIP is calculated:FIP = (13*HR + 3*BB -2*K)/IP + Clet (13*HR + 3*BB -2*K)/IP = xFIP = x + CThis is the basic construction of FIP; a value is calculated for each pitcher, and then a constant is added to this value to put FIP on a more usable scale.
In baseball, a statistic called FIP, or Fielding Independent Pitching, measures a pitcher's ERA over time independent of the defense behind him. Because the pitcher has little control over balls that fall in as hits, FIP aims to measure only the things that the pitcher is specifically responsible for. This statistic shows the ability of a pitcher to prevent home runs, walks, hit by pitches, and strikeouts.
Today's statistic: FIP. What it stands for: F ielding I ndependent P itching, devised by Tom Tango, based on research by Voros McCracken. How they calculate FIP: Tango's simplest version is expressed by the following equation.
