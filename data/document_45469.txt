I’ve been taking oxycodone 5 milligrams for 2 weeks to the surgery how long will take for me to get out of my system I weigh approximately 250 and 47 years old been drinking a lot of water I also been taking 5 milligrams volumes for about 2-3 months how long will it take for that to get out of my system. Most doses of oxycodone are usually taken with or without food every 4 to 6 hours, either as needed for pain or as regularly scheduled medications. The extended-release tablets are taken every 12 hours. Extended-release tablets are supposed to be swallowed one at a time with plenty of water.
About 45 people a day, more than 16,600 people a year, die from overdoses of the drugs, including methadone, morphine, and oxycodone (OxyContin) and hydrocodone combined with acetaminophen (Lortab and Vicodin). And for every death, more than 30 others are admitted to the emergency room. • If you are using opioids for chronic pain, talk to your doctor about how you will be monitored. “You doctor should assess you at regular visits. If pain and function do not improve at least 30 percent after starting the drugs, then they probably are not working well enough to justify the risks,” Franklin said.

Short acting opiates are the drugs like vicodin and oxycodone are are meant to be taken every 4-6 hours. There is another type of drug that is called a drug for breakthrough pain. If you have ever heard of the fentanyl lollipop, this drug was widely used when it first came out as one used for this purpose. It is very fast acting and does not last long in the system.
There are many nerves in the facial area so there is a possibility of nerve damage. I had the surgery around 5-6 years ago and still have numbness on part of my lip.

I have some Oxycodone that I got when I had surgery about a year ago. The prescription was filled on 11/1/11. I didn't use them all but NEED some now due to some heavy duty knee pain (I have torn ACL in both knees). 
Oral pain pills dissolve in the stomach and take between 30-45 minutes to start working from the time they are swallowed. Because these pills dissolve slowly in the stomach, they generally work to control pain for 3-4 hours at a time. Most patients find that they take their pain pills more often throughout the days of their first and second weeks of recovery. After some healing time and physical therapy, patients typically require less frequent dosing, eventually stopping the pain medication at about 4-6 weeks after surgery.
