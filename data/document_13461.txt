A Catena in soil science (pedology) is a sequence of types of soil down a hill slope. Each soil type or facet differs somewhat from its neighbours, but all occur in the same climate and on the same underlying material. A mature catena is in equilibrium as the processes of deposition and erosion are in balance.
Noun. 1. catena-a chain of connected ideas or passages or objects so arranged that each member is closely related to the preceding and following members (especially a series of patristic comments elucidating Christian dogma).
The origin of the catena concept. The catena concept in soil science comes from the Latin word “catena” which means chain. So it is a chain of soils linked by topography. It also refers to a sequence of soils in different positions in the landscape.
A catena (Latin: chain) is a chain of related soil types, known as facets, down a uniform slope. The term was introduced by the soil scientist G. Milne in 1935, working in Africa, as the sequence of soils that ran from the crest of a hill to the floor of the swamp in the valley below it.
Soil Catenas. A soil catena is a sequence of different soil profiles that occur down a slope. They occur on hill slopes where the geology is uniform and there is no marked difference in climate from the top to the bottom of the slope.
