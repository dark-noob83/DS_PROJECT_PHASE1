But remember it is not till the bird has laid it full clutch(5-6 eggs) as she will not start to brood till the last egg is laid. Always have a good supply of soaked sprouting seed available for the parents to feed the young.
It usually takes 13 to 15 days for a wild finch egg to hatch. This can vary 1 to 2 days depending on outside elements that effect hatching times.
How can I tell if the eggs my finch laid are fertile? At first, fertile and infertile eggs will look the same. After about 4-7 days from the last egg being laid, you can candle an egg (using an egg candler or a small flashlight) to tell whether or not it is fertile.
RE: How long does it take finch eggs to hatch? A house finch laid four eggs outside of my house, after nearly a month, the mother discarded one of the eggs (probably dead) and the others she left. Two nights ago she got in my house and flew into my ceiling fan, which killed her. I am now incubating the three eggs.
The female zebra finch incubates her eggs while the male zebra finch takes over every once in a while to give the female time to stretch, rest, eat, and drink. The eggs will start hatching about thirteen days after incubation. Zebra finches can lay a maximum of eight eggs, but usually have 2 to 5 eggs in their nests. When the eggs hatch it is time to feed your nesting finches with rearing / nestling food – a very crucial stage – which provides them with enough supplements.
Bigger birds lay bigger eggs which take longer to hatch. Blue tits incubate their eggs for two weeks but swans sit on theirs for nearly six weeks! Most birds lay one egg a day until the eggs are all laid. Some birds lay up to 15 eggs but others lay only one.
