Speaking roughly, normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are in the range of 0.4 to 4.0 mIU/L. However, each laboratory and test manufacturer identifies its own normal TSH range. This is based on the test, the equipment being used, and the patients being tested. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists has proposed a range of 0.3 to 3.0 for normal TSH levels. Using these cutoff values would lead to more people being diagnosed with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Recommended TSH Levels May Not Be Right. Clinical chemists and doctors decided decades ago that healthy people with normal functioning thyroid glands have TSH levels within a range of 0.450 to 4.500 mIU/L (and some labs go as high as 5.000mIU/L). In clinical shorthand, the diagnostic range is rounded out to 0.4-4.0. If your TSH level falls between 3.5-4.5, but you have many of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, find an integrative medicine practitioner who will help you achieve a level within the desirable range. Remember, individual variations matter. For some people their optimal TSH may have to be in a very tight range of 1.0-1.5.
When the TSH level is high, it is producing too much “stimulating” hormone, which may indicate hypothyroidism. The converse to that is – if it produces too little, and the TSH level is low, then the thyroid is hyperactive. Generally the TSH level is ordered depending on your symptoms. Though the “normal” range for TSH levels vary depending on the labs, the practitioners and individuals. In 2002, The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists changed the range for TSH to be between 0.30 and 3.04. 
This leads to high levels of TSH and low levels of free T4. If your free T4 levels are too low—the normal range for T4 is 5 to 13.5 micrograms per deciliter—it's a possible indicator that you have hypothyroidism, even if your previous TSH tests came back normal. Again, the normal ranges vary from lab to lab. Anti-thyroid Microsomal Antibodies Testing.
1 A TSH level count ranging between 0.5 and 3mIU/L confirms thyroid disorder. 2  The normal TSH range for newborns ranges from between 1 – 39 mIU/L. 3  The normal TSH levels for children ranges from between 0.7 – 6.4 mIU/L. 1 The range of normal TSH levels for full term newborns is higher, as it can range from between 1.3 and 16 micro units per ML of blood. 2  The TSH range gradually reduces to 0.9 to 7.7 micro units per milliliter after 30 days. 3  The TSH narrows to 0.6 to 5.5 micro units per milliliter in school going children
1 An under active thyroid presents with a TSH ranging from 2mIU/L or more than that. 2  A TSH level count ranging between 0.5 and 3mIU/L confirms thyroid disorder. 3  The normal TSH range for newborns ranges from between 1 – 39 mIU/L. 4  The normal TSH levels for children ranges from between 0.7 – 6.4 mIU/L. 1 The range of normal TSH levels for full term newborns is higher, as it can range from between 1.3 and 16 micro units per ML of blood. 2  The TSH range gradually reduces to 0.9 to 7.7 micro units per milliliter after 30 days. 3  The TSH narrows to 0.6 to 5.5 micro units per milliliter in school going children
The normal range are: TSH (0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L). Total T4 (4.5 to 11.2 mcg/dL). Total T3 (100 - 200 ng/dL). Free T4 (0.8 - 1.8 ng/L). This answer should not be considered medical advice... This answer should not be considered medical advice and should not take the place of a doctor’s visit. As you can see from the values listed below there is a fairly large normal range for T4 and T3. As you mention, your values are in the lower range of normal, but as long as your TSH is normal, your thyroid is working well.
Results. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems. The normal values listed here-called a reference range-are just a guide. These ranges vary from lab to lab, and your lab may have a different range for what's normal. Your lab report should contain the range your lab uses.
1 According to some medical laboratories, the normal TSH level ranges between 0.4 – 4mIU/L or 0.4 – 4.5. 2  In general, the normal reference range of TSH for both men and women are equal according to labs. 1 The range of normal TSH levels for full term newborns is higher, as it can range from between 1.3 and 16 micro units per ML of blood. 2  The TSH range gradually reduces to 0.9 to 7.7 micro units per milliliter after 30 days. 3  The TSH narrows to 0.6 to 5.5 micro units per milliliter in school going children
