From 1986 to 1998, all Honda and Acura V6 engines had hydraulic tappets and did not require periodic valve adjustment. In 1999 Honda released the J32A1, J32A2, and J35A4 V6 engines that are found in the Acura CL, TL, and MDX as well as the Honda Accord V6, and Odyssey. This new V6 engine had a “screw and jamb nut” style adjustable valve clearance with an adjustment interval of every 105,000 miles. We’ve not seen a damaged valve on a V6 motor yet, and then it is not inexpensive to do the valve adjustment. A valve adjustment for some of the V6 models takes 4.6 hours. At $82 per hour, that adds up quickly.
I called two dealers for a valve adjustment. Acura of Bayshore said $590 and includes all gaskets. Smithtown Acura said $375 and they only change gaskets if necessary. Also Nardy Honda quoted 4 to 5 hrs at $113 an hour no gaskets only if nec.. He commented that Honda's old valve adjustment interval was 60k miles and increased it to 105k. But he thought going to 105k miles is too far without an adjustment. I am on my 4th Honda over 20 years I recall the 60k old school maintenance interval. His price was only like $225 so I had it done.
One guy said it's gonna take 5 hours x 125$/hr. Another said 2.3 hours x 110$/hr. Still waiting on another shop to call me. So far, the 2nd guy is wining haha And a shop just called me and said they don't wanna do it, just the timing belt haha. so I got quoted 500 for timing belt, water pump... paid 200$ for all the parts, and 253$ for valve adjustment. 
When I reached 105k for my 2004 TL I asked my local Honda dealer their thoughts and they said only do the valves if they are noisy. Also they wanted over $400 for the job and when added to the timing belt it was getting to be a significant outlay of cash. I then checked with my local independent honda mechanic. He commented that Honda's old valve adjustment interval was 60k miles and increased it to 105k. But he thought going to 105k miles is too far without an adjustment.

I've been asked about doing a video on this process since my first Honda valve adjustment videos came out almost 2 years ago. I was happy when this 2004 Acura TL 6 speed came in not just because it allowed me the opportunity to make this video but also because I think these cars are a lot of tun to drive.
