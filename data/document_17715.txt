Unfortunately, many practitioners are hesitant to prescribe oral magnesium preparations due to the known side effect of diarrhea. The recommended daily dose of elemental magnesium is 400 mg per day, and a single dose of 800-1600 mg is necessary to produce this laxative effect. The majority are women over the age of 50 who take them for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. Adults should consume a total of 1000-1200 mg per day of elemental calcium (from diet and supplements) in divided doses of ≤ 500 mg per dose to increase absorption.
Dosage is 2 tsp for about 300 mg. Most people take 2 tsp twice a day. If you get a slight laxative effect with it, just take one tsp four times a day. Or you can mix the powder in your drinking water and sip throughout the day. If you get the laxative effect in spite of all that, take ReMag. The dosage is 10-15 sprays twice a day. One tsp has about 2,500 mg of elemental magnesium. Do your own measurements and find out how much you are getting from your spray bottle and look to get 300 mg per dose. In summary, for Natural Calm and Magnesium oil, my usual recommendation is to take 300 mg twice a day, which is twice the RDA for women
For adults, the UL for magnesium is 350 mg per day. For children ages 4 to 8 years old, the UL decreases to 110 mg per day, and the UL for children 1 to 3 years old is 65 mg per day. Magnesium oxide is a common salt formulation of the mineral magnesium. Your body needs magnesium for numerous vital biological functions, including maintaining a steady heartbeat and proper nervous system function.
Usual Dose Range: 1 to 40 g daily. Electrolyte Replenisher: Intramuscular 1 to 2 g in 50% solution four times a day until serum magnesium is within normal limits. Usual Pediatric Dose: Intramuscular 20 to 40 mg per kg of body weight in a 20% solution repeated as necessary. For Eclampsia: Initially 1 to 2 g in 25% or 50% solution is given intramuscularly.
The usual dose is 100 milligrams per day for younger children and 200 milligrams for older children, taken at bedtime. If the child’s diet is low in calcium, it may be necessary to add a calcium supplement, also taken at bedtime, generally 400 milligrams for younger children and 800 milligrams for older children. Most supplements will not contain more than 100 mg of magnesium because of bulk. However, because magnesium is so plentiful, a diet rich in magnesium is the best way to keep your stores up, and it’s easy to maintain.
When there is a deficiency, the dose will be increased. When magnesium citrate is used as a laxative, for treating constipation, a common dose is approximately 2800 mg of elemental magnesium per single dose. This is six times the usual nutritional recommendation, and it should only be used for up to five days. If you are taking magnesium as a laxative, the syrup contains 1.745 grams (1,745 mg) of magnesium citrate per ounce, and the dose for someone 12 years or older is 10 oz with an 8 oz glass of water. This provides 17.45 g of magnesium citrate, which has 2,000 mg of elemental magnesium.
Tap, mineral, and bottled waters can also be sources of magnesium, but the amount of magnesium in water varies by source and brand (ranging from 1 mg/L to more than 120 mg/L) [ 8 ]. Approximately 30% to 40% of the dietary magnesium consumed is typically absorbed by the body [ 2, 9 ]. 
However, researchers believe that these would be too low of a starting dose for supplementation to correct deficiencies, and that around 600 mg would be a better starting dose. When Mg substitution is started, the minimum dose to be applied is 600 mg Mg per day. The therapy should proceed for more than one month.... If you get loose stools or stomach upset at that magnesium dosage, then take it 3 or even 4 times per day for 3 to 4 days. Don’t assume that you are taking too much magnesium simply because you have loose stools, but be sure to know the symptoms of a Magnesium Overdose and to stop taking it if you begin to feel worse.
