After reading a couple of forums on how to speed it up (which basically only increased the speed of the emulator slightly)...I've figured out a way, my own way, how to make it run faster...no lag in the music or nuthin. Here's a few more things I learnt from a youtube video I saw. You can add more speed to your desmume by downloading game booster 2 to temporarily stop programs in the background, don't worry you can switch it back and forth.
Instructions shown in the video (step by step): 1. Download DeSmuME 0.9.9 from desmume.org (the links to the emulators are also above). 2. The file should be a .zip file. If you don't have an archiving program (WinRAR, WinZIP, 7zip, ect.), you will not be able to open this type of file (same goes for .rar, .7zip, ect.). 9. In the Config tab, you CAN go to Firmware Settings and set your personal preferences (honestly, I have no idea what it is for). 10. In the Config tab, you CAN go to Microphone Settings and change something if you know what it's all about. However, the default settings are fine to me. 11

Be aware though that to run something at 1000% speed, your computer needs to be able to emulate it ten times faster than what it's limited to. Which it won't. You'll likely get anything between 100% and 120%.
