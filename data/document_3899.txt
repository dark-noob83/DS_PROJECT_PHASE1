ovum. pl. ova [L.] egg; the female reproductive or germ cell which, after fertilization, is capable of developing into a new member of the same species; sometimes applied to any stage of the fertilized germ cell during cleavage and even until hatching or birth of the new animal.
All sexually reproducing organisms make sex cells called gametes. The gamete produced by the female is called the egg or ovum (plural = ova). It joins with the sperm, the male gamete, during fertilization to form the embryo, which will eventually grow into a new organism.
Answer by 1Jazz. Confidence votes 9.4K. Ova is the plural for ovum, which is the female gamete (sex cell). An ovum can also be called an egg. Its function is to fuse with a sperm cell during fertilization, and create a zygote. This can then go on to create a new organism (offspring).
The term ovum is usually restricted to the single female sex cell, but the term egg, in its common use to indicate a bird's egg, refers to a more complex structure, only part of which is produced in the ovary of the bird. The ovum of such an egg is a cell swollen with yolk material.
