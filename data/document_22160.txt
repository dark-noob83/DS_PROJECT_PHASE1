Lutino. Blue Series birds are: Turquoise, D Turquoise (Parblue Cobalt), DD Turquoise (Parblue Mauve), and Turquoise Ino (Creamino). There is no “true blue” in linnies and the Blue Series colors are considered parblue mutations. Since there is no true blue in the Lineolated Parakeet there is also no Albino mutation. Turquoise.
The same trend is exhibited in the Blue series with Turquoise, Parblue Cobalt (D Turquoise), and Parblue Mauve (DD Turquoise), respectively. Green Series birds are: Green (Normal; Wild color), D Green (Dark Green), DD Green (Olive) and Lutino.
The lineolated parakeet is also known as the linnie. Linnies come in lutino, albino, cobalt, blue and mauve color mutations, as well as the green color of wild lineolated parakeets and a dark green and olive green. They are native to Central and South America.
They come in Green, which is their normal or wild color, as well as many color mutations. Turquoise, Cobalt, Mauve, Blue Olive, Lutino and Cremino are a few of the more popular colors. The genetics are simple recessive with the exception of the Lutino which is sex linked.
Ad. While wild lineolated parakeets are mostly green, with darker stripes, a great variety of color mutations are available in birds that have been bred as pets. Silver, violet, cinnamon, white, and different shades of blue and yellow birds exist.
A hybrid bird is different from a bird that has a color mutation. For example, in the photograph below, both birds are of the same species (Lineolated Parakeets), but the blue (cobalt) bird carries two different mutations that affect her color.
