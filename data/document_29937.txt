One way in which cells can control diffusion is through the control of movement of particular types of molecules. Some molecules can pass freely through a cellular membrane. Large polar molecules and ions cannot diffuse through the lipid bilayer. Carrier proteins can move molecules across the membrane.
When the substance diffusing is water, the process is called osmosis. In biological organisms, diffusion often occurs across a semi-permeable membrane -- a filter that only allows certainly things to freely pass through it. The two main types of diffusion are passive diffusion and facilitated diffusion. The two main types of osmosis are regular osmosis and chemiosmosis.
Receptors in Facilitated Diffusion. Two types of proteins are involved in facilitated diffusion. Carrier proteins (also called permeases or transporters) such as the glucose transporter (GLUT1) move solute molecules across a membrane, Channels facilitate diffusion of ions down a concentration gradient.
A. Simple diffusion does not require energy: facilitated diffusion requires a source of ATP. B. Simple diffusion can only move material in the direction of a concentration gradient; facilitated diffusion moves materials with and against a concentration gradient.
Facilitated diffusion is the flow of molecules down a concentration gradient, across a membrane, but requires the help of a protein. There are two categories of proteins that assist facilitated diffusion: carrier proteins and channel proteins. Carrier proteins are like taxi cabs in a cell membrane.
Answers. FACILITATED DIFFUSION. In facilitated diffusion, substances move into or out of cells down their concentration gradient through protein channels in the cell membrane. Simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion are similar in that both involve movement down the concentration gradient.
