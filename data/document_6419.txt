In an average healthy adult, the volume of blood is about one-eleventh of the body weight. Most sources state the volume of blood in an average human adult, who is between 150 to 160 pounds, as between 4.7 and 5 liters, although the more recent sources state the volume of blood in an average adult as 4.7 liters.
Scientists estimate the volume of blood in a human body to be approximately 7 percent of body weight. An average adult body with a weight of 150 to 180 pounds will contain approximately 4.7 to 5.5 liters (1.2 to 1.5 gallons) of blood. An average child with a body weight of 80 pounds will have approximately half the amount of blood as an adult.
The total blood volume for an average 70 kg human (150 pounds) is approximately 5.5 liters (or a little more than 5 1/2 quarts, or a little more than 160 ounces)!!!   For a person weighing approximately 150 pounds,the blood volume is on average about 5 litres or 8.8 pints.   If the person is larger or smaller the blood volume would change accordingly.   One litre of volume equals 1.76 pints.

Confidence votes 352. The amount of blood in the human body depends on size. An average man of 150 lbs or 70 kgs will have around 8 pints or 5.2 litres of blood. A woman of 110 lbs (50 kgs) will have about 3.3 litres of blood; about 5 pints. (However, 110 lbs is a petite size!).
