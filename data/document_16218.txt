Reference Range. Bilirubin is a tetrapyrrole and a breakdown product of heme catabolism. Most bilirubin (70%-90%) is derived from hemoglobin degradation and, to a lesser extent, from other hemo proteins. In the serum, bilirubin is usually measured as both direct bilirubin (DBil) and total-value bilirubin (TBil).
Bilirubin is a byproduct of red blood cell destruction and exists in a free form (unconjugated or indirect biliruin) until it is taken up by liver cells. Here it is converted into a soluble form (conjugated or direct bilirubin) by binding with glucuronic acid which is catalyzed by the enzyme glucuronyl transferase.
Indirect bilirubin correlates with unconjugated bilirubin but tends to underestimate unconjugated bilirubin, as a portion of the unconjugated bilirubin reacts with diazosulfanilic acid, producing azobilirubin, which is measured as direct bilirubin. The reference range of total bilirubin is 0.2-1.2 mg/dL.
Bilirubin is oxidized by vanadate at about pH 3 to produce biliverdin. In the presence of a detergent and vanadate, either conjugated (direct) or both conjugated (direct) and unconjugated bilirubin are oxidized.
1-17 years: 5.1-5.9 mg/dL. Pediatric ranges derived for GEM method from analytic comparison to reference method in: Snell J, Greeley C, Colaco A, et al: Pediatric reference ranges for arterial pH, whole blood electrolytes and glucose.
Schnabl, Khun and Adeli eJIFCC 2008, 19 (2) Pediatric Reference Intervals 6 Decision limits as well as reference intervals should be used for certain analytes eg. cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin and neonatal bilirubin. Validation vs. establishment of reference intervals by a laboratory is acceptable.
