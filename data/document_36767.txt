...DISH is absolutely a real disease/diagnosis. The condition has also gone by the names of Marie-Strumpel arthritis and Forrestier's disease. ...It is an acronym for Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis.
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a condition that causes bone to form in abnormal places. DISH most commonly affects the mid back (thoracic spine) but may also affect the neck (cervical spine), low back (lumbar spine), hips, heels, and other areas.
Definition. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a bony hardening (calcification) of ligaments in areas where they attach to your spine. Also known as Forestier's disease, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis may cause no symptoms and require no treatment. The most common symptoms are mild to moderate pain and stiffness in your upper back. DISH can also affect your neck and lower back.
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a disorder in which there is bone growth in the ligaments, particularly where they attach to the bones of the spine. You may have no symptoms. Or you could have minor spinal stiffness and pain. Over time your spine will stiffen and your vertebrae may fuse together.
