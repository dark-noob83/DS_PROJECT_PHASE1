, 2002), H3-K9 methylation (methylation of a specific lysine residue in the histone H3) is required in order for DNA methylation to take place. However, exceptions have been observed in which the relationship is reversed. , 2004). After deamination, the DNA has a mismatch and is repaired, causing it to become demethylated. In fact, studies using inhibitors of one DNMT enzyme showed that this enzyme was involved in not only DNA methylation, but also in the removal of amino groups.
Plantae are the most highly methylated eukaryotes, with up to 50% of their cytosine residues exhibiting methylation. Interestingly, in Fungi, only repetitive DNA sequences are methylated, and in some species, methylation is absent altogether, or it occurs on the DNA of transposable elements in the genome. , 2004). After deamination, the DNA has a mismatch and is repaired, causing it to become demethylated. In fact, studies using inhibitors of one DNMT enzyme showed that this enzyme was involved in not only DNA methylation, but also in the removal of amino groups.
Abstract. A much wider variety of biological functions of postreplicative DNA methylation is observed in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes. In eukaryotes DNA methylation is primarily a means of the control of gene expression. Many chapters of this book are devoted to various aspects of this function. 
Regulation of DNA methylation in eukaryotic cell. There are two basic types of normal methylation processes known in eukaryotic cells. First is de novo methylation which is involved in the rearrangement of methylation pattern during embryogenesis or differentiation processes in adult cells [10,11]. Another mechanism of transcription regulation by methylation of single sites involves methylation dependent binding proteins (MDBPs). MeCP1 described by Meehan et al. needs at least 7 methylated CpGs for efficient DNA binding and therefore is less important for genes without CpG islands in the promoters [ 35 ].
Eukaryotic DNA methylation. Cooper DN. Eukaryotic genomes contain 5-methylcytosine (5mC) as a rare base.5mC arises by postsynthetic modification of cytosine and occurs, at least in animals, predominantly in the dinucleotide CpG. The base is not distributed randomly in these genomes but conforms to a patter
The hypothesis on the involvement of DNA methylation in the repair process in eukaryotes was disproved by Araujo et al [7]. It was shown that methylation in eukaryotic cells occurs immediately after replication and even Okazaki fragments are already methylated [7]. Another mechanism of transcription regulation by methylation of single sites involves methylation dependent binding proteins (MDBPs). MeCP1 described by Meehan et al. needs at least 7 methylated CpGs for efficient DNA binding and therefore is less important for genes without CpG islands in the promoters [ 35 ].
Adenine methylation is restricted to prokaryotes.The rate of cytosine DNA methylation differs strongly between species: 14% of cytosines are methylated in Arabidopsis thaliana, 4% in Mus musculus, 2.3% in Escherichia coli, 0.03% in Drosophila yeast species. Adenine or cytosine methylation is part of the restriction modification system of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A methylase is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence.

Recent advances have expanded our understanding of the processes underlying the establishment, maintenance, and elaboration of DNA methylation patterns in eukaryotes.
DNA methylation can stably alter the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, preventing a cell from reverting to a stem cell or converting into a different cell type. Adenine or cytosine methylation is part of the restriction modification system of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A methylase is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence.
There are many ways that gene expression is controlled in eukaryotes, but methylation of DNA (not to be confused with histone methylation) is a common epigenetic signaling tool that cells use to lock genes in the off position. , 2004). After deamination, the DNA has a mismatch and is repaired, causing it to become demethylated. In fact, studies using inhibitors of one DNMT enzyme showed that this enzyme was involved in not only DNA methylation, but also in the removal of amino groups.
