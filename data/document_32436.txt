Oxidation-reduction or redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between one reactant and another in such a way that the oxidation state of the reactants changes.
Oxidation and reduction. Oxidation is the gain of oxygen by a substance. For example, magnesium is oxidised when it reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide: magnesium + oxygen → magnesium oxide. 2Mg + O 2 → 2MgO. Reduction is the loss of oxygen from a substance. For example, copper oxide can be reduced to form copper if it is reacted with hydrogen: copper oxide + hydrogen → copper + water. CuO + H 2 → Cu + H 2 O. Many ores contain metal oxides, therefore many metals can be extracted from their ores by reduction reactions.
To help you to remember that oxidation means losing electrons and reduction means gaining electrons, remember O I L R I G (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain-of electrons). Oxidation and reduction always occur together. They are called redox reactions (pronounced reed-ox for reduction / oxidation).
Valency, Oxidation State and Ionic Compounds. When a metal reacts with a non-metal, the metal will lose electrons to form a positive ion and the non-metal will gain electrons to form a negative ion. The compound which is formed will be ionic.
The number of electrons that a metal will lose is the same as its group number in the periodic table. A metal in group 1 will form a 1+ ion (Valency 1, oxidation state 1+). A metal in group 2 will form a 2+ ion (Valency 2, oxidation state 2+).
In simple terms, oxidation is the gain of oxygen. We can say that magnesium is oxidised as it becomes magnesium oxide when it is burned in the air. Oxidation can also be considered as part of a pair of changes that go at the same time: red uction and ox idation (redox). Reduction can be considered as the removal of oxgen from a substance.
