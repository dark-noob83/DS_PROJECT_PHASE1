Umami (/uˈmɑːmi/), a savory taste, is one of the five basic tastes (together with sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and saltiness). A loanword from the Japanese (うま味) , umami can be translated as pleasant savory taste. This particular writing was chosen by Professor Kikunae Ikeda from umai (うまい) delicious and mi (味) taste. The kanji 旨味 are used for a more general sense of a food as delicious. Umami enhances the palatability of a wide variety of foods. Glutamate in acid form (glutamic acid) imparts little umami taste, whereas the salts of glutamic acid, known as glutamates, can easily ionize and give the characteristic umami taste. GMP and IMP amplify the taste intensity of glutamate.
Because the umami taste is experienced in a wide variety of foods, the taste of umami is often regarded as distinctive and unique to individual foods. 
tweet. email. You probably eat umami all the time: It's that meaty, savory, brothlike, full-flavor taste we get from things like Parmesan cheese, mushrooms and red wine. Generally speaking, the more mature a food is (say, a Parmesan cheese versus a younger cheese like mozzarella), the more umami flavor it will have. And as a result we eat more food. So, umami-rich food creates satisfaction. Also, umami makes salt taste saltier. So, if you want to reduce the amount of sodium that's in your diet, you make sure you have a lot of umami in your food and you don't have to salt it as much.
As such, it's no surprise that most foods contain some amount of glutamate. Protein foods, such as meat, fish, cheese, milk and some vegetables are especially good sources of glutamate. Not coincidentally, these foods also have a lot of umami taste. Rather, the umami taste is one of richness, fullness and complexity. Simply put, it just makes the food taste more delicious. Glutamate's the key The amino acid glutamate could well be called nature's flavor enhancer because it conveys the umami taste in foods. Glutamate is also well known among food and nutrition professionals as one of the most common building blocks of protein
Umami is considered a savory taste sensation and is often confused with saltiness. Because our tongues have specific taste receptors for L-glutamate, one of the compounds responsible for umami flavor, it is considered a distinctly different taste than saltiness. Broths made with vegetables and meat or seafood have a strong umami flavor. Photo by Lori L. Stalteri [flickr]. Umami is one of the five basic taste sensations, yet most Americans have never heard of it. Umami is subtle and can be hard to recognize, but it has a great impact on the sensory experience of eating.
Glutamate is naturally present in most foods, such as meat, seafood and vegetables. Two kinds of nucleotides that contribute most to the umami taste, inosinate and guanylate, are also present in many foods. Inosinate is found primarily in meat, whereas guanylate is more abundant in vegetables. In Natural Occurrence, lower left, we deliver short stories featuring umami rich ingredient
People taste umami through receptors for glutamate, commonly found in its salt form as the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG). For that reason, scientists consider umami to be distinct from saltiness. Umami enhances the palatability of a wide variety of foods. Glutamate in acid form (glutamic acid) imparts little umami taste, whereas the salts of glutamic acid, known as glutamates, can easily ionize and give the characteristic umami taste. GMP and IMP amplify the taste intensity of glutamate.
Umami is a Japanese word, meaning delicious and savoury, which has been shown to be distinct from saltiness. It is found in foods that contain high levels of glutamate, such as cured meats, shellfish, soy sauce, cheese and green tea, and other foods rich in protein. The ability to taste umami in food could have an effect on overall health, particularly in older people, Japanese researchers suggest. Sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami are the five basic tastes.
