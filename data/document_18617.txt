How chemotherapy kills cancer cells. Chemotherapy kills cells that are in the process of splitting into 2 new cells. Body tissues are made of billions of individual cells. Once we are fully grown, most of the body's cells don't divide and multiply much. Partial remission means the treatment has killed some of the cells, but not all. The cancer has shrunk, but can still be seen on scans and doesn't appear to be growing. The treatment may have stopped the cancer from growing.
Scientists knew that oleocanthal killed some cancer cells, but weren’t really sure how. They thought the compound might be targeting a key protein in cancer cells that triggers a programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, and decided to test their hypothesis. 
Comments. Cancer cells can be destroyed in the bloodstream to prevent them from reaching healthy organs, scientists have found, in a breakthrough which could prevent 90 per cent of deaths. Researchers have developed a method of attaching cancer-killing proteins to white blood cells which travel through the blood. Now researchers believe they can kill cancer as it travels through the bloodstream and prevent the disease from metastasising, or infecting other organs. These circulating cancer cells are doomed,” said Michael King, professor of biomedical engineering at Cornell University in the US.
Doctors who elect for the surgical method of treatment perform an operation to remove cancerous tumors and cells, and they may follow that up with one of the other methods. Chemotherapy uses medication, which can be administered in pill form or intravenously, to zap and kill cancer cells. Pac-Man runs through mazes and chomps down every single pac-dot, but we lack the ability to track down and kill cancer cells as easily. Rather, we have surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, which are the three most common tools for treating cancer.
Because cancer cells divide much more often than most normal cells, they are more likely to be killed by chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs kill dividing cells by damaging the part of the cell's control centre that makes it divide. Other chemotherapy drugs interrupt chemical processes involved in cell division. Partial remission means the treatment has killed some of the cells, but not all. The cancer has shrunk, but can still be seen on scans and doesn't appear to be growing. The treatment may have stopped the cancer from growing.
Scientists at Cornell University have discovered that injecting proteins into the blood attracts and kills cancer cells before they can spread from primary tumours to healthy organs.

If the cancer cells are unable to divide, they die. The faster that cancer cells divide, the more likely it is that chemotherapy will kill the cells, causing the tumor to shrink. They also induce cell suicide (self-death or apoptosis). Chemotherapy drugs that kill cancer cells only when they are dividing are called cell-cycle specific. Chemotherapy drugs that kill cancer cells when they are at rest are called cell-cycle non-specific. The scheduling of chemotherapy is set based on the type of cells, rate at which they divide, and the time at which a given drug is likely to be effective. This is why chemotherapy is typically given in cycles. The process of cell division, whether normal or cancerous cells, is through the cell cycle. The cell cycle goes from the resting phase, through active growing phases, and then to mitosis (division). The ability of chemotherapy to kill cancer cells depends on its ability to halt cell division.
How chemotherapy kills cancer cells. Chemotherapy kills cells that are in the process of splitting into 2 new cells. This is how normal body tissues grow. But cancer cells divide much more often than normal cells, so they are more likely to be killed by chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs kill dividing cells by damaging the part of the control centre inside each cell that makes it divide. Partial remission means the treatment has killed some of the cells, but not all. The cancer has shrunk, but can still be seen on scans and doesn't appear to be growing. The treatment may have stopped the cancer from growing.
Genes control how cells grow and divide. When radiation damages the genes of cancer cells, they can’t grow and divide any more. Over time, the cells die. This means radiation can be used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy kills cancer cells that are dividing, but it also affects dividing cells of normal tissues. The damage to normal cells causes unwanted side effects. Radiation therapy is always a balance between destroying the cancer cells and minimizing damage to the normal cells.
