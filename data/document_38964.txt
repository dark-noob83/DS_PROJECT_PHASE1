Gluteus maximus. The gluteus maximus muscle is located in the buttocks and is regarded as one of the strongest muscles in the human body. It is connected to the coccyx, or tailbone, as well as other surrounding bones. The gluteus maximus muscle is responsible for movement of the hip and thigh.
Structure [edit]. The gluteus maximus is the largest of the gluteal muscles and one of the strongest muscles in the human body. It inserts at the iliotibial band and the gluteal tuberosity of the femur. Its action is to extend and to laterally rotate the hip, and also to extend the trunk.
The gluteus maximus is generally referred to as the biggest muscle in the human body. It is in fact the most massive muscle of the human body. The glutes, as they are commonly known, are a group of three muscles located at the back of each hip or buttock. The gluteus maximus is the largest and most superficial muscle of the group. It contributes most of the mass that can be seen as the buttocks.
The gluteus medius muscle is partially covered, on its lower-third part, by the gluteus maximus muscle. This makes up what is commonly referred to as the buttocks. The gluteus medius works to provide rotation of the thigh outward from the center of the body, which enables a steady walking gait.
