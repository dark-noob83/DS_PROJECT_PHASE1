9. Notice that the choroid coat in the cow's eye is very colorful and shiny. This reflective material is the tapetum lucidum, and its reflective properties allow a cow to see at night by reflecting the light that is absorbed through the retina back into the retina. By dissecting and examining the anatomy of a preserved cow eye, you can learn how your own eye forms images of the world and sends these images to your brain. This dissection guide is complete enough for a high school lab, or the pictures can be used to just get an idea of what the eye looks like inside.

The tapetum lucidum, which is not found in the human eye, functions to reflect light onto the retina. It especailly helps with night vision since it can reflect light even at very low intensities. Human's don't have the tapetum lucidum layer. This is present in animal eyes. It's what causes them to glow … in the dark. There sometimes is a rare occurrence when it does happen in humans, which causes them to lose their sight.
Eyeshine is a visible effect of the tapetum lucidum. When light shines into the eye of an animal having a tapetum lucidum, the pupil appears to glow. Eyeshine can be seen in many animals, in nature and in flash photographs. The tapetum lucidum, which is iridescent, reflects light roughly on the interference principles of thin-film optics, as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the tapetum lucidum cells are leucophores, not iridophores. The tapetum lucidum is a retroreflector of the transparent sphere type.

The tapetum lucidum /təˈpiːtəm/ (Latin : bright tapestry, plural tapeta lucida) is a layer of tissue in the eye of many vertebrates. The tapetum lucidum, which is iridescent, reflects light roughly on the interference principles of thin-film optics, as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the tapetum lucidum cells are leucophores, not iridophores. The tapetum lucidum is a retroreflector of the transparent sphere type.
tapetum lucidum. the iridescent reflecting tissue layer of the choroid of some species of animals that gives their eyes the property of shining in the dark. It is characteristic of nocturnal animals and allows incident light two opportunities to stimulate the retinal receptors. Called also choroidal tapetum. tapetum lucidum. A reflecting pigment layer lying behind the visual receptors of the retina of certain mammals (e.g. cats, dogs), birds and fish, which gives a shining appearance to the eyes when illuminated
The tapdeum lucidum is a reflective membrane in the cow's eye that allows it to see better in low light (such as at dawn or dusk). Human's don't have the tapetum lucidum layer. This is present in animal eyes. It's what causes them to glow … in the dark. There sometimes is a rare occurrence when it does happen in humans, which causes them to lose their sight. I don't remember the name of the disease that my professor said it is though.
tapetum lucidum. A layer of tissue in the choroid of the eye between the vascular and capillary layers in some animals, but not in humans. This membrane reflects light shined into the animal's eyes. tapetum lucidum. A reflecting pigment layer lying behind the visual receptors of the retina of certain mammals (e.g. cats, dogs), birds and fish, which gives a shining appearance to the eyes when illuminated in the dark.
