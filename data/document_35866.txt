Multiply your height in inches by 0.413. This is a predetermined number that figures out average stride length. Then convert your stride length back to feet for the next step. (63 inches x 0.413 = 26.019 inches per stride. 26.019 inches/12 inches per foot = 2.16825 feet per stride.). 3. Find How Many Steps You Walk In A Mile. Divide 5,280 by your average stride length in feet. (5,280/2.16825 feet = 2,435 steps per mile.). Remember, stride length changes based on speed, but both of these ways provide approximate calculations to help you figure out the number of steps you take in a mile
The length of the average stride in running can vary according to the runner's height, how fast he or she is running and the surface and slope he or she is running on. In general, the shorter the distance, the longer the average stride length. When exercise physiologist Jack Daniels analyzed runnersâ€™ stride lengths at the 1984 Olympics, he found that women distance runners had an average stride length of 58 inches, while women sprinters averaged strides of 80 inches. For men, the average stride was 74 inches for distance runners and 93 inches for sprinters.
Since there are 5,280 feet in a mile, divide 5,280 by your average stride length in feet. (5,280/Average Stride Length In Feet = Your Number of Steps Per Mile.). Option 2: Use the Formula. This method may not be as accurate as measuring your exact steps. Then convert your stride length back to feet for the next step. (63 inches x 0.413 = 26.019 inches per stride. 26.019 inches/12 inches per foot = 2.16825 feet per stride.). 3. Find How Many Steps You Walk In A Mile. D
This means that for the average person, the approximate distance from the initial point of contact of your left heel and the initial point of contact of your right heel is about 32 inches. The average stride length, or two steps, is about 62 inches, or a little more than 5 feet. For walking programs, women are encouraged to use an average step length of 26 inches and men are encouraged to use an average step length of 30 inches.
The American College of Sports Medicine reports that there are approximately 2,000 steps in one mile, so the average step length is 2.6 feet or about 31 inches. For walking programs, women are encouraged to use an average step length of 26 inches and men are encouraged to use an average step length of 30 inches.
They found a slightly shorter stride length associated with faster times in the 100 meters. The competitors measured right around 2 meters -- 80 inches or so -- or longer in terms of stride length. The height of the competitors ranged from 160 to 164 cm in height, or 5 feet, 3 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches tall. Success in competitive running in the sprint distances depends on a simple but ironclad formula: Stride length times stride rate equals speed. So if you run in the 100 to 400 meters, you may want to measure your stride length and compare it to typical averages.
Average stride length: 2.2 feet for women and 2.5 feet for man or you can estimate stride length relative to your height (females: height x .413 equals your stride length; males: height x .415 equals your stride length). The average stride length for men is 0.78 m and 0.7 m for women. An approximation to your personal walking stride is multiplying your height with 0.415 (or 0.413 for women).
If you are an average American woman of 5 feet, 4 inches in height, or 64 inches, you can anticipate that your length per stride will be in the range of 73 to 86 inches. Success in competitive running in the sprint distances depends on a simple but ironclad formula: Stride length times stride rate equals speed. So if you run in the 100 to 400 meters, you may want to measure your stride length and compare it to typical averages.
Stride length is measured from heel to heel and determines how far you walk with each step. On average, a man's walking stride length is 2.5 feet, or 30 inches, according to Arizona State University Extension. A woman's average stride length is 2.2 feet, or 26.4 inches, reports the school. In general, people with longer legs have a greater stride length than those with shorter legs. For example, if you travel 290 inches in 10 steps, you average 29 inches per step, which is about 2.4 feet. Another method is to step in a puddle of water, walk 10 steps and measure the stride length between three wet steps.
While averages can be useful, it's fairly simple to find your own stride length. One way is to walk 10 steps, measure the distance from the starting and stopping point, then divide the number by 10. For example, if you travel 290 inches in 10 steps, you average 29 inches per step, which is about 2.4 feet. Another method is to step in a puddle of water, walk 10 steps and measure the stride length between three wet steps. Average those distances to find your average stride rate
