An atom is the smallest possible particle of a chemical element consisting pr protons, electrons and (usually) neutrons. An isotope is one variant of an element with a given … number of neutrons. Different isotopes of an element have different numbers
Isotopes are atoms (as regular as any!) which differ in number of neutrons in the nucleus. For example, hydrogen isotopes are: protium (nucleus contains 1 p),deuterium (1 p + … 1 n), andtritium (1 p + 2 n). An isotope is an atom that has a different number of neutrons than normal.
Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same numbers of protons and electrons but different numbers of neutrons. The difference in the number of neutrons between the various isotopes of an element means that the various isotopes have similar charges but different masses.
Isotopes: Different Types of Atoms. Atoms in a chemical element that have different numbers of neutrons than protons and electrons are called isotopes. The atoms in a particular element have an identical number of protons and electrons but can have varying numbers of neutrons.
Answer by Umbr3on. Confidence votes 487. an isotope is an atom that is heavier or lighter than a normal atom of the same element. the number of protons is different. for example, carbon usually has an atomic mass of 12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. but in carbon 14 (an isotope of carbon), there are 6 protons and 8 neutrons.
