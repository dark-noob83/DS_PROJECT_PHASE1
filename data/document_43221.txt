The answer is 15. We assume you are converting between gram [water] and tablespoon [metric] . You can view more details on each measurement unit: gram or tablespoon. The SI derived unit for volume is the cubic meter. 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000000 gram, or 66666.6666667
A: There are 14.3 grams in a tablespoon. Since grams and tablespoons are different measurements, it is difficult to precisely convert one to the other without knowing the exact ingredient. Grams measure how much an object weighs, while tablespoons measure the volume that an object takes up. Know More.

Different ingredients can have different weights; therefore, the exact number of grams in a tablespoon depends on the weight of the ingredient. For example, a teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams. Teaspoons and tablespoons can be converted easily. Three teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon, which means that 1 tablespoon equals about 4 x 3 grams of sugar, or 12 grams.
About 14 grams (granulated sugar). From the related question (How many cups of sugar are in one pound) and other sources, we have approx 2 cups of sugar per pound. There are â€¦ 16 tablespoons in 1 cup, so 32 tablespoons in 1 pound. A pound is approx 454 grams, so 454 / 32 = 14.1875.
