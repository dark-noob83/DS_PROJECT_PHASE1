A basement entry door can add light and ventilation to your lower-level living space, give you a private entrance to the basement, increase your home's value and make it easier to access your yard from the basement. According to building codes, a basement sleeping area must have two exits, with one to the exterior. These exits can be through an egress window or exterior entry door. In order to be counted as habitable space, your basement must have an exterior door or egress window
1. Edit Answer (for another -5 minute). If done properly & correctly, adding a walkout entrance from the basement will indeed add value to your home and does not weaken the foundation. The obstacle to overcome is introducing this stair carriage and the accompaning stair well into the first floor.

1 A lot depends on how much is included and the quality of the final project. 2  Finishing a basement in a relatively new home can start around $20 -$35 a square foot, or $30,000 -$70,000 for 1,500-2,000 square feet -- but it can cost $100,000 or more to create a fully-finished space. 1 For $500-$5,000, Do-It-Yourselfers can waterproof the walls with a brush-on compound, then add carpeting, paneling, a dropped ceiling or other touches to make a basement into a more usable living area.
