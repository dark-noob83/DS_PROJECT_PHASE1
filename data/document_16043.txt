You can buy a hearing aid anywhere, but it will only be as good as the person fitting it, says St. Joseph, Mich., audiologist Gyl A. Kasewurm. Using the average price of $4,400 for a pair of hearing aids, we break down the costs below. Please note that these figures are estimates drawn from a variety of sources, including discussions and correspondence with audiologists, manufacturers and industry experts. Overall cost — $4,400.

Here’s another way to think about the price of hearing aids. An average pair of hearing aids is $4800 and they have a life expectancy of about five years. If you break it down, the hearing aids will cost you $960 per year, $80 per month or $2.66 per day. In other words, while the initial amount sounds high, the ongoing usage price is reasonable.
The average cost of one digital hearing aid can range from $1500 to $3500. Take the average cost of a top of the line digital hearing aid - $3199.40, divide that cost by 5 years (the lower end of the life expectancy of a hearing aid) and it computes to $639.88 a year or $53.88 a month.
According to a survey recently published by the Hearing Review, the average price of a mid-level pair of aids hovers between $4,400 and $4,500. Prices vary by region. At UCLA's Audiology Clinic, for example, the average price is $4,200, says audiologist Alison Grimes.
