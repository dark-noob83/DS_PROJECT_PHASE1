The Phenomenon of alpha-Complementation in E. coli Cloning Systems. The E. coli enzyme beta-galactosidase is a homo-tetramer of the protein product of the lacZ gene. Certain mutations in the 5' region of lacZ prevent subunit association.
ABSTRACT. A definition of the term alpha complementation, is presented. The term refers to a small part of beta-galactosidase that gives rise to a truncated protein that forms an enzymatically active hetero dimer with a specific mutant beta-galactosidase. ACCESSION #.
Alpha Complementation method for Bacterial Screening. Alpha complementation is a method for bacterial screening that have been transformed with a plasmid vector, carrying the N-terminal coding sequence for Î²-galactosidase of the lac operon. The lac Z gene is required for galactosidase metabolism.
The omega fragment is found in E. coli chromosome, which is the carboxyterminus of the protein and is nonfunctional alone. When the alpha and omega fragments interact, they become functional and beta-galactosidase protein can be produced. This interaction is known as alpha complementation. It is useful during the screening of beta-galactosidase assay. Artificial galactosides like X-Gal which acts as a substrate for beta-galactosidase and leaves a blue precipitate when hydrolyzed therefore pUC8-transformed E. coli colonies appear blue.

Such lacZ mutants are said to be subject to alpha-complementation.. The product of the allele lacZ D M15 lacks amino acids 11-41 of wild-type beta-galactosidase and is subject to a
