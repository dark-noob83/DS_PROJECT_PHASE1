Nevertheless, this invention of the ironing board was patented, and Boone was said to be among the first African Americans who garnered a patent for a particular useful invention. Its patent (U.S. Patent #473,653) was done in the 26th of April in 1892.
Best Answer: The electric iron was invented in 1882 by Henry W. Seeley, a New York inventor Seeley patented his electric flatiron on June 6, 1882 (patent no. 259,054). His iron weighed almost 15 pounds and took a long time to warm up.
By the 1820s, cast iron was also used to make flatirons. These irons were called sad irons because they were heavy, weighing about 15 lb (5.6 kg), and hard to move. Like flatirons, sad irons were heated on the stovetop, but they sometimes heated unevenly. The handle also heated up, which posed problems for users.
The Hotpoint iron, designed by Earl H. Richardson of Ontario, California, was launched in 1905, and was the first electric iron to have any commercial success. By the 1920s enough people had homes wired for electricity for electric clothes irons to spread fast across the US.
Before heated dryers were invented, irons served another purpose as well. Hot irons killed parasites and bacteria in clothing, and eliminated mildew. Most modern irons are made of metal and plastic, and have many features such as steam, temperature controls, and automatic shutoff.
A clothes iron is a household appliance used to press the wrinkles out of and creases into clothes. When the iron is turned on, the consumer moves it over an item of clothing on an ironing board. The combination of heat and pressure removes wrinkles.
If there was no one who invented the iron, you could probably imagine how everyoneâ€™s clothes would look like after being washed and hanged on the clothesline to dry before using. Most probably, it would look really horrid with all its wrinkles and creases.
