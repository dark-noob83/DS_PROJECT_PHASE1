Since Uber's launch, several other companies have copied its business model, a trend that has come to be referred to as Uberification. Uber was founded as UberCab by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp in 2009 and the app was released the following June. Beginning in 2012, Uber expanded internationally. In 2014, it experimented with carpooling features and made other updates. In some cities, if the Uber car is travelling at a speed greater than 11 mph (18 km/h), the price is calculated on a distance basis, otherwise, the price is calculated on a time basis. At the end of a ride, the complete fare is automatically billed to the customer's credit card.
