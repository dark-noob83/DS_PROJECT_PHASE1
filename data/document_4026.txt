Location of the Mariana Trench. The Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans. It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, to the east of the Mariana Islands. The trench is about 2,550 kilometres (1,580 mi) long but has an average width of only 69 kilometres (43 mi). 
Pacific Ocean is 12999 meters deep. The deepest point in the Pacific Ocean is in the Mariana Trench. It is in western part of ocean and near the fourteen Mariana Islands. It is in the shape of semi-circle. It has the length of two thousand five hundred and fifty meters from north east to southwest and width of nearly seventy kilometers. Pacific Ocean is the largest of all the water bodies on the earth. It has got its name from a Latin word a€œMare Oemare€ œmare pacificuma pacificumâ€which means€ a â Oepeaceful œpeaceful seaa Seaâ given. By Ferdinand magellan a portuguese explorer.

down! The average depth of the ocean is about. . The deepest part of the ocean is called the Challenger Deep and is located beneath the western Pacific Ocean in the southern end of the Mariana Trench, which runs several hundred kilometers southwest of the U.S. territorial island of Guam.

Located in the western Pacific east of the Philippines and an average of approximately 124 miles (200 kilometers) east of the Mariana Islands, the Mariana Trench is a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth’s crust that measures more than 1,500 miles (2,550 kilometers) long and 43 miles (69 kilometers) wide on average.

Best Answer: The greatest known depth of the Pacific Ocean is in the Mariana Trench which lies in the Western Pacific off the Southwest coast of Guam, it is approximately 10,911 metres (35,797 ft) below sea level. This is also the lowest point on Earth. The average depth of the Pacific Ocean is 4,280 metres (14,000 ft). Because of the depth of the Pacific Ocean, tsunamis (huge waves created by earthquakes) can reach speeds of 750 kilometers an hour, the same velocity as a jet airplane.
But just how deep is the Mariana Trench? First off, here are the average depths of the earth's oceans; the Arctic Ocean is 1,038 meters (3,407 feet) deep, the Indian Ocean is 3,872 meters (12,740 feet) deep, the Atlantic Ocean is 3,872 meters (12,254 feet) deep and the Pacific Ocean is 4,188 meters (13,740 feet) deep. 
Confidence votes 66. Its average depth is 4,637 meters (2.8 miles). It is home to the deepest known point in the ocean-the Mariana Trench off Guam-which plunges to a depth of about 10,924 meters (nearly 7 miles). Because of the depth of the Pacific Ocean, tsunamis (huge waves created by earthquakes) can reach speeds of 750 kilometers an hour, the same velocity as a jet airplane. Real Deep ;)  Actually, it can get to 35,838 feet. That's how deep Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench off the Marianas Island in the Pacific Ocean gets. The U.S. Navy su … bmersible Trieste reached it in 1960. That's about a mile deeper than Mount Everest is high.
The ocean's second-deepest place is also in the Mariana Trench. The Sirena Deep, which lies 124 miles (200 kilometers) to the east of Challenger Deep, is a bruising 35,462 feet deep (10,809 m). 
The deepest point in the ocean is generally believed to be in the Marianas Trench in the Western Pacific Ocean at approximately 36,160 feet (11,021 m), according to the Rand McNally Atlas (1977).

Answer: The ocean's deepest area is the Mariana Trench (also called the Marianas Trench), which is about 11 km (almost 7 miles, or almost 36,000 feet) deep. The trench is 1,554 miles long and 44 miles wide, and is like the Grand Canyon of the ocean, although it is 120 times larger. Contrary to what you might picture, the trench is wide-according to NOAA, almost 5 times wider than it is deep. The Mariana Trench is located in the western North Pacific Ocean.
