Practically speaking, it is a sweetened tea that is fermented with a SCOBY (a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast) to become a nutrient-rich, low-sugar beverage. The fermentation process takes 7-12 days depending on temperature and the strength of the SCOBY and the over 90% of the sugar is used up in this process.

This action explains why people who suffer from candida can drink Kombucha.
