Pulling and destroying dodder infected plants is recommended. Dodder must be destroyed before it produces seeds or infestations will spread. Once established, dodder appears in patches in the field. Cutting the host plant prior to the dodder producing seed helps reduce the quantity of seed for the following year.
The pathogen also causes ramorum leaf blight or shoot blight on native plant species and horticultural nursery crops, and has plagued some nurseries in California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and in Europe. Parke, J. L., and S. Lucas. 2008.
Plants that are infected must be destroyed as the disease can be transmitted from plant to plant by contaminated sap. Symptoms include dark green ink bleed marks in the veins of yellow-colored leaves, and/or tissue collapse between veins.
Description [edit]. Hostas are herbaceous perennial plants, growing from rhizomes or stolons, with broad lanceolate or ovate leaves varying widely in size by species from 1–18 in (3–45 cm) long and 0.75–12 in (2–30 cm) broad. The smallest varieties are called miniatures.
Integrated Management. To eliminate cogongrass and prevent regrowth, the rhizomes must be destroyed. It has been shown that an integrated approach that combines burning, tillage (mechanical disturbance), and chemical applications provide the best solution for cogongrass management. Burning or Mowing.
