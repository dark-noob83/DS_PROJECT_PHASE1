As with most things, if you live in a big city, you can expect to pay more in moving costs than if you were to move in a small town. Moving companies in big cities charge as much as $20 more per mover per hour than companies in smaller cities and towns, which can add up quite a bit.
These charges are the minimum of what you can expect to pay. There are moving companies which will ask for $50 an hour or even as much as $120. What you decide to pay depends on how experienced you wish the relocation company you hire to be and on the differences between the costs set by those companies themselves.
The cost per hour per mover is about $25 – $30. How many hours of work will the movers do depends on the size of your home, how much stuff you’ve got in there, and if the movers are hired to pack or load/ unload. Hiring only moving labor could cost you about $50 to $70 per hour.
For two men and a truck, you may pay an hourly rate between $70 to over $120, again depending on your area and $45 to $65 for an extra mover-again, it varies from one company to another. More charges may apply though.
