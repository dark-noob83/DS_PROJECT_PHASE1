How Guppies Give Birth. When guppies give birth, the female will drop 2-200 baby guppies, called fry, typically in four to six hours. If she is stressed, however, the process to give birth to all the fry can take up to 12 hours. In extreme cases, a female guppy may give birth to just a few fry at a time, with pauses of several hours or days between births, although in most of these cases the young are not viable and die quickly.
The gestation period for guppies is from 21-30 days (22-26 days is average) depending on the tank's temperature, cleanliness, and the female's health.
Guppies live by a very simple equation: Boy guppy plus girl guppy equals baby guppies. Lots of babies -- a new litter about every 30 days. Because she can store sperm, the female guppy can produce new litters for up to a year, even if you separate her from males.
Guppies give birth to about 1-100 fry (baby guppies), depending on how old they are, and how healthy they are.
Generally speaking, guppies normally give birth to 20 - 30 fry. Now that's a lot of babies. However all guppies are different and it depends upon the guppy's age and if its her first batch. Younger ones generally have about 10- 20 while older ones have 20 - 40.
From this point on, the guppies are highly prolific, meaning they will give birth to lots of young, even in an aquarium. The gestation period for a guppy is around 21 to 30 days.
