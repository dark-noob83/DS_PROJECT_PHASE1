The lower boundary separating the upper and lower mantle-is a transitional zone. The transition zone is located in the depth interval 400 - 650 kilometers from the Earth's surface. The transition zone is an area of great complexity; it physically separates the upper and lower mantle.
The thickness of the upper mantle is between 200 and 250 miles. The entire mantle is about 1800 miles thick, which means the lower mantle makes up the bulk of this part of the Earth. The temperature of the mantle near the crust ranges from 900 to 1600 degrees Fahrenheit. It gets hotter at greater depths.
Geologists have broken up the Earth’s mantle into layered sections. The outermost layer is called the upper mantle, and goes down to a depth of 410 km. Below that is the the transition zone (660 km), then the lower mantle reaching a depth of 2,891 km. The various layers of the mantle have different types of rocks.
The uppermost mantle is connected to the crust and forms the asthenosphere, which composes Earth's tectonic plates. The bulk of the mantle is composed of extremely hot rock under enormous pressure. The mantle may be very close to the melting point of the rock which composes it, or even partially melted.
The upper mantle is made of peridotite and eclogite rock and extends from the Moho to a depth of 400km. The earth's crust and uppermost mantle together form the lithosphere. The lithosphere makes up the plates of plate tectonic theory. The lithosphere averages about 70 kilometers thick beneath continents.
The Earth's upper mantle is composed of rocks that have higher concentrations of mafic minerals (containing iron and magnesium) and lower in concentrations of the felsic miner … als (aluminum and silica) than the rocks of Earth's crust.
