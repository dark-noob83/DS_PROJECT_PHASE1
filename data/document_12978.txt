When all was said and done, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, the two major party candidates for president in 2012, spent close to $1.12 billion -- not counting the millions more spent by the parties and outside groups. Overall, the presidential race cost more than $2.6 billion in that cycle.
Sanders' campaign has drawn comparison to another Vermonter who ran an insurgent race for President: Former Gov. Howard Dean, whose campaign revolutionized the way campaign money was raised by tapping into online donations. In the second quarter of 2003, Dean's campaign raised $7.6 million, primarily online. Sanders' top aides hope to raise between $40 and $50 million this year, a number substantially less than the $100 million Hillary Clinton's campaign is aiming for.
The total for the 2012 election cycle was $37.9 million, representing a more than $100 million decline from the previous presidential year's total of $139.5 million, the largest decline in spending from one cycle to the next.
The 2016 campaign is significantly outpacing recent election cycles in contributions at this point, and the source of the money has shifted away from candidates’ committees, which can accept only $2,700 per election from individuals.
Below is a tally of the money raised and spent through September by the presidential candidates, the national party committees and the primary “super PACs” whose sole purpose is to support a candidate.
Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign has raised about $15 million since it launched in late April, aides to the campaign told CNN on Thursday. The aides added that the 400,000 donations came from about 250,000 individual donors.
In the presidential race, those supporting President Obama have spent $931 million so far, while those supporting Republican challenger Mitt Romney have spent more than $1 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A big chunk of the money is coming from the uber-wealthy, according to election experts.
As of July 14, Obama’s campaign has raised a total of $287,397,945, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group that keeps track of money in U.S. politics. McCain’s campaign has raised a total of $119,594,596.
