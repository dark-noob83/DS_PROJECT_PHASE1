How much energy Tesla Roadster required to travel one mile? The Roadster's battery can hold about 55 kwh of energy, and has a range of 220 miles in between charge. How can I find how much energy the Tesla will use
Tesla makes a 7 and 10 kilowatt-hour battery. Let’s look at the 10 kWh one—but Tesla says that you can stack these such that you could make a 20 kWh battery if that made you happy. But really, this comes down to the definition of power as the rate that you do work (or change energy).
Tesla will offer Powerpack, sold in 100-kilowatt-hour modules at $25,000 each. According to CNET, Tesla has already started working with industrial customers on these installations. 4. Low price point: The price for the residential battery is much lower than most experts anticipated — upwards of $10,000. Musk announced Powerwall at $3,500 for the 10 kilowatt hour (kWh) battery and $3,000 for the 7 kWh model.

The bigger Powerwall has 10 kWh. Yes, this is a unit of energy and not power. It says that you could get a power of 10 kilowatts for 1 hour. You can convert this energy to Joules if you like – it would be 3.6 x 10 7 Joules (1 watt is a Joule/second). The next thing we need to calculate the run time is the power.
Here's the deal. The all-electric Roadster is fitted with a 53-kilowatt-hour battery pack. To figure out how long it would take to charge it, you multiply volts by amps and divide 53,000 by that sum.
