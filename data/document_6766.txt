By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Molecule Definition: a molecule refers to two or more atoms which have chemically combined to form a single species. Examples: Examples of molecules include water H 2 O, oxygen, gas, O 2.
1 Simple molecules [molecule: A molecule is a collection of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. 2  It is the smallest part of a substance that displays the properties of the substance.
A compound is a substance made from two or more elements that have reacted chemically with each other. Remember this definition as you might need it in the exam! A compound is a completely new material that will often have totally different properties from the elements that made it.
474 pages on this wiki. A molecule is a particle containing two or more atoms. If it contains only one type of atom it is called an element. An exception to this is diatomic gases (for example: Oxygen, O 2, where the molecule contains two atoms of the same element, bonded covalently. If it contains two or more different types of element which are bonded it is called a compound.
Some people confuse the terms compound and molecule. Both of these are the result of chemically joining together atoms of different elements. A molecule is the smallest unit (particle) of a compound that has the physical and chemical properties of that compound.
Ethane is a compound formed from the elements hydrogen and carbon, whose atoms may be drawn as follows: A molecule of ethane results when two carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms join together in the configuration shown below as by sharing electrons, as described in the text (below the diagram).
