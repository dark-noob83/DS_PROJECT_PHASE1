Heat can be transferred from place to place by conduction [conduction: The transfer of heat energy through a material-without the material itself moving. ] , convection [convection: The transfer of heat energy through a moving liquid or gas. Heat energy can move through a substance by conduction. Metals are good conductors of heat, but non-metals and gases are usually poor conductors of heat. Poor conductors of heat are called insulators. Heat energy is conducted from the hot end of an object to the cold end.
Conduction occurs when energy is transferred through an object due to the movement of particle due to contact. The energy that is transferred is in the form of heat or electricity, so the two types of conduction that we discussed are conduction of heat and conduction of electricity. Conduction is the transfer of energy in the form of heat or electricity from one atom to another within an object by direct contact. Conduction occurs in solids, liquids, and gases.
Best Answer: Convection is the transfer of heat by the actual movement of the warmed matter. Heat leaves the coffee cup as the currents of steam and air rise. Convection is the transfer of heat energy in a gas or liquid by movement of currents. (It can also happen is some solids, like sand.) The heat moves with the fluid. Consider this: convection is responsible for making macaroni rise and fall in a pot of heated water.
Thermal conduction is the transfer of internal energy by microscopic diffusion and collisions of particles or quasi-particles within a body or between contiguous bodies. The microscopically diffusing and colliding objects include molecules, atoms, electrons, and phonons. In conduction, the heat flow is within and through the body itself. In contrast, in heat transfer by thermal radiation, the transfer is often between bodies, which may be separated spatially.
Heat can only be transferred through three means: conduction, convection and radiation. Of these, conduction is perhaps the most common, and occurs regularly in nature. In short, it is the transfer of heat through physical contact. It occurs when you press your hand onto a window pane, when you place a pot of water on an active element, and when you place an iron in the fire.
Conduction is the transfer of energy through matter from particle to particle. It is the transfer and distribution of heat energy from atom to atom within a substance Convection is the transfer of heat by the actual movement of the warmed matter.

Conduction is when heat is transferred through a material by passing thermal energy from molecule to molecule (from collisions). An example is when you heat up one end of a pa … n and the handle gets hot a little later. Convection is when, as they say, heat rises. Conduction:-   Conduction is the transfer heat from a hotter to a colder body by  vibrating.   Convection:-   Is the main heat transfer mechanism in fluids.   … Radiation:-   Radiation is the process of particles transferring heat through  matter or space. Answered
Heat is transferred in several different ways, either conduction, convection, and radiation. Regardless of the method of transfer, only heat can be transferred. Cold is simply the absence of heat and cannot be transferred by any method. Conduction is the transfer of heat from one molecule to another through a substance. Not all substances conduct heat at the same speed. Metals are considered good conductors since they can speedily transfer heat. Stone is also a moderately good conductor, but wood, paper, air, and cloth are poor heat conductors
