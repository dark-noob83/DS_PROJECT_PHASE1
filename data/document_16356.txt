A simplified ISO FROM clause join syntax is: FROM first_table join_type second_table [ON (join_condition)]. join_type specifies what kind of join is performed: an inner, outer, or cross join. join_condition defines the predicate to be evaluated for each pair of joined rows.
The optimizer determines the order in which Oracle joins tables based on the join conditions, indexes on the tables, and, any available statistics for the tables. IA WHERE clause that contains a join condition can also contain other conditions that refer to columns of only one table.
Table VT11 is generated and returned to the caller. Therefore, (INNER JOIN) ON will filter the data (the data count of VT will be reduced here itself) before applying WHERE clause. The subsequent join conditions will be executed with filtered data which improves performance.

If you use inner joins without an ON clause, you will get a syntax error. If you use the older syntax and forget one of the join conditions in the where clause, you will get a cross join.
These join conditions define the rows in the outer table that take part in the match to the inner table. However, when a search condition is applied to the inner table in a WHERE clause, it should be applied in the ON clause as well. â€¢ The best practice is to use only join conditions in ON clauses. A search condition in the ON clause of the inner table does not limit the number of rows in the answer set.
To write a query that performs an outer join of tables A and B and returns all rows from A (a left outer join), use the LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN syntax in the FROM clause, or apply the outer join operator (+) to all columns of B in the join condition in the WHERE clause.
