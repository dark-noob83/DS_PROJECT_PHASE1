Definition. Any method of resolving disputes other than by litigation. Abbreviated as ADR. Public courts may be asked to review the validity of ADR methods, but they will rarely overturn ADR decisions and awards if the disputing parties formed a valid contract to abide by them.

Mediation, as used in law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), a way of resolving disputes between two or more parties with concrete effects. Typically, a third party, the mediator, assists the parties to negotiate a settlement. In addition to dispute resolution, mediation can function as a means of dispute prevention, such as facilitating the process of contract negotiation. Governments can use mediation to inform and to seek input from stakeholders in formulation or fact-seeking aspects of policy-making.
An additional advantage is that when the parties reach agreement in mediation, the dispute is overâ€”they face no appeals, delays, continuing expenses, or unknown risks. The parties can begin to move forward again. Unlike litigation, which focuses on the past, mediation looks to the future. noun alternaaive litigation resolution, alternative means to litigation, allernative method of resolving a dispute, arbitration, litiiation substitute, means to resolve a dispute, mediation, pretrial mediationSpecifically: arbitration, mediation, pretrial mediation.

Alternative dispute resolution (ADR; known in some countries, such as Australia, as external dispute resolution) includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that act as a means for disagreeing parties to come to an agreement short of litigation. 1 In arbitration, participation is typically voluntary, and there is a third party who, as a private judge, imposes a resolution. 2  Arbitrations often occur because parties to contracts agree that any future dispute concerning the agreement will be resolved by arbitration. 3  This is known as a 'Scott Avery Clause'.
