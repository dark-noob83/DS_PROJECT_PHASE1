Kelp are large brown algae that live in cool, relatively shallow waters close to the shore. They grow in dense groupings much like a forest on land. These underwater towers of kelp provide food and shelter for thousands of fish, invertebrates, and marine mammal species. Among the many mammals and birds that use kelp forests for protection or feeding include seals, sea lions, whales, sea otters, gulls, terns, snowy egrets, great blue herons, cormorants, and shore birds. These dense canopies of algae generally occur in cold, nutrient-rich waters.
In 2007, kelp forests were also discovered in tropical waters near Ecuador. Physically formed by brown macroalgae of the order Laminariales, kelp forests provide a unique three-dimensional habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes. Many marine mammals and birds are also found, including seals, sea lions, whales, sea otters, gulls, terns, snowy egrets, great blue herons, cormorants, as well as some shore birds. Frequently considered an ecosystem engineer, kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities.
Kelp forests usually grow on subtidal rocky reefs although some kelps are able to grow on smaller scattered rocks. In general they grow on reefs in waters to a maximum of around 30 metres depth, although most are found in shallower waters. Habitats-Kelp Forests.

Kelp forests are a feature of many cool water environments around the world and Australia supports some excellent examples of these forests of the sea.
Below that the red algae are the most common. The brown algae are largest and most conspicuous. Almost all the large algae species found on the seashore and in shallow waters are brown algae, usually referred to as kelp. These form kelp forests in the ocean that are structurally similar to forests on land. Kelp forest in Þistilfjörður, þistilfjörður.N. E. Iceland a few cods in a kelp.

Kelp forests provide food and shelter for thousands of species. In ideal conditions, kelp can grow up to. per day, and in stark contrast to the colorful and slow-growing corals, the giant kelp canopies tower above the ocean floor. Like trees in a forest, these giant algae provide food and shelter for many organisms. Also like a terrestrial forest, kelp forests experience seasonal changes. Among the many mammals and birds that use kelp forests for protection or feeding include seals, sea lions, whales, sea otters, gulls, terns, snowy egrets, great blue herons, cormorants, and shore birds. These dense canopies of algae generally occur in cold, nutrient-rich waters.

Snorkelling in a forest of Giant String Kelp. Giant string kelp (Macrocystis angustolia). As these plants are found in cool water extensive kelp forests are only found in Southern Australia, and they are particularly diverse in Victoria and Tasmania. Some species can grow to lengths of over 30m and can been seen with their fronds extended across the water surface. Habitats-Kelp Forests.

Kelp forests provide habitat for a variety of invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, and birds. Many species of fish and marine mammals inhabit kelp forests for protection and food. In kelp forests, the most commonly found invertebrates are bristle worms, scud, prawn, snails, and brittle stars. These animals feed on the holdfasts that keep kelp anchored to the bottom of the ocean and algae that are abundant in kelp forests. Sea urchins will often completely remove kelp plants by eating through their holdfasts. Other invertebrates found in kelp forests are sea stars, anemones, crabs, and jellyfish. A wide range of fish can be found in kelp forests, many of which are important to commercial fishermen.

Kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp. They are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called kelp beds. Many marine mammals and birds are also found, including seals, sea lions, whales, sea otters, gulls, terns, snowy egrets, great blue herons, cormorants, as well as some shore birds. Frequently considered an ecosystem engineer, kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities.
