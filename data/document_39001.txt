By comparison, the sampled prices for a women’s haircut ranged from about $35 to $118, with a mean price of about $63. Removing the top and bottom 25 percent of prices shows that the middle 50 percent of sampled prices were between $50 and $70.
Not everyone tips for a haircut, Square found, but customers who do tip 20 percent on average. A cut's price also varied in different cities analyzed by Square. New York City has the most expensive average women's haircut price at $73, with Minneapolis offering the least expensive women’s haircut price at $41. Minneapolis also boasts the least expensive average haircut price for men at $31, while San Francisco has the most expensive average haircut price for men at $49.
Your hair can cost you a small fortune. With prices for women being on average £50 for a cut, £35 for a blow dry and well over £100 for a colour (and not an awful lot cheaper for men!) you can walk away from the salon seriously out of pocket.
The statistics about the average cost of a haircut vary, but a few years ago American Salon, a publication for beauty industry professionals, reported the numbers as $21 for a cut in a salon with fewer than 6 chairs, and $44 for a salon with more than 13 chairs.
Data from mobile payment company Square show that the average haircut for men costs $28 nationwide, and costs $44 on average for women.
Thirty years later, in the December 1981 quarter, a women’s haircut cost about $13, or $46 in today’s terms, while a men’s dry cut cost about $4, or $15 in today’s terms. Figure 1 shows how prices for hairdressing services have changed since 1981. Between 1981 and 1995, price change was generally in line with the CPI.
The average price for men’s haircuts did tend to be a little lower than the average for women. A man’s haircut cost, on average, $12.76 and a woman’s $13.59. There is a huge variation, however, in the price. Imagine, some people pay $7.99 while other pay nearly twice that much.
