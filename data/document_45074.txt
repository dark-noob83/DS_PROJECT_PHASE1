Looking at the income side, the FBM records from 2010 indicate the average weight of calves sold at weaning time was 594 pounds. Using a current price of $158 per hundredweight (cwt) for 600 pound cattle and rounding the weight off at 600 pounds means a weaned calf value of $948. Current cull prices would pay $70 per cwt., which would come to $910 for a 1300 pound cow. The various figures are now ready to be gathered together and the value of the cow determined: Income. 4.7 calf crops @ $948/ year = $4455.60.
