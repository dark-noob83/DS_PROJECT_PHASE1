Also, giant clams need a brisk, chaotic flow, similar to that needed for Acropora species corals. Like all clams in freshwater or marine species, the Tridacna species are also filter feeders, and their food of choice is phytoplankton (floating algae cells). One can see when a giant clam is in feeding mode when their ‘mouth’ opens and the feeding gills are displayed.
Geographic Range. Giant clams are found throughout the Tropical Indo-Pacific oceanic region, from the south China seas in the north to the northern coasts of Australia and from the Nicobar Islands in the west to Fiji in the east. 1  Biogeographic Regions. 2  indian ocean.
This enormous shellfish is the largest species of bivalve mollusc in the fossil record, and the heaviest of all the living molluscs. Like all bivalve molluscs, the shell of the giant clam (Tridacna gigas) consists of two valves, although in the larger giant clams these cannot close completely.
The Tridacna gigas clam is commonly called the Giant Clam or Gigas Clam. This impressive Tridacna clam species is popular as both a food source and a novelty. Its numbers in the wild have been greatly reduced because of over collection and hunting.
Giant clam lives in symbiosis with algae, which means that both organisms have benefits from the mutual life. Giant clam provides shelter and enough sunlight, while algae provide food via photosynthesis. Giant clam is able to reach huge size thanks to the food based on sugar and proteins (produced by algae).
Giant clam Facts. Giant clam is the largest sessile (attached to the ground) mollusk in the world. It can be found in the tropical waters of Indian and Pacific oceans, in Thailand, Japan, Micronesia and Australia. Giant clam inhabits coral reefs and lagoons that provide enough sun light.
