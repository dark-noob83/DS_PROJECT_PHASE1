Skittles History. Skittles were first made commercially in 1974 by a British company. They were then introduced in North America in 1979 as an import confectionery. Finally in 1982, domestic production of Skittles began in the United States. Today they are made by Wrigley.
The decision to make Skittles in Yorkville, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago, was sweetened by tax incentives and grants from the Illinois government. The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., which is based in Chicago, was acquired by privately-held Mars Inc. in 2008. Skittles now fall under the Wrigley umbrella. This is the first time since the Wrigley acquisition that U.S. production capacity for Skittles has expanded.
Skittles is a brand of fruit-flavoured sweets, currently produced and marketed by the Wrigley Company, a division of Mars, Inc. .
