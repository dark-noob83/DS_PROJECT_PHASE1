Borders. The infratemporal fossa can be said to have a wedge shape. It is located deep to the masseter muscle and zygomatic arch (to which the masseter attaches). The fossa is connected to the pterygopalatine fossa by the pterygomaxillary fissure and also communicates with the temporal fossa superiorly.
The temporal fossa is a depression on the temporal region and one of the largest landmarks on the skull. The temporal bone, the sphenoid bone, the parietal bone and the frontal bone contribute to its concave wall. It is superior to the infratemporal fossa which lies beneath the zygomatic arch.
infratemporal fossa. area medial to the angle of the mandible bounded above by the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, anteriorly by the alveolar border of the maxilla, laterally by the ramus of the mandible and deeply by the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone.
Pterygopalatine Fossa. Brief description. The pterygopalatine fossa has the shape of an inverted cone. It is located lateral to the nasal cavity, anterior inferior to the middle cranial fossa, inferior to the apex of the orbit and medial to the infratemporal fossa.
The infratemporal fossa is a complex and irregularly shaped space, located deep to the masseter muscle. It acts as a conduit for many neurovascular structures that travel between the cranial cavity and other structures of the head.
Brief description. The pterygopalatine fossa is a small space below the orbit that is shaped in a form of the inverted cone. It is located inferioly to the apex of the orbit and medial to the infratemporal fossa, between the root of the pterygoid plates and the infratemporal surface of the maxilla.
