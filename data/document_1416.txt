Mosquito coils are basically nothing but mosquito repellants which are made into a product to be used at home or any other close place. This is usually burnt and smoke is produced which helps in keeping mosquitoes away from us or entering the house. It is a very well known fact that mosquitoes kills more people than even sharks do every year. To be more specific, mosquitoes kills thousands every year all over the world and it is a very grave issue for all of us who live around these insects who are so dangerous.
A mosquito coil is a mosquito repelling incense, usually shaped into a spiral, and typically made from a dried paste of pyrethrum powder. The coil is usually held at the center of the spiral, suspending it in the air, or wedged by two pieces of fireproof nettings to allow continuous smoldering. Burning usually begins at the outer end of the spiral and progresses slowly toward the centre of the spiral, producing a mosquito-repellent smoke. Active ingredients found in mosquito coils may include: 1  Pyrethrum-a natural, powdered material from a kind of chrysanthemum plant; performance moderate. 2  Pyrethrins-an extract of the insecticidal chemicals in pyrethrum. 3  Allethrin-sometimes d-trans-allethrin, the first synthetic pyrethroid.
To use a mosquito coil, you first place it in a holder to keep it safe and off the ground where it can get air to burn. Simple holders are often included with the coils, but some people get quite particular about what they use to contain their coils, with pig-shaped ceramic holders being a perennial favorite. I vaguely remember seeing the occasional mosquito coil when I was growing up in the United States but most people used bug spray and citronella candles. Mosquito coils were actually invented in Japan, at the end of the 19th century. A man named Ueyama Eiichiro was in the business of exporting mandarin oranges when Fukuzawa Yukichi, the famous author, statesman and founder of Keio University, introduced him to a seed trader in the United States
These coils have helped several thousands of people every year in protecting themselves from these harmful mosquitoes. But there is a downside to everything and the smoke from these coils have proven to be pretty harmful as well as it cause suffocation!

To be more specific, mosquitoes kills thousands every year all over the world and it is a very grave issue for all of us who live around these insects who are so dangerous.
These are the usual ingredients used in preparing a mosquito coil. These are put into a mosquito coil making machine and mixed together to get a mosquito coil which is used to get rid of mosquitoes very efficiently. These ingredients are poisonous and so they have their harmful effects on humans as well. It is a very well known fact that mosquitoes kills more people than even sharks do every year.

Dear Scott, Those mosquito coils are called katori senkō (mosquito-killing incense), and like you, I strongly associate them with summer in Japan, right up there with kakikōri (shaved ice) and the Koshien, the high-school baseball championship that takes over Japanese television for two weeks every August.

My conclusion: Mosquito coil smoke is highly toxic to humans and should be avoided. 1  In the evenings or wherever mosquitoes are prevalent during the day, keep your body covered in light-colored clothing and spray insect repellent onto exposed extremities. Burning a mosquito coil while you sleep is not a good idea. Mind you, this is exactly what Thai TV commercials urge the locals to do: one such advertisement shows a group of smiling Thai kids singing about virtues of mosquito coil smoke.
Pyrethrum was used for centuries as an insecticide in Persia and Europe, and the mosquito coil was developed around the 1890s by a Japanese business man, Eiichiro Ueyama. At that time in Japan, people usually mixed pyrethrum powder with sawdust and burned it in a brazier or incense burner to repel mosquitoes. Active ingredients found in mosquito coils may include: 1  Pyrethrum-a natural, powdered material from a kind of chrysanthemum plant; performance moderate. 2  Pyrethrins-an extract of the insecticidal chemicals in pyrethrum. 3  Allethrin-sometimes d-trans-allethrin, the first synthetic pyrethroid.
