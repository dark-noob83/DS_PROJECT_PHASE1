Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that might be prescribed for the treatment of a tooth infection or abscess where the causal organism is a bacterium. This Buzzle write-up provides information on the uses, side effects, and the correct dose of amoxicillin for tooth infection.
Causes. Since amoxicillin is an antibiotic, not a pain reliever, it is important to first determine the cause of the toothache. There are many potential reasons for a tooth to cause pain, including a cracked tooth, gum disease, an abscess, impaction, eruption and muscle spasms.
For serious infections, it may be necessary to take the antibiotics for 7 days. For however long you take them, always take the double dose the first time, and then the regular dose 4 times a day (every 6 hours).
show more My dentist prescribed an antibiotic for toothache. I had root canal 4 days ago and the pain is still here so as he is out of the country, the nurse said take the prescription (which he had given a week prior to the root canal treatment but I hadn't taken).
The earlier amoxicillin antibiotic is taken for tooth infection, the better would be the outcome. The safest amoxicillin dose for the treatment of a tooth infection or tooth abscess is 250 mg about 3 times a day, i.e., after every 8 hours for 10 days. In severe cases, the dose for adults may be increased to 500 mg three times per day for a week.
Best Answer: Antibiotics usually start working in 24 to 36 hours, however when the infection is in a tooth or jaw (bone) it takes longer merely because the blood supply isn't as good in that kind of tissue. Warm compresses help to increase the blood flow to the area and carry the meds to the area.
