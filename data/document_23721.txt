In the 2012 Engineering Income and Salary Survey, conducted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), we look at the state of salaries and the job market in the field of engineering. Also, increased education leads to higher compensation. Full-time salaried respondents holding doctoral degrees in engineering have a median income of $116,000. Those with an M.S. in engineering earn a median of $95,576.
The 2011 Engineering Income and Salary Survey, conducted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), shows that despite the gloomy state of the U.S. economy, engineering professionals continue to earn good salaries. You bet it does. According to the survey, increased education in the engineering field results in higher earnings. Full-time salaried respondents holding doctoral degrees in engineering have a median income of $110,000. Those with an M.S. in engineering earn a median of $92,000.
Civil engineer salaries for the lowest 10% are less than $45,780. Civil engineer salaries for the highest 10% are more than $110,890. Civil engineer salary in the private sector is an average of 8% higher than in government/public institutions. Civil engineer starting salary for BS degrees averages $49,540. New MS graduates have an average starting salary of $59,880; and new PhDs have an average starting salary of $65,470. The number of employers seeking advanced civil engineering degrees has accelerated in the past 5 years, and is projected to exceed 50% through 2015.
For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Civil Engineer I in the United States is $61,722 so 50% of the people who perform the job of Civil Engineer I in the United States are expected to make less than $61,722. Source: HR Reported data as of October 2015. Median $61,722. 
Salary Outlook. Civil engineers earned a median salary of $80,770 in 2013, according to the BLS. The highest-paid 10 percent in the profession made $126,190, while the lowest-paid earned $51,810 in 2013. However, civil engineers earn less than other positions on the Best Technology Jobs list, including software developers, who make an average salary of $96,260, and IT managers, who earn $132,570.
The industry acknowledges the value of a postgraduate degree. Civil engineers with doctorate degrees start their first jobs with an average annual income of $58,000. Entry-level civil engineers typically report to a more experienced engineer. Because they work for someone already licensed by the state, they don't need a license themselves. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics provides some basic figures for salary averages in the field. According to their survey the median salary for a civil engineer as of May 2009 was $76,600. That figure is based on all engineers in the field, most of who are working with a bachelor's degree. The salary for professionals who have completed a masters in civil engineering is going to be higher as will the management opportunities. According to Payscale.com the average difference in annual salary can be $5,000 to $10,000 for a bachelor's degree versus a master's in civil engineering. The job opportunities in this field are projected to increase by 24% over the next ten years, much faster than the average increase of jobs overall
With an average salary of $85,640 in 2013, civil engineers earn a similar salary as mechanical engineers, who take home $85,930. However, civil engineers earn less than other positions on the Best Technology Jobs list, including software developers, who make an average salary of $96,260, and IT managers, who earn $132,570.
Environmental engineers earn about the same on an average as civil engineers in general. However the average salary for environmental health and safety engineer manager, the role that would require a master's in engineering, is over $100,000. The salary for professionals who have completed a masters in civil engineering is going to be higher as will the management opportunities. According to Payscale.com the average difference in annual salary can be $5,000 to $10,000 for a bachelor's degree versus a master's in civil engineering. The job opportunities in this field are projected to increase by 24% over the next ten years, much faster than the average increase of jobs overall
