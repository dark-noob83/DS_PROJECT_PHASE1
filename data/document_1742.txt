Billy has a sister, Judith Billy Joel, and a half-brother, Alexander Billy Joel, who is an acclaimed classical conductor in Europe and currently chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig.[7] Joel's father was an accomplished classical pianist.
Well, to make a long story short, Billy Joel is Jewish! Since Billy Joel's mother is Jewish, and in Judaism one's religion is based on one's mother's religion, then that makes him also Jewish. His father is Jewish too. Billy Joel (who's full birth name is William Martin Joel) was born on May 9, 1949 in The Bronx, New York City, New York, United States.
Billy Joel was born 64 years ago in the Bronx to an English Jewish mother and a German Jewish father who had fled the Nazis. Joel’s father was a classically trained pianist and Billy had lessons from the age of six. And then he saw The Beatles.
Billy Joel was born in The Bronx, New York and raised in Hicksville, New York. Joel’s parents are both Jewish and Joel identifies with his heritage, calling himself a “cultural Jew.” But Joel’s household was not particularly devout and he admits to attending Catholic mass as much as Jewish temple.
The Entertainer. The Jew? Perhaps. Sadly, our hope of a Jewish Billy the Kid is only floating down The River of Dreams. Yes, both of Billy's parents were Jewish, but he went to a Catholic church, got baptized (Don't Ask Us Why), and he's currently Keeping The Faith in an Atheist State of Mind.
While Billy Joel's Jewish linage is well documented, back on June 4, 1995 in a concert in Nuremberg, Germany, Joel discussed his Jewish origins, his upbringing and family life with his audience.
