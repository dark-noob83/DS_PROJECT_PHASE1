Most owners detect the small, flat, white, rice-like segments of the tapeworm which are shed in the intestine and passed out the anus onto the hair or on the bowel movement. When these segments fall off the haircoat onto the bedding,, they dry and look like dried grains of rice, only flatter. When the flea eggs hatch, the flea larvae eat the tapeworm segments and become infected, allowing for the development of the tapeworm in the flea. When the flea is later groomed off the coat by the pet and ingested, the pet becomes infected with tapeworms.
A tapeworm body consists of multiple parts, or segments, each with its own reproductive organs. Tapeworm infections are usually diagnosed by finding segments—which appear as small white worms that may look like grains of rice or seeds—on the rear end of your dog, in your dog’s feces, or where your dog lives and sleeps. 1 Most tapeworms do not produce obvious symptoms in dogs, other than worm segments on your dog's rear end or feces. 2  Dogs can get tapeworms from fleas, mice, or other rodents. 3  Flea control is an important step in protecting your dog from tapeworms. 4  People rarely are affected by dog tapeworm
When terminal segments of the tapeworm break off and pass into the cat's stool, they can be seen crawling on the surface of the feces. These proglottid segments look like grains of cooked white rice or cucumber seeds. Less commonly, segments are seen moving around the cat's anus. After treatment, the tapeworm dies and is usually digested within the intestine, so worm segments don't usually pass into the stool. Side effects, such as vomiting and diarrhea, are rarely reported with the newer tapeworm medications. Flea control is the cornerstone of preventing Dipylidium caninum infection.
The segments of a tapeworm can be pretty small. For example, one segment of the common tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum), which is usually found in dogs and cats, can be just the size of a grain of sand, leading people to think the entire tapeworm is quite tiny. This is a misconception, however, as the whole tapeworm can be about 6 inches or more in length.
Tapeworms are intestinal parasites of the cat and dog. They are classified as cestodes. They belong to a different family than hookworms and roundworms, which are the other common intestinal parasites of dogs and cats. After treatment, the tapeworm dies and is usually digested within the intestine, so worm segments don't usually pass into the stool. Side effects, such as vomiting and diarrhea, are rarely reported with the newer tapeworm medications. Flea control is the cornerstone of preventing Dipylidium caninum infection.
Eating undercooked meat from infected animals is the main cause of tapeworm infection in people. Although tapeworms in humans usually cause few symptoms and are easily treated, they can sometimes cause serious, life-threatening problems. Treatment for Tapeworms. If you suspect you have tapeworms, you should see your doctor. Because there are different types of worms and tapeworms that can infect people, diagnosing a tapeworm infection may require a stool sample to identify the type of worm.
From its head to its last segment, this tapeworm is about a foot long. During its lifespan the tapeworm only sheds the last segments (Pg1) (proglotids) of its body. Those are the rice-like grains you see on your pet's stool and clinging to its anal region. The tapeworm looks a bit like a string of pearls-each pearl being a proglottid segment.
Few things are as creepy as the thought of a parasite gaining entry to your body. Tapeworms are parasites that take up residence in the intestines of humans or animals. They only choose hosts with backbones, so invertebrates aren't affected by them. For example, one segment of the common tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum), which is usually found in dogs and cats, can be just the size of a grain of sand, leading people to think the entire tapeworm is quite tiny. This is a misconception, however, as the whole tapeworm can be about 6 inches or more in length.
Effects. A human infected with tapeworm may not have any symptoms, but he may see segments of adult tapeworm in his fecal matter. When symptoms are obvious, they may include nausea, appetite loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness and weight loss. For example, one segment of the common tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum), which is usually found in dogs and cats, can be just the size of a grain of sand, leading people to think the entire tapeworm is quite tiny.
