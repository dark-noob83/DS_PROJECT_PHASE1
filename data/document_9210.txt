1 Wood is the most traditional, common and easily available material for decks; it is typically easier to work with than composite materials. 2  Composite deck installation can cost $25-$70 or more a square foot (8,000 -$22,400 for 16'x20).
If the replacement value for your home is $200,000 and the deck cost $3,000, the policy will be increased to reflect the replacement cost of the new deck. The same holds true for any addition you make to your house whether it be a new garage, dormers or an additional room built on to your home.
Deck Repair Cost Factors. Deck repair costs an average of $1,369 with many homeowners spending between $718 and $2,075. Although it requires an investment of time and money, it costs significantly less than replacement, as long as the deck is structurally intact and the wood is healthy.
Cedar decks generally last from 15 to 20 years, but they can deteriorate faster, particularly on the ground-floor and in shaded areas that take longer to dry out. The average material cost for cedar is $5 to $15 per square foot, for an estimated cost of $6,400 to $24,000 to replace a 16-by-20-foot deck.
Redwood lumber hit an all-time high price in 2013, and the current average cost is $15 to $25 per square foot, making this formerly common deck material less popular these days. The estimated total replacement cost is $9,600 to $24,000 for a 16-by-20-foot Redwood deck.
Replacing Old Materials. The average cost of deck repair is approximately $550. With the assistance of a professional, you may expect to spend as much as $1,000 for an extensive repair project. One of the most common repair needs on decks is the replacement of rotted materials.
