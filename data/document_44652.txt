exercise can be grouped into two basic categories aerobic and anaerobic while most people can give you a basic definition of aerobics anaerobic exercise can be a bit more difficult to explainsimply put aerobic means with oxygen and anaerobic means without oxygen this is referring to whether or not your body uses oxygen to provide energy for your workoutboth types of exercise are necessary providing different benefits for the individual
anaerobic exercise is very high intensity or at your maximum level of exertion examples include sprinting and weight lifting consider using intervals aerobic with some bursts of anaerobic exercise mixed in periodically to improve weight loss and overall fitnessuring anaerobic exercise your body builds up lactic acid which causes discomfort and fatigue at sustained levels for this reason anaerobic exercise or high intensity exercise happens in short bursts it may be helpful to consider the difference between a sprinter anaerobic and a marathoner aerobic
examples of anaerobic exercise include heavy weight lifting all types of sprints running biking etc jumping rope hill climbing interval training isometrics or any rapid burst of hard exerciseverall anaerobic exercise burns fewer calories than does aerobic exercise and may be somewhat less beneficial for cardiovascular fitness however it is better at building strength and muscle mass and still benefits the heart and lungs
aerobic exercise and fitness can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise of which strength training and short distance running are the most salient examples the two types of exercise differ by the duration and intensity of muscular contractions involved as well as by how energy is generated within the muscle

what is anaerobic exercise while aerobic means with oxygen anaerobic means without air or without oxygen anaerobic exercise is short lasting high intensity activity where your body s demand for oxygen exceeds the oxygen supply availableverall anaerobic exercise burns fewer calories than does aerobic exercise and may be somewhat less beneficial for cardiovascular fitness however it is better at building strength and muscle mass and still benefits the heart and lungs
aerobic exercise is a type of physical activity that uses your large muscle groups is rhythmic in nature and can be sustained for at least 10 minutes walking jogging indoor cycling and aerobic dancing are all examples of aerobic exercise that strengthens your heart and lungs and keeps you healthyf you re performing this last activity then you re engaging in aerobic exercise aerobic exercise is any physical activity that makes you sweat causes you to breathe harder and gets your heart beating faster than at rest
the anaerobic threshold definition physiological significance and identification wasserman k during exercise the oxygen consumption above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis is termed the anaerobic threshold atthe oxygen consumption at the at depends on factors that affect oxygen delivery to the tissues
examples of anaerobic exercise examples of anaerobic exercise include heavy weight training sprinting running or cycling and jumping basically any exercise that consists of short exertion high intensity movement is an anaerobic exerciseconsists of brief intense bursts of physical activity such as weightlifting and sprints where oxygen demand surpasses oxygen supply while aerobic exercise relies on oxygen anaerobic exercise is fueled by energy stored in your muscles through a process called glycolysisglycolysis is a method by which glycogen is broken down into glucose also known as sugar and is converted into energyglycolysis occurs in muscle cells during anaerobic exercise without the use of oxygen in order to produce energy quickly thus producing lactic acid which causes your muscles to fatiguelactic acid is a by product of glycolysis and forms when your body breaks down glucose for energy when oxygen is low
anaerobic exercise anaerobic exercise is exercise intense enough to trigger lactic acid fermentation it is used by athletes in non endurance sports to promote strength speed and power and by body builders to build muscle mass
