A. Platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. A normal platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter, abbreviated mcL). The average platelet count is 237,000 per mcL in men and 266,000 per mcL in women.
Normal Results. The normal number of platelets in the blood is 150,000 to 400,000 platelets per microliter (mcL). Normal value ranges may vary slightly. Some lab use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about your test results.
A platelet count is used to detect the number of platelets in the blood. The test is included in a complete blood count (CBC) , a panel of tests often performed as part of a general health examination. Platelets are tiny fragments of cells that are essential for normal blood clotting.
A platelet count below 150,000 per mcL is called thrombocytopenia, while a platelet count over 450,000 is called thrombocytosis. Platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50,000 per mcL (assuming no other problems are present).
A higher-than-normal number of platelets is called thrombocytosis. It means your body is making too many platelets. Causes may include: 1  A type of anemia in which red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal (hemolytic anemia).
If your platelet count is below 50,000, your risk of bleeding is much higher. Even every day activities can cause bleeding. If your platelets are low, you need to know how to prevent bleeding and what to do if you are bleeding. A lower-than-normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia.
A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Having more than 450,000 platelets is a condition called thrombocytosis; having less than 150,000 is known as thrombocytopenia. You get your platelet number from a routine blood test called a complete blood count (CBC).
