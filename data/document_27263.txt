The typical lifespan in the wild for Hammerhead Sharks is from 20 to 30 years approximately. Sandbar sharks or Brown sharks are considered to live between 20 and 30 years. Research made by Joung (2004) identified to be about 20 years of age. Some scientists believe that the life expectancy of the Great White Sharks is around 30 years (Levine, 1988) but other research indicates that they can reach up to 40 years. The lifespan of Tiger Sharks in the wild is believed to be 27 years in average, although some may live up to 50 years of age. Like with other species, tiger sharks in captivity do not live as lengthy as in wildlife reaching only 17 to 20 years
Shark lifespan vary by kind. Although the majority of types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some kinds that live much longer than others. For example, the spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespan at more than 100 years, while the blue shark in the wild has an average lifespan of 15-16 years. Some scientists believe that the life expectancy of the Great White Sharks is around 30 years (Levine, 1988) but other research indicates that they can reach up to 40 years. The lifespan of Tiger Sharks in the wild is believed to be 27 years in average, although some may live up to 50 years of age. Like with other species, tiger sharks in captivity do not live as lengthy as in wildlife reaching only 17 to 20
For Hammerhead sharks, their life expectancy ranges from 20 to 30 years. Brown sharks and sandbar sharks are thought to live between 25 to 30 years. A research conducted in 2004 by joung identified that the lifespan of brown sharks is about 25 years while sandbar sharks can live up to 30 years. Their lifespan vary by kind. Even though most of them live about 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live longer than others. For instance, the dogfish has one of the longest lifespan of more than 100 years while blue shark has an average lifespan of about 15-16 years in the wild.
The typical life expectancy in the wild for Hammerhead Sharks is from 20 to 30 years approximately. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are also believed to live above 100 years, suggesting that the time to reach maturity is longer and young will take longer to born, making this type of shark more vulnerable. Lately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them. Shark lifespan vary by kind and it is very different for each of them. While many types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live much longer than others.
The life-span of tiger sharks in the wild is considered to be 27 years in average, even though some may live up to 50 years of age. As with other species, tiger sharks in captivity do not live as extensive as in wildlife reaching only 17 to 20 years. Some experts presume that the lifespan of the Great White Sharks is approximately 30 years (Levine, 1988) but other research indicates that they can reach up to 40 years. Lately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them. Shark lifespan vary by kind and it is very different for each of them. While many types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live much longer than others.
In the wild, it is believed that their life expectancy is about 30 years. Sandbar sharks or Brown sharks are thought to live between 20 and 30 years. Investigation made by Joung (2004) found to be about 20 years of age. While, Sminkey (1996) mention that sandbar sharks can live to be more than 30 years old. Lately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them. Shark lifespan vary by kind and it is very different for each of them. While many types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live much longer than others.
Some experts believe that the lifespan of the Great white sharks is about 30 years but other studies show that they can live up to 40 years. The life expectancy of tiger sharks in the wild is thought to be 28 years in average while some reach up to 50 years. But Just like the other kind, tiger sharks in captivity do not have a longer life span as those in the wild. If they are lucky they can reach 17 to 21 years. Their lifespan vary by kind. Even though most of them live about 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live longer than others. For instance, the dogfish has one of the longest lifespan of more than 100 years while blue shark has an average lifespan of about 15-16 years
Hammerhead sharks typically live between 20 to 30 years in the wild. In captivity, their life expectancy is increased up to 40 years.
