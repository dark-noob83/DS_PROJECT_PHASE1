For our example today, we will use Santa Clarita, California which would have an average cost per Kilowatt-Hour of 14.37 cents. Next, multiply the Kilowatt-Hours found in step 2 by this price to find out how much it costs to run your air conditioner for one hour. Then multiply it by 24 to find out how much it costs for a day, and then by 30 to find out how much it costs to run your air conditioner for a month. 4.32 X 14.37 = 62 cents an hour, 62 X 24 = $14.89 per day, $14.89 X 30 = $446.96 per month,
1 The cost to operate the unit will vary from region to region. 2  In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the kilowatt-hour cost is about 63 percent greater than the national average, so it would cost about $950 annually to run a 5,000-Btu air conditioner. A yearly cost can be determined by multiplying the cost per week, $11.20, by how many weeks in a year, 52. The total approximate yearly amount to run a 5,000-Btu air conditioner continuously will be about $585.
1 So, here are the air conditioner running costs based on your data for both a 40% and 70% operating rate: 2  1st Price cents/hour @ 70%. 3  2nd Price cents/hour @ 70%. 4  3rd Price cents/hour @ 70%. 1 3rd Price cents/hour @ 70%. 2  1st Price cents/hour @ 40%. 3  2nd Price cents/hour @ 40%. 4  3rd Price cents/hour @ 40%. 5  Finally, if you want to know your air conditioner running cost during the course of a whole day, you'll need to know how many hours you intend to run it and at what capacity and what tariff.
In this case, the cost per month will be approximately $45. A yearly cost can be determined by multiplying the cost per week, $11.20, by how many weeks in a year, 52. The total approximate yearly amount to run a 5,000-Btu air conditioner continuously will be about $585.
Tip. 1  The cost to operate the unit will vary from region to region. 2  In the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, the kilowatt-hour cost is about 63 percent greater than the national average, so it would cost about $950 annually to run a 5,000-Btu air conditioner.

For example, if we assume the cost is 15 cents per kilowatt-hour, the formula would be: 389 kWh per month x $0.15 / kWh = $58.35 per month Side note: 540 watts is very low for an air conditioner, even a portable window unit. Source(s): 
Determine how much the air conditioner would cost to run over a 24-hour period. Use the basic formula of watts x hours of use ÷ 1,000 x cost per kilowatt-hour = cost of operation. A yearly cost can be determined by multiplying the cost per week, $11.20, by how many weeks in a year, 52. The total approximate yearly amount to run a 5,000-Btu air conditioner continuously will be about $585.
0.53 X 24 = $12.72. Cost per Month to Run Your Air Conditioner: $12.72 X 30 = $381.60. Using the multiplier for a 100 degree Santa Clarita summer again, we get: $381.60 X 0.4 = $152.64. That’s a $26.00 a month difference from our basic calculation, all by using actual data. Next, multiply the Kilowatt-Hours found in step 2 by this price to find out how much it costs to run your air conditioner for one hour. Then multiply it by 24 to find out how much it costs for a day, and then by 30 to find out how much it costs to run your air conditioner for a month.
Typical Electricity Costs. The town of Wellesley, Mass., has estimated the average cost of running central air conditioning in a typical home for six hours a day will use 900 kilowatt/hours (kWh) per month. At a cost of $0.134 per kWh, this amounts to $120.60 per month. A large 12,000 BTU air conditioner, like that in a window, running six hours each day will consume 270 kWh, at a cost of $36.26 per month. A smaller 6,500 BTU room air conditioner will consume 144 kWh at a cost of $19.34
1 3rd Price in cents/hour. 2  So, here are the air conditioner running costs based on your data for both a 40% and 70% operating rate: 3  1st Price cents/hour @ 70%. 4  2nd Price cents/hour @ 70%. 1 3rd Price cents/hour @ 70%. 2  1st Price cents/hour @ 40%. 3  2nd Price cents/hour @ 40%. 4  3rd Price cents/hour @ 40%. 5  Finally, if you want to know your air conditioner running cost during the course of a whole day, you'll need to know how many hours you intend to run it and at what capacity and what tariff.
