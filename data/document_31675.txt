When the Mars and the Earth are at the opposite sides of the Sun, the distance is the largest: approximately: 378 million km. The time needed for an electromagnetic wave to cover this distance is approximately: 21 minute. The closest distance between Mars and Earth is 78 million km, the time in this case is: 4.3 min. So the time of travel between Earth and Mars is between 4.3 minutes and 21 minutes, depending on the actual distance between the two planets
Radio signals are electromagnetic waves, such as light or X-ray. The speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, is 300000km/sec (approximately). In order to calculate the time of travel with this speed from Earth to Mars, we need to know the distance. The time needed for an electromagnetic wave to cover this distance is approximately: 21 minute. The closest distance between Mars and Earth is 78 million km, the time in this case is: 4.3 min.
Radio signals that carry the data travel at the speed of light which is about 300,000 kilometers per second. At this speed, the signals can reach Earth in as little as 4 minutes (78 million km), or can take as long as 21 minutes (377 million km). Engineers refer to this length of time as the one-way light time.. Surveyor will take 309 days to reach Mars. In theory, the ideal transit time is 259 days. However, the journey can take anywhere between seven to 10 months depending on type of trajectory chosen and the precise locations of Earth and Mars at the time of launch.
For accuracy. 1 satellite can only tell you the distance from that satellite (a 3-d sphere around it). 2 satellites can only tell you what your distance from the two of th … em are(a 2-d circle between them). If you sent a microwave from the corresponding latitude on the equator, 75 degrees west for instance, ina perfect environment, at light speed, it would take about 7 minutes and 13 seconds.
The distance to a satellite is determined by measuring how long a radio signal takes to reach the receiver from the satellite. A radio signal travels at the speed of light or roughly 300,000 km/sec (186,000 miles/sec). Multiply travel time by the speed of light to get distance. Suppose we measure our distance from a satellite and find it to be 18,000 km (11,000 miles). Knowing that we are 18,000 km from a particular satellite narrows down our possible locations to the surface of a sphere centered on the satellite with a radius of 18,000 km as shown to the right.
At that distance, it takes a radio signal about 4 minutes to cover the distance one-way. At 62 million … miles it takes 5 minutes 20 seconds. Radio travels at speed of light 186,000 mps. + 9 others found this useful. If you sent a microwave from the corresponding latitude on the equator, 75 degrees west for instance, ina perfect environment, at light speed, it would take about 7 minutes and 13 seconds.
From Earth to an orbiting satellite it takes approximately 200 to 299million M/S or slightly slower than the speed oflight. This varies on weather and atmospheric conditions. The signal is significantly faster, or closer to the speed of light (299792458 M/S), in the Vacuum of Outer Space. Geosynchronous-Earth-orbit satellites are found 22,300 miles from Earth and are always positioned over t … he same point on Earth. The signal has to go to the satellite which is 22,300 miles up, and then back to Earth which is 22,300 miles back. So the total distance traveled is 44,600 miles.
Microwaves travel at the speed of lig … ht (186,000 mph) but only in a vacuum. Through air they are a bit slower. If you sent a microwave from the corresponding latitude on the equator, 75 degrees west for instance, ina perfect environment, at light speed, it would take about 7 minutes and 13 seconds.
The speed of light is equal to approximately 186,000 miles per second. Geosynchronous-Earth-orbit satellites are found 22,300 miles from Earth and are always positioned over t … he same point on Earth. The signal has to go to the satellite which is 22,300 miles up, and then back to Earth which is 22,300 miles back. So the total distance traveled is 44,600 miles. To get the amount of time it takes simply do 44,600/186,000 = approximately .23978 seconds. Or you could say 239.78 milliseconds
Mars is so far away in fact that it takes radio signals quite a long time to get from the spacecraft back to Earth. During Curiosity EDL, this delay will be 13 minutes, 48 seconds, about mid-way between the minimum delay of around 4 minutes and the maximum of around 24 minutes. So the time of travel between Earth and Mars is between 4.3 minutes and 21 minutes, depending on the actual distance between the two planets.
