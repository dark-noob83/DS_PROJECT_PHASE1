CELLULAR MANUFACTURING. Photo by: sellingpix. Cellular manufacturing is a manufacturing process that produces families of parts within a single line or cell of machines operated by machinists who work only within the line or cell. A cell is a small scale, clearly-defined production unit within a larger factory.
This system is used in the cellular manufacturing concept, which is distinct from the traditional functional manufacturing system in which all similar machines are grouped together. The use of manufacturing cells improves material flow and is especially suited for batch production, even in relatively low volumes.
DEFINITION of 'Manufacturing Cells'. Sets of machines that are grouped by the products or parts they produce in a lean manufacturing environment.
Cellular Manufacturing. Definition. A cell is a group of workstations, machines or equipment arranged such that a product can be processed progressively from one workstation to another without having to wait for a batch to be completed or requiring additional handling between operations.
