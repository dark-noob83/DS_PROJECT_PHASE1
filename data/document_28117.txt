If the left ankle is broken, you can drive once you once you have stopped taking narcotics. For the right ankle, driving can be started at 4 to 6 weeks. No weight-bearing is permitted until 4 to 6 weeks. At 4 weeks, exercise activities are initiated in a swimming pool and on a bike.
It depends a lot on what type of break and how many bones have been broken, probably 10 weeks i broke my ankle, had a cast for 9 weeks now it is the 13 week and i still … can't run. .._. 1 person found this useful.
Starting 5 weeks after surgery, the doctor let me begin spinning on a stationary bike. I used a heavy duty ankle brace instead of the boot cast, and within 10 days I was spinning 2 hours per day. Six weeks after surgery I also started swimming 2-3 times a week (also with the ankle brace). It's been nearly thirty years since I worked as a lifeguard and water safety instructor. In those days I could swim 5 miles. Now I had to settle for a slow mile.
