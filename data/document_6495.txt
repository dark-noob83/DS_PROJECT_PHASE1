1 Legs and arms: Symptoms of blood clots in the legs and arms vary and may include pain or cramping, swelling, tenderness, warmth to the touch and bluish-or red-colored skin. 2  Clots that occur in larger veins are called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
A clot (thrombosis) in the deep veins of legs or arms (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) leads to an obstruction of blood outflow from the extremities back to the heart. Acute leg swelling and pain, therefore, result. This is called an acute DVT.
Deep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together. Most deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. They also can occur in other parts of the body. A blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. The loose clot is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus). It can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE.
Deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot that forms inside a vein, usually deep within your leg. About half a million Americans every year get one, and up to 100,000 die because of it. The danger is that part of the clot can break off and travel through your bloodstream.
Typically, there may be a fair amount of pain and swelling when a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) develops. This pain is partly due to swelling in the vein in the leg with the blood clot. With appropriate therapy, however, the inflammation-and therefore the pain-usually resolves significantly within a few days.
