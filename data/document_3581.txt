The function of the fibrous capsule, which encases the various internal organs, is the same for each individual organ or pair of organs. In the case of the kidneys for example, this strong capsule is composed of connective tissue and tightly contains each of the body's two kidneys. The fibrous capsule offers support to the internal kidney tissue. As with each internal organ, the kidney performs a unique and totally indispensable function.
The glomerulus and bowmans capsule are part of the excretory system, and they are found in the nephron of a kidney. The function of the glomerulus and the bowman's capsule is â€¦ to filter the substances in the blood. The glomerulus is a tangle of capillaries which have little slits in them. Water, salts, glucose and urea pass through the slits into the bowmans capsule, which leads to kidney tubules.
The fibrous capsule is formed from dense irregular connective tissue. It is attached to the periosteum (layer) of the articulating bones. The functions of the fibrous capsule in synovial joints include: 1  Flexibility (of the fibrous capsule). 2  at the joint. 3  Tensile strength (collagen fibres in the capsule). 4  of
fibrous capsule, 1 the external layer of an articular capsule. It surrounds the articulation of two adjoining bones. 2 the external, tough membranous envelope surrounding some visceral organs, such as the liver. Compare synovial membrane.
The capsule is held together with ligaments (fibrous connective tissue) that help with the range of motion. The capsule contains synovial fluid, which is found in the cavities of highly mobile joints called synovial joints. This fluid circulates around the patella, tibia, and femur.
Save. The medical or veterinary term fibrous capsule refers to either an external layer which surrounds the articular capsule on a synovial join, or to the resilient, external membrane that envelopes certain organs, such as the liver and kidneys.
