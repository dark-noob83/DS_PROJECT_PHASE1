That only happens when the Medicare claims are filed. If your doctor has not yet filed your Medicare claims -- and you are waiting for reimbursement or were responsible for a deductible -- you can call the doctor's office to remind them to file the claim. If that doesn't work, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).
To check the status of Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) or Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) claims: 1  Login to MyMedicare.gov. 2  You can access your personalized Medicare information, including the most up-to-date information about your Part A and Part B claims.
Rather than queue at your local Medicare Office to make your claim, you can now lodge a claim for certain items online and have it paid straight into your bank account.
1 If they don't file a claim, call 1-800-MEDICARE. 2  Ask for the exact time limit for filing a Medicare claim for the service or supply you got. 3  If it's close to the end of the time limit and your doctor or supplier still hasn't filed the claim, you should file the claim.
You should only need to file a claim in very rare cases. Medicare claims must be filed no later than 12 months (or 1 full calendar year) after the date when the services were provided. If a claim isn't filed within this time limit, Medicare can't pay its share. For example, if you see your doctor on March 22, 2012, the Medicare claim for that visit must be filed no later than March 22, 2013.
1 You’ll usually be able to see a claim within 24 hours after Medicare processes it. 2  You can also use the Blue Button on MyMedicare.gov to download and save your Part A and Part B claims information. 3  Learn more about Medicare’s Blue Button.
If the claims aren't being filed timely: 1  Contact your doctor or supplier, and ask them to file a claim. 2  If they don't file a claim, call 1-800-MEDICARE. 3  Ask for the exact time limit for filing a Medicare claim for the service or supply you got.
