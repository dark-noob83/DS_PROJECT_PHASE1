Students attending Brown University will absorb the steepest hike. The cost of classes for the Providence (R.I.) school will rise to $48,272 from $46,408, a 4 percent increase, for the 2015-16 academic year. On the bottom end, Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., is raising tuition 2.9 percent, to $48,120 from $46,763. College tuition is outpacing inflation across the board, a phenomenon even the Ivy League and its fat endowments can't escape. Next year, tuition will rise an average of 3.76 percent at the Ivies—pushing the cost of attendance as high as $63,000.
A good rule of thumb is that tuition rates will increase at about twice the general inflation rate. During any 17-year period from 1958 to 2001, the average annual tuition inflation rate was between 6% and 9%, ranging from 1.2 times general inflation to 2.1 times general inflation. Note that these figures show an average tuition inflation rate from 1979 to 2001 of 8.0% and from 1997 to 2001 of 4.5%. An inflation rate of 8% means that a baby born today will face college costs that are 3.7 times current costs.
At 4-year institutions, the average total cost of attendance for first-time, full-time students living on campus and paying in-state tuition was $22,190 at public institutions, $44,370 at private nonprofit institutions, and $29,950 at private for-profit institutions. For example, at public 4-year institutions, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received by first-time, full-time students paying in-state tuition in 2012–13 was highest for those with incomes of $30,000 or less ($9,800 in aid) and lowest for those with incomes of $110,001 or more ($1,790 in aid).
The average net price of attendance (total cost minus grant and scholarship aid) in 2012–13 (in constant 2013–14 dollars) for first-time, full-time students was $12,890 at public, in-state 4-year institutions, $24,430 at private nonprofit 4-year institutions, and $21,740 at private for-profit 4-year institutions. For example, at public 4-year institutions, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received by first-time, full-time students paying in-state tuition in 2012–13 was highest for those with incomes of $30,000 or less ($9,800 in aid) and lowest for those with incomes of $110,001 or more ($1,790 in aid).
According to The College Board®, the average 2014-2015 tuition increase was 3.7 percent at private colleges, and 2.9 percent at public universities. However, looking back at the last decade, the 10-year historical rate of increase is approximately 5 percent. 
On average, tuition tends to increase about 8% per year. An 8% college inflation rate means that the cost of college doubles every nine years. For a baby born today, this means that college costs will be more than three times current rates when the child matriculates in college. Note that these figures show an average tuition inflation rate from 1979 to 2001 of 8.0% and from 1997 to 2001 of 4.5%. An inflation rate of 8% means that a baby born today will face college costs that are 3.7 times current costs.
For example, for students paying in-state tuition at public 2-year institutions and living with family, the average total cost of attendance was $8,530, compared with $13,580 for students living on campus and $16,090 for students living off campus but not with family. For example, at public 4-year institutions, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received by first-time, full-time students paying in-state tuition in 2012–13 was highest for those with incomes of $30,000 or less ($9,800 in aid) and lowest for those with incomes of $110,001 or more ($1,790 in aid).
It's not just the tuition costs at elite universities like Harvard that are outpacing the government's Consumer Price Index. The average cost of tuition and fees a t a private, non-profit, four-year university this school year was $31,231 —up sharply from $1,832 in 1971-1972 (in current dollars) . At public, four-year schools, tuition and fees cost about $9,139 this year. 
Question: What are the trends in the cost of college education? Response: For the 2012–13 academic year, annual current dollar prices for undergraduate tuition, room, and board were estimated to be $15,022 at public institutions, $39,173 at private nonprofit institutions, and $23,158 at private for-profit institutions.
At 2-year institutions, the average total cost of attendance for first-time, full-time students at public institutions living on campus and paying in-state tuition was $13,580, and it was $28,290 at private nonprofit institutions, and $28,060 at private for-profit institutions. For example, at public 4-year institutions, the average amount of grant and scholarship aid received by first-time, full-time students paying in-state tuition in 2012–13 was highest for those with incomes of $30,000 or less ($9,800 in aid) and lowest for those with incomes of $110,001 or more ($1,790 in aid).
