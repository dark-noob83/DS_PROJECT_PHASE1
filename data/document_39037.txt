ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). 1  It is the major energy currency of the cell, providing the energy for most of the energy-consuming activities of the cell. 2  It is one of the monomers used in the synthesis of RNA and, after conversion to deoxyATP (dATP), DNA. 3  It regulates many biochemical pathways. 1
Free Energy from Hydrolysis of ATP. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of life and it provides that energy for most biological processes by being converted to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). Since the basic reaction involves a water molecule, this reaction is commonly referred to as the hydrolysis of ATP. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is considered by biologists to be the energy currency of life. It is the high-energy molecule that stores the energy we need to do just about everything we do.
Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) is a multifunctional nucleotide, and is most important in cell biology as a coenzyme that is the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer.[1] In this role, ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. 
Two processes convert ADP into ATP: 1) substrate-level phosphorylation; and 2) chemiosmosis. Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs in the cytoplasm when an enzyme attaches a third phosphate to the ADP (both ADP and the phosphates are the substrates on which the enzyme acts). This is illustrated in Figure 3. As the hydrogen passes through the ATP synthesizing enzyme, energy from the enzyme is used to attach a third phosphate to ADP, converting it to ATP. Figure 5. A generalized view of an electron transport system.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) , the energy currency or coin of the cell pictured in Figfures 1 and 2, transfers energy from chemical bonds to endergonic (energy absorbing) reactions within the cell. As the hydrogen passes through the ATP synthesizing enzyme, energy from the enzyme is used to attach a third phosphate to ADP, converting it to ATP. Figure 5. A generalized view of an electron transport system.

Role of ATP. ATP serves as an important role in biology because cells mainly get their energy from ATP. ATP also helps by bringing energy wherever energy is needed in a cell, and releasing the energy, which can be used to power other chemical reactions, such as the ones that can make molecules. What ATP Is. ATP is a natural molecule, also known as adenosine triphosphate, in your body that is the main energy source currency of cells. Mitochondria, an organelle, gathers energy from organic compounds to make most of the ATP, while other ATP can be made in the cytoplasm.
ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. It is one of the end products of photophosphorylation, cellular respiration, and fermentation and used by enzymes and structural proteins in many cellular processes, including biosynthetic reactions, motility, and cell division. In plants, ATP is synthesized in thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis in a process called photophosphorylation. Here, light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane.
Energy is stored in the covalent bonds between phosphates, with the greatest amount of energy (approximately 7 kcal/mole) in the bond between the second and third phosphate groups. This covalent bond is known as a pyrophosphate bond. We can write the chemical reaction for the formation of ATP as: As the hydrogen passes through the ATP synthesizing enzyme, energy from the enzyme is used to attach a third phosphate to ADP, converting it to ATP. Figure 5. A generalized view of an electron transport system.
ATP hydrolysis is the reaction by which chemical energy that has been stored in the high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released, for example in muscles, by producing work in the form of mechanical energy. Hydrolysis of the phosphate groups in ATP is especially exergonic, because the resulting orthophosphate group is greatly stabilized by multiple resonance structures, making the products (ADP and P i) much lower in energy than the reactant (ATP).
