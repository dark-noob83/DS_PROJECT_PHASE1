7%. Employment of aerospace engineers is projected to grow 7 percent from 2012 to 2022, slower than the average for all occupations. Some aerospace engineers work on projects that are related to national defense and thus require security clearances. Aerospace engineers work in industries that build aircraft and often help oversee construction. Aerospace engineers held about 83,000 jobs in 2012. They are employed in industries where workers design or build aircraft, missiles, systems for national defense, or spacecraft.
Pay. The median salary of an aerospace engineer is more than $97,000. The median salary is the salary at which 50% of the workers earned more and 50% earned less. The lowest 10% of engineers earn less than $60,000, and the highest 10% earn more than $140,000. Aerospace engineers normally work forty hours a week, but project directors often need to work overtime. Project directors are responsible for the quality of design and the efficiency of the aircrafts' performance, as well as managing timetables, deadlines, and employees.
Employment of aerospace engineers is expected to grow more slowly than the average (increase 0 to 9 percent) for all occupations through 2008. The decline in Defense Department expenditures for military aircraft, missiles, and other aerospace systems has caused mergers and acquisitions among defense contractors. According to a 1999 salary survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, bachelors degree candidates in aerospace engineering received starting offers averaging about $40,700 a year; masters degree candidates, $54,200; and Ph.D. candidates, $64,400.
$34,750. The median annual wage for aerospace engineers was $103,720 in May 2012. The median wage is the wage at which half of the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $65,450, and the top 10 percent earned more than $149,120. Aerospace engineers work in industries that build aircraft and often help oversee construction. Aerospace engineers held about 83,000 jobs in 2012. They are employed in industries where workers design or build aircraft, missiles, systems for national defense, or spacecraft.
On average, a Design Engineering Manager can earn $102K annually. Becoming an Aviation and Aerospace Project Engineer is, more often than not, the most common role that Aerospace Engineers move into when they're ready for the next step in their career. The average salary for the position is $81K. In the world of Aerospace Engineers, overall income ranges from $58K near the bottom to $123K at the top; this can include more than $8K from bonuses and more than $10K from profit sharing in exceptional cases.
The average Aerospace Engineer in the United States can expect to rake in roughly $78K per year. In the world of Aerospace Engineers, overall income ranges from $58K near the bottom to $123K at the top; this can include more than $8K from bonuses and more than $10K from profit sharing in exceptional cases.
Median annual earnings of aerospace engineers were $66,950 in 1998. The middle 50 percent earned between $51,170 and $82,620. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $42,650 and the highest 10 percent earned more than $93,880. According to a 1999 salary survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, bachelors degree candidates in aerospace engineering received starting offers averaging about $40,700 a year; masters degree candidates, $54,200; and Ph.D. candidates, $64,400.
Companies look for aerospace engineers who possess both an exceptional academic record and an ability to get work done quickly. The average work weeks for an aerospace engineer last between 36 and 40 hours, which means that aerospace engineering professionals need to be deliberate about their projects. Aerospace engineers can expect to spend their average day working on a new aircraft, missile system, or spacecraft in terms of its design, construction and testing.
