Here's the story of a meeting between a Pagan demon and the Pythagorean teacher-sage Apollonius of Tyana. Apollonius lived in the first century AD; after He died, He was worshiped as a God. This history about Him was written in the third century AD, from notes made by one of His disciples.
By far the most detailed source is the Life of Apollonius of Tyana, a lengthy, novelistic biography written by the sophist Philostratus at the request of empress Julia Domna. She died in 217 AD, and he completed it after her death, probably in the 220s or 230s AD.
(3) With Apollonius you have no documents with material reliably dated to the century in which he lived. With Jesus you have 27 books, dated at the latest within a century of his death and at best within 40 years of his death.
THE story preserved of the life of Apollonius contains the tale of his visit to the North of India. A precisely detailed description is given of the cities, the sites and the people; but the significance of his visit is completely overlooked. Truly, Apollonius of Tyana was known as a lover of distant travel. But this little explains his journeys.
When He went out of incarnation at the Crucifixion, Jesus was a fourth-degree initiate. In His next incarnation, as Apollonius of Tyana(16AD to c.97 AD), He became a Master (fifth-degree initiate). He died in India.
Apollonius was born into a respected and wealthy Greek family; the dates of his birth and death, however, are uncertain. His primary biographer, Philostratus the Elder (c. 170 â€“ 247 AD), places him c. 3 BC to 97 AD. Others agree that he was roughly a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth.
He is reputed to have live to one hundred. Apollonius' death is a mystery. According to some he fell out of favor with Emperor Severu, who put him on trail and had his hair cut off to eliminate his magical powers. Apollonius simply disappeared from the courtroom never to be seen again.
