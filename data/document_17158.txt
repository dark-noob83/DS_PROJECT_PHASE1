Breeding bald eagles typically lay one to three eggs once a year and they hatch after about 35 days of incubation. Hunting, egg sitting, eaglet feeding and brooding duties are shared by both parents. The young eagles begin flying three months after hatching and are on their own about one month later.
What do Bald eagle eggs look like, and how large are they? Bald eagles lay white, oval shaped eggs. The eggs weigh approximately 125 grams or 4.4 ounces, and are on average about 2.9 inches long and 2.2 inches wide. Size-wise, they are just a tad smaller than a tennis ball, although tennis balls are round, not oval.
Eagles lay their eggs when they are fully mature. For example, a bald eagle lays its eggs when its about 4-5 years. Steller's sea eagles also mature at around the same time, b â€¦ ut wait to lay their eggs at the time when their feathers change color from brown to black, which takes another few years.
Most eagles only lay a single clutch of eggs. Each egg is laid about 3 days apart and incubation, the process of the eagles sitting on the egg to bring up the eggs' temperature, starts with the laying of the first egg. The eggs take almost precisely 35 days to hatch.
Number of Eggs Laid: Average 2 per nest. The average for the west coast eagle populations is almost exactly 2 eggs per clutch. Eagles can lay only one egg but can also lay three eggs and there are some rare records of 4 eggs being laid. Incubation Period: 35 days. Most eagles only lay a single clutch of eggs. Each egg is laid about 3 days apart and incubation, the process of the eagles sitting on the egg to bring up the eggs' temperature, starts with the laying of the first egg. The eggs take almost precisely 35 days to hatch.
Q. How many eggs does an average bald eagle lay in a lifetime? A. The average bald eagle clutch size is just under 2 eggs/clutch (1.9). If we assume that a female eagle begins nesting at age 5, and lives until she is 25, she will have 20 years of egg-laying.
