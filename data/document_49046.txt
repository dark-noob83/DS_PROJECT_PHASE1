The osmotic diarrhea is the only noted side effect of Stevia in dogs. Osmotic diarrhea occurs due to the nature of the molecules of Stevia drawing water from the body into the lumen of the colon (osmosis) that results in looser feces for this reason.
One of the most dangerous artificial sweeteners you may encounter in flavored yogurt is xylitol. If you give your pup yogurt containing this sweetener, it can increase his insulin levels and cause a dangerous drop in his blood-sugar level.
It will not hurt them at all. I make homemade dog treats alot, and I use a whole can of pumpkin, it is really good for them. It helps with there coat, there digestive issues, and helps with there pudding poop. The pumpkin does NOT have to be cooked.
Hi there, Thank you for your question regarding giving Stevia for dogs. I assume you are talking about the artificial sweetener. One artificial sweetener in particular is very toxic to dogs-this is xylitol and any products containing xylitol should definitely be avoided. Stevia is actually pretty safe but can cause an osmotic diarrhea, so although it isn't going to cause the toxicity that xylitol would, it still isn't very ideal. If you really want to give something like this-I would recommend a small amount of honey.
Google+. Thinkstock. Xylitol, an ingredient in many sugar-free gums and mints, leads to a rapid drop in blood sugar for dogs. To most of you, it only makes sense to keep that sugar-free German chocolate cake away from your German Shorthaired Pointer.
You're speaking to Dr. Michael Salkin. Neither erythritol nor stevia has been found to be toxic to dogs in scholarly studies but an osmotic effect can be seen after ingestion of an excessive amount of these artificial sweeteners and this is just what you're witnessing at this time.
