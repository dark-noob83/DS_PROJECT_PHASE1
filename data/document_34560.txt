As the frequency of sound is increased does the wavelength increase or decrease. As the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases. This is true for light and other electromagnetic radiation as well as sound. From the universal wave equation velocity = wavelength * frequency, it can be derived that wavelength = velocity / frequen … cy, and therefore wavelength is inversely related to frequency. For inverse relationships, when one variable increases, the other decreases. 7 people found this useful.
Increasing the frequency will always decrease the wavelength.   Wavelength lambda and frequency f are connected by the speed c of the medium.   c can be air = 343 … m/s at 20 degrees celsius or water at 0 dgrees = 1450 m/s.   c can be light waves or electromagnetic waves = 299 792 458 m/s. For example, we will say … that the standard wavelength is 5m.   F = 3.0 x 108 / 5   = 60,000,000 hertz    Say if we increased the wavelength to 6m:   F = 3.0 x 108 / 6   = 50,000,000 hertz     As you can see, if we increase the wavelength, the frequency decreases.
If you increase frequency you decrease wavelength, at the same wave velocity. The speed of a mechanical wave in a medium depends on 2 things an elasticity term (on the top) an mass/inertia/density term (on the bottom) The greater the restoring force in the medium, the greater the speed of the waves. It doesn't. Apart from light in a vacuum, the speed of a wave in a medium will vary with frequency or wavelength. It's called dispersion. Apart from light in glass, which is well known, the speed of sound in gases in some cases will increase with frequency. At higher frequencies in CO2 for example.
Report Abuse. Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional. So as frequency increases, the wavelength decreases. One way to think about this is frequency is the number of cycles that occur in a period of time, like a cycle per second, or Hertz. So if you increase the number of times that your repeat the cycle, the wavelength has to get smaller to accommodate. Thus if you use sound sources of higher frequencies, the wavelengths will decrease. This is because v= speed of sound = frequency * wavelength As v remains the same, increasing frequency,should decrease the wavelength.
When the wavelength decreases the frequency increases.   Wavelength lambda and frequency f are connected by the speed c of the medium.   c can be air = 343 m/s at … 20 degrees celsius or water at 0 dgrees = 1450 m/s.   c can be light waves or electromagnetic waves = 299 792 458 m/s.

If you pass light through glass, its speed decreases and its frequency remains constant. This means the wavelength must decrease while the frequency stays the same. With waves it tends to be frequency that is constant. You need to think more about how, in this case, wavelength varies with speed. (Original post by muh123). I need a proper explanation to why it happens, I just don't understand why. It doesn't. Apart from light in a vacuum, the speed of a wave in a medium will vary with frequency or wavelength. It's called dispersion. Apart from light in glass, which is well known, the speed of sound in gases in some cases will increase with frequency. At higher frequencies in CO2 for example.
