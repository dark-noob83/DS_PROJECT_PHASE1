Without the atmosphere, the temperature on Earth would be more like the Moon, which rises to 116° C in the day, and then dips down to -173° C at night. The reason the average temperature on Earth is so high is because of the atmosphere. This acts like a blanket, trapping infrared radiation close to the planet and warming it up.
The distance from Earth to the sun is one of the most important factors in making Earth habitable. The next closest planet to the sun, Venus, for example, is the hottest planet in the solar system. Temperatures there reach more than 750 F (400 C), while the average temperature on Mars is minus 80 F (minus 60 C). Which location holds the record as the hottest place on Earth is a matter of some contention. El Azizia, Libya, held the top hot spot for 90 years. Temperatures allegedly climbed to 136.4 F (58 C) on Sept. 13, 1922.
temp. ranges from 425 degrees in the day to -170 degrees at night. From the night, Mercury's surface temperature changes 1,130 °F (630 °C), more than any other planet … or moon in the solar system. Just before sunrise on a typical day on Mercury the temperature is -300 °F (-180 °C). By midmorning the temperature rises to 80 °F (27 °C). While there is day on one side of the Earth, we have night on the other side, i.e. we always have both day and night on the Earth. In that sense, there is no answer to this qu … estion.   A: It's about 63 degrees Fahrenheit.
The average Earth surface temperature is 14° C. That’s 287 kelvin, or 57.2° F. Sea temperature model. As you probably realize, that number is just an average. The reason the average temperature on Earth is so high is because of the atmosphere. This acts like a blanket, trapping infrared radiation close to the planet and warming it up.
The average temperature on the Moon (at the equator and mid latitudes) varies from -298 degrees Fahrenheit (-183 degrees Celsius), at night, to 224 degrees Fahrenheit (106 degrees Celsius) during the day. 
The average temperature on Earth is about 61 degrees F (16 C). But temperatures vary greatly around the world depending on the time of year, ocean and wind currents and weather conditions. Summers tend to be warmer and winters colder. Also, temperatures tend to be higher near the equator and lower near the poles. Which location holds the record as the hottest place on Earth is a matter of some contention. El Azizia, Libya, held the top hot spot for 90 years. Temperatures allegedly climbed to 136.4 F (58 C) on Sept. 13, 1922.
The Earth’s temperature can be much higher or lower than this temperature. In the hottest places of the planet, in the deserts near the equator, the temperature on Earth can get as high as 57.7° C. And then in the coldest place, at the south pole in Antarctica, the temperature can dip down to -89° C. The reason the average temperature on Earth is so high is because of the atmosphere. This acts like a blanket, trapping infrared radiation close to the planet and warming it up.
Temperature Extremes. Earth's surface temperature depends on how much energy it receives from the sun. The equator, which is in direct sunlight all year, tends to be the hottest place, but the highest air temperature ever recorded was at Death Valley, California, in 1913. It was 56.7 degrees Celsius (134 degree Fahrenheit). Its average surface temperature is following a warming trend. In 2013, Earth's average temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius (58.3 degrees Fahrenheit), according to NASA.
