The price for the drone is $999, but you need supply the GoPro and gimbal, bringing the total price to around $1,800. The first unit I got had gimbal issues, which resulted in shaky footage, although the second fixed that.
The CIA has about 30 Predator and Reaper drones, which are operated by Air Force pilots from a U.S. military base in an unnamed U.S. state. The Department of Homeland Security has at least ten unarmed Predator drones, costing approximately $62 million a year. The cost per flight hour varies by type of drone. Predator and Reaper drones cost about $2,500-3,500 per flight hour; larger armed systems such as the militaryâ€™s Global Hawk cost about 10 times as much: approximately $30,000 per flight hour.
While the Reaper's per-hour cost is cheaper than manned fighters, their missions are drastically longer, meaning that overall costs stay high. Wheeler estimated that a CAP of drones would cost around $20 million per year to operate, around four times as much as the F-16 or A-10.
According to recent reports, the Pentagon now has some 7,000 aerial drones, compared with fewer than 50 a decade ago. The fiscal year 2016 budget included $2.9 billion for drone research, development, and procurement.
Price/Unit Cost: The MQ-1B Predator is no longer being purchased by the Air Force. The unit cost of the Army's MQ-1C Gray Eagle is $4.98 million in FY 2015, while the MQ-9 Reaper costs $13.77 million. These prices are for air vehicles only and does not include the cost of ground stations and other associated equipment.
Using the example of the MQ-9 Reaper drone, which entered service in 2007, he estimated the true cost of the aircraft at a stunning $120.8 million dollars. Part of the reason for the gap, according to Wheeler, is that other estimates ignore the support costs required to keep drones flying.
