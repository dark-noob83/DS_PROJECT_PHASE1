Relating to the form of a gene that is not expressed as a trait in an individual unless two such genes are inherited, one from each parent. In an organism having two different genes for a trait, the recessive form is suppressed by its counterpart, or dominant, form located on the other of a pair of chromosomes.
Recessive trait. Definition. noun. (genetics) A genetic trait that results from the expression of the two recessive alleles. Supplement. When the dominant allele is lacking or when the two alleles present are both recessive, their expression results in a recessive trait. Also called: 1  recessive character.
(In genetic terms, a dominant trait is one that is phenotypically expressed in heterozygotes). A dominant trait is opposed to a recessive trait which is expressed only when two copies of the gene are present. (In genetic terms, a recessive trait is one that is phenotypically expressed only in homozygotes). Examples of dominant disorders include: 1  Achondroplasia (a common form of dwarfism with short arms and legs),
Examples of Recessive Traits. We know many examples of traits controlled by recessive alleles; however, as scientists are more thoroughly studying the genetics of traits, they are finding that many have multiple genes and alleles associated with them, instead of just one gene with two alleles as explained above.
Recessive trait. An inherited trait that is outwardly obvious only when two copies of the gene for that trait are presentâ€”as opposed to a dominant trait where one copy of the gene for the dominant trait is sufficient to display the trait.
Another way to define a recessive trait is one that is never expressed by the heterozygous genotype. For example, the heterozygous genotype for earlobe type (Ee) produces detached earlobes because the dominant allele (E) hides the effects of the recessive allele (e).
