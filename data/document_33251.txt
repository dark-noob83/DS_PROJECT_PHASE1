The protolith may be a sedimentary rock, an igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock. Metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth 's crust and are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage (metamorphic facies). Quartzite, a form of metamorphic rock, from the Museum of Geology at University of Tartu collection. Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means change in form.
For example, slate is a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale. Non-foliated rock does not have planar patterns of strain. Rocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated.

Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means change in form.
Metamorphic minerals are those that form only at the high temperatures and pressures associated with the process of metamorphism. These minerals, known as index minerals, include sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, andalusite, and some garnet.

Metamorphic rocks are those formed by altering igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks by heat and/or pressure. The heat and pressure cause changes in the minerals present, as well as rearranging the minerals in the rocks. Metamorphic rock names are based on grain size, organization of minerals into layers (foliation), and composition. Pennsylvania has gneiss, schist, phyllite, slate, marble, and quartzite. Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling of molten material, either lava (above ground) or magma (underground). They are classified by what minerals they contain and the grain size of the minerals (coarse enough to be seen with the naked eye, or too fine to be seen).

Anthracite is a metamorphic rock commonly called coal ,whose protolith or parent rock is bituminous coal. Bituminous coal is a sedimentary rock. Anthracite coal is considered a metamorphic rock. 5 people found this useful. Edit.

Coal is an organic sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation and preservation of plant materials, usually in a swamp environment. Coal is a combustible rock and along with oil and natural gas it is one of the three most important fossil fuels. Coal has a wide range of uses; the most important use is for the generation of electricity. Coal forms from the accumulation of plant debri
Metamorphic rock fabrics and textures. Foliated rocks have a ‘fabric’, called a foliation, caused by the parallel alignment of mineral grains. Textures of Foliated Metamorphic Rocks (listed from lowest grade to highest). 1. Slate has a parallel foliation of fine-grained, platy minerals (e.g. micas). 2.
A metamorphic rock is an igneous, sedimentary, or ano … ther metamorphic rock that has either been squeezed by incredible pressures deep underground and/or has been exposed to very high temperatures, altering its structure, mineral alignment, mineralogy, and possibly its chemistry. 3 people found this useful.
