3. Roast. Throw that skillet in the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes more, flipping the tenderloin over halfway through cooking, until the meat reaches 140°F (or, if you don't have a meat thermometer, until it feels firm and springs back when pressed with your finger and the juices run clear when poked with a knife). 
2. When Ready to Cook: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 225°F. Place baking sheet with rack and tenderloin in the oven and roast until internal temperature registers 120 to 125°F on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes. 
Roast the tenderloin for 15 to 20 minutes. Take the ovenproof skillet off the stovetop and transfer the entire pan, tenderloin included, to the oven. Cook until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink, roughly 20 minutes. Pork tenderloin is fairly easy to prepare in the oven, but you need to make sure that you do not overcook it to prevent the meat from drying out. Marinating the meat beforehand is a common method used to add flavor, tenderness, and moisture. From there, the pork tenderloin can be roasted or broiled.
Let the tenderloin cool before serving. Pan-roasting pork tenderloin Preheat your oven to 425ºF and coat an ovenproof skillet with oil. Sear the tenderloin over medium-high heat until it’s brown on all sides. Roast the tenderloin for 15 to 20 minutes until the internal temperature reads 145ºF. You can grill it or roast it. Grilling pork tenderloin Always cook the tenderloin over indirect heat. Depending on its size, it usually takes 20 to 30 minutes over medium-high heat. Flip the tenderloin every 4 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 135ºF to 140ºF.

1 Place the tenderloin in a roasting pan. 2  Place the pan in the oven and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 3  Allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes before serving. 
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Place the tenderloin on a roasting rack. Sprinkle generously with kosher salt and sugar, which will deepen the savory flavors. Press the crushed peppercorns all over the surface of the meat. Insert a meat thermometer and place in the oven until the beef registers 120 to 125 degrees F for medium-rare/rare. Beef will probably cook in 20 to 25 minutes depending on its temp before it goes in the oven. 
1 Preheat oven to 500 degrees. 2  Remove tenderloin from refrigerator. 3  Season meat as desired. 4  Place seasoned meat in an uncovered roasting pan on a shelf in the bottom 1/3 of your oven. 5  Bake EXACTLY 5 1/2 minutes PER POUND. 6  Adjust +/- according to your oven's accuracy and heat retention. 7  NOTE:. 1 Weight will determine how long to cook the roast. 2  Preheat oven to 500 degrees. 3  Remove tenderloin from refrigerator. 4  Season meat as desired. 5
1 Preheat the oven and pan: Ten to 20 minutes before you plan to cook, place the skillet in the oven on a middle rack and preheat the oven to 450°F. 2  The skillet will heat along with the oven. 3  Season the pork: Pat the pork dry and cut off any large pieces of surface fat. Roast the pork for 10 minutes: Set the pork in the pan. (It's fine if your pork tenderloin is a little long for the pan; just bend it to fit as we did here.) Return the pan to the oven. Roast for 10 minutes. Flip the pork, reduce the heat, and roast another 10 to 15 minutes: Flip the pork to the other side.
