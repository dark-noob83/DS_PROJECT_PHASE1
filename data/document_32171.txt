Thatâ€™s a range of anywhere from a little over $2,000 out of pocket to more than $31,000! In 2012, the average cost in the US was $9,775 for a delivery, with the average Cesarean costing $15, 041.
If you don't have health insurance, the average cost of prenatal care is about $2,000. One of the most important parts of prenatal care is a prenatal vitamin. You need one that contains at least 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid to help prevent neural tube birth defects. This is one cost you should start paying even before you get pregnant. About half of all pregnancies are surprises. So all women of childbearing age should take a multivitamin that contains folic acid, Conry says. For an over-the-counter option, the cost ranges from $10 to $20. If it's prescribed by your doctor and covered by your insurance you'll pay whatever the co-pay price is. Either way, this could be one of the most important pregnancy investments you make
