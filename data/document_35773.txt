A recent European Commission report states ‘a smart metering system could cost on average £158 to £198 per customer’. The Government’s latest Impact Assessment puts the cost of installing dual fuel meters at £214.80, which will be added to bills. Unveiled: New £200 'smart' meters every household must pay for (but may not work). 1  Minister and Bob Geldof to launch £11bn scheme to make us all use 'green' meters... 2  which other EU nations rejected. 3  Project will be launched this week despite fears they will not work and they pose a security risk to power supplies.
All utility consumers are entitled to a smart meter in their home, regardless of whether you use prepayment or credit energy meters. It is the responsibility of the energy supplier to install smart meters in consumers’ homes. Most energy providers, however, do not currently support smart meter technology, and will not be distributing and installing smart meters until 2015. The smart meter rollout is a UK government initiative that sees standard gas and electricity meters replaced with smart meters in accordance with the EU’s Energy Efficiency Directive. The rollout, which is due to begin in 2015, requires all energy providers to install smart meters in customers’ homes.
Energy companies will begin the mass installation of smart meters next year at a cost of at least £200 per home, and have admitted the expense will be passed on to customers. How it works: This diagram explains how the new smart meters will work, or more precisely, how they won't.

Smart meters can only benefit you: they cost nothing to install and can save you money by helping to reduce energy bills as you become more aware of your energy usage. Smart meters eliminate the need for estimated bills, as they send readings directly and automatically to energy suppliers through wireless technology.

In Texas, where state law encourages installation of smart meters, the public utility counsel, a consumer advocate, got the utilities to agree to pay tens of millions of dollars for public education and to subsidize the cost of an in-home display to give an instantaneous price in low-income households. The meters cost the utility roughly $220 apiece, including installation. Elizabeth Keogh, a retired social worker in Bakersfield, Calif., who describes herself as “a bit chintzy,” has created a spreadsheet with 26 years of electric bills for her modest house. She decided that her new meter was running too fast.
