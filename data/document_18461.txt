The normal pH of blood running through arteries (large elastic-walled blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body) is 7.4; the pH of blood in the veins (vessels that transports blood to the heart) is about 7.35. Normal urine pH averages about 6.0. Saliva has a pH between 6.0 and 7.4. 
1 BLOOD GAS VARIATIONS BLOOD pH Normal range 7.35 â€“ 7.45 Think of 7.40 as your new 0 or neutral If the reading is below 7.4 it is acid. Below 7.35 it is acid out of range or Acidosis If the reading is above 7.4 it is alkaline. 
The pH range is from 0 to 14, with 7.0 being neutral. Anything above 7.0 is alkaline, anything below 7.0 is considered acidic. Human blood stays in a very narrow pH range right around (7.35 - 7.45). Below or above this range means symptoms and disease. If blood pH moves to much below 6.8 or above 7.8, cells stop functioning and the patient dies.
Numerical Range. Normal blood pH is 7.4. Lower than pH 7.4, the blood is acidic, and higher than 7.4 the blood is basic, or alkaline. Large changes in blood acidity results in small changes in the pH. The blood pH is a measure of the acidity of the blood. It stands for power of hydrogen and represents the concentration of hydrogen ions, which make the blood acidic. Acidic or alkaline blood can interfere with processes in the body and be both a result of disease and a cause of further problems
Blood pH is tightly regulated by a system of buffers that continuously maintain it in a normal range of 7.35 to 7.45 (slightly alkaline). Blood pH drop below 7 can lead to a coma and even death due to severe acidosis. This causes depression of the central nervous system. High blood pH (above 7.45) is called alkalosis. Hence, breathing directly affects blood pH. In its turn, blood pH is tightly monitored within a very narrow range (from about 7.3 to 7.5) by the group of nerve cells located in the medulla oblongata in order to have normal-body biochemistry.
Arterial and venous blood must maintain a slightly alkaline pH: arterial blood pH = 7.41 and venous blood pH = 7.36. Because the normal pH of arterial blood is 7.41, a person is considered to have acidosis when the pH of blood falls below this value and to have alkalosis when the pH rises above 7.41. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Normal arterial blood pH is 7.40, with a range of about 7.36-7.44. Blood pH depends on carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and bicarbonate (HCO3) concentration. Because there is more CO2 in venous blood, pH of venous blood is slightly lower, around 7.38
In mammals, the normal pH of arterial blood lies between 7.35 and 7.50 depending on the species (e.g. healthy human-arterial blood pH varies between 7.35 and 7.45). Blood pH values compatible with life in mammals are limited to a pH range between 6.8 and 7.8. If not further qualified, it usually refers to acidity of the blood plasma. Acidosis is said to occur when arterial pH falls below 7.35 (except in the fetus-see below), while its counterpart (alkalosis) occurs at a pH over 7.45.
A pH of 7 is neutral. The lower the pH, the more acidic the blood. A variety of factors affect blood pH including what is ingested, vomiting, diarrhea, lung function, endocrine function, kidney function, and urinary tract infection. The normal blood pH is tightly regulated between 7.35 and 7.45.
