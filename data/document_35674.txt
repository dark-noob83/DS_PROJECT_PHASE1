Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day [ 1 ]. It could be a scary future indeed, with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century [ 2 ]. No group of animals has a higher rate of endangerment than amphibians. Scientists estimate that a third or more of all the roughly 6,300 known species of amphibians are at risk of extinction [ 6 ]. The current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate [ 7 ].
Some researchers believe there are more than 100 million species on our planet today, but scientists have identified fewer than 2 million, or about 2 percent. In fact, new animals are still being found! We've discovered 10 new species of mammals over the past 10 years, Eggert said. We are now in a mass extinction. Eggert said this is largely because of habitat loss. Just like people, animals need space to live
1 These experts calculate that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year. 2  If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true-i.e. that there are around 2 million different species on our planet** - then that means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year. 1 The rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate 2  .*. These experts calculate that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year.
So let's say there are 17 million species on earth, just to plot it right in the middle. 200 species per day = 73000 species per year. So if there are 17 million species on earth, and we lose 73000 whole species per year, that means in 232.8 years there not be a single living organism on earth. No animals, plants, humans, fungus, NOTHING in 232.8 years. Earth will just be a bald, powdery rock in 232 years, just like the Moon.
According to the UN Environment Programme, the Earth is in the midst of a mass extinction of life. Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. 
They estimate that more than one-tenth of these species are endangered. That adds up to at least one million kinds of plants and animals that could become extinct by the year 2015. In recent years the rate of extinction has increased too fast to too many species of plants and animals, in too many places. In the past 300 years, about 100 kinds of mammals have become extinct. Right now hundreds of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish are endangered, as well as more than 25,000 plants. The American Museum of Natural History in New York reports: Three species become extinct every hour of every day
Nobody really knows how many species are in danger of becoming extinct. Noted conservation scientist David Wilcove estimates that there are 14,000 to 35,000 endangered species in the United States, which is 7 to 18 percent of U.S. flora and fauna. No group of animals has a higher rate of endangerment than amphibians. Scientists estimate that a third or more of all the roughly 6,300 known species of amphibians are at risk of extinction [ 6 ]. The current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate [ 7 ].
Globally, BirdLife International estimates that 12 percent of known 9,865 bird species are now considered threatened, with 192 species, or 2 percent, facing an “extremely high risk” of extinction in the wild — two more species than in 2008. No group of animals has a higher rate of endangerment than amphibians. Scientists estimate that a third or more of all the roughly 6,300 known species of amphibians are at risk of extinction [ 6 ]. The current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate [ 7 ].
