comparing the cost of heating fuels see below will show that heating with a petroleum product or electricity will cost approximately $ 40 00 for a million btus geothermal will cost anywhere from one third to one quarter of this amount
according to the united states department of energy the average cost of a geothermal heat pump system is $ 2500 per ton the agency goes on to say that the average residential property is going to require a unit of three tons to supply their needs
geothermal heating system price varies depending on the type of loop system usually either vertical or horizontal on average a typical home of 2500 square feet with a heating load of 60000 btu and a cooling load of 60000 btu will cost between $ 20000 to $ 25000 to install
the initial costs of geothermal energy are high wells can cost $ 1 to $ 4 million each to drill and installation of a home geothermal pump system can run as much as $ 30000 sources repp consumer energy center
the cost of drilling varies somewhat with the depth required the wider the bore of the drilled hole the more efficient it can be the geothermal energy cost range for power stations is $ 2500 to $ 6500 per kilowatt production
let s not sugarcoat it installing a geothermal system is expensive it costs $ 10000 to $ 30000 depending on your soil conditions plot size system configuration site accessibility and the amount of digging and drilling required for a typical 2000 sq ft home a geothermal retrofit ranges from $ 10000 to $ 20000
standard air source hvac systems cost around $ 3000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity during new construction homes usually use between one and five tons geothermal hvac systems start at about $ 5000 per ton and can go as high as $ 8000 or $ 9
part of the geothermal energy cost of such an approach can be earth tremors as occurred in basel switzerland over 10000 seismic events of up to 3 4 on the richter scale through a six day hydrofracturing period were recorded
the initial cost for the field and power plant is around $ 2500 per installed kw operating and maintenance costs range from $ 0 01 to $ 0 03 per kwh most geothermal power plants can run at greater than 90 % availability i e producing more than 90 % of the time but running at 97 % or 98 % can increase
