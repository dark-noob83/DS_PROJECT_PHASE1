Horizon Pharma (HZNP) plunged Tuesday on news of its hostile takeover bid for Depomed (DEPO), but with HZNP stock up 160% so far this year, shareholders can afford a little pullback. HZNP has been trying to buy DEPO since March, only to be rebuffed repeatedly.
With DEPO declining to even enter into a discussion, HZNP offered $3 billion, including debt, which sure looks good on paper. At $29.25 a share, Horizon Pharma’s bid represents a 42% premium to Depomed’s closing share price. Of course, DEPO added nearly 40% at one point in early trading.
DepoMed Inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on pain and other conditions and diseases of the central nervous system.
