The skeleton of the echinoderms, which include, among other things, the starfish, is composed of calcite and a small amount of magnesium oxide. It lies below the epidermis in the mesoderm and is within cell clusters of frame-forming cells. This structure formed is porous and therefore firm and at the same time light. A hydrostatic skeleton is a semi-rigid, soft tissue structure filled with liquid under pressure, surrounded by muscles. Longitudinal and circular muscles around their body sectors allow movement by alternate lengthening and contractions along their lengths. A common example of this is earthworm.
There are two different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, and the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body. There are also two other forms of skeleton referred to, the hydroskeleton and the cytoskeleton. A hydrostatic skeleton is a semi-rigid, soft tissue structure filled with liquid under pressure, surrounded by muscles. Longitudinal and circular muscles around their body sectors allow movement by alternate lengthening and contractions along their lengths. A common example of this is earthworm.
Bone shapes. An adult skeleton is made up of 206 bones, which come in several different shapes and sizes. The shape of a bone reflects its role within your body: 1  Long bones, like in your arms and legs, are mostly made of compact bone. 2  Short bones, like the bones in your wrists and ankles, are mainly made of spongy bone
The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage as in the (Chondrichthyes), or bones as in the (Osteichthyes). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong.

The skeleton. The skeleton is the framework of bones which gives shape and support to the body. It also protects the internal organs like the heart and lungs. In the illustration below, you can see the human skeleton with the labels either on or off by clicking on the 'Labels on' or 'Labels off' but
The skeletal formula, sometimes called line-angle formula, of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of its bonding and some details of its molecular geometry. It is represented in two dimensions, as on a page of paper. The skeletal structure of an organic compound is the series of atoms bonded together that form the essential structure of the compound. The skeleton can consist of chains, branches and/or rings of bonded atoms.
It consists of bones, ligaments, and cartilage. The skeleton is composed of the hard tissues of the body, and its primary functions are to support the body, to provide a system of levers used in locomotion, to protect the soft organs of the body, and to produce red blood cells (hematopoiesis). The cat skeleton has an average of 250 bones. 1 Appendicular skeleton – the bones of the limbs. 2  Axial skeleton – the bones of the skull, spine, ribs and sternum. 3  Visceral skeleton – bone that forms part of an organ (such as the middle ear ossicles). 4  Bones are organs composed of hard, mineralized tissue that provide structural support to the body.
Bones are rigid organs that form part of the endoskeleton of vertebrates. They function to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells and store minerals. Bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue.

Bones are rigid organs that form part of the endoskeleton of vertebrates. They function to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells and store minerals. Bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue. Bones have a complex internal and external structure making them lightweight, yet strong and hard. One of the types of tissue that makes up bone is mineralized osseous tissue. This tissue gives bone rigidity and a honeycomb-like three-dimensional internal structure. Other types of tissue found in bones include marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage.The skeleton is an animal’s internal support frame. Other animals possess a skeleton on the outside of their body called an exoskeleton. Vertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that possess a vertebral column or “backbone”. This, along with the rest of the animal’s skeleton, comprises a support frame for the body and helps to protect vital organs.
