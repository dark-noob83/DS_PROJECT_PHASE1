So here's how I did it. Do not try to use Glade plug-ins, it DOES NOT work, once you take the top off it doesn't snap back on. I tried to super glue it back on and that didn't work either. I used Febreze & Airwick.
1 Use only Glade ® PlugIns ® Scented Oil brand refills in PlugIns ® Scented Oil warmer units. 2  Unit will not operate properly if positioned sideways or upside down. 3  Use only properly functioning 120-volt electrical outlet. 4  Do not place fragrance oil bottle or cap on painted, finished or plastic surfaces.
Glade scented oil Plug-Ins are a dangerous product, particularly if small children are around. The scented oil Plug-In works the best of any other Plug-In but the actual oil is dangerous.
When empty, replace fragrance oil bottle with Glade ® PlugIns ® Scented Oil refills only. Do not use any other refills in Glade ® PlugIns ® Scented Oil Warmers. Fragrance oils may collect on warmer unit over time. To clean, remove warmer unit from electrical outlet and wipe with dry cloth. Wash hands after handling.
I hope that made sense, lol. Ask someone that doesn't live in your home if they smell it when they come over. If it is in fact that the Glade Plug-ins don't work well, try the Febreeze plug-ins. They cost a little more at $8 and the refills are around $4, but they work really well and last forever. Hope this helps.
