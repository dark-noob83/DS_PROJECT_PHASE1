Light your walkway with a post mount or a pier mount bracket post light from top brands like Hinkley, Z Lite and Livex Lighting. And remember quality is important for a light like this. 
From the base of the column, connect a vertical conduit from the conduit in the ground. Cover the end of the exposed conduit to prevent it from touching wet cement. Once your conduit is in place, you can pour the cement into the concrete form. Mount a conduit on the surface if the concrete column already exists. You can use conduit straps and concrete screws to secure it to a concrete, brick or masonry surface. A hammer drill is used to make a hole for the concrete screws. Save. Installing lights on concrete columns can be a challenging task if you have no experience in wiring electrical materials inside or outside your home. If instructions and safety guidelines are followed, you can put in a light on any concrete column or structure, before or after the column is built.
Step 8: Add the Light Fixture. To mount the light base, position it in the center of the post. Mark the position of the screw holes. Drill holes for the masonry anchors using a power drill with a masonry bit. Building a light post is easy. Light posts can be built on existing patios or pavement, as well as on an unfinished surface such as soil or grass. If you will be building in an area that does not have an existing patio or pavement, see How-to Sheet #220 Building Posts for more information.

Connect the Grounds Together. Turn off the power to the circuit that the outside light switch is connected to. Unhook the switch from its box to give you room to work. Connect your grounds together -- the white to all neutral wires, and the black to the switch leg side, opposite the wires on the switch. Dig a Trench. Dig the trench for the electrical lines. Start with the corner that the electrical light is coming from. Go slow and steady. It is better to dig by hand if you are digging next to the house.
