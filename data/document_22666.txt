Be honest about how you want to live in retirement and how much it will cost. These estimates are important when it comes time to figure out how much you need to save in order to comfortably afford your retirement. One way to begin estimating your retirement costs is to take a close look at your current expenses in various categories, and then estimate how they will change. For example, your mortgage might be paid off by then-and you won't have commuting costs. Then again, your health care costs are likely to rise
How Much Does a Baby Cost in the First Year. After nailing down preparation for pre-labor and deliver/hospital costs, you should consider examining the amount of money needed to get through your baby’s first year. Believe it or not, there are plenty of tools to help you get through this. Children do not have to cost a lot. I had great insurance so we spent under $1000 for our delivery. Tax credits and deductions help. Craigslist and children’s consignment sales are great ways to get baby gear, clothes, and toys for very little money.
Let someone else do it for you. If you've really got to have that $300 stroller, put it on your gift registry. Expectant parents in our survey were counting on their friends and family to buy 46 percent of their baby's first year of clothes, 40 percent of toys and 39 percent of baby-care items as gifts. Nearly half of new parents say they spent more money than necessary on a car seat; 36% overspent on strollers; about 25% went overboard on baby photos, a crib and clothing. All new parents say they won't lavish their child with toys and clothes. But many respondents to our survey did just that.

That’s the amount you need in your individual retirement account, 401(k) or other savings vehicle to close the gap of $2,000 a month. Like all the other numbers you project into retirement, these are estimates and averages. First, figure out approximately how much you’ll need to spend, either on an annual basis or a monthly basis. If you do it by the month, don’t forget to add in expenses that only come once or twice a year, such as insurance bills, tax bills and vacation bills.
The average baby goes through 10 diapers a day. If you use disposable diapers, that'll cost you about $2,000 by the time your little one is potty-trained! The cost of cleaning their little bottom with a wet wipe or two at each diaper change will add about $100 to your monthly grocery bill. And that doesn't include the cost of a college education. In the first year alone, the costs of a baby can reach between $9,000 and $11,000, and most new and expectant parents don't realize the size of the financial burden they are taking on.
