A bacteriophage is the whole virus that attacks bacteria and either goes into the lytic direct attack which destroys the bacterial DNA while the phage uses the cell machinery to replicate, or it inserts its own genetic material into the bacterial DNA in the lysogenic cycle becoming a prophage. A prophage is viral genetic material (DNA) inseted into bacterial DNA so that when the bacteria replicates the virus gets replicated along with the bacterial DNA. Called the … lysogenic cycle.
the biral DNA that is embedded in the host's DNA is called a Prophage while Bacteriophage is a bacteria which is infected by virus. the first part is correct, a prophage is created when a bacteriophage inserts its DNA into the host cell...basically you have host DNA and bacteriophage DNA integrated together. This provides the bacteria with new properties and capabilities. A bacteriophage is actually a virus that specifically infects a bacteria. A prophage is viral genetic material (DNA) inseted into bacterial DNA so that when the bacteria replicates the virus gets replicated along with the bacterial DNA. Called the … lysogenic cycle.
A prophage is a bacteriophage (often shortened to phage) genome inserted and integrated into the circular bacterial DNA chromosome or existing as an extrachromosomal plasmid. This is a latent form of a phage, in which the viral genes are present in the bacterium without causing disruption of the bacterial cell. Upon detection of host cell damage, such as UV light or certain chemicals, the prophage is excised from the bacterial chromosome in a process called prophage induction. After induction, viral replication begins via the Lytic Cycle.
What&#39;s the difference between a Prophage and a Provirus? Aren&#39;t they the same thing?

A prophage gene is a gene of a bacteriophage (virus that targets bacteria) that is inserted and integrated into the circular bacterial DNA chromosome or plasmid. Bacteriophage … s reproduce by inserting their genome into that of a bacterium and thus getting their genes read and viral proteins produced. Confidence votes 22.7K.
