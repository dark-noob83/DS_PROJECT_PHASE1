Reconcile, Reconciliation. Reconciliation is changing for the better a relationship between two or more persons. Theologically it refers to the change of relationship between God and man. We are naturally children of wrath (Eph. 2:3), and are at enmity with God (Eph. 2:11-15); but,  . . . we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son. . .  (Rom. 5:10). Because of the death of Jesus, the Christian's relationship with God is changed for the better.
Reconciliation is also related to justification. God has reconciled the world, not counting people's sins against them. It is related to justification in Romans 5. We have been justified through faith (v. 1) by his blood (v. 9). Reconciliation is also subjective in that the sinner is spoken of as being reconciled.
