glycogen. a polysaccharide, the chief carbohydrate storage material in animals. It is formed and stored in the liver and muscles (phosphorylytically cleaved to glucose-1-phosphate). Called also animal starch.
glycogen. a polysaccharide, the chief carbohydrate storage material in animals. It is formed and stored in the liver and muscles (phosphorylytically cleaved to glucose-1-phosphate). Called also animal starch. glycogen granules. electron-dense accumulation of glycogen molecules.
It is formed from repeating units of glucose and stored chiefly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in muscle cells. Glycogen is depolymerized to glucose, which is released into the circulation as needed by the body. Also called animal starch, hepatin, tissue dextrin. See also glucose.
Glycogen is the principal storage form of glucose in animal cells. In humans, the most glycogen is found in the liver (10% of the liver mass), whereas muscles only contain a relatively low amount of glycogen (1% of the muscle mass). In addition, small amounts of glycogen are found in certain glial cells in the brain.
1. (Biochemistry) a polysaccharide consisting of glucose units: the form in which carbohydrate is stored in the liver and muscles in man and animals. It can easily be hydrolysed to glucose. Also called: animal starch.
Glycogen. a highly branched polysaccharide composed of glucose that is made and stored by LIVER and MUSCLE tissues of human beings and animals as a storage form of glucose. Glycogen is not a significant food source of carbohydrate and is not counted as one of the complex carbohydrates in foods.
glycogen. a polysaccharide that is the chief carbohydrate storage material in animals, being converted to glucose by depolymerization; it is formed by and largely stored in the liver, and to a lesser extent in muscles, and is liberated as needed. glycogen disease glycogen storage disease.
