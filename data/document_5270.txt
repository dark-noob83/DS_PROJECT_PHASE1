Specifically, in eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle (also called the TriCarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle) occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria. The cycle provides the primary means for oxidizing the acetyl carbons in acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide. In the second part of the citric acid cycle, succinyl-CoA is converted back to oxaloacetate (see also Figure 14.3), thus making it possible to begin the process again. In each turn of the citric acid cycle, two carbons are added from acetyl-CoA and two carbons are oxidized as CO 2.
Within the Krebs cycle, energy in the form of ATP is usually derived from the breakdown of glucose, although fats and proteins can also be utilized as energy sources. Since glucose can pass through cell membranes, it transports energy from one part of the body to another. The Krebs cycle is the second stage of aerobic respiration, the first being glycolysis and last being the electron transport chain; the cycle is a series of stages that every living cell must undergo in order to produce energy.
1 The citric acid cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate). 1 Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich electrons to NAD + , forming NADH. 2  For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced.

1 To do so, pyruvate molecules are processed through the Krebs Cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle. 2  This cycle occurs in the mitochondria. 3  KREBS CYCLE YIELDS (2 CYCLES, 1 FOR EACH PYRUVATE): 24 ATP; 6 NADH + H + , 2 GTP, 2FADH Click HERE for an excellent animation of the Krebs Cycle. Citrate is formed when the acetyl group from acetyl CoA combines with oxaloacetate from the previous Krebs cycle. 3. Citrate is converted into its isomer isocitrate. 4. Isocitrate is oxidized to form the 5-carbon α-ketoglutarate. This step releases one molecule of CO 2 and reduces NAD + to NADH 2 + .
During cell respiration, the Citric Acid Cycle can only take place after Acetyl-CoA is generated from Glycolysis. As you can see from the image below, Prokaryotes do not have organelles or membrane enclosed sacs to separate functions, so the Citric Acid Cycle must occur in the cytosol. 
In simple terms, the Krebs’ cycle metabolizes acetyl coenzyme A into citric acid and then runs through a complex series of biological oxidations, producing free hydrogen ions. A net of two molecules of ATP is created at this stage in the Krebs’ cycle. Hans A. Krebs first elucidated the process of cells converting food into energy, the Citric Acid Cycle, in 1937. Krebs proposed a specific metabolic pathway within the cells to account for the oxidation of the basic components of food – carbohydrates, protein and fats – w for energy.

The Kreb's cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotic cells. In prokaryotic cells, which have no mitochondria, the Kreb's cycle occurs in the cytoplasm.
The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a series of chemical reactions in the cell that breaks down food molecules into carbon dioxide, water, and energy. In plants and animals, these reactions take place in the mitochondria of the cell as part of cellular respiration. Citric Acid Cycle-Overview of the Citric Acid Cycle. The Citric Acid Cycle is also known as the Krebs Cycle or Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle. It is a series of chemical reactions that takes place in the cell that breaks down food molecules into carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Photo Credit: Narayanese, wikipedia.org
