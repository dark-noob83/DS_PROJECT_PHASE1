For the example, assume that the tax rate is 20% and that the pretax interest rate on an investment is 5%. After paying income taxes, the individual would be left with $16,000 that could be consumed. Assuming the individual put all $16,000 into savings, they would earn $800 in interest after one year. Under a consumption-based tax system, the rate on consumption is the same 20% as in the income-based system. If the taxpayer consumes every dime, they would pay $4,000 in taxes ($20,000 x 20%) and could have consumed the remaining $16,000 — just like the previous example with the income taxes.
Progressive tax rates are marginal, meaning that each rate applies to specific portions of your taxable income within a specified range, or tax bracket. For example, if you are single and have taxable income of $200,000 in 2014, then you are in the 33 percent bracket.. In the 2014 tax year, for example, single people with a taxable income of $9,075 or less pay federal income tax at the tax rate of 10 percent.
The first $50,000 of corporate taxable income is taxed at a rate of 15 percent; income of $50,000 to $75,000 is taxed at a 25 percent rate; income of $75,000 to $10 million is taxed at a 34 percent rate; and income above $10 million is generally taxed at a rate of 35 percent. This option would increase all corporate income tax rates by 1 percentage point. For example, the corporate income tax rate would increase to 36 percent for taxable income above $10 million. The option would increase revenues by $113 billion over the 2014–2023 period, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. The major argument in favor of the option is its simplicity
The additional marginal tax rates would increase as taxable income increases. For joint filers, for example, an additional 1 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income between $500,000 and $600,000 per year, increasing the total rate to 10.3 percent. Similarly, an additional 2 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income between $600,000 and $1 million, and an additional 3 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income above $1 million, increasing the total rates on these income brackets to 11.3 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively.
The federal government and most states use a system of progressive income tax rates. This means that as your taxable income increases, so does your maximum tax rate. In the 2014 tax year, for example, single people with a taxable income of $9,075 or less pay federal income tax at the tax rate of 10 percent.
Unless you are in the lowest tax bracket, you actually have two or more tax brackets. If you are in the 25% tax bracket, for example, you pay tax at three different rates – 10%, 15%, and 25% – on different levels of your income. Based on the tax brackets, you always have more money after taxes when you earn more. For example, if you’re in the 25% tax bracket, every $100 you contribute to charity saves you $25 in federal income taxes. Knowing your tax rate also helps when you’re thinking about making a retirement plan contribution.
Raising all statutory tax rates on ordinary income by 1 percentage point would increase revenues by a total of $694 billion from 2014 through 2023, according to estimates by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). If this alternative was implemented, for example, the top rate of 39.6 percent would increase to 40.6 percent. Because the AMT would remain the same as under current law, some taxpayers would not face higher taxes under the option. Alternatively, lawmakers could target specific individual income tax rates. For example, boosting rates only on ordinary income in the top four brackets—28 percent and over—by 1 percentage point would raise revenues by $152 billion over the 10-year period, according to JCT
Although most corporate income falls within the 35 percent tax bracket, the average tax rate on corporate income (corporate taxes divided by corporate income) is lower than 35 percent because of allowable deductions, exclusions, tax credits, and the lower tax rates that apply to the first $10 million of income. This option would increase all corporate income tax rates by 1 percentage point. For example, the corporate income tax rate would increase to 36 percent for taxable income above $10 million. The option would increase revenues by $113 billion over the 2014–2023 period, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. The major argument in favor of the option is its simplicity
