From Hamilton, you can get a return student Greyhound ticket to Ottawa for $102, plus tax (6 to 7 hours). Would be cheaper if you book a Hamilton-Montreal trip using the aforementioned Greyhound Ottawa loophole. Coach Canada (aka Megabus Canada) does Toronto-Montreal direct. I typically am going once a month so I am looking for the best deal possible. I currently take the Go Bus from Hamilton to Toronto and then take the Greyhound to Ottawa. This costs me $89 round trip for the greyhound and $20 for the go station. Roughly an 8 hour day including the go bus and waiting, etc. I talked to some guy in line on Friday saying he got his ticket for just $65 dollars or something like that through greyhound as they have a competition with megabus.
