If the tissue is to recover, the blood supply needs to be restored, and angiogenesis is a critical part of this process. “Notch” is a protein-receptor found on cell membranes that is important in regulating communication between neighbouring cells “cell-cell crosstalk”. Notch is particularly important in regulating normal vascular development, being part of the genetic program that ensures arteries and veins develop correctly
Answers. Best Answer: Cell-to-Cell communication is absolutely essential for multicellular organisms. The billions of cells of a human or an oak tree must communicate in order to develop from a fertilized egg and then survive and reproduce in turn. Communication among cells is also important for many unicellular organisms that must locate food and find mates in order to sexually reproduce. The process by which a signal on a cell's surface is converted into a specific cellular response, a series of steps called a signal-transduction pathway, has been extensively studied in many types of cells.
Long-distance communication is by means of nerves and circulating hormones; the principal function of many organs, notably the endocrine glands, is to facilitate such communication between organs. Cells communicate with each other by means of an enormous diversity of signalling molecules. These molecules have traditionally been classified according to the distance over which they act. Local communication between neighbouring cells is described as paracrine signalling.
Another form of local communication is provided by gap junctions, which directly link the cytoplasm of certain cells and so allow the exchange both of ions and of small molecules between them. Cells communicate with each other by means of an enormous diversity of signalling molecules. These molecules have traditionally been classified according to the distance over which they act. Local communication between neighbouring cells is described as paracrine signalling.
Consequently, the relevance of cell communication is quite vast, but major areas of fundamental research are often divided between the study of signals at the cell membrane and the study of signals within and between intracellular compartments. Multiple cell types can then join together to form tissues such as muscle, blood, and brain tissue. In single-celled organisms, signaling allows populations of cells to coordinate with one another and work like a team to accomplish tasks no single cell could carry out on its own.

Cellular communication is an umbrella term used in biology and more indepth in biophysics and biochemistry to identify different types of communication methods between living cells. Some of the methods include cell signaling among others. There are three different types of basic cell communication: surface membrane to surface membrane, exterior, which is between receptors on the cell, and direct communication, which means signals pass inside the cell itself.
Autocrine signalling, wherein cells respond to signalling molecules that they have themselves released, is often presented as another category of signalling mechanism, although it too describes local communication, but between similar cells. Cells communicate with each other by means of an enormous diversity of signalling molecules. These molecules have traditionally been classified according to the distance over which they act. Local communication between neighbouring cells is described as paracrine signalling.
The study of cell communication focuses on how a cell gives and receives messages with its environment and with itself. Indeed, cells do not live in isolation. Multiple cell types can then join together to form tissues such as muscle, blood, and brain tissue. In single-celled organisms, signaling allows populations of cells to coordinate with one another and work like a team to accomplish tasks no single cell could carry out on its own.
