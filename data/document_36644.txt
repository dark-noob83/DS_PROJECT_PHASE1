- Discussion: - early dx by postnatal screening w/ Ortolani or Barlow's Test is essential to detect hip instability or dislocation; - strictly interpreted, the Ortolani sign is the palpable sensation of the gliding of the femoral head in and out of the acetabulum; - Ortolani test identifies dislocated hip that can reduced in early weeks of life; - a positive test requires active treatment (see treatment in newborns); - if hip remains dislocated (for weeks), limitation of abduction becomes more consistent clinical finding.
HEY2. Approximately 20% of the cases of Brugada syndrome have been shown to be associated with mutations in a gene that encodes for a sodium ion channel in the cell membranes of the muscle cells of the heart (the myocytes); this is often referred to as a sodium channelopathy. The majority of patients affected by Brugada syndrome are not found to have known genetic mutations to explain the disease, as of 2015. The gene, named SCN5A, is located on the short arm of the third chromosome (3p21).
Ortoli Syndrome is the name of a genetic disease that causes erratic activity of the adrenal glands, which can lead to abrupt heart attacks. There is no such disease in existence and House mentioned the disease solely to have a fake diagnosis in order to be able to send a patient home. 
Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a genetic disease that is characterised by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The majority of patients affected by Brugada syndrome are not found to have known genetic mutations to explain the disease, as of 2015. The gene, named SCN5A, is located on the short arm of the third chromosome (3p21).
In this example, House and Chase lied to the patient so that he will believe that his condition is cured and is able to live his life without thinking he will die when he turns 40 years old. Aronson, E., Wilson, T., & Akert, R. (2007). Social Cognition: How We Think about the Social World. In Social Psychology (pp. Automatic thinking may be useful to individuals because it does not use a lot of mental effort to do a task, but controlled thinking is considered necessary whenever an individual wants to plan ahead for something, do things that are not part of his or her daily routines, or even make decisions in certain situations.
Although the ECG findings of Brugada syndrome were first reported among survivors of cardiac arrest in 1989, it was only in 1992 that the Brugada brothers recognized it as a distinct clinical entity, causing sudden death by causing ventricular fibrillation (a lethal arrhythmia) in the heart. The majority of patients affected by Brugada syndrome are not found to have known genetic mutations to explain the disease, as of 2015. The gene, named SCN5A, is located on the short arm of the third chromosome (3p21).
You just don't want anything in your life that won't let you do whatever the hell you want to do whenever the hell you want to do it. You've had it easy. Sorry to screw you up.

6,523 pages on this wiki. Giovannini Mirror Syndrome is not thought to be a real syndrome. It has occurred only twice in real life and is thought to be because someone has incured severe brain damage, causing no understanding of the person's self to be retained. 
Then at 16 minutes and 25 seconds in the episode, House made up an illness, Ortoli Syndrome, to prove the patient wrong about not being able to find what is wrong with him, but House did not inform Chase that he will make up a fake illness (Shore, Kaplow, & Shakman, 2009). Automatic thinking may be useful to individuals because it does not use a lot of mental effort to do a task, but controlled thinking is considered necessary whenever an individual wants to plan ahead for something, do things that are not part of his or her daily routines, or even make decisions in certain situations.
