An average adult body is 50 to 65 percent water -- that's roughly 45 quarts. Men are more watery than women. A man's body is 60 to 65 percent water, compared to 50 to 60 percent for a woman. In infants, the figure is a whopping 70 percent according to statistics compiled by the International Bottled Water Association.
The average human in the US weighs on average 155 lbs. If about 70% of our body is water and water weighs 8.35 lbs/gallon. When you do the math it comes out to about 13 gallons. For most adults, body weight is about 60 to 70 percent water. That equals roughly 10 to 12 gallons (38 to 46 L).
The percentage of water varies according to your age and gender. Here's a look at how much water is inside you. Answer: The amount of water in the human body ranges from 50-75%. The average adult human body is 50-65% water, averaging around 57-60%. The percentage of water in infants is much higher, typically around 75-78% water, dropping to 65% by one year of age. Body composition varies according to gender and fitness level, because fatty tissue contains less water than lean tissue.
Actually, the amount of water a body contains varies according to certain contexts: The body of a newborn is composed of more water (75%) than that of an elderly person (50%).
* The human body is more than 60 percent water. Blood is 92 percent water, the brain and muscles are 75 percent water, and bones are about 22 percent water. * A human can survive for a month or more without eating food, but only a week or so without drinking water.
The total amount of water in our body is found in three main locations: within our cells (two-thirds of the water), in the space between our cells and in our blood (one-third of the water). For example, a 70-kg man is made up of about 42L of total water.
