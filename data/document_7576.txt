The National Broadband Network (NBN) is a national wholesale-only, open-access data network and is under development in Australia. It is based on the premise that fixed line and wireless broadband connections are sold to retail service providers (RSPs), who then sell Internet access and other services to consumers. NBN Co intends to begin paying dividends back to the Federal Government in 2021, and to have fully repaid the Government's contribution by 2034. NBN Co's business plan forecasts a return on investment of 7.1%, expecting to turnover revenue of A$23.1 billion by 2021.

We will deliver your service to the Network Boundary Point at your premises, which is defined as the physical port or 'UNI' on the NBN Network Termination Device. Pro-rata from $120 in the first month of your contract, to $5 in the final month of your contract. Customers in an existing Internode ADSL contract can roll over the remainder of their contract seamlessly (without penalty) to the NBN at the same address.

It costs over $4000 per premise to directly connect a home to fibre broadband, twice as much as previous estimates, according to an internal review by NBN Co. The Abbott government will use the costings to justify its decision to pursue a multi-technology mix broadband model including fibre-to-the-node and hybrid fibre-coaxial technologies. In April 2013, under the Labor government, NBN Co estimated the cost per premises at between $2200 and $2500. NBN Co's new figures include additional inputs – such as internal labour costs and the cost of leasing Telstra's network of ducts and manholes – which were not included in previous estimates
