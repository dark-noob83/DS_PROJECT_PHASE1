1 Adipose tissue acts as an insulating layer, helping to reduce heat loss through the skin. 2  It also has a protective function, providing mechanical protection (padding) and support around some of the major organs, e.g. kidneys. 3  Adipose tissue is also a means of energy storage.

Adipose tissue is a type of connective tissue which plays an important role in the functioning of the body. Better known simply as “fat,” this tissue makes up around 15-20% of the body weight of an average person.
Adipose Tissue is a loose fibrous connective tissue that is packed with many fat cells (called  adipocytes ): Adipose tissue forms a thick layer under the skin, around the kidneys and in the buttocks. More generally, it is found at the same locations throughout the body as areolar connective tissue.
Brown adipose tissue is present in small mammals (e.g., mice) and in newborn humans. Most of it disappears in adult humans. The cells in both types of fat are called adipocytes although they differ in origin, structure, and function in the two types of tissue.

White adipose tissue stores energy reserves as fat, whereas the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue is lipid oxidation to produce heat. A good balance between them is important to maintain energy homeostasis.
