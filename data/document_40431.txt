The normal limits of the human gestation period are from 37 weeks (259 days) to 42 weeks (293 days); days and weeks are counted as completed days and weeks.
The gestation period of humans is 266 days, 8 days short of nine months. Many such biological characteristics have an explanation in terms evolutionary survival value. Even some seemingly cultural characteristics of human society have such a biological explanation.
The gestation period of a human, from time of conception to birth is approximately 9 months (266 days/38 Weeks). 9.5 months is calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period (280 days/40 Weeks). most full-term babies will come between 37-42 weeks.
Confidence votes 261. The gestation period of a human, from time of conception to birth is approximately 9 months (266 days/38 Weeks). 9.5 months is calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period (280 days/40 Weeks). most full-term babies will come between 37-42 weeks.
Thus, the gestation period for humans in days can be calculated as 280 days. However, the actual gestation period, as compared to other mammals, is around 267 days. But then what is the average gestation period for humans? It is taken to be about 259 to 294 days. Therefore, if the birth occurs in between 259 to 294 days, it is considered to be normal, while if it takes place before 259 days, it is termed as pre-term, and if it happens after 294 days, it is called post term.
Answer:   The gestation period of a human, from time of conception to birth is approximately 9 months (266 days/38 Weeks). 9.5 months is calculated from the first day of â€¦ the last menstrual period (280 days/40 Weeks).  . + 41 others found this useful.
