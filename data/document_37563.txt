Pea Gravel. The basics: Pea gravel is a small, rounded rock that got its name because the rocks are about the size of a pea. In reality pea gravel comes in different sizes — 1/4 inch, 1/2 inch and 5/8 inch are common sizes. The basics: River rocks are larger than pea gravel, typically 1 inch and larger in diameter. They're available in a variety of colors, costs and sizes, and are used to create dry creek beds or to direct drainage through a property. Cost: This type of rock is sold by the pound or by the ton.
Gravel is categorized by the Udden-Wentworth scale into granular gravel (2 to 4 mm or 0.079 to 0.157 in) and pebble gravel (4 to 64 mm or 0.2 to 2.5 in). 1 Pay gravel: also known as pay dirt; a nickname for gravel with a high concentration of gold and other precious metals. 2  The metals are recovered through gold panning.
Gravel has a specific meaning in both Civil Engineering and Geology. In both cases it is related to the diameter of the grains which the soil is composed of. The density of gravel varies depending on many many things. For one there is packed and loose density. Next the density varies much of how many fines and coarses (sand and … rock) are in the gravel mixture. There are many ways to find the density of gravel but takes a little know how.
Gravel /ˈɡraevəl/ ˈɡrævəl is composed of unconsolidated rock fragments that have a general particle size range and include size classes from-granule to-boulder sized.

Gravel is an important commercial product, with a number of applications. Many roadways are surfaced with gravel, especially in rural areas where there is little traffic. Globally, far more roads are surfaced with gravel than with concrete or tarmac; Russia alone has over 400,000 km (250,000 mi) of gravel roads. 1 Pay gravel: also known as pay dirt; a nickname for gravel with a high concentration of gold and other precious metals. 2  The metals are recovered through gold panning.
Construction sand and gravel is used to make concrete, for road construction, for mixing with asphalt, as construction fill, and in the production of construction materials like concrete blocks, bricks, and pipes. All fifty states in the United States produce sand and gravel, where more than a billion tons are produced every year. The US has extensive, quality deposits of sand and gravel, along with the technology that allows it to process the material into nearly any quality for nearly any application.
