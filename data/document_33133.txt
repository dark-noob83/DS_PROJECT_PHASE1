1 After 20 minutes of high heat cooking reduce heat to 350°F and continue to roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes OR until the meat thermometer reads 130°F for rare doneness OR 140°F for medium-rare doneness, that is the way a prime rib really should be served, check your roast after 1 hour cooking time. 1 *NOTE* if desired you can cover the roast loosely with foil the first hour and then uncover and cook for the remaining time. --------------------------------------------. 2  APPROXIMATE COOKING TIMES for the prime rib cooked at 350°F after the 20 minute cooking time at 450°F. 3  Rare; cook 12-13 minutes per pound or to 130°F.
1 Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. Directions. 1 
Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). In this case, check after 1 hour 45 minutes of total cooking time, or 1 hour 30 minutes after you lowered the oven temp to 325°. A prime rib roast is too expensive to wing it. Error on the rare side, you can always put the roast back in the oven to cook it more if it is too rare for your taste. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium.
1 Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 2  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5

Residual Heat or Carry-Over Cooking: Remember, the rib roast will continue to cook as it sets. The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit. Cook until rib roast reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F. (or your desired temperature). Remove from oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Cutting into the meat too early will cause a significant loss of juice. Do not skip the resting stage.
Sear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast. Cook until rib roast reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F. (or your desired temperature). Remove from oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Cutting into the meat too early will cause a significant loss of juice. Do not skip the resting stage.
4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. A prime rib roast is too expensive to wing it. Error on the rare side, you can always put the roast back in the oven to cook it more if it is too rare for your taste. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium.
1 Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 2  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 3  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5
Fit a roasting pan with a roasting rack. Place roast on rack, fat side up, and cook in oven for 20 minutes. Without removing the roast, drop oven temperature to 325 degrees F and cook for an additional 60 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 125 degrees F for a medium-rare finished roast. Remove roast from pan to a cutting board. 1 If using a cooking bag to cook your prime rib, first sear all sides of the roast in a very hot pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil. 2  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, as you will not need the initial higher heat for browning.
