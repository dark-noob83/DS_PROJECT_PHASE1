retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the tissues of the retina the retina is the nerve tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye the retina senses light and sends images to the brain by way of the optic nerven intraocular retinoblastoma cancer is found in one or both eyes and may be in the retina only or may also be in other parts of the eye such as the choroid ciliary body or part of the optic nerve cancer has not spread to tissues around the outside of the eye or to other parts of the body
children with hereditary retinoblastoma are at an increased risk to develop other tumors such as more retinoblastoma tumors pineal gland tumors skin bone and muscle tumors develop second cancers after exposure to radiationhe risk to develop retinoblastoma tumors is greatest during the first five years of life a small number of children with hereditary retinoblastoma develop cancers outside the eyes such as in the pineal gland of the brain later in life tumors might form in other parts of the body bones muscle and skin
retinoblastoma is a cancer of the eye that occurs only in children it is a cancer of the very young child two thirds of retinoblastoma patients are diagnosed before they are 2 years old and more than 90 percent are diagnosed before the age of 5retinoblastoma can take two formsapproximately 75 percent of children with retinoblastoma have one tumor in one eyet is a cancer of the very young child two thirds of retinoblastoma patients are diagnosed before they are 2 years old and more than 90 percent are diagnosed before the age of 5 
retinoblastoma retinoblastoma is a rare cancer originating in the part of the eye called the retina the retina is a thin layer of nerve tissue that coats the back of the eye and enables the eye to see most cases about 60 percent involve only one eye unilateral but in some children both eyes may be involved bilateral 
retinoblastoma a neuroblastic tumor is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood patients usually present with leukokoria white reflex or white pupil detected in primary care the mean age at diagnosis is 12 months for bilateral tumors and 24 months for un
retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that usually develops in early childhood typically before the age of 5 this form of cancer develops in the retina which is the specialized light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and colorutations in the rb1 gene are responsible for most cases of retinoblastoma rb1 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it normally regulates cell growth and keeps cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way
in most children with retinoblastoma the disease affects only one eye however one out of three children with retinoblastoma develops cancer in both eyes the most common first sign of retinoblastoma is a visible whiteness in the pupil called cat s eye reflex or leukocoriautations in the rb1 gene are responsible for most cases of retinoblastoma rb1 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it normally regulates cell growth and keeps cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way
when retinoblastoma is associated with a gene mutation that occurs in all of the body s cells it is known as germinal retinoblastoma people with this form of retinoblastoma also have an increased risk of developing several other cancers outside the eyeutations in the rb1 gene are responsible for most cases of retinoblastoma rb1 is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it normally regulates cell growth and keeps cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way
retinoblastoma is an eye cancer that typically develops in children before 5 years of agethis cancer develops in the retina the part of the eye that helps a person see color and light retinoblastoma may affect one or both eyes in about two thirds of all cases only one eye is affectedhe risk to develop retinoblastoma tumors is greatest during the first five years of life a small number of children with hereditary retinoblastoma develop cancers outside the eyes such as in the pineal gland of the brain later in life tumors might form in other parts of the body bones muscle and skin
about eye cancer retinoblastoma retinoblastoma is a rare eye cancer affecting children affecting about 300 children each year the disease occurs most often in children under the age of 4 years with 80 % of cases occurring under age 3 years and virtually none above age 6 years
