Notice: This review covers both seasons of this anime. Tokyo Ghoul was one of the most hyped titles of summer 2014 but it quickly proved to be far weaker than what its first episode promises. It starts off as a psychological thriller about the main character suddenly turning to a man eating monster. There was a good amount of hype for Tokyo Ghoul just prior to the premier episode. The manga seemed to have a faithful fan-base, the animation and characters all looked very slick. The question was, whether or not there was any substance under Ghoul’ s slick exterior.
As the MC of Tokyo Ghoul, Kaneki's main role is to disappoint us to death, cry a lot, and bitch a lot about how much he sucks. With the characters being so dreadful, the anime relied heavily on the plot and the violence. The plot is very broad in the anime: Humans vs Ghouls and Ghouls vs Ghouls. And yes, the opening song of Tokyo Ghoul, Unravel is so addictive and it fitted perfectly on every aspect with the anime... just like the ending, Seijatachi. Anyway, the music was a good thing on the anime, it did fit pretty well, and OP and ED are pretty catchy.
A 12-episode anime television series adaptation by studio Pierrot aired on Tokyo MX between July and September 2014.

The other protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul: JACK, Taishi is a First Class Ghoul Investigator. Fura, as a teenager, attended Seishin Senior Highschool along with Arima. Though he never liked school, he usually went shopping and did all the housework, since his mother never did.

What Tokyo Ghoul lacks in deep character development or story, it makes up for with production values. As a series that ran through the summer of 2014, Tokyo Ghoul is a gorgeous series to look at. There was a good amount of hype for Tokyo Ghoul just prior to the premier episode. The manga seemed to have a faithful fan-base, the animation and characters all looked very slick. The question was, whether or not there was any substance under Ghoul’ s slick exterior.
Tokyo Ghoul is pretty much the same thing as Deadman Wonderland. Promises excitement, mystery, and internal conflicts but all it delivers after a few episodes is a gorefest regarding poorly conceived superpower battles, shallow world building, and characters that come and go as the plot demands for it.

Rating: 4. Review: Tokyo Ghoul is really gross. It's full of blood and spit and vomit and tears and intestines. There are lots of intestines in fact. I kept gasping and laughing with discomfort throughout the first episode, and if Tokyo Ghoul keeps up that fervor, it could be one of the most fun anime this summer. Well, if you like your fun coated in warm, gooey, fleshy bits.
both of these manga are about Demi-human, While tokyo Ghoul is about a half human and half ghoul, Ajin is about a boy who find out he a immortal Ajin. While the art in Ajin is better, the story and atmosphere in Tokyo ghoul is darker and better. But if I were to try to sum up Tokyo Ghoul's plot in one sentence, it would be about the main character coming to terms with his new persona. The Kaneki we see post chapter 60s is not the same Kaneki we see at the beginning, both personality and appearance wise.
A sequel titled Tokyo Ghoul:re began serialization in the same magazine in October 2014 and a prequel titled Tokyo Ghoul: JACK ran online on Jump Live. The other protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul: JACK, Taishi is a First Class Ghoul Investigator. Fura, as a teenager, attended Seishin Senior Highschool along with Arima.

Tokyo Ghoul is a dark fantasy and seinen anime adaptation of the manga made by Ishida Sui, and the TV anime was produced by Studio Pierrot containing 12 episodes.
