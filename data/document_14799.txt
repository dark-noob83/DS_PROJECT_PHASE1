If an airplane reaches the speed of sound, its speed is Mach 1. If the airplane reaches double the speed of sound, its speed is Mach 2. Airplanes speeds that are less than Mach 1 are considered subsonic speeds, while those very close to Mach 1 are said to be transonic. 
I’ve always wondered what’s the ideal speed for a plane like a 737 to takeoff. The takeoff speed is based on the weight of the airplane which varies. But you can think of it as a speed between 135 and 155 knots or so. Add 15% to convert knots to m.p.h. and you’ll have a liftoff speed of around 155 to 178 m.p.h. 
Usually a commercial aircraft flies between 0.7 up to 0.82 mach number. Mach is speed of sound which is 1224 Km/H or 760 Mph. Each aircraft base on length of its wings and other factors will fly between this range. I should add that normal cruise fly is about 0.75 Mach. This Site Might Help You. RE: What is the average speed of a commercial airplane? For the purposes of this question, what is the normal average speed of a 747 or a 767 aircraft on a commercial flight at cruising altitued?
At altitude, an aircraft could be flying 300 knots indicated air speed, but have a ground speed of 500 knots. To covert knots to km/h, multiply the speed in knots by 1.85. I fly all the time with an 500 knot ground speed, which translates to 925 km/h. 
The 747-400 passenger version can accommodate 416 passengers in a typical three-class layout, 524 passengers in a typical two-class layout, or 660 passengers in a high density one-class configuration. The newest version of the aircraft, the 747-8, is in production and received certification in 2011. Manufactured by Boeing 's Commercial Airplane unit in the United States, the original version of the 747 had two and a half times greater capacity than the Boeing 707, one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s. First flown commercially in 1970, the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years.
The maximum speed of a plane is completely dependent on the aircraft type. Captain Al Bridger confirmed that a Boeing 747 (Jumbo Jet) has a cruising speed of 575 mph (Mach 0.85) at 35,000ft. 'All of our pilots receive extensive training to ensure they fly at a safe speed, based on a range of factors including customer comfort, weather conditions, aircraft weight and fuel efficiency,' he said.
Cruise is at 0.78 to 0.79 mach depending on the fuel consumption rate. Mach is the speed of sound and varies by altitude, temperature and air density. At 35,000 feet altitude, mach 1 is 663.5 mph for standard conditions. It is a few mph faster for lower altitudes and a few mph slower for higher altitudes. They are then converted to miles per hour -- mph. Speed calculations are based on the Boeing 757-200 aircraft with a takeoff weight of 220,100 pounds. Knots used here means knots indicated airspeed -- KIAS. Takeoff is at 152 knots -- 175 mph. Climb out is at 167 knots -- 192 mph -- until 1,000.
Confidence votes 39.3K. The way this is worded is tricky so I'm going to give you the answer to the question I think you meant to ask. The average speed of a large commercial jet airliner is about 500 mph. A passenger plane can be anything from an ultralight on up
