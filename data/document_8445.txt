The medical, surgical and catheter-based treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a combined effort of the Emory Heart & Vascular Center, the Division of Vascular Surgery & Endovascular Therapy as well as the section of Interventional Radiology.
Peripheral Vascular Disease Overview. Peripheral vascular disease, also called PVD, refers to any disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. The term can include any disorder that affects any blood vessels. It is, though, often used as a synonym for peripheral artery disease. PVD is the most common disease of the arteries. The build-up of fatty material inside the vessels, a condition called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, is what causes it.
For patients admitted to hospital for PAD between 1996 and 2005, the likelihood of undergoing surgery decreased from 34.5% to 26.3%. Although the rate of bypass is decreasing, surgery remains an important component in the armamentarium for treating patients with advanced vascular disease.
Also in rare cases, a blood clot in an artery can suddenly and completely block blood flow to a leg or foot. Often, severe pain, numbness, and coldness develop within 1 hour. This blockage is an emergency. Clot-dissolving medicines, surgical removal of the clot, or bypass surgery is needed to restore blood flow.
Most of the time, surgery is only done in cases of severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD), such as disabling intermittent claudication; open sores (ulcers that won't heal); or serious skin, bone, and tissue problems (gangrene).
Surgery choices. The type of surgery used to treat PAD will depend on the location of the affected leg artery or arteries. 1  Aortobifemoral bypass is done for PAD that affects the major abdominal artery (aorta) and the large arteries that branch off of it.
