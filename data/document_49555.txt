A lysosome is a type of membrane-bound organelle that is present in animal cells. Ranging in diameter from approx. 50nm to 1 μm § , lysosomes have a single outer membrane consisting of a phospholipid bilayer and contain acid hydrolases which are enzymes capable of breaking-down macromolecules. § i.e. 50x10-9m to 1x10-6m, which is the same as 0.00005 to 0.001 mm (millimetres).
Often lysosomes fuse with phagosomes(contain substances from outside of the cell) in order to digest material. Lysosomes contain enzymes like proteases, phospholipases, etc... Lysosomes also have H+ ion pumps in the membrane in order to decreases the pH which denatures molecules and activates the enzymes. Lysosomes are also important in cell activated suicide. When the cell receives a signal for autolysis a signal is sent to the lysosomes which release its contents into the cytoplas, and result in cell death. Hope that helps. -Yes, it did.
Lysosomes are membrane bounded organelles found in animal and plant cells. They vary in shape, size and number per cell and appear to operate with slight differences in cells of yeast, higher plants and mammals. Lysosomes (lysosome: from the Greek: lysis; loosen and soma; body) are found in nearly all animal and plant cells. In plant cells vacuoles can carry out lysosomal functions. Lysosomes appear initially as spherical bodies about 50-70nm in diameter and are bounded by a single membrane.
lysosomes are organelles about the size of small vacoules. they are also called suicide bags. lysosomes burst releasing harmful emzymes when the cell is subjected to any harmf … ul substance. these enzymes digest the substance that the cell identifies as alien thus protecting the cell. Lysosomes are also important in cell activated suicide. When the cell receives a signal for autolysis a signal is sent to the lysosomes which release its contents into the cytoplas, and result in cell death. Hope that helps. -Yes, it did.
Lysosomes are single-membrane organelles. Since lysosomes are little digestion machines, they go to work when the cell absorbs or eats some food. Once the material is inside the cell, the lysosomes attach and release their enzymes. The enzymes break down complex molecules that can include complex sugars and proteins. Lysosomes hold enzymes that were created by the cell. The purpose of the lysosome is to digest things. They might be used to digest food or break down the cell when it dies.
A lysosome (derived from the Greek words lysis, meaning to loosen, and soma, body) is a membrane-bound cell organelle found in most animal cells (they are absent in red blood cells). Lysosomes fuse with autophagic vacuoles (phagosomes) and dispense their enzymes into the autophagic vacuoles, digesting their contents. They are frequently nicknamed suicide bags or suicide sacs by cell biologists due to their autolysis.
You will find organelles called lysosomes in nearly every animal-like eukaryotic cell. Lysosomes hold enzymes that were created by the cell. The purpose of the lysosome is to digest things. They might be used to digest food or break down the cell when it dies.
1 Lysosomes are the main sites of digestion, that is the break-down of structures, within cells. 2  There are, however, some circumstances (diseases/conditions) in which lysosomes begin to 'break-down' living cells-not just useless parts of cells or potentially harmful structures. Ranging in diameter from approx. 50nm to 1 μm § , lysosomes have a single outer membrane consisting of a phospholipid bilayer and contain acid hydrolases which are enzymes capable of breaking-down macromolecules. § i.e. 50x10-9m to 1x10-6m, which is the same as 0.00005 to 0.001 mm (millimetres).

MUHAMMAD AFZAL. Lysosomes contain enzymes for compound breakdown. Often lysosomes fuse with phagosomes(contain substances from outside of the cell) in order to digest material.
Lysosomes The main function of these microscopic organelles is to serve as digestion compartments for cellular materials that have exceeded their lifetime or are otherwise no longer useful. In this regard, the lysosomes recycle the cell's organic material in a process known as autophagy. Lysosomes break down cellular waste products, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and other macromolecules into simple compounds, which are then transferred back into the cytoplasm as new cell-building materials. Lysosomes are found in all animal cells, but are most numerous in disease-fighting cells, such as white blood cells. This is because white blood cells must digest more material than most other types of cells in their quest to battle bacteria, viruses, and other foreign intruders.
