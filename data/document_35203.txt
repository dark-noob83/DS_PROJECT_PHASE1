Peter Thomas Roth Uber-Dry Sunscreen SPF 30. Many consumers agree that Peter Thomas Roth Uber Dry Sunscreen SPF 30 is the best sunscreen for oily and acne prone skin. It has a super lightweight, water resistant formula that goes on light, dries matte, and make you feel like your not wearing anything at all.
What to look for: A broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against both UVA and UVB light. A water-based or light liquid-based gel or spray-on sunscreen is best for people who tend to get breakouts. You can also look for light lotions and powder sunscreens.
