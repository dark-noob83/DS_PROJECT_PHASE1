Red meat and pork can remain in the refrigerator up to 5 days and can be frozen for 4-12 months. Leftover cooked meat will last 3-4 days in the refrigerator and 2-6 months in the freezer. Ground meats (beef, veal, pork, or poultry) can be refrigerated for 1-2 days and frozen for 3-4 months. Lunchmeats and hot dogs will last two weeks in the refrigerator unopened and should be eaten within 3-5 days of opening (hot dogs can go a couple of days longer). In the freezer they’ll last 1-2 months. Bacon is safe to eat for up to a week in the fridge—but raw sausage should be eaten within two days. Both can be frozen for a month, and some sausage will freeze for twice as long. Eggs can be refrigerated for up to a month raw but no more than a week hard-boiled
Answer: If you thawed the steaks in the refrigerator, you’ve got some time. Steak that’s been defrosted in the fridge can be safely kept for an additional 3 to 5 days in the refrigerator before cooking, says the U.S. Department of Agriculture. You also can safely refreeze the steak within that same timeframe. On the other hand, if you thawed the steak in the microwave or in cold water, the USDA advises that you cook it immediately. That’s because with either method, the steak could have at least temporarily warmed up to a temperature higher than 40°F.
Here's a guide to help you know how long you can keep cuts of meat around! Kitchen Fact: Raw ground meats and poultry should be cooked in 2 days, and roasts, steaks, and chops should be cooked in five days. For raw poultry, ground meats, and other chopped-up cuts of meat, cook them within two days. Larger cuts — like roasts, steaks, and chops — can be stored a bit longer, but should be used within five days. If you don't have time to cook the meat at the end of these time periods, just freeze it, as freezing will halt any bacteria growth.
No use letting it sit in the fridge. But if it was a steaka dn you were going to consume it within the next couple of days, freezing the steak will completely ruin it.

Your steaks will still be safe resting after an hour and a half outside the fridge. Personally I leave my thick steaks out for two hours to come to room temperature. It is however preferable to salt your meat as far ahead of time if you can manage it. If the steaks are already at least thawed to fridge temperature, leave them out for a shorter time on the counter, or even put them in the oven at 150 before broiling/grilling.
