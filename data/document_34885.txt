Typically, installing a geothermal heating and cooling system costs $2,000-$4,000 more than installing a new HVAC system with ductwork, or around $7,000-$10,000 total. With 30-60 percent energy savings, all costs associated with building a geothermal heating and cooling system are recovered in 5-10 years.
The installation of a geothermal heating and air conditioning system will pay for itself after two to 10 years. The exact payback time depends on several factors including current utility rates, how energy efficient the rest of the home is and how much energy the home typically uses for heating and cooling purposes.
Geothermal heating systems offer a whopping 300 to 600 percent efficiency rating, which can save you money on energy bills while helping to ease your impact on the environment. Despite the efficiency and potential savings associated with these systems, many buyers may be deterred by the high up-front cost of geothermal.
Geothermal heating system price varies depending on the type of loop system, usually either vertical or horizontal. On average, a typical home of 2500 square feet, with a heating load of 60,000 BTU and a cooling load of 60,000 BTU will cost between $20,000 to $25,000 to install.
Much lower operating costs than other systems. A geothermal heat pump will immediately save you 30 to 60 percent on your heating and 20 to 50 percent on your cooling costs over conventional heating and cooling systems. Uses clean, renewable energy (the sun).
The GSHP is one of the most efficient residential heating and cooling systems available today, with heating efficiencies 50 to 70% higher than other heating systems and cooling efficiencies 20 to 40% higher than available air conditioners. That directly translates into savings for you on your utility bills.
The average national cost to install a geothermal heating or cooling system is $5,745, with most homeowners spending between $3,534 and $11,089.
An average home needs 3 tons of heating capacity, and the average cost of a geothermal system is at least $2,500 per ton of capacity. Generally, for each ton of capacity, air source heat pumps are about $3,000 less to install than geothermal heat pumps.
Before installing any new heating or cooling system in a home, it is necessary to re evaluate and reduce the energy load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not only reduce the cost of a new system and utility bills, but it will greatly improve the comfort of your home.
While geothermal heating and cooling costs several times more than other technologies, these systems pay for themselves in energy savings in 5 to 10 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
