Place in the oven and reduce the temperature to 170 degrees. Cook for 2 1/2 hours per pound (for medium-rare). Transfer the roast to a platter or cutting board, tent loosely with aluminum foil and allow to rest for at least 15 to 20 minutes before carving. However, when you are roasting shoulder, round or rump roasts, the doneness temperatures should be adjusted 5 degrees higher; for best results, cooking beyond 145 degrees is not recommended. For narrower-shaped cuts of beef, such as eye of round, roast at 170 degrees for 2 hours per pound.
1 Use cooked beef within 2 hours—1 hour if the air temperature is above 90 °F (32.2 °C) or refrigerate it at 40 °F (4.4 °C) in shallow, covered containers. 2  Eat within 3 to 4 days, either cold or reheated to 165 °F (73.9 °C)--hot and steaming. 3  It is safe to freeze ready-prepared beef dishes. 1 To defrost beef in cold water, do not remove packaging. 2  Be sure the package is airtight or put it into a leakproof bag. 3  Submerge the beef in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes so that it continues to thaw. 4  Small packages of beef may defrost in an hour or less; a 3- to 4-pound roast may take 2 to 3 hours.
Cook all raw beef steaks and roasts to a minimum internal temperature of 145 °F (62.8 °C) as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. 1 To defrost beef in cold water, do not remove packaging. 2  Be sure the package is airtight or put it into a leakproof bag. 3  Submerge the beef in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes so that it continues to thaw. 4  Small packages of beef may defrost in an hour or less; a 3- to 4-pound roast may take 2 to 3 hours.
Also, grinding allows any bacteria present on the surface to be mixed throughout the meat. Bacteria multiply rapidly in the Danger Zone — temperatures between 40 and 140 °F (4.4 and 60 °C). To keep bacterial levels low, store ground beef at 40 °F (4.4 °C) or below and use within 2 days, or freeze. Never leave ground beef or any perishable food out at room temperature for more than 2 hours — 1 hour at 90 °F (32.2 °C) and above.
Cooking to higher temperatures is not recommended. ---. Pork Roasts. For Pork loin and fresh ham roasts (a leg of pork that is not cured and smoked), remove from refrigerator and rest roast at cool room temperature; 30-60 minutes for small roasts and 60-90 minutes for larger roasts. Test in several spots and average temperatures to make the best assessment. Roasts will continue to cook when removed from the oven, large roasts rising 5 -10 and smaller roasts rising from 15 -20 after coming out of the oven. Below, find a guideline of estimated internal temperature to remove and rest your roast.
Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper; for a slightly richer flavor, cook over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes to reduce the liquid. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. Serve the sauce on the side with the warmed slices of roast beef. However, when you are roasting shoulder, round or rump roasts, the doneness temperatures should be adjusted 5 degrees higher; for best results, cooking beyond 145 degrees is not recommended. For narrower-shaped cuts of beef, such as eye of round, roast at 170 degrees for 2 hours per pound.
Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat, and sear the beef on all sides until browned, but not burned, about 3-4 minutes per side. Put the vegetables and bay leaves in the bottom of a roasting dish. Drizzle with olive oil and place the roast on top. Place the roast in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 F (190 C). Roast for about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare, 17-19 minutes for medium, and 22-25 for cooked through. Check the meat with a thermometer to make sure it is the temperature you want it--145°F for medium rare, 160°F for medium. (Baste the roast a couple times while cooking, and keep an eye on the vegetables. 
How long and at what temperature should I cook a beef roast in the oven? Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast. Sirloin-tip, rump, rolled-rump, eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice. Cooking at a constant oven temperature of 300°F (160°C), a 5- to 8-lb standing rib roast will take 17-19 minutes per pound for rare, 20-22 for medium rare, 23-25 minutes for medium, and 27-30 minutes for well done.
