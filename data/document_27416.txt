My problem is that on page load firebug tells me kendoConsole is not defined kendoConsole.log(Navigate); On clicking a date I get the following: kendoConsole is not defined kendoConsole.log(...+ kendo.toString(this.value(), 'd')); All required js and css files are loaded properly(according to the demo). ------------------------------------------ Edit I found the kendo.console.js  file. kendoConsole is not defined. kendoConsole.log(Navigate); kendoConsole is not defined.
Else if console.log is defined (IE8) AND console.debug (any other) is not defined: redirect all logging functions to console.log, this allows to keep those logs ! window.console = { debug: window.console.log, ...}; Not sure about the assert support in various IE versions, but any suggestions are welcome. I'm using Firebug and have some statements like: in my page. In IE8 (probably earlier versions too) I get script errors saying 'console' is undefined. I tried putting this at the top of my page: still I get the errors.

If you have recently changed your Firefox configurations (and upgraded to Firebug 1.2) then you may have experienced some difficulties with console.log throwing the following error: ReferenceError: console is not defined. If you have recently changed your Firefox configurations (and upgraded to Firebug 1.2) then you may have experienced some difficulties with console.log throwing the following error: ReferenceError: console is not defined. It turns out that this is by design. If you want to make use of the console object that Firebug offers, you need to do so with a call to window.loadFirebugConsole() first. Whilst you are at it, why not check out some of the other nifty commands available on the Firebug console object at the Get Firebug website. Tags: JavaScript.

Understanding JavaScript’s ‘undefined’. Compared to other languages, JavaScript’s concept of undefined is a little confusing. In particular, trying to understand ReferenceErrors (“x is not defined”) and how best to code against them can be frustrating. This is my attempt to straighten things out a little. In JavaScript there is Undefined (type), undefined (value) and undefined (variable). Undefined (type) is a built-in JavaScript type. undefined (value) is a primitive and is the sole value of the Undefined type. Any property that has not been assigned a value, assumes the undefined value. (ECMA 4.3.9 and 4.3.10).
Javascript error: console is not defined. I'm getting a console is not defined Javascript error in Firefox, Safari, and IE. It doesn't stop the map from rendering, but it does interfere with some other functionality I'm trying to implement. The offending code is in openlayers/js/openlayers.js, line 118
into the same problem: console is not defined. At first I thought that. it could be some strange problem with Bon Echo, close it and started. FF 2.0.0.11 but the situation was the same.

Paste the following at the top of your JavaScript (before using the console): The function closure wrapper is to scope the variables as to not define any variables. This guards against both undefined console and undefined console.debug (and other missing methods). I'm using Firebug and have some statements like: in my page. In IE8 (probably earlier versions too) I get script errors saying 'console' is undefined. I tried putting this at the top of my page: still I get the errors.
