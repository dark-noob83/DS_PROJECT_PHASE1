Then in 1938, nylon bristles replaced animal hair. A company called DuPont de Nemours introduced the first toothbrushes with nylon bristles. The first such toothbrush was called Dr. West’s Miracle – Tuft Toothbrush. American Dental Association has described an ideal toothbrush to be having – a brushing surface 1 to 1.25 inches long and 7.9 to 9.5 mm wide, 2 to 4 rows of bristles and 5 to 12 tufts per row.
Dr. West’s Miracle Tuft Toothbrush appeared in 1938, with bristles made of nylon, the new invention from DuPont. Timely that, as China’s civil war and the Japanese invasion had made East Asian boar bristles hard to get. 
Boar bristles were used until 1938, when nylon bristles were introduced by Dupont de Nemours. The first nylon toothbrush was called Doctor West's Miracle Toothbrush. Later, Americans were influenced by the disciplined hygiene habits of soldiers from World War II. Some other interesting toothbrush facts: 1  The first mass-produced toothbrush was made by William Addis of Clerkenwald, England, around 1780. 2  The first American to patent a toothbrush was H. N. Wadsworth, (patent number 18,653,) on Nov. 7, 1857. 3  Mass production of toothbrushes began in America around 1885

The first bristle toothbrush, resembling the modern toothbrush, was found in China during the Tang Dynasty (619–907) and used hog bristle. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. The first patent for a toothbrush was granted to H. N. Wadsworth in 1857 (US Patent No. 18,653) in the United States, but mass production in the United States only started in 1885. The rather advanced design had a bone handle with holes bored into it for the Siberian boar hai
Boar bristles were used until 1938, when nylon bristles were introduced by Dupont de Nemours. The first nylon toothbrush was called Doctor West's Miracle Toothbrush. Later, Americans were influenced by the disciplined hygiene habits of soldiers from World War II. These 'chew sticks' were rubbed against the teeth. The bristle toothbrush, similar to the type used today, was not invented until 1498 in China. The bristles were actually the stiff, coarse hairs taken from the back of a hog's neck and attached to handles made of bone or bamboo.
The toothbrush first appeared around 3500 BC and was used by Egyptians and Babylonians. These were in the form of chewing sticks and were made from the branches of the Salvadora persica tree. Another very effective oral hygiene aid was boar bristles mounted on a bamboo stick. The first such toothbrush was called Dr. West’s Miracle – Tuft Toothbrush. American Dental Association has described an ideal toothbrush to be having – a brushing surface 1 to 1.25 inches long and 7.9 to 9.5 mm wide, 2 to 4 rows of bristles and 5 to 12 tufts per row.
During the 1900s, celluloid handles gradually replaced bone handles in toothbrushes. Natural animal bristles were also replaced by synthetic fibers, usually nylon, by DuPont in 1938. The first nylon bristle toothbrush, made with nylon yarn, went on sale on February 24, 1938. The first electric toothbrush, the Broxodent, was invented in Switzerland in 1954. As of the turn of the 21st century, nylon had come to be widely used for the bristles, and the handles were usually molded from thermoplastic materials. The first patent for a toothbrush was granted to H. N. Wadsworth in 1857 (US Patent No. 18,653) in the United States, but mass production in the United States only started in 1885. The rather advanced design had a bone handle with holes bored into it for the Siberian boar hair bristles.
Early forms of the toothbrush are mentioned as early as 3000 BC, when Egyptians and Babylonians used “˜chew sticks’ which were thin twigs with frayed edges used to rub against the teeth. The first bristle toothbrush was invented in China in 1498, where coarse boar hairs were attached to handles made of bamboo or bone. Boar bristles were used until 1938, when nylon bristles were introduced by the company Dupont de Nemours. The first nylon toothbrush was called Doctor West’s Miracle Toothbrush.
