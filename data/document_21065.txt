one light year 1 ly is the distance that light travels in one year in one second light travels 186282 miles or 299793 km since there are in a tropical year about 31569260 seconds we can find the length of a light year by multiplying velocity by time to give 5 88 trillion miles 9 46 trillion km
so to measure really long distances people use a unit called a light year light travels at 186000 miles per second 300000 kilometers per second therefore a light second is 186000 miles
in any case it s clear a light year is a vast expanse over a year light travels 5 87849981 x 10 12 miles roughly 9 4605284 x 10 12 kilometers written out that s 5878499810000 miles or 9460528400000
a light year is the distance light will travel in a year which is a long long way light travels 186000 miles a second 300000 kilometers per second so a light second is 186000 miles 300000 kilometers so some quick multiplication gives us one light year as 5878500000000 miles
it really is an incredibly long distance a lightyear is roughly 6 trillion miles or nearly 10 trillion kilometers here s how you calculate it you start with the speed of light which is about 186000 miles per second then you multiply that by 3600 seconds in an hour then you multiply that by 24 hours in a day
a light year is a unit of distance it is the distance that light can travel in one year light moves at a velocity of about 300000 kilometers km each second so in one year it can travel about 10 trillion km more p recisely one light year is equal to 95000000
1 light year is the distance light can travel in vacuum in one year s time this distance is equivalent to roughly 9461000000000 km or 5878000000000 miles this is such a large distance for comparison consider the circumference of the earth when measured at the equator 40075 km
