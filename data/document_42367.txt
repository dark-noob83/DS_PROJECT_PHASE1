These admission statistics provide an indication as to the selectivity of the school and how difficult it is to get in. 4,667 out of 4,872 applicants or 96% percent were admitted making Keiser University Ft Lauderdale an easy school to get into with a very good chance of acceptance assuming you meet the requirements.
I just checked out the requirements for the Keiser ASN Nursing program and you need a 3.0 gpa in the pre reqs to get into the nursing program. I called Broward College and said that the lowest GPA that they accepted last semester was a 3.1 in the pre reqs.
Note also that some students were accepted with test scores and grades a bit below the norm. This is because Alabama is looking at more than your grades and test scores. The admissions folks are also assessing the rigor of your high school courses, and they want to see that you have taken important core courses.
1 Required minimum cumulative undergraduate GPA of 2.75, minimum cumulative “natural” science GPA of 3.0 and minimum cumulative prerequisite (i.e. general education) GPA of 3.0.
Instead let us take a look of the gpa of the students entering Keiser versus the gpa of the students entering the cc schools, there you will find your difference. Most students attend Keiser plan and simple because it is a easy way to get into nursing schools and make money.
Report Abuse. Most schools, the minimum is 2.5. Also because of your GPA you should apply to the university or college of your choice in October, or whenever they are starting to accept applications. The earlier you apply, the higher chance you can get in. For colleges, they don't really have super high standards when it's early in the year.
Also do not get discouraged just because of your GPA or whatever. Your GPA is fine, again 2.5 is good and above, but so much stress is put on to be good in high school and there's always this mentality only people with straight A's get into college lol, that's not true as you can see.
