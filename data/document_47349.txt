It is not a typical shield volcano because, in addition to erupting basaltic lavas, it also has erupted andesitic and even rhyolitic lava. The volcano is 25 miles (40 km) in diameter and has a total volume of 120 cubic miles (500 km 3). It possesses a large oval-shaped caldera 4 × 5 miles (6.4 × 8.0 km) in diameter, called the Newberry Caldera.
(Sno-Park Permit from November-April). Newberry Volcano is the largest volcano in Oregon, a broad shield volcano with a huge area of 600 square miles (1500 square km) and massive volume of 110 cubic miles (450 cubic km) which are second only to Medicine Lake Volcano in the entire Cascade Range. 
A great deal of volcanic activity has occurred at Newberry Volcano, which itself has one of the largest collections of cinder cones, volcanic domes, lava flows, and fissures in the world. Most of the cinder cones are 200 to 400 feet (60 to 120 m) high and have shallow saucer-shaped summit craters. The volcano is 25 miles (40 km) in diameter and has a total volume of 120 cubic miles (500 km 3). It possesses a large oval-shaped caldera 4 × 5 miles (6.4 × 8.0 km) in diameter, called the Newberry Caldera.
Newberry Volcano (with Newberry Caldera) is a large potentially active shield volcano located 40 miles (64 km) east of the Cascade Range and about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Bend, Oregon, within the Newberry National Volcanic Monument. The volcano is 25 miles (40 km) in diameter and has a total volume of 120 cubic miles (500 km 3). It possesses a large oval-shaped caldera 4 × 5 miles (6.4 × 8.0 km) in diameter, called the Newberry Caldera.
Newberry Volcano is located near Bend, Oregon (Figure 2). With an estimated volume of 450 cu. km, Newberry is one of the largest Quaternary volcanoes in the contiguous United States. It has as an elongated shield-form that extends 60 km north-south and 30 km east-west. 
Newberry Volcano was named for John Strong Newberry, who explored central Oregon for the Pacific Railroad Surveys in 1855. During the Apollo program, parts of the volcano that resemble the Moon 's surface were used to train the astronauts. The volcano is 25 miles (40 km) in diameter and has a total volume of 120 cubic miles (500 km 3). It possesses a large oval-shaped caldera 4 × 5 miles (6.4 × 8.0 km) in diameter, called the Newberry Caldera.
Paulina Lake is located within the collapsed crater, or caldera of Newberry Volcano. Nearly five miles in diameter, this caldera encircles the basins of Paulina Lake, and its twin, East Lake. Covering an area of 1,531 acres, Paulina Lake, the larger and deeper of the two, plunges to depths of 250 feet. 
Newberry National Volcanic Monument was designated on November 5, 1990, to protect the area around the Newberry Volcano in the United States. It was created within the boundaries of the Deschutes National Forest and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. 
To reduce load times, the list is not rendered for large queries. Description (Newberry). Newberry is one of the largest Quaternary volcanoes in the United States, with a caldera that spans 6 to 8 km across. The center of the volcano is located about 35 km SE of Bend, OR. 
Quick Facts. Newberry Volcano is the largest volcano in the Cascades volcanic arc and covers an area the size of Rhode Island (about 3100 km 2 or 1200 mi 2). Unlike familiar cone-shaped Cascades volcanoes, Newberry was built into the shape of a broad shield by repeated eruptions over the past 400,000 years.
