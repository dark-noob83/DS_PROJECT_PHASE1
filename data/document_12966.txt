Connective tissue: A material made up of fibers forming a framework and support structure for body tissues and organs. Connective tissue surrounds many organs. Cartilage and bone are specialized forms of connective tissue. All connective tissue is derived from mesoderm, the middle germ cell layer in the embryo.
connective tissue. a fibrous type of body tissue with varied functions; it supports and connects internal organs, forms bones and the walls of blood vessels, attaches muscles to bones, and replaces tissues of other types following injury.
connective tissue-tissue of mesodermal origin consisting of e.g. collagen fibroblasts and fatty cells; supports organs and fills spaces between them and forms tendons and ligaments. cutis, skin, tegument-a natural protective body covering and site of the sense of touch; your skin is the largest organ of your body.
Type, abundance, and orientation of protein fibers determine the kind of connective tissue proper. The forming and mature cells of connective tissue proper are called fibroblasts or fibrocytes respectively. A clear distinction between these two types is difficult. Try to remember the fibroblast as the more active cell that forms fibers and ground substance. Therefore, in a young forming tissue these cells prevail.
Connective tissue (CT) is one of the four types of biological tissue that support, connect, or separate different types of tissues and organs in the body. The other three types are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue.
