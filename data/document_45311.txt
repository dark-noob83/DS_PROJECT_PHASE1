So tasty. If you’ve been making your own nut and seed butters in the Blendtec Twister Jar this will come super easy to you, all you have to add is sesame seeds and away you go. Prior to making this sesame seed butter, I ordered a bulk shipment (2 bottles) through Amazon that has taken me 2 years to go through. Place half the sesame seeds into your Blendtec Twister Jar, fitted with twister lid. 2  Blend on high (or use the whole juice setting) while turning the lid counter-clockwise. 3  Repeat this 3-4 times until sesame seed butter is smooth and creamy. 4  Scrape into a wide-mouth mason jar and repeat for 2nd half of sesame seeds.
