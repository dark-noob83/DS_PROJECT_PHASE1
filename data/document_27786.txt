spec·tro·scope. Any of various instruments used to measure the wavelengths and intensity of radiation by splitting the radiation up into a spectrum. In a light spectroscope, light enters a narrow slit, is focused into a thin beam of parallel rays by a lens, and passes through a prism that separates it into a spectrum. Other types of spectroscopes, such as the mass spectroscope, use magnetic fields to separate the incoming radiation. See also: Instruments.
What is Spectroscopy Spectroscopy is a very important tool in astronomy. It is detailed study of the light from an object. Light is energy that moves through space and can be thought of as either waves or particles. The distances between the peaks of the waves of light are called the light's wavelength.
An early example of a spectroscope. Prisms split light by refraction; the resulting spectrum is measured by the spectroscope. In astronomy, a spectroscope may be used in conjunction with a telescope. A spectrophotometer measures how much light is reflected off of -- or absorbed by -- an object.
A spectroscope is a scientific instrument that splits light into its different wavelengths, which humans see as different colors. Violet has the shortest wavelength that people can see and red the longest. This instrument can also identify wavelengths that humans cannot see, such as infrared and ultraviolet radiation.
The spectroscope is a tool for examining which parts of white light are absorbed by a gemstone (as well as by other materials). Materials can absorb parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and when the absorbed parts fall within the visible range, that absorbed part will influence the color of the material.
Spectroscopy is a scientific measurement technique. It measures light that is emitted, absorbed, or scattered by materials and can be used to study, identify and quantify those materials. One thing that you need to remember is that light is a lot more than just the colored visible light that we can see.
