Starting school. Most children begin primary school at the start of the school year in which they reach school age (5 years old). All schools must admit children from the September following their 4th birthday. A school year runs from September to the following August.
When to start school. Your child can start Kindergarten at the beginning of the school year if they turn five on or before 31 July in that year. By law, all children must be enrolled in school by their sixth birthday.
So my guess would be at about age 7. Not all children start school at age 5. If a child is 5 years old, but not socially ready for school, the school my recommend that the child wait another year. But, I have never heard of a child being taken away from a parent for not starting school by the time they turn 5.
Cutoff dates are deadlines schools use to determine who can enter the next kindergarten class. Your child must reach the age of 5 by the cutoff date, which is usually around September 1 in most school districts, though some states have later or earlier cutoffs or no deadline at all.
A child who was not age-eligible for kindergarten (that is, the child turned five after September 1 in the 2014-15 school year or thereafter) and who attended a California private school kindergarten for a year is viewed by the CDE as not legally enrolled in kindergarten, pursuant to EC Section 48000 requirements.
The intake for children into Reception is the September during the year they turn 5, so if a child turns 5 between 1st September,2009 and 31st August 2010 then he/she will start in September 2009. It is Nursery schools intakes that do things different, they start the children the term after they turn 3.
