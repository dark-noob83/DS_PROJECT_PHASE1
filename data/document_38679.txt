That includes the fuel adjustment charge, which varies monthly. The average CPS customer used roughly 1,100 kilowatt hours of electricity per month in 2010, she said, and paid an annual average of $1,262. USA Today found the average American household paid $1,419 for electricity in 2010. Photo: Mike Fisher. CPS Energy prices below average Electricity prices nationally have been rising faster than the rate of inflation, according to a recent story by USA Today, but CPS Energy customers pay less than both the state and national average for power.
At $1, this fee translates to $5 per month, or $60 per year for the average solar customer that produces five kW per month and saves $800 per year on their electricity bill. At $3.50, the average total yearly cost would be about $210 on average, about 26 percent of solar customer savings. That estimate assumes a continued price decrease of installed capacity of about 10 percent per year (a “middle of the road” market forecast, according to CPS Energy), totaling a $4,010 assumed cost decrease over three years.
When Arizona Public Service adopted a fee on solar installations of $.70 per kilowatt per month, solar applications declined by 40% in the next three months. CPS Energy is proposing a fee starting at $1.00 and rising to $3.50. The CPS Energy fee will be the highest in the nation. That estimate assumes a continued price decrease of installed capacity of about 10 percent per year (a “middle of the road” market forecast, according to CPS Energy), totaling a $4,010 assumed cost decrease over three years.
Given this price, it surprised Sarno that CPS Energy would lock in for 25 years. Perhaps a 20-year contract would have made more sense. Utility officials said it signed a 25-year contract because that's how long the solar panels are under warranty. In July 2012, CPS Energy inked a 25-year contract with OCI Solar Power for five plants that will produce a total of 400 megawatts of solar energy.
Currently, the rebate amount in the CPS Energy service area is $1.60 per watt up to $25,000 or 50% of the cost of the system, whichever is less. Once the rebate is credited, a 30 percent federal tax credit can be applied to the remaining balance. Your quote will vary. If a 5 kw system costs $20,000 before rebates, the CPS Energy residential rebate would bring this cost down to $13,200. After the 30 percent tax credit is applied to the remaining balance, the final cost would be $9,240.
The cost of solar depends on the size of your house. The average residential system is 5 kW and the current average price per watt is $4, so an average 5 kW system would cost $20,000. Your quote will vary. If a 5 kw system costs $20,000 before rebates, the CPS Energy residential rebate would bring this cost down to $13,200. After the 30 percent tax credit is applied to the remaining balance, the final cost would be $9,240.
And the award for being the energy distributor for the seventh-largest city in the US goes to City Public Service of San Antonio (also known as CPS Energy). Serving 717,000 electricity customers and 325,000 natural gas customers, the utility operates in a 1,514-sq.-mi. service territory. 
CPS Energy customers are paying roughly 20 percent less than the state average for electricity, according to data from the utility and USA Today, which found that household electricity bills have been rising faster than the rate of inflation over the past five years.

Keep in mind this is just an estimate based on the average of contracts signed. Your quote will vary. If a 5 kw system costs $20,000 before rebates, the CPS Energy residential rebate would bring this cost down to $13,200. After the 30 percent tax credit is applied to the remaining balance, the final cost would be $9,240.
