The duration and level of long-term care will vary from person to person and often change over time. Here are some statistics (all are “on average”) you should consider: 1  Someone turning age 65 today has almost a 70% chance of needing some type of long-term care services and supports in their remaining years. 1 Someone turning age 65 today has almost a 70% chance of needing some type of long-term care services and supports in their remaining years. 2  Women need care longer (3.7 years) than men (2.2 years).
Length of Stay Demographics. According to the National Nursing Home Survey, females spend slightly more time in nursing homes than do males, 2.51 years compared to 2.29 years. People over the age of 85 have a longer average length of stay at 2.62 years. Short-Term Care Nursing Home Patients. The average stay of patients in a nursing home for acute rehabilitation is 23 days; only 9 percent of nursing home patients fall into this category.
When hospices began, workers often entered a home months before a death with plenty of time to help the family prepare emotionally for the death. But the average length of stay in a hospice fell from an average of 90 days in 1990 to 48 days in 1999, according to the IOM. Half of Medicare hospice users received care for 19 days or less, the General Ac-. counting Office found in a review last year. A week or less was common. 
And the average nursing home stay is 835 days, or more than two years, according to the government's latest National Nursing Home Survey. Costs widely vary from person to person, both because of geographical difference in rates and because each resident's length of stay differs. If an individual has spent at least three days in a hospital for medically necessary care, Medicare will pick up the tab for up to 100 days of convalescent care immediately following discharge, as long as the patient goes to a home that's a Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility.
Many of the patients who are currently in care have probably been there at least a year or more and are most likely to be long-term care patients. According to the data the average length of stay for current residents is 835 days and for discharged residents is 270 days. When these patients are admitted from a hospital, Medicare will cover the cost. In 2004, at any given time, only about 12.7% of nursing home residents were being covered for their stay by Medicare rehabilitation, and their average stay was only 23 days.
The overall average length of stay computed from the 1999 Nursing Home Survey for DISCHARGED residents is 388 days, or just over 1 year. Using discharge data from this survey, it appears that the average length of a nursing home stay for people admitted to a nursing home when they are age 45 or older is: The average length of stay for DISCHARGED residents is 388 days, or just over 1 year. Many people use the first figure when discussing the average length of a nursing home stay, but I think the DISCHARGE data is more meaningful.
Long-Term Care Nursing Home Patients. According to the National Nursing Home Survey, the average length of stay for patients currently in nursing homes is 892 days, or 2.44 years. The average length of stay for those patients who are able to be discharged is 272 days, or approximately nine months. Short-Term Care Nursing Home Patients. The average stay of patients in a nursing home for acute rehabilitation is 23 days; only 9 percent of nursing home patients fall into this category.
According to the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey, nursing home residents who did not receive end-of-life (EOL) care had a mean length of time from admission of 837 days (median of 462 days), while residents who received EOL care had a mean length of time from admission of 761 days (median of 479 days).
