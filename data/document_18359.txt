I visited Madeira island for the first time last year and it was not at all what I expected. I anticipated a touristy beach destination and was so pleasantly surprised to find an island full of culture, amazing hiking possibilities, and delectable gourmet food.
Print this map. Funchel, Portugal. Funchal is the largest city and capital of Portugal's Madeira Islands, and a major tourism attraction. The approach to Funchal Harbor (by cruise ship) is well documented as one of the two most spectacular in the world, being on a par with Rio de Janeiro.
Don't go for the beaches. Simply put, Madeira island isn't a beach destination. The island might well be 35 miles long and 13 miles wide and boast 99 miles of coastline, but the shore is all rock and cliffs. It's a mountainous island; the highest peak is 1862 meters/6,100 feet high.
Madeira Island offers truly spectacular natural scenery and warm temperatures year-round. Follow walking trails that run parallel to man-made irrigation channels and take in views of clear blue waters and green cliffs. Spot brightly colored and sweetly scented flowers in the spring.
Madeira (c) Linda Garrison. Madeira is a gorgeous island situated in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Portugal and Africa. It is a perfect vacation destination, with mountains, a wonderful climate, and beautiful views such as this one. Madeira is located in the eastern Atlantic Ocean southwest of Portugal and off the coast of Africa. The island is breathtakingly beautiful with spectacular views and something for everyone. About the only things lacking on Madeira are flat land and sandy beaches.
Madeira [1] is a sub-tropical archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean and an autonomous region of Portugal. The archipelago is made up of two populated islands, Madeira and Porto Santo, and two groups of unpopulated islands called the Desertas and Selvagens Islands. It is part of the European Union ultraperifric area.
