There are two main methods of fishing for pink salmon from a boat, trolling and casting. 1  Trolling uses a downrigger to get your tackle to the depth you want to fish. 2  Casting at pink salmon from a boat uses the methods and gear described in shoreline fishing. 1 The key to trolling is using a small flasher of any color, which is an attractor for the pink salmon to swim along and hopefully strike at your lure. 2  The most common lure is a pink mini squid (hootchie), followed by a pink spoon.
