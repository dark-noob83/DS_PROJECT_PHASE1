Key points about hydromorphone. A single dose of IV hydromorphone (0.015 mg/kg) is suboptimal in treating acute pain in the ED. Titration with an initial bolus of 0.015 mg/kg and follow-up doses of 0.0075-0.015 mg/kg every 5-15 minutes might be a reasonable alternative, regardless of patient age. Chang and colleagues conducted a randomized double-blinded study comparing IV hydromorphone (0.015 mg/kg) with IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) in adult patients presenting to the ED in acute pain. The results showed that hydromorphone at a dose of 0.015 mg/kg gave better pain relief at 30 minutes.
Underdosing of opioid analgesia is a significant problem in emergency medicine. Although many dosing regimens for intravenous morphine have been studied, 0.10 mg/kg generally is recommended as an acceptable starting dose for treating patients with acute pain. Unfortunately, many physicians start much lower. All patients received an initial dose of 0.10 mg/kg of morphine. After 30 minutes, those randomized to the higher dose received 0.05 mg/kg of morphine, while the lower-dose group received placebo.
Guidelines for the Use of Morphine Sulfate Recommended Neonatal Dose, Route, and Interval A. Analgesia:  Bolus IV over 5 minutes: 0.05-0.2 mg/kg/dose. Repeat as required, usually Q 4 hours. May also be given IM or SC. 
In children, an infusion dose of 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg/hour morphine to a maximum intravenous dose of 4 mg/hour is recommended. It is recommended that an opioid antagonist and equipment for artificial ventilation be available. Children: Morphine sulfate is given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection in doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg bodyweight to a maximum of 15 mg. Injection may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours.
In a study by Bailey and colleagues that evaluated the efficacy of IV morphine in children with right lower quadrant pain, the initial dose of 0.1 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 5 mg was no more effective than placebo in diminishing children's pain 30 minutes after administration. Chang and colleagues conducted a randomized double-blinded study comparing IV hydromorphone (0.015 mg/kg) with IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) in adult patients presenting to the ED in acute pain. The results showed that hydromorphone at a dose of 0.015 mg/kg gave better pain relief at 30 minutes.
Morphine. Emergency medicine textbooks commonly recommend that the initial analgesic dose of IV morphine should be 0.1 mg/kg. Intravenous morphine is typically started at 0.1 mg/kg, with subsequent doses of 0.05 mg/kg given every 5 minutes until pain is relieved. Chang and colleagues conducted a randomized double-blinded study comparing IV hydromorphone (0.015 mg/kg) with IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) in adult patients presenting to the ED in acute pain. The results showed that hydromorphone at a dose of 0.015 mg/kg gave better pain relief at 30 minutes.
The dose is usually in the range of 2.5 to 15 mg diluted in 4 to 5 mL of Water for Injections given slowly over 4 to 5 minutes. Children: Morphine sulfate is given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection in doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg bodyweight to a maximum of 15 mg. Injection may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours.
MI– 8–15 mg, for very severe pain additional smaller doses may be given every 3–4 hr. IM: IV: SC: Usual starting dose for moderate to severe pain in opioid-naive patients– 0.05–0.2 mg/kg q 3–4 hr, maximum: 15 mg/dose. IM: IV: SC: Neonates 0.05 mg/kg q 4–8 hr, maximum dose: 0.1 mg/kg.

The narcotic antagonist, naloxone, is a specific antidote for morphine. The recommended adult dose of naloxone is 0.4 to 2.0 mg IV every 2 to 3 minutes as necessary, simultaneously with assisted respiration. For children, the initial recommended dose is 0.01 mg/kg naloxone. A response should be seen after 2-3 doses.
