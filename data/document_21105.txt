Skeletal system is the system of bones, associated cartilages and joints of human body. Together these structures form the human skeleton. Skeleton can be defined as the hard framework of human body around which the entire body is built.
Teeth are considered part of the skeletal system but they are not counted as bones. Teeth are made of dentin and enamel, which is strongest substance in your body. Teeth also play a key role in the digestive system.
Bones are a major component of the skeletal system. Bones that comprise the human skeleton are divided into two groups. They are the axial skeletal bones and appendicular skeletal bones. An adult human skeleton contains 206 bones, 80 of which are from the axial skeleton and 126 from the appendicular skeleton.
The skeletal system includes all of the bones and joints in the body. Each bone is a complex living organ that is made up of many cells, protein fibers, and minerals. The skeleton acts as a scaffold by providing support and protection for the soft tissues that make up the rest of the body.
The adult human skeletal system consists of 206 bones, as well as a network of tendons, ligaments and cartilage that connects them. The skeletal system performs vital functions — support, movement, protection, blood cell production, calcium storage and endocrine regulation — that enable us to survive.

Teeth are made of dentin and enamel and are part of the skeletal system but are not counted as bones. A bone’s structure includes cartilage, blood vessels, and internal structure. The periostenum is a membrane that lines the outside of bones.
