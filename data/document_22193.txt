Th etable below indicates current ratings PVC-insulated single and multicore wiring cables. The common US wire gauges-AWG gauges and current ratings. The AWG-American Wire Gauge-is used as a standard method of denoting wire diameter, measuring the diameter of the conductor (the bare wire) with the insulation removed.

American Wire Gauge (AWG) is a U.S. standard set of non-ferrous wire conductor sizes. The gauge means the diameter. Non-ferrous includes copper and also aluminum and other materials, but is most frequently applied to copper household electrical wiring and telephone wiring. Typical household wiring is AWG number 12 or 14. Telephone wire is usually 22, 24, or 26. The higher the gauge number, the smaller the diameter and the thinner the wire. Since thicker wire carries more current because it has less electrical resistance over a given length, thicker wire is better for longer distanc

Features. One important feature for both standard and T1 wire is the length of the wire. Those that are looking to connect an office to the public telephone system should make sure that they buy enough wire length to establish the connection.
