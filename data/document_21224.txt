A light year is a measure of distance, or the distance a particle of light will travel through a pure vacuum in one Earth year. This distance is approximately 5.8785 x 1012 [5.87 trillion] miles, or 9.4605 x 1012 [9.46 trillion] kilometers. In one year, light can travel about 10 trillion km. One light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. A light year is the distance covered by light in one year travelling at 186,000 miles per second.
SPACE.com Staff | January 15, 2013 09:41pm ET. Albert Einstein profoundly changed how we think about space and time. Einstein’s teachers probably had no clue what a famous man he would one day become, but contrary to what you might read on some older web pages out there, he was a good student. At age 12 Einstein had taught himself geometry. And his grades were good, according to those who've studied his archives. 1 His work on the photoelectric effect, which held that light be considered as consisting of particles called photons. 2  Einstein travelled widely. 3  In a visit to the United States, he was offered a position at Princeton University. 4  Shortly after his arrival, the Nazis took control of Germany and Einstein never went back.
Math Genius. One Day a person came to Hazrat Ali (May Allah be pleased with him), thinking that people say Ali is too smart; I'll ask him such a tough question that he won't be able to answer and I'll embarrass him in front of all Arabs. The first mathematician goes off to the washroom, and in his absence the second calls over the waitress and tells her that after a few minutes when his friend returns, he will call her over and ask her a question. All she has to do is answer one third x cubed.
Light year is a distance. It's defined as the distance light travels in one year, through vacuum. That's a huge distance compared to the daily experience of human beings … ... about 5,874,600,000,000,000 miles, or more than 31 thousand round trips to the sun and back. In one year, light can travel about 10 trillion km. One light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. A light year is the distance covered by light in one year travelling at 186,000 miles per second.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: A light year is the distance light travels in a year. I'm pretty sure light travels at the speed of 299,792,458 m/s. There are 60*60*24*365.256 or 31558118.4 seconds in the average year. So multiply that and light travels about 9.46 x 10^15 meters per year. According to anyone-not just astronomers-a light year is a light year. It's the distance light travels in a year.
It is the distance that light can travel in one year. In one year, light can travel about 10 trillion km. One light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. A light year is the distance covered by light in one year travelling at 186,000 miles per second.
It's just how far light can travel in a year, so you need to know the speed of light and then use the formula: speed = distance divided by time, rearranged to give distance = speed x time. A light-year is a unit of distance. It is the distance that light can travel in one year. Light moves at a velocity of about 300,000 kilometers (km) each second. So in one year, it can travel about 10 trillion km. More p recisely, one light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers.. According to anyone-not just astronomers-a light year is a light year.

For distances to other parts of the Milky Way Galaxy (or even further), astronomers use units of the light-year or the parsec. The light-year we have already defined. The parsec is equal to 3.3 light-years.
