OBJECTIVE: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a health state that is associated with hypercholesterolemia, infertility, iron-deficiency anemia, and poor obstetric outcome.
Anemia. For example, iron-deficiency anemia (insufficient iron) is more common in people with hypothyroidism. Symptoms or signs of anemia include: 1  Feeling tired or weak. 2  Pale appearance to the lining of lower eyelids. 3  palpitations, fast or irregular heart beat. 4  faintness and breathlessness. 5  hair loss.
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the body lacks sufficient thyroid hormone. Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to run the body's metabolism, it is understandable that people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial, 60 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and iron-deficiency anemia received iron salt+placebo (20 patients), levothyroxine+placebo (20 patients), or levothyroxine+iron salt (20 patients) for 3 months.
Symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary from mild to severe. Examples of the most common hypothyroidism symptoms include weight gain, constipation, depression, feeling run down, thinning or brittle hair or nails, intolerance to cold, loss of libido, and sleepiness.
