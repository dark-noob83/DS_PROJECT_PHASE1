Barrow, Alaska Food Prices. 10 Nov 2014 jskouri 1 Comment. I have recently relocated to Barrow, Alaska: America’s northern most city located several hundred miles inside the Arctic Circle. All food is flown in and as such I’ve been enjoying the cringe worthy and laugh out loud insanity of the food prices.
In other words, the best parts of Alaska are completely free! Grocery costs. It costs roughly $122 to feed a family of four per week in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Mat-Su Valley. That’s on par with Portland, Ore., where the weekly family grocery bill is $100. It should be noted, however, that costs in rural Alaska are higher due to the remote locations.

The Cost of Living in Alaska. Not as expensive as you might think T he cost of living in many cities throughout Alaska is affordable and is significantly less expensive than San Francisco, Honolulu, Manhattan and a handful of other U.S. cities.
While the processed foods were priced roughly the same as in Anchorage, others were much worse. A single bell pepper cost $2.99, milk was $6 a gallon, and a honeydew melon was $14. We heard tell of $29 watermelon in Kotzebue, a town not far north of Nome.
Alaska is part of the United States, not Canada. If your talking about prices, then you should be using the U.S. measures and not the metric system. The U.S. including Alaska does not use the metric system, and you should say a gallon of milk not liter; a loaf of bread is either a pound (16 oz.) or 24 oz., not grams.
