It makes sense that Kobalt is trying to match up to Ridgid. Lowes’ main competitor is Home Depot, and both Home Depot and Sears if you’re talking about just tools. It also wouldn’t be a good idea for to Lowes to suggestively compare the Kobalt power tools to other brands they carry, such as Porter Cable.
Kobalt is a line of hand tools, power tools, and tool storage products owned by the American home improvement chain Lowe's. It is the house brand for both Lowe's in North America and their joint venture Masters Home Improvement in Australia.
All Kobalt power tools are covered by a five-year, hassle-free guarantee, and all Kobalt batteries are covered by a three-year, hassle-free guarantee. If you ever experience a problem with your Kobalt tools, return the item to the place of purchase for a free replacement. There is no registration or phone call required.
Kobalt tools are currently manufactured by Danaher (June 2009). Kobalt is Lowe's in-house brand of mechanic's tools. Danaher's other brands of mechanics tools include K-D Tools, Matco Tools, Gearwrench, and Craftsman (to name a few, there are more!). Kobalt used to me mfg by Snap-On; not any more!
In 2003, the Danaher Corporation began producing the majority of Kobalt hand tools. In 2011, Lowe's ended its arrangement with Danaher and switched to a different supplier for its mechanic's hand tools, JS Products of Las Vegas, Nevada.
Stuart 78 Comments. Home Depot and Lowes are in a fierce marketing battle, with each saying their house brand makes the better 18V cordless drill driver. Lowes struck first, with an in-store banner behind their new Kobalt cordless power tool displays comparing the Kobalt Li-ion drill driver to Ridgid’s.
Stuart 13 Comments. Lowes’ Kobalt brand has recently launched their “new” line of 20V Max li-ion cordless power tools. I put new in quotes because the tools seem to be unchanged from the Kobalt 18V cordless power tools that came out nearly two years ago.
