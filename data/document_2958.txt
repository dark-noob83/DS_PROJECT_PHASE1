You can choose to dispute a Content ID claim if you believe the system somehow misidentified your video, or if you have all the rights to use that copyright-protected content. You may want to learn more about fair use or the public domain before you choose to dispute for either of those reasons. YouTube can’t help you determine whether you should dispute a claim, so you’ll probably want to seek your own legal advice if you’re still not sure what to do. If you dispute a claim without a valid reason, the copyright owner may choose to take down your video.

Alternatively, you can dispute with YouTube that the music in your video qualifies as ‘fair use’. I helped many YouTube partners to make music parodies of popular commercial songs and this approach often works. I wouldn’t recommend it as a sure-fire way of defending against copyright claims, however. If you receive a copyright claim on a video that uses my music, do not dispute if with youTube! It will take a considerable time, while I can remove the claim much quicker. Send me a link to the YouTube video that received the claim along with the order number and I will white-list you video and remove the claim.

To avoid penalization, only submit legitimate dispute claims. In the second case, I really feel like I have a decent Fair Use case, so I filled out this form. The form says that I think the clip is fair use under copyright law. It’s my responsibility to “understand the law” according to YouTube, and that is my understanding of it.
