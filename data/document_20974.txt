Location: ماشاءالله Heaven. Here is the Kligman's Hq formula that I had copied and pasted from a dermatology site, in which I pasted the link below. Enjoy. - Hydroquinone powder 5%- Dexamethasone powder 0.1%- Tretinoin powder 0.1%- Hydrophilic ung qs ad 60gmThe reference is O.H. Mills and A.M. Kligman, J. Soc. cosmet.
Kligman’s Formula 1  : In 1975 Drs. 2  Kligman and Willis combined hydroquinone with tretinoin and dexamethasone and obtained a very potent skin whitening formulation. 3  This formula was capable of producing a white complexion in black subjects after 6-8 weeks of application. 1 This formula is the combination of hydroquinone and tretinoin without any steroids. 2  The depigmenting effect of this formula is less than the Kligman’s formulation but significantly more than hydroquinone alone.
RESULTS: CONCLUSION: Superficial chemical peel with salicylic acid in combination with topical modified Kligman formula for melasma is more effective than topical modified Kligman formula alone. It is easy and cheap. The results of the epidermal type were better than other types. Superficial chemical peel with salicylic acid (20% and 30%) in combination with topical modified Kligman formula is more effective than topical treatment alone, especially for epidermal type but less effective in mixed and with no result in dermal type.

Tretinoin helps to stimulate the production of healthy, new skin cells and it may also assist with the absorption of hydroquinone. Dexamethasone is a mild steroid, which is incorporated to help minimize skin irritation that may arise from the hydroquinone and tretinoin in Kligman’s formula. Kligman’s formula must be prescribed by a physician and can be compounded by a specialist pharmacy. Your physician will be able to determine if the combination is appropriate for your condition.
