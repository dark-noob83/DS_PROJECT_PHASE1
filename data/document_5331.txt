Report Abuse. They were convinced women were 'lesser' beings than men, and they considered theatre an art. Thus, women weren't allowed to play. Just like they weren't supposed to have a personality, or any influence either. It was a man's world, and the only thing women were good for was get and raise children. Why were women not allowed to perform on the public stage in Elizabethan times? I'm learning about Shakespeare and I can't find any reason for women not being allowed on the stage.
No women take part in traditional kabuki. Women were banned at an early stage of kabuki's development because an important side business of the onna (women's) kabuki troupes was prostitution, and men assumed the female roles. The art of female impersonation (onnagata) was developed into a theatrical role requiring years of training. Unlike noh drama, which is solemn and ritualized, kabuki is designed to entertain an audience with dramatic, often spectacular, effects. A kabuki play opens to the rapid clapping of wooden clappers as the traditional stage curtain, in black, green, and persimmon vertical stripes, is drawn open.
Kabuki (̕) is a traditional Japanese form of theater with roots tracing back to the Edo Period. It is recognized as one of Japan's three major classical theaters along with noh and bunraku, and has been named as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. If you come across people from the audience shouting out names at the actors on stage, do not mistake this for an act of disrespect: all kabuki actors have a yago (hereditary stage name), which is closely associated to the theater troupe which he is from.

In 1954, East Side Theater was made, and Kabuki stage relied on TV. In 1965, Kabuki was seen as an important cultural heritage. After World War II, the Japanese came to see that Kabuki as an important part of their culture. Kabuki was started by a woman, Izumo no Okuni, who performed in the dry river bed in Kyoto in 1603. It was very popular, especially because many of the stories and dance moves were about sex. Many of the women performers were probably prostitutes.
The one person who was aware that women were allowed on the stage in Spain claimed that actors were all disreputable, which is simply not true; the most successful actors were very well connected, being included even in court functions. That questioner wrote, I remember reading that there was a law in Spain that said they could. But I don't know if that only covered Spain.. The answer is that it depends upon the country, but in England, women were not allowed on the stage until 1660. Of course, you wouldn't know that from reading the Yahoo! answer.. In fact, the best that anyone did was to know as much as the questioner did
Kabuki (歌舞伎) is a classical Japanese dance-drama. Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers. The individual kanji, from left to right, mean sing (歌), dance (舞), and skill (伎). Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as the art of singing and dancing. Since the word kabuki is believed to derive from the verb kabuku, meaning to lean or to be out of the ordinary, kabuki can be interpreted as avant-garde or bizarre theatre. The expression kabukimono (歌舞伎者) referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed and swaggered on a street.
No. Women were only allowed on stage after 1660, following the downfall of Cromwell's puritanical government. The first recorded female actor in England was Margaret Hughes, who played Desdemona in Thomas Killigrew's production of Othello. 
Charles reign did however see the first appearance of professional female players on the stage in England-but they were not English. Charles's Queen, Henrietta Maria, was a Frenchwoman and it was her influence that brought a French company, complete with actresses, to perform in London at the Blackfriars Theatre. Not only were women to continue to be banned from the stage, now theatrical performance in its entirety was to be banned, and all of the theatres were closed down. Paradoxically, this ban on theatre in all its forms would lead to the door finally being opened for English women to appear on the stage.
