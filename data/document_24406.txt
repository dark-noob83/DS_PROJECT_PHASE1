2. Transitive verb that takes a direct object (a single noun or noun phrase), which requires something to receive the action of the verb: I punched the wall.. Here, punched is the transitive verb and the wall is the noun phrase that takes the action of the verb. 3. Indirect and direct object (two noun phrase)
Not all verbs are Linking Verbs, of course. One type of non-linking verb is the dynamic verb (sometimes called an action verb). Here the subject is actively involved in a specific action, e.g. 'kick', 'run', 'eat'. Often, action verbs require something to complete their meaning, but sometimes they don't. Thus the clause is analysed: Subject (She) - Linking Verb (seems) - Complement (tired) or S-V-C. Note that in both those examples the predicatives are called 'subject complements' because they tell you about the subject, either by renaming it (father), or describing it (tired).

A linking verb (known as a Copular verb) is normally followed by either a COMPLEMENT element or an ADVERBIAL element. The complement is sometimes called a predicative noun or a predicative adjective, e.g. in 'He is my father', 'is' is the linking verb and 'father' the Complement (predicative noun). Thus the clause is analysed: Subject (He) - Linking Verb (is) - Complement (father) or S-V-C. Thus the clause is analysed: Subject (She) - Linking Verb (seems) - Complement (tired) or S-V-C.

Linking verbs are verbs that link the subject to the predicate so that more Information about the subject can be provided in the predicate. Examples are seem, appear, look, feel. An important point is that since the predicate modifier is modifying the subject, a noun, it is an adjective, not an adverb. 
A noun can follow both a linking verb and an action verb. When it  follows a linking verb, it's called a predicate nominative. Ex:  Henry is a teacher. When a noun follows a â€¦ n action verb,  it's called a direct object. The predicate adjective (also called a subject complement)is the adjective following a linking verb which describes the subject of the sentence. Edit. Share to: Notyouraveragedummy ...
