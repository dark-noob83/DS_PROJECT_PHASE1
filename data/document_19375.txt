charles, There is a difference between the time it takes for the bone to unite and for you to rehabilitate the limb. In femur fractures, the time to union is usually between 12 to 16 weeks for low energy fractures and around 16 to 20 for high energy fractures. When using a cane, it should be in the hand opposite the fracture femur (not on the same side). By using it in the opposite hand, you walk more normally. Using a cane can take about 50% of the weight off the limb. By weight bearing, it applies stress across the fracture, which will actually help stimulate it to heal.
If you break a bone in your arm or leg, you may just need to wear a splint, cast or brace to hold it in place while it heals. But sometimes a broken bone will need to be fixed with surgery using metal plates, rods or pins. You may hear your surgeon refer to your broken bone as a fracture, which is the medical term. Bone is a living tissue so if it breaks (fractures), it can heal itself.
Greetings, I am Dr. Pat. I have worked with birds for many years. I will do my best to help you. I often do not splint budgies either, it depends on the fracture. You should let them know that he is dragging it. He may require a protective wrap for the areas being dragged. If it is partially healed, I think it is best to do very little to him
Also ask your surgeon how long he thinks it will take for union of the fracture and also how long till you get back to your regular activities. He/she is the one who knows how well the fracture was fixed and what it can withstand. Hang in there. You still have a long ways to go and a lot of hard work to do.

If the broken bone is still in position, you'll usually just need a plaster cast. This holds the bone in place so it can heal. If there's a lot of swelling, you may just have a splint or cast around the back half of your leg until the swelling goes down. A full cast can be fitted a few days later. You may be provided with painkillers to take home and information on how to look after your cast. You'll probably need to use crutches or a wheelchair during this time, until it's possible to put weight on the leg again. You'll be shown how to safely use any mobility equipment you're provided with. More severe fractures can take between three and six months to fully heal. Some can take even longer.
If your injury is minor, such as a crack in the bone with little muscle damage, you may be able to resume normal activities 3 to 4 months after surgery. If the fracture is severe, however, it may take 1 to 2 years before recovery is complete. Because of this, calcaneus fractures are often severe and may result in long-term problems. The calcaneus is the most frequently fractured tarsal bone. Tarsal bone fractures account for about 2% of all adult fractures. Of these, 60% are calcaneus
The tibia, or shinbone, is the most common fractured long bone in your body. The long bones include the femur, humerus, tibia, and fibula. A tibial shaft fracture occurs along the length of the bone, below the knee and above the ankle. Open fracture: When broken bones break through the skin, they are called open or compound fractures. For example, when a pedestrian is struck by the bumper of a moving car, the broken tibia may protrude through a tear in the skin and other soft tissues.
How long does it take for a parakeet fractured leg to heal?Will he ever be able to use it? He now drags it but he eats fine.He is not as active and we are worried for stress. I have worked with birds for many years. I will do my best to help you. I often do not splint budgies either, it depends on the fracture. You should let them know that he is dragging it. He may require a protective wrap for the areas being dragged.
It takes about 6-8 weeks to heal, depending on the type of injury sustained. (Keep the finger as still as you can !!!!) When broken place the hand in ice cold water for … about 5 min.s then take it and wrap the whole hand in a soft wrap (anything that is a soft colth) . The time changes for everyone, depending on age, health conditions before the break, and how bad the break is. On average, the break takes about 1-3 months to fully heal. If t … he hip has been operated on it usually takes longer to heal than one without operation.
