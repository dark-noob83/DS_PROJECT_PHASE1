A progressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from high-income groups than from low-income groups and is based on the concept of ability to pay. A progressive tax system might, for example, tax low-income taxpayers at 10 percent, middle-income taxpayers at 15 percent and high-income taxpayers at 30 percent.
The proposed compromise between a flat tax and a progressive tax. A graduated flat tax is characterized by having minimal tax brackets and low tax rates. An example of a graduated flat tax was the modified flat tax system that was part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
progressive tax. A tax with a rate that increases as the amount to be taxed increases. For example, a taxing authority might levy a tax of 10% on the first $10,000 of income and increase the rate by 5% per each $10,000 increment up to a maximum of 50% on all income over $80,000.
In a progressive, or graduated, income tax system, taxpayers with higher incomes are taxed at higher rates that those with lower incomes. Those in favor of this approach say that the greatest tax burden falls on those who can afford to carry it.
Income taxes are levied by governments on the income of citizens to raise money for government services and programs. Taxes can be regressive or graduated. Regressive taxes tax a smaller percentage of income from wealthier individuals while graduated taxes, also known as progressive taxes, increase as income increases.

A graduated income tax is one that imposes a higher tax rate the higher your income. For example, the first $10,000 that you earn might be taxed at a rate of 5 percent, the next $15,000 at 15 percent and any income above $25,000 would be taxed at 30 percent. The tax rates only apply to the income in that category. For example, a person who makes $11,000 would not pay 15 percent on all of their income. Instead, they would pay 5 percent on the first $10,000 and 15 percent on the remaining $1,000 for a total tax bill of $650.
