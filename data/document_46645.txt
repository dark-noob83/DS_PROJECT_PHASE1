Transcription factors are proteins that control which genes are turned on or off in the genome. They do so by binding to DNA and other proteins. Once bound to DNA, these proteins can promote or block the enzyme that controls the reading, or “transcription,” of genes, making genes more or less active. Transcription factors are essential for the regulation of genes. Through the action of transcription factors, the various cells of the body, which all have the same genome, can function differently. These proteins are so important to life that they are found in all living organisms. Roughly 8% of genes in the human genome encode transcription factors.
The regulation of transcription is a vital process in all living organisms. It is orchestrated by transcription factors and other proteins working in concert to finely tune the amount of RNA being produced through a variety of mechanisms. Transcriptional initiation, termination and regulation are mediated by “DNA looping” which brings together promoters, enhancers, transcription factors and RNA processing factors to accurately regulate gene expression.
Often, for gene transcription to occur, a number of transcription factors must bind to DNA regulatory sequences. This collection of transcription factors, in turn, recruit intermediary proteins such as cofactors that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and RNA polymerase. Transcription factors use a variety of mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression. These mechanisms include: 1  stabilize or block the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA. 2  catalyze the acetylation or deacetylation of histone proteins.
Thus, for a single transcription factor to initiate transcription, all of these other proteins must also be present, and the transcription factor must be in a state where it can bind to them if necessary. Cofactors are proteins that modulate the effects of transcription factors. Transcription factors use a variety of mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression. These mechanisms include: 1  stabilize or block the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA. 2  catalyze the acetylation or deacetylation of histone proteins.
Some transcription factors bind to a DNA promoter sequence near the transcription start site and help form the transcription initiation complex. Other transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences, such as enhancer sequences, and can either stimulate or repress transcription of the related gene. Transcription factors include a wide number of proteins, excluding RNA polymerase, that initiate and regulate the transcription of genes.

Transcription factors are one of the groups of proteins that read and interpret the genetic blueprint in the DNA. They bind to the DNA and help initiate a program of increased or decreased gene transcription. As such, they are vital for many important cellular processes. Transcription factors use a variety of mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression. These mechanisms include: 1  stabilize or block the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA. 2  catalyze the acetylation or deacetylation of histone proteins.
Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences in order to regulate the expression of a given gene. The power of transcription factors resides in their ability to activate and/or repress wide repertoires of downstream target genes. Transcriptional initiation, termination and regulation are mediated by “DNA looping” which brings together promoters, enhancers, transcription factors and RNA processing factors to accurately regulate gene expression.
After the transcription factor binds the DNA, co-regulatory molecules will bind the transcription factor. As with the DBD, transcription factors do not bind to just any co-regulatory proteins. The TAD region of the transcription factor interacts with co-regulatory proteins and it too, has unique sequences. These sequences are only recognized by certain co-regulatory proteins. In summary, transcription factors regulate gene expression. They do this by interacting directly with a target gene through the DBD. Once the transcription factor binds to DNA, co-regulatory molecules bind the transcription factor at the TAD. This leads to the formation of a gene regulatory complex
