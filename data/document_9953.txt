NADH FADH₂. The electron transport chain serves two major functions in respiration: 1) It is where the chemical energy of ____ and _____ is used to make ATP. NADH 2 hydrogen intermembrane. STEP 2: ____ provides _ electrons to the first carrier in the chain. This process releases energy because the electrons are at a lower energy state after being passed to the first carrier. The energy released is used to drive the transport of ________ ions into the ______________ space.
The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain is molecular oxygen. Electron transport chains are used for extracting energy via redox reactions from sunlight in photosynthesis or, such as in the case of the oxidation of sugars, cellular respiration. In the mitochondrial electron transport chain electrons move from an electron donor (NADH or QH 2) to a terminal electron acceptor (O 2) via a series of redox reactions. These reactions are coupled to the creation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane
Answers. Best Answer: An electron transport chain couples a chemical reaction between an electron donor (such as NADH) and an electron acceptor (such as O2) to the transfer of H+ ions across a membrane, through a set of mediating biochemical reactions. 
The function of the electron transport chain is to produce a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient as a result of the redox reactions. If protons flow back through the membrane, they enable mechanical work, such as rotating bacterial flagella. In the mitochondrial electron transport chain electrons move from an electron donor (NADH or QH 2) to a terminal electron acceptor (O 2) via a series of redox reactions. These reactions are coupled to the creation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane
Glycolysis literally means splitting sugars.. Glucose, a six carbon sugar, is split into two molecules of a three carbon sugar. Glycolysis takes place in the cell's cytoplasm. In the process, two molecules of ATP, two molecules of pyruvic acid and two high energy electron carrying molecules of NADH are produced.
Best Answer: D. The electron transport chain is composed of various proteins that act as electron acceptors and donors. As high-energy electrons pass through it, they release a little bit of their energy a time. This energy is used to pump H+ against a concentration gradient, increasing their concentration on one side. 
Electron transport requires oxygen directly. The electron transport chain is a series of electron carriers in the membrane of the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. Through a series of reactions, the high energy electrons are passed to oxygen. In the process, a gradient is formed, and ultimately ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation. In the process, two molecules of ATP, two molecules of pyruvic acid and two high energy electron carrying molecules of NADH are produced.
An electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of compounds that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H + ions) across a membrane. In the mitochondrial electron transport chain electrons move from an electron donor (NADH or QH 2) to a terminal electron acceptor (O 2) via a series of redox reactions. These reactions are coupled to the creation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner
The electron transport chain converts energy stored in hydrogen ions and various other substances formed in early cellular respiration to produce high energy ATP in mitochondr … ia. Mitochondria contain both an inner and an outer membrane, and it is along the inner membrane that the actual reactions of the chain occur.
