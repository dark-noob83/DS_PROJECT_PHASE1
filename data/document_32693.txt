State Information. The first step in determining whether an LLC in your state can used as a business structure for a non-profit organization is to review the requirements for forming an LLC promulgated by the state agency overseeing business organizations.
Nonprofit Versus For-Profit. The purposes for establishing and maintaining nonprofit organizations and for-profit businesses differ significantly. The main purpose of a for-profit company is to produce income above and beyond expenses; the products or services provided by the company are a means to that end. On the other hand, nonprofit organizations exist to provide a service for a target community or the public at large.

Non-profits. Whether or not an organization is non-profit depends on its compliance with IRS rules and regulations, as well as state tax laws. The basic rules for a non-profit do not concern the legal structure of the business, but the purpose for which the business is formed. The most familiar purpose for non-profits is a charitable purpose, usually referred to as a 501(c)(3) organization.
Though, in many ways, non-profit organizations are similar to for-profits, a non-profit's goals are different. If you're thinking about starting a non-profit, consider the goals and various benefits of this type of organization.
A for-profit organization exists primarily to generate a profit, that is, to take in more money than it spends. The owners can decide to keep all the profit themselves, or they can spend some or all of it on the business itself.
