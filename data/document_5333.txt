Generally, you have up to 26 weeks of eligibility depending on how much you have earned in your base period. If you return to work of if you have deductible income for any week, you may draw more or less than 26 weeks.
For example, if you apply for unemployment in March 2012, the base period would be October 1, 2010 though September 30, 2011 (in that example, since the last complete calendar quarter was October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the base period is the four quarters preceding that one).
You can collect the equivalent of 26 weeks of total unemployment benefits on a claim. A claim is in effect for a one-year period. Within that claim year, maximum benefits would be 26 times your Weekly Benefit Rate. Using the previous example, with a Weekly Benefit Rate of $152, you would be entitled to collect $3,952.
Q. How long will I have had to work to be monetarily eligible for benefits? You must have wages in at least two quarters of your qualifying period (base period). The base period is the first four quarters (12 months) of the last five completed quarters from the date your claim is filed.
While unemployment benefits may cover up to 50% of your earned wages, most states also have established a cap on how much you can receive. Meaning, if 50% of your wages is an amount over the maximum benefits, then you will not receive 50%.
1 b. 2  You must have earned at least $7,000 in total wages in at least two quarters of the base period, with wages in one quarter equal to $5,987.50 or more (2013). 3  Once you have determined your earnings for your base period, you can find out how much unemployment you will receive by checking this chart.
AND. The total wages paid to you in your base period must be one and one-half times your high quarter wages. We use no more than $9,240 of your high quarter earnings to determine if you qualify. You must have earned at least half that amount ($4,620) in the other base period quarters.
1 Your earnings during the entire base period must be at least one-and-a-half times your wages in the highest paid quarter of the base period. 2  For example, if you earned $5,000 during your highest paid quarter, your total earnings for the base period year must be at least $7,500.
1 OR. 2  b. 3  You must have earned at least $7,000 in total wages in at least two quarters of the base period, with wages in one quarter equal to $5,987.50 or more (2013). 4  Once you have determined your earnings for your base period, you can find out how much unemployment you will receive by checking this chart.
