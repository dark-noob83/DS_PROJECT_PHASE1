A 170-gram container of plain, nonfat Greek yogurt -- approximately 3/4 cup -- supplies 17 grams of protein. That's 30 percent of the protein the average man should aim to consume each day, and it fulfills 37 percent of the average woman's recommended daily intake.
Greek yogurt provides on average 10 grams of protein per 5.3 ounces. There are a wide variety of brands of Greek yogurt on the market, all varying in serving sizes and protein content. Greek yogurt is available in fat-free, low-fat or full-fat varieties.
Greek yogurt protein is actually a type of milk protein called casein. It is considered to be a very desirable and beneficial protein because it contains a full set of the nine amino acids the body needs but cannot produce.
The casein in Greek yogurt is a complete protein because it contains all nine essential amino acids: methionine, lysine, isoleucine, histidine, valine, tryptophan, threonine, phenylalanine and leucine. You can only obtain essential amino acids from your diet -- your body cannot synthesize them.
Greek-style yogurt companies have made a name for their product by touting protein-content, too. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Nutrient Database, a 6-ounce container of regular yogurt has a mere 8.9 grams of protein compared to the 17.3 grams found in the same serving of Greek yogurt.
Here's a closer look at how the two stack up nutrition-wise. Protein. Greek yogurt is high in protein, which helps promote fullness. A typical 6-ounce serving contains 15 to 20 grams, the amount in 2 to 3 ounces of lean meat. That makes it particularly appealing to vegetarians, who sometimes struggle to get enough of the nutrient.
