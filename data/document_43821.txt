The Konica Minolta Magicolor 5 430DL is a very complete printer, but its bulk limits its possible applications.

Laser Printer Cost Advantages. Consider that an entry level business Color Laser printer can be bought for less than $250. If one uses the same cost comparison method, the cost is less than $0.16 per page. ($231 street price divided by 1500 sheets = $0.154 per page). The savings become even greater when the costs of the printer and subsequent high capacity replacement toner cartridges are used and factored in over a 3 year period. Inkjet Cost Myth. Inkjet printers, although very inexpensive to purchase, often have a very high cost per page for cartridge supplies. It’s not uncommon for inkjet cost per page analyses to work out to be $0.25 to more than a $1 per page.
You’ll need a compatible printer—we like the HP Envy 5530 ($70)—and then a base-level subscription costs $3 per month. That’s a lot less than a color laser printer, which will set you back around $200—but with Instant Ink you’ll always have a supply of ink on hand for when you need it.

With a rated cost per page of just 1.6 cents for black and white, the Officejet 8600 beats the rap that inkjet printers are cheaply made, offer inferior print quality and are too expensive to run for office use. The 8600 even beats HP's own entry-level laser multifunction printer (MFP), the LaserJet M1212nf, with its estimated cost per page (CPP) of 4.1 cents.
The $230 Dell 1250c single-function color laser printer, for instance, accepts high-yield toner cartridges that cost 3.5 cents per page for black and 5 cents per color, per page. A four-color page would cost 18.5 cents. These costs are no better than the current average for a color inkjet. I know I’m going to hear about it from the laser printer’s many fans, but here goes: If you have $400 to spend on a new color printer for your small office of five to ten people, you should buy an inkjet model.
The Color LaserJet 3600 represents the best compromise between ergonomics, quality, speed, and cost per page; it's a shame that its network version costs so much. Yup. Nice Post.

Overall inkjet costs way way less with alternative ink, alone the cost of supplies for laser (toner set+drum+fixer) can overweight cost of laser printer itself by factor 200%.

Again, the cost per page is based on the default print quality setting. For the LaserJet there's a fast res setting of 600 by 600 dots per inch (DPI) and a high resolution 1200 x 1200 setting. The 8600 even beats HP's own entry-level laser multifunction printer (MFP), the LaserJet M1212nf, with its estimated cost per page (CPP) of 4.1 cents.
