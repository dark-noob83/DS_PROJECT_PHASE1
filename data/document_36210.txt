Religion: Catholic. Re: Church closest to the Catholic Church. If you're looking for the church that is closest to the Catholic Church in terms of doctrine and practice, that would be the Eastern Orthodox churches. Even the Lutherans are far closer to the Catholic Church than the Methodists.
In this context the closest religion to Catholicism within western Christianity would be Anglicanism (usually called Episcopalian out side of the UK) and Lutheranism. Each has a high church tradition which liturgically at least resembles Catholicism quite closely.
To get the closest to Catholicism, one has to look to the east and the various Orthodox Churches of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. These churches most notably the Greek Orthodox Church are the closest theologically and sacramentally.
Using this definition, the religion most similar to Catholicism would be Judaism followed by Islam. Each are religions of the book and accept the God of Abraham, Isaac and Moses as the one true God. However, most will define the various denominations of Christianity as separate religions.
Re: Church closest to the Catholic Church. Whether they go to a Methodist parish, an Anglican one, or Billy Bob's Pentecostal worship centre down the street, it does not matter. Neither is the true religion.
Best Answer: Eastern Orthodox is the closest to Catholicism. They have a church hierarchy, believe in the Real Presence in the Eucharist, have the seven sacraments, and have other similarities.
