During that time, scholars thought that the work of the ancient Greek physician Galen was an authority when it came to human anatomy. As Greek and Roman laws had disallowed the dissection of human beings, Galen had evidently reasoned out analogies related to human anatomy after studying pigs and apes. Andreas Vesalius.

Image of muscular anatomy from De humani corporis fabrica by Andreas Vesalius, 1543. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was trained in anatomy by Andrea del Verrocchio. In 1489 Leonardo began a series of anatomical drawings depicting the ideal human form. This work was carried out intermittently for over 2 decades. The first recorded school of anatomy was in Alexandria from about 300 to 2nd century BC. Ptolemy I Soter was the first to allow for medical officials to cut open and examine dead bodies for the purposes of learning how human bodies operated.
It has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Human anatomy was the most prominent of the biological sciences of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The first recorded school of anatomy was in Alexandria from about 300 to 2nd century BC. Ptolemy I Soter was the first to allow for medical officials to cut open and examine dead bodies for the purposes of learning how human bodies operated.
In Alexandria, Egypt, there are 2 surgeons named Herophilus and Erasistratus. Herophilus is also known as the Father of Anatomy. They togeth … er did the human cadaveric dissections for 30-40 years. After that, human dissection was prohibited for the next 1800 years. The anatomy of a pig and a human are very similar. Both are placental mammal, which means the fetus receives nourishment from the mother through the umbilical cord. Both speci … es are also omnivores. These two things lead to the digestive track and layers under the skin to be similar

Indeed, such a definition is typical of most dictionaries. Since NetAnatomy focuses on human anatomy, the definition may be refined to a study of the structure of the human body. In fact, many anatomists would likely not accept such a definition because of its lack of reference to function.
Galen's understanding of anatomy and medicine was principally influenced by the then-current theory of humorism, as advanced by ancient Greek physicians such as Hippocrates. His theories dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than 1,300 years. Galen’s principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC. Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living (vivisection) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and primates.
