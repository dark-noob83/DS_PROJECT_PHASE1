It's not much. I started at Woolworths when I was 15, and as a casual on probation I believe it was somewhere around the $8 mark. After three months you should move to the next level of shop assistant so you should get a marginal pay increase after three months if Coles has similar policies to those of Woolworths.
At Target, at least in my store, the Team Members start off at $7.50. Specialists make $8.50 and Team Leaders make $10.50. I believe starting pay for an Executive Team Lead st â€¦ art at $42,000 a year. I don't know how much the Store Team Leads make. Target is really good to even there part time team members.

posted 2009-Jul-19, 5:47 pm. From the award at www.sda.org.au you get paid 45% of the adult rate. Adult rate for a service assistant is $664.20 per week or $17.47 per hour exclusive of penalties. Your rate of pay would therefore be $7.8655 per hour exclusive of penalties and loadings. I started at Woolworths when I was 15, and as a casual on probation I believe it was somewhere around the $8 mark. After three months you should move to the next level of shop assistant so you should get a marginal pay increase after three months if Coles has similar policies to those of Woolworths.
