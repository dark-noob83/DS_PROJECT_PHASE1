Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. There are three types of infection: 1  Cutaneous (skin) anthraxCutaneous (skin) anthrax. 2  This can occur when spores enter your body through a break in the skin.
Anthrax is an infectious disease due to a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. Infection in humans most often involves the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs.
Anthrax is the disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which lives in soil. The bacterial cell lives as a hardy spore to survive harsh conditions. The spores germinate into thriving colonies of bacteria once inside an animal or person.
Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive spore-forming rod. It was the first bacterium to be used to prove that bacteria caused diseases, when Robert Koch (1877) produced anthrax spores and injected them into animals. Bacillus anthracis is a commonly found in soil of grazing areas.
Description Anthrax. Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacteria form spores or latent versions, protected by a hard shell. The spores form in which the bacteria causing the infection, can survive in soil for many years.
Anthrax is a zoonotic infection caused by Bacillus anthracis (see the image below) . B anthracis while handling sick animals or contaminated wool, hair, or animal hides. Pulmonary anthrax results from inhaling anthrax spores. GI anthrax results from ingesting meat products that contain anthrax.

What is Bacillus anthracis? 1  Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent of anthrax, is a large, gram-positive, non-motile, spore-forming bacterial rod. 2  Bacillus anthracis spores do not have a characteristic appearance such as color, smell, or taste.
Anthrax disease is a severe illness caused by bacteria named Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax disease can result in pneumonia, blood infection, and death. Most of the time anthrax bacteria live in an inactive form called spores.
