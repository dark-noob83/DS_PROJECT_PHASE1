Bulls are much more muscular than cows, with thicker bones, larger feet, a very muscular neck, and a large, bony head with protective ridges over the eyes. These features assist bulls in fighting for domination over a herd, giving the winner superior access to cows for reproduction. Their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles, and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum: a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches 28 centimetres (11 in); that of a fully adult bull may be over 40 centimetres (16 in).
The United Kennel Club considers only one breed of dog to be a pit bull, and that is the American Pit Bull Terrier. Since they have strict standards for each breed that they recognize, they would say that the biggest pit bull could not weigh any more than 60 pounds for a male and 50 pounds for a female.
The English Bull Terrier should reach between 20 and 24 inches at the shoulder. However, there are no limits for height or weight in this breed's Kennel Club Breed Standard. 
For example, if bull A has a weaning weight EPD of +45 and bull B has a weaning weight EPD of +35, the calves produced by bull A are expected to weigh, on the average, 10 pounds more at weaning than those of bull B, assuming the bulls are bred to comparable cows. If the new bull sires 90 calves over the next 3-5 years, $910 ÷ 90 = $10.11 cost/ calf. If the bull sires 90 calves that are 10 pounds heavier at weaning and they sell for $1.09/lb. (3-year average for 500-pound calves – GA Auction Markets, 2009-2011) at weaning, you will have paid for the bull.
A full grown average EBT should be between 18-24. However, there is no height specifics for this breed. AKC breed standards dictate  most stand 21-22 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 50-70 pounds .. A bull terrier smaller than 18 would most likely weigh in the 40's which would be considered small for a standard EBT. Most Standard EBT breeders strive to ensure they reach at least the 20 mark for height within their bloodline. An average 20 male Bull Terrier would weigh around 50 pounds. However, now a days I notice most people prefer males to be in the 60 pound range which require more height than 20.
The American Staffordshire bull terrier is a different breed from the Staffordshire bull terrier. Sometimes referred to as an Am Staff, this dog is also sometimes called a pitbull. If the pitbull is actually an Am Staff, a male can stand as tall as 17 to 19 inches, while a female is between 16 and 18 inches. The Am Staff weighs between 57 and 67 pounds. There is a breed called the American pit bull that is not recognized by the AKC but is recognized by 12 other breed clubs. This breed is currently only recognized by five breed clubs. The American bully is a short, stocky dog with a large head and wide chest. This pitbull-type breed reaches a height of 18 to 21 inches in males, 17 to 20 inches in females and a weight of 70 to 120 pounds. There are five categories of American bully according to body type and height and weigh varies greatly
