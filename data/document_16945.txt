Ductus venosus. In the fetus, the ductus venosus shunts less than a third of the blood flow of the umbilical vein directly to the inferior vena cava. Thus, it allows oxygenated blood from the placenta to bypass the liver. In conjunction with the other fetal shunts, the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, it plays a critical role in preferentially shunting oxygenated blood to the fetal brain. It is a part of fetal circulation.
Medical Definition of DUCTUS VENOSUS. : a vein passing through the liver and connecting the left umbilical vein with the inferior vena cava of the fetus, losing its circulatory function after birth, and persisting as the ligamentum venosum of the liver.
The ductus venosus, which is situated within the liver parenchyma, is a vascular shunt unique to the fetal and neonatal circulations. In fetal life, the ductus venosus allows variable portions of the umbilical and portal venous blood flows to bypass the liver microcirculation. After birth, when the umbilical circulation ceases, blood flow through the ductus venosus decreases substantially.
ductus venosus, the vascular channel in the fetus passing through the liver and joining the umbilical vein with the inferior vena cava. Before birth it carries highly oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetal circulation.
In the fetal sheep, for example, pressure and resistance differences across the liver are important determinants of the umbilical venous blood flow through the ductus venosus. In addition, ductus venosus blood flow can passively in response to alterations in the systemic circulation.
