6. Bake the Eggs: Transfer the baking dish with the ramekins of eggs to the middle rack of the oven. Bake until the whites are set: 12-15 minutes for runny yolks, 15-18 minutes for soft-cooked yolks, or 20 minutes for hard-cooked yolks. Remove the ramekins with oven mitts and eat immediately with toast for dipping.
All you have to do is set your oven to 350F, grease a muffin tin with non stick cooking spray, and crack your eggs into the tin. Then add some flavor with a little shake of salt and pepper. Bake for about 17 minutes and viola.
