Considered marine birds, penguins live up to 80 percent of their lives in the ocean, according to the New England Aquarium. All penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere, though it is a common myth that they all live in Antarctica. In fact, penguins can be found on every continent in the Southern Hemisphere. It is also a myth that penguins can only live in cold climates. The Galapagos penguin, for example, lives on tropical islands at the equator.

Although penguins are commonly associated with Antarctica, penguins are found in a variety of habitats in the Southern Hemisphere. Eighteen different penguin species inhabit areas from Antarctica to the Equator. Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are flightless seabirds found almost entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. Although their wings have become useless for flight, they have become superbly adapted to swimming and diving.
The Chinstrap Penguin lives around the South Sandwich Islands, South Orkeys, Bouvet Island, Balleny, South Shetland, and Antarctica. The isolated islands and the icebergs found in the sub Antarctic areas including the Antarctic Peninsula is where they live. They tend to avoid areas of heavy ice packs. The feet of the Chinstrap Penguin are very strong. They also have a bill that is short and that is black in color. They survive in water that is much colder than most species of penguins.
Penguin Natural Habitat. The habitat for penguins is going to depend on the type you are talking about. Some of them are able to live in the coldest parts of the world. Others live very close to the equator where it is quite warm. All penguins though reside within the Southern hemisphere. They are found on every single island there.
Chinstrap penguins live in the Antarctic, but are also found in small groups south of New Zealand (near Australia) on the Balleny Islands. They not only eat what’s found in the water, but what they find on shore. The Chinstrap penguins hold the distinction of being perhaps the boldest of all penguin species. The second largest group of penguin species, the Chinstraps are known for their aggressive pursuit of prey.
For the penguin species that live in the Southern Ocean, which encircles Antarctica, global climate change is also having significant impacts. In the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, ocean warming and the melting of sea-ice are linked to the decline of the penguins’ major food supply—Antarctic krill. Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are flightless seabirds found almost entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. Although their wings have become useless for flight, they have become superbly adapted to swimming and diving.
Penguins are torpedo-shaped, flightless birds that live in the southern regions of the Earth. Though many people imagine a small, black-and-white animal when they think of penguins, these birds actually come in a variety of sizes, and some are very colorful. For example, crested penguins sport a crown of yellow feathers. Blushes of orange and yellow mark the necks of emperor and king penguins. In fact, penguins can be found on every continent in the Southern Hemisphere. It is also a myth that penguins can only live in cold climates. The Galapagos penguin, for example, lives on tropical islands at the equator.
