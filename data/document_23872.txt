PV systems reached LCOE between 0.078 and 0.142 Euro/kWh in the third quarter of 2013, depending on the type of power plant (ground-mounted utility-scale or small rooftop solar PV) and average German insolation of 1000 to 1200 kWh / m² per year (GHI). That method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 Eurocent/kWh, from hard coal 8.94 Eurocent/kWh, from natural gas 4.91 Eurocent/kWh, from photovoltaic 1.18 Eurocent/kWh, from wind 0.26 Eurocent/kWh and from hydro 0.18 Eurocent/kWh.
An $18,000 system ($12,600 after the tax credit) that produces 3800 kWh a year in a windy place with 12mph avg. windspeed will produce 76,000 kWh over its 20-year life, for a cost of $0.17 per kWh. That's much more than grid energy, and way more than solar. 
So, for example, if you use 10 kilowatt-hours a day, and the cost of power is about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, then you electrical costs would be about $1 per day (ten times 10 cents), or $30 per month. Also, we need to know how long the sun shines each day on average. Let this be denoted by Tsun, Or, by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000, Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8000/kilo-watt. Thus, as a function of Energy use, the cost of the solar panels will be. Costpanels = Ppeak panels x Costs.p.
On average, a similar value emerges to that of the price experience curve for solar modules. A module that cost US$5-$6 in 2000 costs just $0.50 to $0.60 cents in 2014. (Figure 1: Learning curve for lithium-ion batteries for electric cars in the past, and forecast for the future, as presented at the EU PVSEC.). Decentralized supply cheaper option. If the battery has 80% usable capacity and holds 5,000 cycles, the cost of stored electricity in this evaluation will fall from €0.20/kWh ($0.25) in 2012 to €0.05/kWh ($0.06) in 2030.
To achieve this goal, SunShot works to lower the price of solar electricity to $0.06 per kilowatt hour (KWh) -- a cost target that will make solar-generated power to be fully cost-competitive with traditional energy sources by the end of the decade. Just three years into the initiative, SunShot is making significant headway. Today, the Energy Department announced that the U.S. solar industry is more than 60 percent of the way to achieving cost-competitive utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity.
The chart at the left shows the average cost of electricity for 2014 by consumer group per the EIA (the US Energy Information Administration). For 2014 the average residential cost was 12.50 cents per kilo-watt hour up 3.1% from 2013. Commercial was 10.75 cents and industrial 7.01 cents. Assuming an average 2015 residential electricity price in AZ of $.125 per kWh (excluding taxes and fees) yields a yearly savings of $1,006.25 (8,050 x $.125 not counting future inflation). The monthly savings would then be $83.85 ($1,006.25 divided by 12). This was rounded to $84.00 even
Since SunShot’s inception, the average price per kWh of a utility-scale PV project has dropped from about $0.21 to $0.11. Take a look at the interactive graph above, breaking down the falling cost of utility-scale PV over the past three years. Just three years into the initiative, SunShot is making significant headway. Today, the Energy Department announced that the U.S. solar industry is more than 60 percent of the way to achieving cost-competitive utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity.
The average residential household in the southwest installs a 5 kWh system and during Q1 2015, it cost about $3.40 per DC watt or $17,000 (5000 times $3.40) before incentives. Utilities on the other hand typically install systems in the 100 mega-watt or greater range. Assuming an average 2015 residential electricity price in AZ of $.125 per kWh (excluding taxes and fees) yields a yearly savings of $1,006.25 (8,050 x $.125 not counting future inflation). The monthly savings would then be $83.85 ($1,006.25 divided by 12). This was rounded to $84.00 even
Therefore, the upfront cost of the solar panels per watt are Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8/watt Or, by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000, Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8000/kilo-watt. As determined from a survey of current market prices, it costs about $600 to purchase and install a 75 watt panel. Or, by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000, Costpanels = $600/75 watts = $8000/kilo-watt. Thus, as a function of Energy use, the cost of the solar panels will be. Costpanels = Ppeak panels x Costs.p.
