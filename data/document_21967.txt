Breathing holes located along the sides of insects. The spiracles are connected to the air tubes, or trachea, and allow the insect to exchange gases. The insect can open or close the spiracles by contracting muscles along its side.
Spiracle, spiracleShawn Hanrahan in arthropods, the small external opening of a trachea (respiratory tube) or a book lung (breathing organ with thin folds of membrane resembling book leaves). Spiracles are usually found on certain thoracic and abdominal segments.
In elasmobranch and ganoid fishes a pair of spiracles, derived from the gills, is used as a water passageway during respiration. The nasal opening of whales and other cetaceans is called a spiracle, as is the respiratory opening behind the eyes of rays and skates. In tadpoles the spiracle is the excurrent opening from the gill chamber.
Insects and some more derived spiders have spiracles on their exoskeletons to allow air to enter the trachea. In the respiratory system of insects, the tracheal tubes primarily deliver oxygen directly into the animals' tissues. The spiracles can be opened and closed in an efficient manner to reduce water loss.
Darkfield Digital Image Gallery Insect Spiracles Spiracles, specialized structures featured in the class Insecta, provide the breath of life. While the tracheae constitute the respiratory system of the adult insect, spiracles are the external apertures or openings through which gases are exchanged with the environment.
