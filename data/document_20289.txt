The Zebra is an example of a quadruped. Quadrupedalism or pronograde posture is a form of terrestrial locomotion in animals using four limbs or legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a quadrupedal manner is known as a quadruped, meaning four feet (from the Latin quad for four and ped for foot).
