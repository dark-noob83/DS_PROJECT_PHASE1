Nucleic acids are large organic compounds found in the chromosomes of living cells and viruses. They are strong acids found in the nucleus of the cells. The nucleic acid polymers are with high molecular weights as high as 100,000,000 grams per mole.
Yes, nitrogen is found in nucleic acids in the form of nitrogenous base. Actually, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are linear polymers of nucleotides (a purine or pyrimidine nitro â€¦ genous base + a pentose sugar + a phosphate group).
Properties of nucleic acids are as follows:Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are long polymers made of repeating units of nucleotides. Nucleotide units are made of phosphate-sugar-nitrogenous base units.The nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.
Nucleic Acids and Nucleotides. Nucleic acids, which are relatively strong acids found in the nuclei of cells, were first isolated in 1869. The nucleic acids are polymers with molecular weights as high as 100,000,000 grams per mole. They can be broken down, or digested, to form monomers known as n
1 Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are long polymers made of repeating units of nucleotides. 2  Nucleotide units are made of phosphate-sugar-nitrogenous base units. 3  The nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. 4  Adenine and guanine are purine bases while cytosine and thymine are pyrimidnes.

Nucleic Acids. The third group of macromolecules found in cells contain some of the largest molecules of the body-these are the nucleic acids. There are two major groups of nucleic acids, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) . Each group is composed of long chains of building block molecules known as nucleotides.
