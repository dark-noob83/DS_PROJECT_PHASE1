RS Scripter was written by Jasper Smith, a SQL Server MVP. It was chosen to be included in FineBuild because it enables scripting of Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services catalog items to aid in transferring them from one server to another. If you want to install it with a FULL build, the following parameter should be added at run time: /SetupSQLTools:Yes RS Scripter cannot be installed by FineBuild on a Windows Core operating system because it is supplied in zip file format.
The Scripter object allows programmatic access to scripting settings and is responsible for the following scripting functionality: Finding dependencies. Output script to memory and file. To get Scripter object properties, users can be a member of the public fixed server role. To set Scripter object properties, users can be a member of the public fixed server role. To run a script operation, users require permissions for the objects that are being scripted. Thread Safety. Any public static (Shared in Microsoft Visual Basic) members of this type are safe for multithreaded operations

Scripter uses cascading timelines data-visualization model to track entities involvement in the case. By doing so, a network of entities and incidents relation is automatically generated, allowing the user to roam, zoom and focus on specific data. To resolve these issues and make story-telling workload much bearable, we have created Scripter, a world-class story builder and a visual time-machine. Scripter job does not end by just generating dynamic timelines.
This led to the birth of Scripter, a product that bases its foundation on a simple concept that information describes an occurrence – event or incident – and encapsulates four key elements – Who, What, When and Where – i.e. the 4Ws. To resolve these issues and make story-telling workload much bearable, we have created Scripter, a world-class story builder and a visual time-machine. Scripter job does not end by just generating dynamic timelines.
During data collection, Scripter restructures and organizes the information in project’s containers. It then generates a scalable graphical view of the information by using symbolic graphic objects that represent the; who, what, when and where in the data. To resolve these issues and make story-telling workload much bearable, we have created Scripter, a world-class story builder and a visual time-machine. Scripter job does not end by just generating dynamic timelines.
