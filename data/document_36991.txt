1. Jul 1, '08 by Daytonite. fte is a budgeting term that means full time equivalent. basically, it means one full time worker position. a fte is the number of total hours worked divided by the maximum number of paid hours in a work year. so, if the work year of a full-time employee is 2,080 hours, that would be one fte.
The definition of FTE (full time equivalent) is the number of working hours that represents one full-time employee during a fixed time period, such as one month or one year. FTE simplifies work measurement by converting work load hours into the number of people required to complete that work.
FTE stands for full-time equivalent, which is a way to measure how many full-time employees would be required to perform the work done in a company. For example, many companies have a mix of part-time and full-time employees, and part-time employees can vary widely in the number of hours works.
The term FTE or Full-time Equivalent is used in many contexts, but in particular in the Health Care Reform Law. In this context, an FTE is used to determine the number of employees, both full-time and part-time, for purposes of determining eligibility for employer tax credits. A full-time employee is considered to work 2080 hours a year (52 weeks times 40 hours per week).
An FTE is an employee, or a combination of employees, who work full time, which would be 80 hours per 14-day pay period or for a total of 2,080 hours per year. You can calculate how much any one person consumes of your budgeted FTE allocation by using the following equation:
FTE means Full Time Equivalency. Basically, 80 hrs in a 2 week period = a 1.0 FTE and any less than that is a decimal. Each 8 hr period in 2 weeks = 0.1 FTE. For instance, if you work 4 eight hr shifts a week, you work 0.8 FTE (8 shifts in 2 weeks).
