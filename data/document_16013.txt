In its most general sense, the term Animism refers to belief in souls (anima is Latin for soul): in this sense, animism is present in many religions, including religions that see souls as completely distinct from their bodies and as limited to humans.
Animism is not a religion in itself but a type of belief such as monotheism, polytheism or shamanism. Animism is found in the religions of native people which include Shinto, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Pantheism and Neopaganism.
Question: What is animism?. Answer: Animism is the belief that everything has a soul or spirit, an anima in Latin, including animals, plants, rocks, mountains, rivers, and stars.

Animism is the belief that all things have a spirit or soul, including animals, plants, rivers, mountains, stars, the moon, and the sun. Each being is considered a spirit that can offer help or harm to humans.
Animism (Latin anima meaning ‘soul’) is the belief that within all creatures and objects (natural and manufactured) there exists a soul. This would mean that there are non-human souls, and that these souls are different in nature than the things in which they inhabit. Such animistic beliefs would lead to nature worship.
