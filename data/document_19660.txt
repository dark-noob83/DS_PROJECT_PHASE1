Wegener didn't have an explanation for how continents could move around the planet, but researchers do now. Plate tectonics is the unifying theory of geology, said Nicholas van der Elst, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York.
A continent is what floats on top of the plate. There are continental and oceanic plates. The continents float on the continental plate and the ocean sits on the oceanic plate … . But there are also plates that carry both continents and oceans.
They are actually part of the same theory. Seafloor spreading and subduction are the driving forces of continental drift.   Pangaea was the Earth's only continent 4 bi … llion years ago. Tectonic plates are small plates, while continent drift is several tectonic plates moving as a mass (continent).
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Continental plates are tectonic plates. They are tectonic plates upon which continents rest, and they move as do all tectonic plates. Basically, there is no difference, other than the fact that oceanic plates are another type of tectonic plate.
Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle, the rocky inner layer above the core. The plates act like a hard and rigid shell compared to Earth's mantle. This strong outer layer is called the lithosphere.
There will be others. Find them here. Misconception: The edge of a continent is the same thing as a plate boundary. There is a natural sensibility to Geology’s Theory of Plate Tectonics. Obviously, continents have moved, because of the puzzle-like fit of the continent edges across the Atlantic Ocean.
