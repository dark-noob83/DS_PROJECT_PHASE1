If asbestos is found, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has guidelines for proper removal of asbestos. Ask the asbestos abatement professional for an estimate on how much this will cost. Usually, it is around $2 or $3 per square foot. For instance, if you have a building that has 1,750 square feet and was quoted $2 per square foot for asbestos removal, the cost for this part of the demolition will cost $3,500. Add this price to the amount the professional asbestos inspector charged for the discovery of asbestos. 
1 Some companies might charge a minimum fee of as much as $2,500 or more. 2  Asbestos removal cost for an entire home could be $25,000 to $35,000. 3  Asbestos disposal cost should be included in the initial price quote. Asbestos is a fibrous silicate mineral that, prior to 1980, was used in a wide variety of building materials and other products because of its strength, fire and heat resistance, affordability, and other desirable characteristics.
Ductwork made of asbestos is a major concern because, when it begins to deteriorate, fibers are blown into the house. Talk with an asbestos abatement contractor about removal. Removing ductwork costs from $12 to $25 per lineal foot—from $1,000 to $2,000 for a standard-sized basement. New ductwork is an additional cost. Wrapped ducts should be removed if the wrapping is friable. 
6. Repair = $9 – $15 per square foot (approx. 40% of removal cost). Removal teams are usually composed of two different companies; one that conducts asbestos inspections and one to remove the asbestos. While some companies are able to offer both services, many do not in the interest of conflict of interest. Depending on how small or large the job, your costs should be anywhere from $1500 – $30,000 with most companies dictating set fees for smaller jobs. There are several abatement options that may be offered to you based on your initial inspection; removal, enclosure, encapsulation and repair.
1 Some contractors have a minimum fee of $1,500-$3,000, no matter how small the job is. 2  And a complete removal in a 1,500 square foot home with asbestos everywhere--walls, floors, ceilings, attic, roof, pipes--could be as high as $20,000-$30,000. 1 Have an independent inspector do an initial asbestos inspection; the White Lung Association says this costs $400-$800 for an average 1,500 square foot house, including lab fees; and a re-inspection at the end of the project can be $200-$400. 2  If lab work is done separately, a sample analysis averages $25-$75.
Asbestos Abatement Average Costs. The actual cost of asbestos abatement may vary depending on your location, the size of the job, and other factors. 1  It costs $400 to $500 for professional home asbestos testing. 2  A professional inspection before and after the removal, recommended by some experts, might cost $600 to $1,200. Asbestos is a fibrous silicate mineral that, prior to 1980, was used in a wide variety of building materials and other products because of its strength, fire and heat resistance, affordability, and other desirable characteristics.
1 Removing a 10-foot section of asbestos pipe insulation could be $400-$650. 2  Some contractors have a minimum fee of $1,500-$3,000, no matter how small the job is. 3  And a complete removal in a 1,500 square foot home with asbestos everywhere--walls, floors, ceilings, attic, roof, pipes--could be as high as $20,000-$30,000. 1 Have an independent inspector do an initial asbestos inspection; the White Lung Association says this costs $400-$800 for an average 1,500 square foot house, including lab fees; and a re-inspection at the end of the project can be $200-$400. 2  If lab work is done separately, a sample analysis averages $25-$75.
1 The removal period is an entirely separate process and requires containment of any debris or dust. 2  The average costs vary, but standard removal runs at $15 to $25 per square foot while encapsulation or enclosure of stable asbestos runs around $2 to $6 per square foot; 1 It is hard to simply look at a material in order to know if asbestos is present, and this usually means that a sampling is the first step in the process. 2  The SeattleAsbestosTest.com website indicates that a standard on site sampling will range from $250 to $750.
