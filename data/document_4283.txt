Sarcoptes scabiei or the itch mite is a parasitic arthropod that burrows into skin and causes scabies. The mite is cosmopolitan, meaning can be found in all parts of the world. Other mammals, such as wild and domesticated dogs and cats (in which it is one cause of mange) as well as ungulates, wild boars, bovids, wombats, koalas, and great apes are affected. The discovery of the itch mite in 1687 marked scabies as the first disease of humans with a known cause. The Italian biologist Diacinto Cestoni showed in the 18th century that scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, variety hominis
Itch mites are microscopic insect-like creatures that cannot be seen by the naked eye. There are several different kinds of itch mites in the United States. One type, the oak leaf gall mite, is believed to be responsible for outbreaks of human bites in 2004 in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Texas. Try over-the-counter topical anti-itch creams and oral anti-histamines to control itching. If the itching is intense, or you develop a skin infection, you should contact your health care provider. 1  If you see brown and crusty edges on oak tree leaves, be aware that mite activity is possible.
Anyone can get scabies. It is found all over the world and the mite is transmitted by direct and prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. Sexual contact is the most common way scabies is transmitted. Transmission can also happen from parents to children, particularly mother-to-infant. 
The action of the mites moving within the skin and on the skin itself produces an intense itch that may resemble an allergic reaction in appearance. A delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mites, their eggs, or scybala (packets of feces) occurs approximately 30 days after infestation. Other mammals, such as wild and domesticated dogs and cats (in which it is one cause of mange) as well as ungulates, wild boars, bovids, wombats, koalas, and great apes are affected.

In humans, the bites of the straw itch mite are located almost entirely on the clothed portions of the body. Dermatitis results from reaction to the bites within 24 hours. Humans become infested when they come in contact with straw, grain, or wood. where the mites are present. 
Scabies, known as the seven-year itch, is a contagious skin infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally tiny burrows may be seen in the skin. When first infected, usually two to six weeks are required before symptoms occur. Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites.
There are several types of skin conditions that can cause itching and rashes, and scabies is one of them. Scabies is a dermatologic condition caused by the sarcoptes scabiei mite, an eight-legged microscopic bug.1,2. Scabies spreads very easily from person to person. 1 Symptoms of scabies occur after the mite burrows into the skin, which causes itching and a rash. 2  The cause of the itching experienced in those with scabies is due to the body's allergic reaction to the mite eggs, mites and mite waste. 3  The average person infested with scabies will have 15 to 20 mites present.
Scabies is an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis). The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs. The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a pimple-like skin rash. The scabies mite usually is spread by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. Scabies is found worldwide and affects people of all races and social classes.
