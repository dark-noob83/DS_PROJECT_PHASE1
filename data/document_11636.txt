Many English sounds do not exist or transfer to other languages, so English Language Learners may lack the auditory acuity to “hear” these English sounds and have difficulty pronouncing them.

Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics.

Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.

LEARNING C-SPEAK – THE LANGUAGE OF EXECUTIVES Ideas for selling your learning initiative by targeting your message To successfully get a training initiative up and running, you need to convince a lot of people that your ideas are worth pursuing. They speak a slightly different language. In larger companies, it is sometimes impossible for C-level executives to get involved in the day-to-day operation and minute details of the training department (even though we hear this is a vital component at e-learning conferences).
Short stories have always served many purposes. Some of them provide interesting myths and tales that teach us some facts in history. Others serve as a way to inform the public about a certain culture. Several are simply anecdotes, just like the short story “What Language Do Bears Speak” by Roch Carrier. This story also provides us with many lessons. The lack of communication is used as a vehicle to teach these lessons.
