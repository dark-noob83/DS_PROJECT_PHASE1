According to the National Institutes of Health, the central nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord and nerves. The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons, ganglia (clusters of neurons) and nerves that connect to one another and to the central nervous system.
1 Outside the central nervous system. 2  along the peripheral nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord with the muscles, glands, and sensory organs of the body, there is another type of supporting cell that is similar in many ways to the oligendrocytes.
The nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It is essentially the bodyâ€™s electrical wiring. Structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
The brain sends messages through the spinal cord and nerves of the peripheral nervous system to control the movement of the muscles and the function of internal organs. The basic working unit of the nervous system is a cell called a neuron. The human brain contains about 100 billion neurons.
The nervous system consists of two main parts: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system: 1  The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord.
1 The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. 2  The peripheral nervous system is made up of the nerve fibers that branch off from the spinal cord and extend to all parts of the body, including the neck and arms, torso, legs, skeletal muscles and internal organs.
Neurons. Neurons are the fundamental cellular unit of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Essential features of neurons: 1  The purpose of neurons is to receive, process, and transfer information. 2  This information is made up of chemical or electrical signals.
