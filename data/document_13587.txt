A theory, a story about why things happen, does one other very important thing for us: if you know why things are the way they are, you know what would have to happen to change them. A theory points out where you can find leverage for bringing about social change. Functionalism, on the other hand, does well at explaining continuity, assuming, as it does, that stability is the natural state of society. What it has trouble with is explaining change, why anything ever changes at all. These three general categories of social theory are ideal types.

In sociology, sociological theories are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related. They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to paradigms for analysis and interpretation. Social conflict is the struggle between segments of society over valued resources. From the perspective of social conflict theory, in the West, by the nineteenth century, a small population had become capitalists.
Theories of Society. Society has been explained by different paradigms based in part on underlying ideas about how human beings interact with one another, what they seek in the social setting, and what they have to give up in order to be in a social setting.
