There is as much variety in the types of fruits as in the flowers from which they are produced. In this exercise you will examine the parts of flowers and some of the different types of fruits that are produced by flowering plants.
pollen-the fine spores that contain male gametes and that are borne by an anther in a flowering plant. microspore-smaller of the two types of spore produced in heterosporous plants; develops in the pollen sac into a male gametophyte.
Introduction to different types of spores: Definition of spores: Spore is a single celled reproductive body that grows into a new organism. it is produced by bacteria,fungi,seedless plants and some protozoanâ€™s. Flowerless plants such as ferns and mosses also produce spores. Single spores develop into new organisms.
Many varieties of indoor and outdoor plants produce flowers, pollen and seeds. However, non-flowering plants, such as fungi and broadleaf ferns, are asexual -- some produce spores in order to reproduce themselves. Spores are tiny organisms that live in groups -- they form brown microscopic spots, usually on foliage.
There are two main groups of non-flowering plants. Plants that use spores to reproduce and plants that use seeds to reproduce. The non-flowering plants that use seeds are called gymnosperms. The leaves (needles) of a. non-flowering spruce tree. 1  The leaves of ferns are called fronds.
Plant spores are produced by the organisms we can usually recognize. The major types of plants that form spores are algae, mosses, and ferns. Algae are the simplest of these plants, and can range from tiny, single celled things to large, multi-celled plants that cover your backyard pond.
