Otherwise you will have no friends as there is no way to unsend messages. Joshlyn said: ↑. On the Facebook chat box, you should untick that box that says 'press enter to send' as sometimes it can be easy to send the message to the wrong person or worse send an angry message to 'the right person'.
1 Click on the Messages icon at the top right of any Facebook page. 2  Click on the message or conversation you want to exit. 3  Click on the Options drop-down menu, pictured as a small gear or wheel. 4  Select Leave Conversation.
But once a message is sent, it's sent. While an invite sent out to the wrong friend or an angry rant typed up in the heat of the moment might have you wishing you could take it back, Facebook messages, unlike wall posts, can't be recalled, unsent or deleted from the recipient's inbox.
