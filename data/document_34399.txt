Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible transfer of a phosphate from ATP to fructose-6-phosphate: fructose-6-phosphate + ATP fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + ADP. In part because of the irreversible nature of this step in glycolysis, PFK is the key regulatory enzyme for glycolysis. When ATP levels are high in the cell, the cell no longer needs metabolic energy production to occur. In this case, PFK's activity is inhibited by allosteric regulation by ATP itself, closing the valve on the flow of carbohydrates through glycolysis. Recall that allosteric regulators bind to a different site on the enzyme than the active (catalytic) site
PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition, and in this way, the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cellâ€™s energy requirements. For example, a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis. The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate.
It is an allosteric enzyme made of 4 subunits and controlled by many activators and inhibitors. PFK-1 catalyzes the important committed step of glycolysis, the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate and ATP to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP. Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration, both anaerobic and aerobic. Because phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose-6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP, it is one of the key regulatory and rate limiting steps of glycolysis. For example, a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis. The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate.

Under aerobic conditions, the pyruvate produced in the glycolystic pathway enters the mitochondrion and is converted to acetyl CoA by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase.
ATP activates this enzyme, and ADP inhibits it. Since ATP is a product of glycolysis when ATP is present the cell can activate phosphofructokinase, because if there is enough ATP in the cell, the cell no longer needs to carry out glycolysis. Conversely, if only ADP is present the cell needs to convert glucose into energy, instead of creating more glucose
Allosterically activated by ADP, AMP, or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and allosterically inhibited by ATP or citrate. This protein is involved in step 3 of the subpathway that synthesizes D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and glycerone phosphate from D-glucose. ATP-binding, Magnesium, Metal-binding, Nucleotide-binding.

Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is an important enzyme in virtually all living cells. It performs the committed step in the glycolytic pathway, namely, the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Glycolysis is a pathway that uses glucose to maintain a steady amount of ATP, the major energy carrier in living cells. Phosphofructokinase is a multisubunit protein. In such proteins, the subunits may behave cooperatively; that is, the activity of one subunit influences the activity of all the other subunits. An especially notable example of an allosteric protein is hemoglobin, which is an oxygen-transport protein rather than an enzyme. The activity of an allosteric enzyme such as PFK can be regulated by the binding of a small molecule that acts as an activator or inhibitor.
First: What does phosphofructokinase do? This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of fructose 1-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (It adds a phosphoryl group because it is a kinase) so it is part of the glucose synthesis pathway. The reverse reaction is an irreversible step of glycolysis. Since ATP is a product of glycolysis when ATP is present the cell can activate phosphofructokinase, because if there is enough ATP in the cell, the cell no longer needs to carry out
