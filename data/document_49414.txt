Due to the fact that the 1974 model did not have a V-8 engine available, the 1974 top horsepower was the lowest to date. When the V-8 was added in 1975, the V-8 horsepower stayed virtually the same from 1975 on into the first 3 years of the Fox Body platform (1979 - 1981). It was the same engine that was used in the early Fox Body Mustangs and carried about the same horsepower until 1982. The King Cobra was the only model of the Mustang II to have the 5.0 designation on the outside of the car, it was located on the hood scoop.
1995 was the last 5.0 before the coming of the 4.6 introduced in 1996. More Information: 1993 was the last year of the original FOX Body 1994 and 1995 were the only two year … s that the SN95 Platform housed a 5.0 engine. 1993 Was the first year of the Cobra in quite a while. The cobra has been made all the way through from 1993 till 1999.

This refined car, based on the 2010 Ford Mustang, features 40 more horses, offering up 540 hp and 510 lbs.-ft. of torque. That makes this GT500 one of the most powerful production Mustangs ever.
In the second quarter of 2012, Ford launched an update to the Mustang line as an early 2013 model. The Shelby GT500 has a new 5.8 L supercharged V8 producing 662 hp (494 kW; 671 PS). Shelby and Boss engines came with a six-speed manual transmission. The 1971 Mustang was nearly 3 inches (76 mm) wider than the 1970, its front and rear track was also widened by 3 inches (76 mm), and its size was most evident in the SportsRoof models with its nearly flat rear roofline and cramped interior with poor visibility for the driver.
Ford built 108,344 Mustangs that model year, with 6,961 of them being Cobra coupes and 3,088 Cobra convertibles. Except for redesigned five-spoke wheels on the Cobra, revisions to the 4.6-liter V8 that increased output to 225 horsepower and the usual juggling of colors and trim, the 1998 Mustang carried over from '97. Rated at the same 215 horsepower as the outgoing 5.0, the 4.6 opened a new chapter in Mustang history as the good old small-block Ford V8 was left behind after serving in the Mustang for 31 of the previous 32 model years. In addition, the 3.8-liter V6 was rerated to 150 horsepower.
The Cobra name was first introduced in a Ford line back in 1962 with the Shelby Cobra models of fame and flair. These cars and the 1968 Mustang 428 Cobra Jet, a beast with 335 horsepower, helped establish the Cobra name as a powerhouse on the road. 
Though initially used in the 1994 and 1995 Mustang GT and Cobra, Ford retired the 302 cid pushrod small-block V8 after nearly 30 years of use, replacing it with the newer Modular 4.6 L (281 cid) SOHC V8 in the 1996 Mustang GT. The 1971 Mustang was nearly 3 inches (76 mm) wider than the 1970, its front and rear track was also widened by 3 inches (76 mm), and its size was most evident in the SportsRoof models with its nearly flat rear roofline and cramped interior with poor visibility for the driver.

The Mach 1 body style debuted in 1969 and came standard with a 351 cid V8 but could also be had with the 428 Cobra Jet, which now came in three states of tune.
