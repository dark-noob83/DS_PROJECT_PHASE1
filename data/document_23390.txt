1 Your thermostat in the winter is ideally set to about 69 F or 20 C. This saves on your heating bill and also helps saving the environment. 2  37 degrees Celsius is the equivalent of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or normal body temperature. Celsius, or centigrade, is also a temperature scale that describes temperatures in Celsius degrees (C) and it is used in (almost) everywhere else outside the US. 212 F = 100 C = boiling point of water. 32 F = 0 C = freezing point of water. The conversion formulas between F and C are: [ C] = ([ F] - 32) 5/9
1 A fever in Celsius is a temperature greater than 38 degrees, or the equivalent of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. 2  Also, a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius/102 degrees Fahrenheit is not dangerous in and of itself, although it should prompt the individual to seek medical attention if it persists. Celsius, or centigrade, is also a temperature scale that describes temperatures in Celsius degrees (C) and it is used in (almost) everywhere else outside the US. 212 F = 100 C = boiling point of water. 32 F = 0 C = freezing point of water. The conversion formulas between F and C are: [ C] = ([ F] - 32) 5/9
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally. 
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . 
37 Celsius: Body temperature measurement and unit conversions. 37 °C is a value that one encounters probably more often than any other temperature reading. If you are used to the Celsius scale, you recognize it immediately. Indeed, a normal body temperature of a healthy person is in the vicinity of 37 degrees Celsius, which makes this value so special and important. For the Fahrenheit folks, you may know it as 98.6 °F (as you can easily verify using our online converter). 
The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. This is the longest and most inaccurate way of measuring body temperature, the normal temperature falls at 97.6 °F or 36.4 °C. Rectal temperatures are an internal measurement taken in the rectum, which fall at 99.6 °F or 37.6 °C.
Body temperatures vary, even within humans. The body temperatures of mammals range from around 97° to over 103° Fahrenheit. Birds have average temperatures of around 105° Fahrenheit. The phi point between the freezing temperature (32° F) and the boiling temperature (212° F) of water is 100.8° F, or 38.2° Centigrade. Interestingly enough, if you take the phi point or 0.618 of 37 degrees centigrade, which is the average human body temperature, you get 23 degrees centigrade or 73 degrees Farenheit, a “room” temperature that many would consider to be just about perfect for indoor comfort and outdoor enjoyment.
Bird Body Temperatures. Birds are warm-blooded animals that have a much higher metabolism, and thus higher body temperature, than humans. While the exact measurement varies for different bird species, the average bird’s body temperature is 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). Most birds can lower their body temperature by a few degrees, but torpid birds have lowered their body temperatures by as much as 50 degrees. Torpor can be a dangerous behavior, however, as the reduced temperature also leads to reduced reactions and greater vulnerability to predators.
The normal temperature inside your child’s body is usually around 37 degrees Celsius. Your child has a mild fever if their temperature is higher than 38 degrees Celsius. A high fever usually means more than 39 degrees Celsius.
