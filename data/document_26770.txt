Shingles is the reactivation of a viral infection in the nerves to the skin that causes pain, burning, or a tingling sensation, along with an itch and blisters in the skin supplied by the affected nerve. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus[1] , or VZVâ€”the same virus that causes chickenpox.
Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a virus that causes nerve roots near the spinal cord to become inflamed. This inflammation causes painful blisters on the skin, typically in a band on the chest and abdomen. They may also occur around the eyes, or on the face, arms, thighs or neck.
The technical name for shingles is herpes zoster. If you happen to know Greek, you're one step closer to knowing what and why shingles happens. Zoster is Greek for girdle, describing how the blisters girdle the body; and herpes means virus.
A virus causes shingles-the same one that causes chicken pox in children. After a childhood outbreak of chicken pox, the virus may remain sleeping in nerve roots near the spine. Later, if resistance to infection is weakened by stress, lack of sleep, illness or injury, the virus may be reactivated to cause shingles.

Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpes virus family. The same virus also causes herpes zoster, or shingles, in adults. Chickenpox is extremely contagious, and can be spread by direct contact, droplet transmission, and airborne transmission.
Shingles is a viral infection medically known as Varicella (herpes) zoster. The word shingles probably comes from the Latin cingulum, meaning belt or girdle; zoster is the Greek word for belt.
