Here's a tip: The value of a coin laundry has nothing to do with the seller's asking price. It is irrelevant! The value of a Laundromat, as with any business, is a multiple of its net income. In the self-service laundry business, the average multiple is between 4 and 5.5 times the yearly net income. There are several factors that go into determining the multiplier.

Employees add to your overhead costs but allow you to offer additional profit-generating services, such as laundry drop-off. 70% of laundromat business investors employ 0-2 attendants.
