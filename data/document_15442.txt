Best Answer: Cytoplasm is the semi-fluid substance that fills the space between the nucleus and the cell membrane. It holds all of the organelles in suspension. The Cytoskeleton is what holds the organelles in place, or moves them.
Cytoplasm is the fluid in a typical cell, that holds all the cell mechanisms (called organelles). It's the site where most activities occur and contains liquid called cytosol.it's contained by the cell membrane. The cytoskeleton is basically the structure that holds the cytoplasm together. hence the name.
Posted on. (Answer #1). Cytoplasm is the jelly-like material found inside all cells. It is mostly water, and it provides a place for the cells essential chemical reactions to take place. It also helps support the organelles, like the nucleus and mitochondria, The cytoskeleton is the skeleton of the cell.
Cytoskeleton is a set of long, thin fibers that contained in the eukaryotic cytoplasm, and it has many membrane-enclosed organelles. There are at least three important roles about cytoskeleton: Cytoskeleton maintains cell shape and support.
The cytoskeleton and cytosol are structural elements that help provide the cell with its structure. The cytoskeleton is composed of protein filaments and is found throughout the inside of a eukaryotic cell. The cytosol is the main component of the cytoplasm, the fluid that fills the inside of the cell. The cytoplasm is everything in the cell except for the cytoskeleton and membrane-bound organelles.
Answer by Neodarwinian. Confidence votes 22.6K. No, the cytoplasm is the cell contents between the membrane and the nucleus; organelles and liquid. The cytoskeleton is a frame work and also an internal highway of the cell that is made of microtubules.
