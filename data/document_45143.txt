accessory muscle of respiration, any of the muscles of the neck, back, and abdomen that may assist the diaphragm and the internal and external intercostal muscles in respiration, especially in some breathing disorders or during exercise.
The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration (normal/relaxed breathing), assisted by the intercostals. No accessory muscles should be recruited during normal respiration unless there is a respiratory disorder. During quiet inspiration, the diaphragm and intercostals are activated.
