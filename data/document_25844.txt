The Institute of Medicine encourages all women to consume at least 130 grams of carbohydrates each day. A womanâ€™s individualized carbohydrate needs are based on her recommended calorie requirements, weight management goals and physical activity level.
1 First you figured out how many calories you need to eat per day for your specific goal (losing fat, building muscle, or maintaining your current weight). 2  From there you figured out where those calories should come from each day by calculating your ideal daily intake of protein, fat and just now, carbs.
Percent of Calories. According to the Institute of Medicine, children and adults should consume 45 to 65 percent of their calorie intake as carbohydrates, and at least 130 grams of carbs per day.
Athletes should not dip below about 250 grams of carbohydrates a day and should strive to get about 50 to 60 percent of daily calories from carbohydrates, advises Iowa State University Extension. This equates to about 3 to 5 grams of carbohydrate per 1 pound of body weight.
This means women following 1,200-calorie weight loss diets need about 135 to 195 grams of carbs each day, women consuming 1,600-calorie diets need 180 to 260 grams, women following 2,000-calorie diets need 225 to 325 grams and women consuming 2,400 calories per day require 270 to 390 grams of carbohydrates each day.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs.
Daily Recommendations. About 45 to 65 percent of your calories should come from carbohydrates. This equates to about 900 to 1,300 calories from carbohydrates or about 225 to 325 grams of carbohydrates each day if you normally consume around 2,000 calories. Most adults should avoid dipping below 130 grams of carbohydrates per day, as this small amount is what you would need to support basic body functions.
