Temperate deciduous forests receive 30 - 60 inches of rain each year and are ranked second only to the rainforest as the rainiest biome. Although the average temperature is 50° F, the winter typically sees temperatures below freezing. The trees of the temperate deciduous forest are deciduous of course.
Following rainforests, temperate deciduous forests are the second-rainiest biome. The average yearly precipitation is 30 - 60 inches (75 - 150 cm). This precipitation falls throughout the year, but in the winter it falls as snow. The average temperature in temperate deciduous forests is 50°F (10°C).
Climate is a mix of temperature and precipitation. Deciduous forests have almost 14 inches of rain in the winter months and more than 18 inches of rain in the summer. I hope you enjoyed my report on the climate of a deciduous forest and that you learned a few things from it.
