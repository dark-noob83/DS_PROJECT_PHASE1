Termites damage approximately 600,000 homes in the U.S. each year. Nationwide, the cost for termite control measures and repairs for damage totals about $5 billion annually. This figure includes prevention methods to help reduce the likelihood of termite infestations and treatment for existing infestations.
According to Turner Pest Control, many home insurers do not cover the cost of termite treatment. Treatment can be expensive depending on where you live, what kind of termites you have, and how bad the infestation is. It can cost anywhere from $500-$4,000. The construction of your home can differ the cost as well.
Termite prevention and treatment methods are quite cost effective when compared to the cost of repairing termite damage. On average, a homeowner will spend $3,000 to repair termite damage, not including the cost of treatment to control the infestation.
Ft. x .84 cents per Ln. ft. (Termidor cost based on $50 per bottle) = $201.60 for the treatment. When you have a termite company treat your home you will receive a guaranty against future infestations and an annual inspection. When you do it yourself you donâ€™t receive a guaranty and you have to inspect your own house every year.
Figuring a termite treatment cost on an existing home infested with native species subterranean termites is a bit more involved. In the Phoenix area the average price to treat a home runs between $1.75 to $3.00 per linear foot.
This treatment can protect your home from subterranean termites for up to 10 years! Subterranean termites are the one of the most damaging termites and cost homeowners in the U.S. $4.5 billion dollars in treatments and prevention every year. The termite treatment cost is significantly less when you do it yourself.
