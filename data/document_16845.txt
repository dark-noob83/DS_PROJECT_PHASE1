The low-intensity tumor of a pathologic clivus tended to be hypointense relative to the pons (17/19), and was completely devoid of foci of bright signal intensity. The normal adult clivus was approximately isointense relative to the pons on T2-weighted images.
A clivus of very low signal intensity (signal void) on T1- or T2-weighted images was always abnormal. The clivus with marrow reconversion was uniformly hypointense relative to the pons on T1-weighted images and isointense relative to normal marrow on T2-weighted images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).
Clival tumors were found to enhance intensely. A clivus of very low signal intensity (signal void) on T1- or T2-weighted images was always abnormal. The clivus with marrow reconversion was uniformly hypointense relative to the pons on T1-weighted images and isointense relative to normal marrow on T2-weighted images. The intensity patterns of the normal clivus on T1- and T2-weighted MR images change predictably with advancing age. Intensity patterns of abnormal clivi differ from those of normal clivi. When contrast material is used, normal and abnormal clivi generally show different patterns of enhancement.
Normal bone marrow signal of the clivus. Dr Yuranga Weerakkody ◉ and Dr Frank Gaillard ◉ et al. Bone marrow signal of the clivus changes predictably with age and is well assessed with midline T1 non-fat saturated, non-contrast images. As is seen in the rest of the body the proportion of yellow (fatty) marrow increases with age. Knowledge of these changes allows diagnosis of the abnormal clivus.
The clivus is a bone of the central skull base formed from the basisphenoid and the basiocciput. During normal ageing, the clival marrow converts from haematopoietic with low-to-intermediate T1 signal to fatty high T1 signal. Low T1 signal in adults is a marker of disease.
