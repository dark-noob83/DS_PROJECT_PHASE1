What is an SOC? A somewhat common outcome in a domestic violence assault case is for the defendant to enter into what is known as a Stipulated Order of Continuance (SOC). In an SOC, the defendant enters into a contractual agreement with the state or city government that is prosecuting the case. The second is that it would constitute a whole crime called Violation of a No Contact Order. If entering into an SOC, always try to negotiate the NCO out of the agreement or at a bare minimum, set up as part of the SOC a timeline in which the NCO can be removed.
Short for system-on-chip, a chip that holds all of the necessary hardware and electronic circuitry for a complete system. SoC includes on-chip memory (RAM and ROM), the microprocessor, peripheral interfaces, I/O logic control, data converters, and other components that comprise a complete computer system. Applications include digital cameras, cellular phones, set-top boxes, PDAs, and uses in nanotechnology and medical technology.

Given the multiple interdependent programs that rely on the SOC, this is best accomplished by timing revisions of the SOC for the years following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) revisions, which occur for years ending in 2 and 7. 2018 SOC Revision Process. The revision schedule is designed to minimize disruption to data providers, producers, and users by promoting simultaneous adoption of revised occupational and industry classification systems for those data series that use both.

When it is not feasible to construct a SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a system in package (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single package. In large volumes, SoC is believed to be more cost-effective than SiP since it increases the yield of the fabrication and because its packaging is simpler. The AMD Geode is an x86 compatible system on a chip. A system on a chip or system on chip (SoC or SOC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that integrates all components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip. It may contain digital, analog, mixed-signal, and often radio-frequency functions—all on a single chip substrate
