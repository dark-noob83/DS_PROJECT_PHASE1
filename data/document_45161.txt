Signal Peptide Search Engine. Signal peptides. The properties of the amino acids that constitute the signal peptide region of a protein are the significant factors determining interaction with the protein transport system, hence the destination to which that protein is delivered. Different classes of signal peptide are used to specify different cellular placement.
It binds to the signal peptide. The SRP binds to the signal peptide as soon as it is synthesized and extruded from the ribosome. This causes a pause in protein synthesis, most probably allowing the ribosome-SRP complex time to bind to the SRP receptor on the target ER membrane.
Best Answer: A signal peptide is a short (3-60 amino acids long) peptide chain that directs the transport of a protein. Signal peptides may also be called targeting signals, signal sequences, transit peptides, or localization signals. There is some confusion relating to the precise meaning of the term 'signal peptide'. Some sources refer to signal peptides as only the pre-sequence that targets the propeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and through the secretory pathway. Used in this way it does not refer to 'transit peptides'.
Signal peptide. A signal peptide is a short peptide present at the N-terminus of the majority of newly synthesized proteins that are destined towards the secretory pathway. These proteins include those that reside either inside certain organelles, secreted from the cell, or inserted into most cellular membranes.
