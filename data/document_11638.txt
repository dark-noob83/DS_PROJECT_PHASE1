Both gas and electric stoves are in essentially the same price range, depending on the brand and model. Generally, you'll spend $650 to $2,800 for an electric stove, and $800 to $2,300 for a gas stove, according to Consumer Reports. 
gas vs. electric oven usage cost. I know most people have a preference for using either gas or electric ovens. For those of you shopping for a new or used one to purchase, I thought I'd point out the basic costs of running them so you can weigh out the pros and cons using your local electricity or gas costs. So an oven that is rated at 11,000 watts uses 11 Kilowatts per hour or 11 KWH. The electric company bases their charges on KWH, mine is $.057/KWH. That means my electric oven costs 11 x $.057 = $.63 per hour to run. Propane and Natural Gas ovens are rated in BTU/hour (here anyway). My LP oven uses 60,000 BTU per hour. It takes approximately 1 gallon of propane to burn 90,000 BTU. So my oven uses (60,000/90,000) .67 of a gallon of propane to run for 1 hour. Since propane cost me $2.19 per gallon, my running cost per hour is .67 x $2.19 = $1.46 per hour
On average, gas ovens cost around £9 a year to run, whereas electric ovens cost around £44 a year, so installing a gas oven gives you an annual saving of £35. A microwave, for instance, can offer a cheaper way to cook than by oven, and sometimes cheaper than a hob. Halogen ovens (pictured below) also make bold claims about the amount of energy they save. They can roast a chicken in 30 minutes and use 75pc less electricity than a conventional electric oven.
The gas used by pilot lights is substantial. At $1.40/therm, you're looking at $183/yr. to run the pilots in a furnace and a water heater, not even counting a stove. Pilots could easily account for over 70% of summer gas usage, and 40% of total usage. (Dept. of Energy) Like gas, the cost of electricity varies by location. Don't assume the state rates are accurate for you, because rates vary even within a state. I have more info about electric costs on our cost of electricity page.
While gas ovens cost less to operate than electric ovens, gas ovens cost about 50 percent more than electric units in terms of upfront costs, says Aclara Technologies, a utility communications company. In addition, gas ovens require access to commercial gas lines. At the average price of $0.164 per kWh of electricity in California as of January 2013, a 1,500 watt oven costs $0.25 to operate for one hour each day. This equates to an annual operating cost of $89.80.
A gas stove uses propane, butane, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas or other flammable gas as fuel, while an electric stove uses electricity to heat coils (or flat-top surfaces like glass-ceramic cooktops). Gas stoves are usually more expensive to buy but cheaper during use compared with electric stoves. Not only are gas stoves more energy efficient but gas is also usually cheaper than electricity, which results in operational cost savings.
A gas stove which uses electronic ignition instead of a pilot light uses 30% less gas and is more cost efficient than an electric stove. The cost of a GE standard 30” free-standing electrical range is $799 whereas that of a GE 30” free standing gas range with similar features is $3,299. Although the gas range costs more, it can work out to be cheaper in the long run if the gas price in your state is low. Gas stoves are usually more expensive to buy but cheaper during use compared with electric stoves. Not only are gas stoves more energy efficient but gas is also usually cheaper than electricity, which results in operational cost savings.
To calculate the operating cost of an 18,000 BTU oven, for example, divide 18,000 by 100,000 to get 0.18. As of January 2013, the average price per therm of natural gas in California is $0.93, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Assuming you use your 18,000 BTU oven for one hour each day, the operating cost per day is $0.17 (0.18 times $0.93 times 1), or $61 per year. At the average price of $0.164 per kWh of electricity in California as of January 2013, a 1,500 watt oven costs $0.25 to operate for one hour each day. This equates to an annual operating cost of $89.80.
