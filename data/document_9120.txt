12) Acetoacetic esters can also be used to add groups to the terminal carbon through use of a dianion. OC 2 H 5 O O 2 eq. KNH 2 in liquid NH 3 OC 2 H 5 O O The terminal anion always reacts first. The internal anion can react with a second equivalentof electrophile or just protonate with water.1) RX2) H 2 O OC 2 H 5 O OR 13) Diesters can be used very similiarly to the above synthesis(#8) to create substituted acids.
Although the terms reactant and reagent are often used interchangeably, a reactant is more specifically a substance that is consumed in the course of a chemical reaction. Solvents, although they are involved in the reaction, are usually not referred to as reactants. When purchasing or preparing chemicals, reagent-grade describes chemical substances of sufficient purity for use in chemical analysis, chemical reactions or physical testing. Purity standards for reagents are set by organizations such as ASTM International or the American Chemical Society.
For instance, reagent-quality water must have very low levels of impurities such as sodium and chloride ions, silica, and bacteria, as well as a very high electrical resistivity. When purchasing or preparing chemicals, reagent-grade describes chemical substances of sufficient purity for use in chemical analysis, chemical reactions or physical testing. Purity standards for reagents are set by organizations such as ASTM International or the American Chemical Society.
General structure of a Gilman reagent. A Gilman reagent is a lithium and copper (diorganocopper) reagent compound, R 2 CuLi, where R is an organic radical. These are useful because they react with organic chlorides, bromides, and iodides to replace the halide group with an R group. This is extremely useful in creating larger molecules from smaller ones. In the reaction depicted below, the Gilman reagent is a methylating reagent reacting with an alkyne in a conjugate addition, and the negative charge is trapped in a nucleophilic acyl substitution with the ester group forming a cyclic enone. Gilman reagents have complicated structures in crystalline form and in solution.
Reagents, such as sulfur (pictured), are the starting materials that are used in chemical reactions. A reagent /riˈeɪdʒənt/ is a substance or compound that is added to a system in order to bring about a chemical reaction, or added to see if a reaction occurs.. When purchasing or preparing chemicals, reagent-grade describes chemical substances of sufficient purity for use in chemical analysis, chemical reactions or physical testing. Purity standards for reagents are set by organizations such as ASTM International or the American Chemical Society.

Reagent Definition: A reagent is a compound or mixture added to a system to cause a chemical reaction or test if a reaction occurs. The term reagent is often used in place of reactant, but a reagent may not necessarily be consumed in a reaction like a reactant.
