The amount of energy you'll get from carbohydrate, protein and fat is measured in calories per gram. Fats have the most energy and proteins have the same amount as carbohydrates, but their value as a source of energy is determined by more than the calories gained from one gram. Other factors, such as your activity level and diet, impact which macronutrient is used for energy.
Fats. Wikipedia, 13 May 2004. Fat is one of the 3 main classes of food, and approximately 38 kJ (9 cal) per gram, as compared to sugar with 17 kJ per gram or ethanol with 29 kJ per gram, the most concentrated form of metabolic energy available to humans.. 38.0 MJ/kg. Collins, Anne. Fats. 2003. Fat is a high calorie food.
Sugar is a source of carbohydrate and energy. It provides 4 calories per gram or 16 calories in a level teaspoon (4 g). This compares to 36 calories for the same amount (4 g) of fat or oil (e.g., butter, margarine, canola oil). On its own, sugar has no other nutrients.
Multiply the total grams of sugar from step 2 by four to get the total calories from sugar, because there are 4 calories per gram of sugar. For example, there are 32 calories in 8 grams of sugar, which equals 2 teaspoons.
Honey, brown sugar, white sugar and maple syrup all have similar nutritional values. All are composed of glucose, fructose, and/or sucrose in varying amounts, provide a similar amount of energy (approximately 4 Calories per gram), and contain insignificant amounts of vitamins and minerals.
