In the image we can see the output from our PWM when our duty cycle is either 10%, 30% or 90%. When we are outputting a 10% duty cycle, we are sending 5V to our load (the lamp) for 10% of the whole period and 0V for the remaining 90% of the period. This means that, over the full period, the average voltage is 0.5V.
Figure 1a shows a PWM output at a 10% duty cycle. That is, the signal is on for 10% of the period and off the other 90%. Figures 1b and 1c show PWM outputs at 50% and 90% duty cycles, respectively. These three PWM outputs encode three different analog signal values, at 10%, 50%, and 90% of the full strength.
PWM is a technique used to relay data in the form of a varying pulse width. You may be already familiar with binary, 1's and 0's; where a 1 is represented as 'on' and a 0 as 'off'. An example of this would be a light switch. Turning the switch on would indicate a 1, off a 0.
PWM. Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off.
Guide to PWM and PPM PWM and PPM are two common words used in the R/C industry. PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation and PPM stands for Pulse Position Modulation. Some devices that use PWM for control are ESC's (electronic speed controls) and servos.
To PWM, or not to PWM, That is the Question. Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a fancy term for describing a type of digital signal. Pulse width modulation is used in a variety of applications including sophisticated control circuitry. A common way we use them here at SparkFun is to control dimming of RGB LEDs or to control the direction of a servo motor.
