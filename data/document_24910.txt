A Dr. Deborah Raines, MSN, Nursing, answered on behalf of Honor Society of Nursing (STTI). It is common for a woman’s body temperature to change during pregnancy. During pregnancy the woman's body generates additional heat due to: 1  Increased metabolism. Simultaneously the woman has increased peripheral circulation which leads to dissipation of heat from the body. Therefore it is not unusual that the combination of these factors lead to pregnant women feeling HOT yet having a measured body temperature within the normal range.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. the average temperature for a pregnant woman is 0.5 to 1.5 degrees higher than her normal body temp. so, if your normal is 98.6, your pregnancy temp could be 99.1-100.1. A woman gets pregnant when she ovulates. If her cycle is 28 days, ovulation is USUALLY around day 12-17 (The first day of bleeding is d … ay 1) Ovulation lasts about 3 days. Ovulation predictor kits are available in drug stores and can tell her
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . 
Yes | No Thank you! It's not uncommon for body temp to elevate from what your normal pre-pregnancy temp was. Elevated levels of progesterone, combined with an increased metabolism, will raise your body temp a little during the entire pregnancy. Temps higher than 100.4 F should be reported to your Dr. For temps 102 F or higher, go to the emergency room. I am 14 weeks pregnant. My temp before i got pregnant was usually around 98 or 98.6 sometimes a little lower but now that im pregnant i check my temp everyday around noon and its been anywhere from 99.3 to 99.8 but im also sick right now.
Basal body temperature (BBT) is the lowest body temperature attained during rest (usually during sleep). It is usually estimated by a temperature measurement immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken. This will lead to a somewhat higher value than the true BBT (see Fig. 1).

Is it normal that women who are pregnant have a slightly higher body temperature than non pregnant women? I been kinda sick and was worried. I had 98.7 on the thermometer by mouth and I thought that you usually add 1 to it so that would have been 99.7 but wanted to know if this was a normal temperature while pregnant?
