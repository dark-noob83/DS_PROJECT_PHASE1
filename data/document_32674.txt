Magnets are objects that produce magnetic fields and attract metals like iron, nickel and cobalt. The magnetic field's lines of force exit the magnet from its north pole and enter its south pole. Permanent or hard magnets create their own magnetic field all the time.
Magnets are materials that produce magnetic fields, which attract specific metals. Every magnet has a north and a south pole. Opposite poles attract, while like poles repel. While most magnets are made from metals and metal alloys, scientists have devised ways to create magnets from composite materials, such as magnetic polymers.
Magnets attract to ferrous metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, certain steels and other alloys. Brass, aluminum, copper, and most stainless steels, however, are non ferrous.
Magnets strongly attract materials (like iron) which already themselves have magnetic domains. They do not significantly attract many metals like gold, aluminum, silver, and even some types of high-chromium stainless-steel, which lack such domains. In fact, pure gold is slightly repelled.
The main ferromagnetic metals are iron, nickel, and cobalt. The uncommon element gadolinium is magnetic. These form alloys that are also magnetic, such as steel. The rare-earth elements neodymium and samarium can also form magnetic alloys, and neodymium magnets are among the most powerful of permanent magnets. *The element titanium is not ferromagnetic.
Iron, nickel, cobalt and gadolinium are the easiest to magnetize. Metals like aluminum and copper can be magnetized also, but the magnetic fields they produce are very weak. Oxides and alloys that have iron in them can also be magnetized easily, such as rust and steel.
