Here are some estimates of weight... New, unused or uncirculated copper cents weigh about 3.11 grams each or about 145 copper pennies per pound. New zinc cents are much lighter and weigh only 2.5 grams each yielding about 180 zinc pennies in a pound. And there are about 80 uncirculated quarters in a pound. Those numbers of pennies per pound are of course for new, uncirculated, zinc or copper cents. When minted, new copper cents weigh about 3.11 grams each and new zinc cents about 2.5 grams each and that is our basis for the number of
So there are about 180 zinc cents / pennies per pound. Those numbers of pennies per pound are of course for new, uncirculated, zinc or copper cents. When minted, new copper cents weigh about 3.11 grams each and new zinc cents about 2.5 grams each and that is our basis for the number of pennies in a pound. However, once they are put in circulation, they start to ware thinner and thinner
To calculate a partial roll of coins, enter a decimal value in the appropriate text box. For example, a value of 1.5 will equal 1½ rolls of coins. Do take into account the number of coins in a particular coin roll. A value of 1.5 in a dime roll text box would equal 75 total dimes, since there are 50 dimes in a roll. A value of 1.5 in a quarter roll text box would equal 60 total quarters, since there are 40 quarters in a roll.
If your penny has a date before 1982, it is made of 95% copper. If the date is 1983 or later, it is made of 97.5% zinc and plated with a thin copper coating. Pennies made after 1983 weigh 2.5 grams. One pound of pennies weigh 453.6 grams. It would take 181.4 pennies to equal one pound. Pennies made from 1959 to 1982 weigh 3.11 grams so it would take 145.7 pennies from this era to make a pound. BTW: There are 50 pennies in a roll of pennies, so the entire roll would weigh a little over 4 ounces.
