The pancreatic acini form ducts that produce and secrete pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct and into duodenum of the small intestine. In the small intestine pancreatic juice help to digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats and play a role in creating a normal ph in
Pancreatic juice secretion is regulated by the hormones secretin and cholecystokinin, which is produced by the walls of the duodenum upon detection of acid food, proteins, fats and vitamins.
1. Proteases Digestion of proteins is initiated by pepsin in the stomach, but the bulk of protein digestion is due to the pancreatic proteases. Several proteases are synthesized in the pancreas and secreted into the lumen of the small intestine.
Some of the enzymes that are found in pancreatic juice include trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, lipase and amylase. These enzymes are important for digestion.
Pancreatic secretion consists of an aqueous bicarbonate component from the duct cells and enzymatic component from the acinar cells. A clear alkaline secretion of the pancreas containing enzymes that aid in the digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and close to the duodenumâ€”the first part of the small intestine. The pancreas secretes digestive juices, or enzymes, into the duodenum through a tube called the pancreatic duct.
Pancreatic juice is composed of two secretory products critical to proper digestion: digestive enzymes and bicarbonate. The enzymes are synthesized and secreted from the exocrine acinar cells, whereas bicarbonate is secreted from the epithelial cells lining small pancreatic ducts.
The pancreas contains exocrine glands that produce enzymes important to digestion. These enzymes include trypsin and chymotrypsin to digest proteins; amylase for the digestion of carbohydrates; and lipase to break down fats. When food enters the stomach, these pancreatic juices are released into a system of ducts that culminate in the main pancreatic duct.
(April 2012). Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase.
