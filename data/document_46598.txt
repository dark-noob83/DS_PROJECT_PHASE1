Temperature can be used to slow down growth. 60 F will cause growth to be reduced about 1/4 compared to 70 F. 50 F to 65 F = this is the beginning of cold stress. Tomato plants in this range grow slowly, often produce anthcyanins (turn purple), and become pale green from loss of chlorophyll function.
When growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, daytime temperatures in the summer can be a problem, but temperatures cannot exceed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). If they do, you'll need to open the doors and ventilate to reduce the temperature.
Many tomato plant problems are caused by improper greenhouse temperatures. The problems from temperatures being too cold include slow leaf growth and reduced leaf size. Both problems can affect plants' ability to make food via photosynthesis.
Heating. If the proper temperature is not maintained within the greenhouse, the tomatoes will fail to produce. You should plan on keeping the greenhouse above 60°F, but below 90°F. In most areas, this will require some heating during cold weather.
The growing temp for tomato seedlings should be maintained at constant temps of between 58-60 degrees F. (14-16 C.), whether starting in the greenhouse or indoors, and then not transplanted until the last frost has passed.
Highest daytime temperature. When growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, daytime temperatures in the summer can be a problem, but temperatures cannot exceed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). If they do, you'll need to open the doors and ventilate to reduce th
Most tomatoes are warm season plants and should only be planted after the danger of frost has passed. Tomato temperature tolerance for extreme heat or cold snaps is of extreme importance to the development of blossoms and subsequent fruit set. Blossom drop will occur in the spring if daytime temperatures are warm but night temps drop below 55 degrees F. (13 C.).
