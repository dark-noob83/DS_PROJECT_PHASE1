Adenine is a key component in adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When adenine attaches to a ribose molecule and a chain of three phosphates, ATP is formed. ATP is an important molecule for life because it captures energy from food. All living organisms use ATP as their primary energy carrier.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide that consists of an adenosine and a ribose linked to three sequential phosphoryl (-PO32-) groups via a phosphoester bond and two phosphoanhydride bonds. ATP is the most abundant nucleotide in the cell and the primary cellular energy currency in all life forms.
Its Structure. The ATP molecule is composed of three components. At the centre is a sugar molecule, ribose (the same sugar that forms the basis of RNA). Attached to one side of this is a base (a group consisting of linked rings of carbon and nitrogen atoms); in this case the base is adenine.
ATP consists of adenosine and is composed of an adenine ring, ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups (triphosphate). The groups of the phosphate group are usually called as the alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) phosphates. It is typically related to a monomer of RNA called adenosine nucleotide.
1 Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) : a nucleotide composed of adenine, the sugar ribose, and three phosphate groups; involved in energy metabolism and required for RNA synthesis. 2  It exists in cells in a form of high-energy phosphate bond to store and transport chemical energy.
An adenine molecule bound to a deoxyribose, a sugar, is known as deoxyadenosine. An adenine bound to ribose, also a sugar, is known as adenosine, a key component in Adenosine Triphosphate. When adenosine attaches to three phosphate groups, a nucleotide, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is formed.
