Singapore is located in the middle of a geographical region that’s rich in dragonflies. Through a two-year survey from 2008-2010, NParks conducted an intensive survey of dragonflies in several parks all over Singapore, and found some parks to be exceptionally rich in dragonfly diversity. One of these is Bishan Park. Bishan Park contains three ponds, which harbour up to 33 species of dragonflies – almost a quarter of the 124 known species recorded from Singapore. In fact, most of the common Singapore dragonflies can be found in this park, especially in the lotus plant pond near Upper Thomson Road.
Bishan Park is one of Singapore’s most popular parks in the heartlands of Singapore with more than 3 milllion visitors to the park annually.
Bishan Park Water Playground. Went to check out the Bishan Park Water Playground yesterday morning. It was a 10-15 min walk to reach, and I wanted to kill myself for not going to my in law's place to get her Quinny Zapp Xtra. In the end, I'm the one who did a 20-30 min walk carrying a 10kg load, ugh.
As one of the largest urban parks in central Singapore, Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is a great place for families to have a fun day out.

History. The Kallang River is the longest river in Singapore and flows for 10 kilometres through the centre of the island from the Lower Peirce Reservoir to Marina Reservoir. In the 1960s and 70s, concrete drains and canals, including Kallang River along Bishan Park, were built to alleviate widespread flooding.
