For dividends that do not meet the above criteria, the effective qualified dividend tax rate is determined by the date on which the dividend was paid and the individual's ordinary income tax bracket. Qualified dividend. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Qualified dividends, as defined by the United States Internal Revenue Code, are ordinary dividends that meet specific criteria to be taxed at the lower long-term capital gains tax rate rather than at higher tax rate for an individual's ordinary income.
In the U.S. a qualified dividend is a type of dividend to which capital gains tax rates are applied. These tax rates are usually lower than regular income tax rates. In contrast, ordinary dividends that do not qualify for this tax preference are taxed at an individual's normal income tax rate. Qualified dividends are subject to the 0% rate for taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets. For taxpayers in the 25%, 33% and 35% tax brackets, the tax rate on qualified dividends is 15%. For 2013 and beyond, a 20% rate applies if the regular tax rate is 39.6%.
BREAKING DOWN 'Qualified Dividend'. Ordinary dividends that do not qualify for this tax preference are taxed at an individual's normal income tax rate. In order to qualify: 1. The dividend must have been paid by an American company or a qualifying foreign company. 2. The dividends are not listed with the IRS as dividends that do not qualify. 3.

The Big Difference. A qualified dividend is a type of dividend that is taxed at the capital gains tax rate. Generally speaking, most regular dividends from U.S. companies with normal company structures (corporations) are qualified. For individuals, estates, and trusts, qualified dividends are taxed at the current capital gains rate of 15%. For individuals whose income tax rate is 10% or 15%, then the capital gains tax rate is zero.

Generally speaking, most regular dividends from U.S. companies with normal company structures (corporations) are qualified. For individuals, estates, and trusts, qualified dividends are taxed at the current capital gains rate of 15%. Non-qualified dividends do not qualify for the lower tax preference and are thus taxed at an individual's normal income tax rate. Regardless of your tax bracket, this difference means you will pay significantly higher taxes on a non-qualified payout.
A qualified dividend is a corporate distribution that meets certain criteria set forth by the Internal Revenue Service to qualify it for capital gains treatment. This means that anyone receiving a qualified dividend will pay the much lower capital gains rate on that dividend, rather than the normal tax rate. The tax rate paid on ordinary dividends received is the same as the tax rate for ordinary income, while the tax on qualified dividends has ranged in recent years from 0% to 15%, depending on the recipient's tax bracket.
