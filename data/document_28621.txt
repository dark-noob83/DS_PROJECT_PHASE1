USCIS does not give an exact time period for when you should expect to receive your green card in the mail after the interview, but it should not take more than 60 days. Before the actual card comes, USCIS will send you a welcome notice. The welcome notice should come in the mail within 30 days after your interview.
Usually, the whole process takes about 1 to 1.5 years for an EB-5 investor to get a conditional green card. It takes about 6 to 8 months to receive approval of an I-526 investor petition.
If you are in the United States, you can apply for the Green Card with the USCIS. If not, you will have to apply for the same in the Embassy or Consulate in your country of residence. The same will take anywhere between 9 to 12 months. Overall, the investment-based Green Card will take around 15 to 18 months. The document that you will get at the end of this period will be a conditional Green Card. In order to remove these conditions, you will have to file the I-829 petition, but only after 2 years.
The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) lists its processing time for the I-526 application for a conditional green card as 4-6 months. You should be filing your I-829 application to remove conditions 2-3 years after you receive your conditional green card.
The current processing time is longer than before. For the I-526 petition, the average processing time is 8 months. After the I-526 is approved, if an investor is in lawful status in the U.S., he/she can apply for Adjustment of Status (I-485) to conditional Permanent Residence with USCIS.
