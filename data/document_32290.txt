Don’t rush to move your child to a booster seat before they’re ready. Each time you “graduate” your child to the next seat, there’s a reduction in the level of protection for your child. Keep your child in each stage for as long as possible.
Keep your child in a forward facing seat until at least 40 pounds and 40 inches. Children who are very large may not be ready to move into booster seats at a young age and may need to be harnessed until they mature. Look for seats that can be harnessed up 50 – 60 – 85 or even 100 pounds.
8 - 12 Years. Keep your child in a booster seat until he or she is big enough to fit in a seat belt properly. For a seat belt to fit properly the lap belt must lie snugly across the upper thighs, not the stomach. The shoulder belt should lie snugly across the shoulder and chest and not cross the neck or face.

Children who have outgrown forward-facing car seats are ready to use a booster seat if they are less than 4 feet 9 inches tall and weigh between 40 and 80 pounds (18-36kg). Putting your child in a seatbelt before he is big enough puts him at risk for serious injury or death in a crash.
