1 First, check the label for instructions. 2  It should be labeled 'fully cooked' or 'cook before eating.'. 3  Preheat the oven to 350°F. 4  If the ham is labeled 'fully cooked' (does not require heating), heat for 8 to 10 minutes per pound, or to an internal temperature of 140°F.
1 275°F-Bake for 20 minutes per pound (about 2 to 2 1/2 hours total). 2  350 °F-Bake for 10 minutes per pound (about 1 to 1 1/2 hours total). 3  The ham is ready when it has reached an internal temperature of about 120°F to 140°F.

5 Place ham in oven. Cook for about 1 1/2 hours (check after 1 hour, will take longer if the ham is not at room temp to begin with), or about 10 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature of the ham is 110°-120° (use a meat thermometer).
1 For a whole 10- to 15-pound ham, allow 18 to 20 minutes per pound; for a half--5 to 7 pounds--about 20 minutes per pound; or for a shank or butt portion weighing 3 to 4 pounds, about 35 minutes to the pound. 2  In all cases, cook uncovered until the internal temperature reaches 160°F.
Cook until the ham reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F. Remove from oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 15 to 20 minutes. NOTE: Cutting into the meat too early will cause a significant loss of juice.
1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. 2  To heat the ham, place it on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and bake uncovered. 3  For a whole ham, allow 15 to 18 minutes to the pound; for a half, 18 to 24 minutes per pound. 4  The ham will be ready when the internal temperature reaches 140°F.
