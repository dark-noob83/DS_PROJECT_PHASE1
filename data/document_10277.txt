When you’re sick, mucus can be a master of mayhem. But quick, long-lasting chest congestion relief is just a dose away — with Mucinex ® extended-release bi-layer tablets that start in 8 minutes and last for 12 hours.*. Regular strength Mucinex 1  ® : Relieves chest congestion.
I have used the regular strength Mucinex (600 mg) 12 hour formula and it worked great and would highly recommend it. BUT, the maximum strength is so strong that it completely dried out my whole nasal passage and I could not breathe through my nose. Also, when I cough, it burns my chest because it is so dry.
I don't use regular guaifenesin because it doesn't last long enough, but Mucinex 12-hour does work for me. I take it most nights, and mornings when house is very dry. It loosens the mucus.
How to use Mucinex D. Take this medication by mouth with or without food, usually every 12 hours with a full glass of water or as directed by your doctor. If stomach upset occurs, take with food or milk. If you are self-treating, follow all directions on the product package.

Mucinex D extended release tablets contain a combination of guaifenesin and pseudoephedrine. Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It helps loosen congestion in your chest and throat, making it easier to cough out through your mouth. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose). Mucinex D tablets are used to treat nasal and sinus congestion.
