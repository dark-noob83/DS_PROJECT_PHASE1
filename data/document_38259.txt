Mud Cloth. This fabric is made by the Bamana people of Mali. The ground fabric is woven of hand spun cotton yarn in narrow strips on the mans double-heddle loom. The cloth is then dyed yellow and the design applied with river mud. This 'saddens' the yellow, turning it dark brown.
Using the process of making mud cloth is an engaging way of teaching and learning about Mali and other West African countries. Mud cloth is hand-woven and hand-dyed cloth, with patterns of symbols that tell a story, teach lessons, and are an integral part of life for the people of Mali. Mud cloth is usually made in the village, with men weaving long strips of cotton, followed by women painting a design of symbols on the mud cloth. To make mud cloth, the cloth is first soaked in a mixture made from leaves and water to prepare it to take the mud dye.
The first step in making the cloth is to set it in a fixative solution made from tea. The mud designs are then hand-painted and the tea sets into the fabric. Mud used to make mudcloth is usually mixed with water and set aside for about a year.
