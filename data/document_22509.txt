In Europe, since the mid-1990s about 125 large solar-thermal district heating plants have been constructed, each with over 500 m 2 (5400 ft 2) of solar collectors. The largest are about 10,000 m 2, with capacities of 7 MW-thermal and solar heat costs around 4 Eurocents/kWh without subsidies. Of the 21,000,000 square feet (2,000,000 m 2) of solar thermal collectors produced in the United States in 2007, 16,000,000 square feet (1,500,000 m 2) were of the low-temperature variety. Low-temperature collectors are generally installed to heat swimming pools, although they can also be used for space heating.
In my earlier article, I estimated that a residential solar thermal system with two 4' by 8' collectors and a solar storage tank with a capacity in the range of 80 to 120 gallons costs between $8,000 to $10,000 to install. DIY PV is also cheaper by a large factor, same as with solar thermal. FYI, it is hard to find HPWH for less than ~ 1600$CAD in Quebec, (Stiebel sales for 3000$+) whereas i can find a first quality 6 years warranty 60gal for ~ 350$.
The tax credits offered by the federal government for a solar thermal system are equal to 30 percent of the cost of the equipment, up to $2,000. Many states offer tax credits for these systems, which are usually 15 to 25 percent, up to $1,000. This can reduce the cost of your solar thermal installation by as much as one-third the original price.
The cost of a complete solar thermal system with two panels usually falls between $8,000 and $10,000. This may seem like a steep price, but if you are going to be living in your home for several years, it may be the cheapest long-term heating solution. Many states offer tax credits for these systems, which are usually 15 to 25 percent, up to $1,000. This can reduce the cost of your solar thermal installation by as much as one-third the original price.
Solar Thermal (also called Solar Hot Water). Solar thermal systems capture the sun’s energy to heat water and are one of the most cost-effective renewable energy systems. They are used to heat hot water tanks and/or a heating system. A solar pool heating system is another type of solar thermal system designed specifically to heat a pool or hot tub. 
Solar thermal energy (STE) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing solar energy to generate thermal energy or electrical energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors. Of the 21,000,000 square feet (2,000,000 m 2) of solar thermal collectors produced in the United States in 2007, 16,000,000 square feet (1,500,000 m 2) were of the low-temperature variety. Low-temperature collectors are generally installed to heat swimming pools, although they can also be used for space heating.
Solar thermal (ST) is one of the most cost-effective renewable energy systems. Solar thermal water heating systems collect the sun's energy in the form of thermal or heat energy. The system can save a major portion of your utility bill. 1 This solar thermal system will cost about $4,600 US (with the price decreasing all the time). 2  A solar pool heater, popular and practical, is an open loop system. 3  It's called this because water circulates back into the pool, which is (of course) an open system.
A typical residential solar PV panel system in the U.S. costs $3.60/watt after installation, and the solar panels typically save the customer over $20,000 (net) over the course of 20 years. Learn more about the many advantages of solar energy. 
A solar thermal water heating system can pay for itself in three years or less. Typically, these cost under $5,000, and can reduce your monthly hot water heating bill between 50 - 100%. Learn more about solar thermal energy systems. A solar energy system big enough to power a computer and a few other small items might cost you about $700 to $1000. These are also well suited for RVs, boats and camping. Learn more about portable solar energy units.
To estimate the annual operating cost of a solar water heating system, you need the following: 1  The system's solar energy factor (SEF). 2  The auxiliary tank fuel type (gas or electric) and costs (your local utility can provide current rates). Including the price of a solar water heater in a new 30-year mortgage usually amounts to between $13 and $20 per month. The federal income tax deduction for mortgage interest attributable to the solar system reduces that by about $3–$5
