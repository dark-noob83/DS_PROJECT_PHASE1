(This is because hyperthyroidism caused by pituitary hypersecretion of TSH is very rare.). The symptoms of hyperthyroidism in Graves disease are related to the effects of thyroid hormone on metabolism and cardiac function. Because thyroid hormone increases basal energy expenditure, there is increased heat production and individuals will become heat intolerant. As diagrammed in the figure, when there is less T3 and T4, there is reduced negative feedback inhibition of secretion of the tropic hormones, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone; released by the hypothalamus) and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone or thyrotropin; released by the anterior pituitary).
Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are produced that bind to the TSH receptor. As diagrammed in the figure, when there is less T3 and T4, there is reduced negative feedback inhibition of secretion of the tropic hormones, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone; released by the hypothalamus) and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone or thyrotropin; released by the anterior pituitary).
Graves' disease, also known as toxic diffuse goiter and Flajani-Basedow-Graves disease, is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid. It frequently results in hyperthyroidism and an enlarged thyroid. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea, and weight loss.
BACKGROUND. One of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism is Graves’ disease, an autoimmune process in which the patient’s immune cells make antibodies against the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor on the thyroid gland cells. These antibodies can either turn on the thyroid (Graves’ disease, hyperthyroidism) or turn it off (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, hypothyroidism). Goiter: a thyroid gland that is enlarged for any reason is called a goiter.
ABBREVIATIONS & DEFINITIONS. Autoimmune thyroid disease: a group of disorders that are caused by antibodies that get confused and attack the thyroid. These antibodies can either turn on the thyroid (Graves’ disease, hyperthyroidism) or turn it off (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, hypothyroidism). Hypothyroidism: a condition where the thyroid gland is underactive and doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone. Treatment requires taking thyroid hormone pills. Thyroiditis: inflammation of the thyroid, most commonly cause by antibodies that attack the thyroid as seen in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and post-partum thyroiditis. It can also result from an infection in the thyroid. Thyroid Ultrasound: a common imaging test used to evaluate the structure of the thyroid gland.

Throughout the world, the most common thyroid disorders are iodine deficiency disorders. In the United States and Canada, the use of iodized salt has eliminated iodine deficiency disorders, and the most common thyroid disorders are the autoimmune diseases Graves disease and Hashimoto s thyroiditis. As diagrammed in the figure, when there is less T3 and T4, there is reduced negative feedback inhibition of secretion of the tropic hormones, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone; released by the hypothalamus) and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone or thyrotropin; released by the anterior pituitary).
The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis (HPT axis for short, aka thyroid homeostasis or thyrotropic feedback control) is part of the neuroendocrine system responsible for the regulation of metabolism. As its name suggests, it depends upon the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormone exerts negative feedback control over the hypothalamus as well as anterior pituitary, thus controlling the release of both TRH from hypothalamus and TSH from anterior pituitary gland.
Background. Hyperthyroidism, thyroid storm, and Graves disease are conditions of excess thyroid hormone. The elevated level of thyroid hormones can result in clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severely toxic with resultant morbidity and mortality for affected patients. Graves disease. Graves disease (diffuse toxic goiter), the most common form of overt hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune condition in which autoantibodies are directed against the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor.
