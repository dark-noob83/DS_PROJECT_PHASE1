An incubator or brooder is designed to bring normal room temperature to the desired temperature. Room temperature of 60 degrees F. or below will reduce the temperature in the incubator. Room temperature changes of 10 degrees or more will change the temperature in the incubator. The automatic turner must be removed from the incubator or the eggs must be moved to a separate incubator for hatching. Do not attempt to hatch eggs while the turner is in the incubator, as the slow turning egg racks could crush the chicks. Lay eggs on wire floor with small end pointed slightly down.
