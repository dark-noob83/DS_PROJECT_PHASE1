For example, dry whole red moss had no effect on bacteria, whereas other treatments of red moss did, and all treatments of green mosses did. Mold grew on some agar plates that contained red moss, possibly causing competition between bacteria, and skewing results for Experiment 2. However, we did find that. found that Bacillus licheniformis is a type of bacteria that can cause feather degradation in birds. B. licheniformis is also known to be gram positive, meaning that moss and lichen used in a nest could have possible bacteria-inhibiting benefits for birds. The absence of significance in some types was interesting.
Moss is a bryophyte, and is thus neither a bacteria or a fungus, but a rather primitive form of plant. 8 people found this useful. Edit.

MO Bacter is unique as a moss eliminator because moss does not go black but is digested by the bacteria. Lawns are left free of debris and there is no need to scarify. Grassed areas will be fed evenly over a three-month period. It is harmless to animals and wildlife and will not damage border plants. Moss dies from an excess of potassium within a few weeks but leaves no black debris. The dead moss is then digested by the bacteria in MO Bacter (npk: 5-5-20). The bacteria in MO Bacter becomes active when the soil temperature reaches 10degC. As you can see from our pictures, a moss-infested lawn was treated on April 25 - and by May 16 the grass was clear of moss. . . with debris gone
Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Sphagnum moss has also been used for centuries as a dressing for wounds, including through World War I. Since it is absorptive and extremely acidic, it inhibits growth of bacteria and fungi, so it is used for shipping seeds and live plants.

The bacteria-fighting mechanism of sphagnum mosses is not entirely clear, but some have suggested that it may be related to the moss’ uronic acids, which are believed to be what gives sphagnum its bacteria-inhibiting properties (Clymo 1963). Others suggest that it may be due to its acidic properties (Stalheim et al. found that Bacillus licheniformis is a type of bacteria that can cause feather degradation in birds. B. licheniformis is also known to be gram positive, meaning that moss and lichen used in a nest could have possible bacteria-inhibiting benefits for birds.

Moss is fungus, because it belongs to the fungi kingdom, it is also a decomposer because it breaks down all the dead substances around it. 21 people found this useful.

Constructed like a big sponge, sphagnum moss tends to retain the water and by releasing hydrogen ions, maintains the high acidity. One result is that the bacteria which normally breakdown plant matter can't thrive and the dead sphagnum moss accumulates, eventually forming peat.
