Base rent is the amount of money you pay to lease your space and it is specified in your lease. It is generally stated as a whole dollar amount (e.g. $30,000 per annum) or as dollars per square foot (e.g. 1,500 square feet at a rate of $20.00 per square foot). For example, if a building is 100,000 square feet and you occupy 1,500 square feet, your proportionate share is 1.5%. That means you will pay 1.5% of the total operating and tax bill for the building as additional rent.
Market Rates. In some cases, you will pay a set monthly fee for a store, warehouse or other business space that’s already configured and ready to go.

Divide that amount by your usable square footage to calculate your actual price per usable square foot. For example, if the rentable square footage is 1,130 and the price is $1 per square foot, your monthly lease amount is $1,130.
