in the atmospheric greenhouse effect the type of surface that sunlight first encounters is the most important factor forests grasslands ocean surfaces ice caps deserts and cities all absorb reflect and radiate radiation differently these gases water vapor carbon dioxide methane ozone and nitrous oxide are referred to as greenhouse gases albedo has an important influence on the earth s temperature greenhouses are structures designed to retain heat
behind the struggle to address global warming and climate change lies the increase in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere a greenhouse gas is any gaseous compound in the atmosphere that is capable of absorbing infrared radiation thereby trapping and holding heat in the atmosphere by increasing the heat in the atmosphere greenhouse gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect which ultimately leads to global warming 
greenhouse gas nitrous oxide chemical symbol n2o about generated by burning fossil fuels in the manufacture of fertilizer and by cultivation of soils greenhouse gas perfluorocarbons chemical symbol various compounds about human made chemicals a by product of aluminum smelting also a by product of burning fossil fuels oil coal and biomass as well as land use changes and various industrial processes greenhouse gas methane chemical symbol ch4 about occurs naturally other sources are landfills coal mines paddy fields natural gas systems and livestock
the earth s atmosphere contains trace gases some of which absorb heat these gases water vapor carbon dioxide methane ozone and nitrous oxide are referred to as greenhouse gases albedo has an important influence on the earth s temperature greenhouses are structures designed to retain heat
greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect refers to circumstances where the short wavelengths of visible light from the sun pass through a transparent medium and are absorbed but the longer wavelengths of the infrared re radiation from the heated objects are unable to pass through that medium the action of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in trapping infrared radiation is called the greenhouse effect it may measurably increase the overall average temperature of the earth which could have disastrous consequences
global warming is the increase of earth s average surface temperature due to effect of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels or from deforestation which trap heat that would otherwise escape from earth this is a type of greenhouse effect 
the primary greenhouse gases in earth s atmosphere are water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone without greenhouse gases the average temperature of earth s surface would be about 15 c 27 f colder than the present average of 14 c 57 f a greenhouse gas sometimes abbreviated ghg is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range this process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect
