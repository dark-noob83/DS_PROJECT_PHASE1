The Starr Piano Company produced numerous lines of pianos under these names: Starr, Jesse French, Cumberland, Duchess, Gennett, Minum, Trayser, Royal, Pullman, Remington, Coronado, and Richmond pianos. The music industry dynasty of Jesse French and his connection with Starr and Gennett begins with his father-in-law John Lumsden. Lumsden was born in Southhampton, England in 1824, and moved to America in 1842. He married in 1848 and thereafter had three daughters.

Stark control Jesse French. The Jesse French pianos that were manufactured during the control of P.A. Stark had serial numbers that started with 161500 in 1955, and the last year of manuf. under this control was 1965 with serial numbers starting with 195000. The Jesse French & Sons piano company, in 1948 (pre-P.A. Stark Control), started the serial numbers this year with 180000. I know this is a bit confusing, but it could easily be a 1948 or a 1964 manufacturing date since there were duplications of serial numbers, depending on which year it was made
John Lumsden had involved himself with the Starr Company long before Jesse French did, and it was probably he who brought Starr and French together. Upon Starr Piano's incorporation in 1893, Lumsden's third son-in-law, Henry Gennett, entered the picture.

Forum: 11,843. Votes: 299. this sn shows 1946 date. unless you have a recent date piano called jesse french that has been made by Marantz or other companies. the 46 date is the original french catalog of sn. IF it is 20 years old, still i do not know the size (height) in feet and inches. Regardless of the date the '46 model would be just a few hundred and if you have a 20 year old piano built in 1992. If a 52' uipright and if it plays and tune well, it could be about $1000 + or-depending on how it plays and tunes. these type of pianos do not hold value. If you had a yamaha u3, 52 in 1992 it would sell for $4000 + all day long.

Guest. I have a 1875 Jesse French and Sons upright piano, serial number 71883. In good condition, 1 key is flat, no missing keys, a few scratches on the case. I have a French & Sons upright piano with serial# 92509 just wondering how old its is and if its worth anything. It is in tune and very minor scratches no missing parts.
