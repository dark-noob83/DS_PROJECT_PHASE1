Best Answer: The letters indicate the physical state of the substance: The (s) is solid, the (l) is liquid, the (g) is gas and the (aq) is aqueous [dissolved in water]. Source(s): http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/reactions/. Matti · 7 years ago. Thumbs up. 1.
The state symbols in brackets show the physical state of the substance at the reaction temperature. Solid (s), liquid (l), gas (g), or dissolved in water (aq). aq is called aqueous which comes from the Latin word aqua meaning water. If you do not know the state of a substance see melting and boiling points. If the melting point is above the reaction temperature, the substance is solid (s).
aq stands for an aquious solution. (An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant formula.
One method of describing a physical or a chemical change is with a chemical equation. For chemical equations, symbols written in parenthesis can be used to indicate the changes in the physical state of substances. In such equations, (aq) means in aqueous solution, (s) is for solid, (l) is for liquid, and (g) is for gas.
