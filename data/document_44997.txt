Thread Pitch Chart. Thread series cover designations of diameter/pitch combinations that are measured by the number of threads per inch (TPI) applied to a single diameter. Coarse Thread Series (UNC/UNRC) is the most common designation for general application bolts and nuts. 
Definition of DIAMETRAL PITCH. : a ratio equal to the pitch diameter of a gear in inches divided by the number of teeth in the gear. ADVERTISEMENT. This word doesn't usually appear in our free dictionary, but the definition from our premium Unabridged Dictionary is offered here on a limited basis
Pitch Diameter is one of the most important inspections for nearly any thread. In the past, pitch diameter was ignored as long as the ring or plug gage threaded. Now, using Gagemaker gages, you have more control over threading connections of marginal quality. The ball pitch diameter gages or “GO/NO GO” gages indicate the pitch diameter size of the product’s external thread. The gages are adjustable within a size range and use interchangeable contact points to measure different pitch threads.
Each H limit represents 0.0005 inches over basic pitch diameter. The best way to visualize the differences in screw thread classes of fit is shown on the bar graph in Figure 2. This example shows the pitch diameter limits for ¼-28 UNF internal and external standard threads. Metric threads use a different system for pitch diameter tolerances. And, this system is a bit more complicated than that used for inch threads. The tolerance class consists of a tolerance grade and tolerance position. We will focus on the pitch diameter tolerances to keep it simple. Typically there will be a number and letter following the thread size to designate the class of fit. On inch sizes, the number 2 or 3 expresses the class of fit, and the letters “A” or “B” designate external or internal threads respectively.
10 most extreme places on Earth. Pitch diameter is a term used to take measurements of the diameter of a gear or a screw using pitch points. Pitch points on a gear could be found if a straight line were drawn up from two of the gear's teeth located side by side and the two lines were connected by a curve. Pitch diameter measurement is used to help people find the right screws for a certain job. Pitch diameter is particularly useful if you are in need of replacement screws. Putting the wrong ones in could cause problems, so it's important to match them up with the old ones.
The ball pitch diameter gages indicate the pitch diameter size of the product’s external and internal threads. The gages are adjustable within a size range and use interchangeable contact points to measure different thread forms and pitches. The ball pitch diameter gages or “GO/NO GO” gages indicate the pitch diameter size of the product’s external thread. The gages are adjustable within a size range and use interchangeable contact points to measure different pitch threads.
In a screw, the pitch diameter, or thread pitch diameter, is found by measuring the tread's major and minor diameter. The pitch of a gear basically measures the distance between the teeth.

5. PITCH DIAMETER-The basic thread pitch diameter is the diameter where the thread thickness is equal to the space between the threads. If the flats at the top and bottom of the thread are the same, the pitch diameter will coincide with the middle of the sloping side of the thread. 8. BEST SIZE WIRES. * Wires which touch the thread at the pitch diameter are known as “Best Size” Wires. Such wires are used because the measurements of pitch diameter are least affected by errors that may be present in the angle of the thread. The diameter of the measuring wires is represented by the letter G.
