Not all Full Body MRI Scans are created equal. Our Radiologists have assembled unique equipment for generating and reviewing images to advance the field of diagnostic imaging with Advanced Cancer Detection Techniques. Our full body MRI machine, unlike other MRI machines currently available, produces images comparable to a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scanner, without the radiation. Diffusion Weighted Imaging with Background Suppression (DWIBS) is able to distinguish a tumor in normal looking tissue.

Report Abuse. I heard about $1900 dollars for full body mri testing. Does she have insurance because the most of the cost may be covered under certain insurances. I want my mom to get one too but then again we are already hypochondriacs...so it'll just make matters worse! Josh C Â· 6 years ago. Full body MRI scans are VERY expensive. They range into the thousands. It's not something you should really get Just to be safe unless you have exhausted other options, or can afford it.
An alternative to a full-body CT scan may be Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. MRI scans are generally more expensive than CT but do not expose the patient to ionizing radiation and are being evaluated for their potential value in screening. Controversy arises from the use of full-body scans in the screening of patients who have no signs or symptoms suggestive of a disease. As with any test that screens for disease, the risks of full-body CT scans need to be weighed against the benefit of identifying a treatable disease at an early stage.
A full-body scan is a scan of the patient's entire body as part of the diagnosis or treatment of illnesses. If computed tomography (CAT) scan technology is used, it is known as a full-body CT scan, though many medical imaging technologies can perform full-body scans.

An full body MRI is the same type of test that can be done to any other part of the body. However, most of the time and MRI is done on a specific part, such as the head or abdomen. Depending on the condition and symptoms, a full body MRI may be necessary for some people. 1 You can check out Comparemricost.com for a list of MRI costs in various locations in the United States. 2  Costs vary depending on the testing facility location. 3  Here, the average cost of an MRI ranges around $1,694 to $3,624.
