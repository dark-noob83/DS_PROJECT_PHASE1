A common bankruptcy myth is that it takes seven (7) years after filing bankruptcy before you can get new credit. This is simply untrue. Any kind of bankruptcy can be reported on your credit for up to ten (10) years but this does not mean that you canâ€™t obtain new credit during the ten (10) year period. How soon after filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy can you buy a new house? Our experience has been that it takes two years after your discharge in order to get a decent mortgage.
