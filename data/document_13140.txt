No. Cooked potatoes left out overnight are not safe to eat.
1 Cooked potatoes can be left out uncovered for about two to four hours before bacteria gets to them, but it is still best to cover them when cooling. 2  Boiled potatoes can be left in the water they were cooked in while refrigerated. 3  Cover the pot to let it cool down; then put it in the refrigerator.
Place the potatoes in the fridge overnight. They will usually be good for at least two to three days, without a significant change in taste. They may last longer, but it is best to eat them within a few days after placing them in the fridge.
