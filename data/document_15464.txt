There are several types of synapses in the body. The most commonly discussed type is the chemical synapse, but other types of synapses include electrical synapses and immunological synapses. Because chemical synapses are the most commonly discussed synapses in general, that's probably what this question is referring to.
The Synapse. Neurons have specialized projections called dendrites and axons. Dendrites bring information to the cell body and axons take information away from the cell body. Information from one neuron flows to another neuron across a synapse. The synapse contains a small gap separating neurons. The synapse consists of: 1  a presynaptic ending that contains neurotransmitters, mitochondria and other cell organelles. 2  a postsynaptic ending that contains receptor sites for neurotransmitters. 3  a synaptic cleft or space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic endings.
synapse. the junction between the processes of two neurons or between a neuron and an effector organ, where neural impulses are transmitted by chemical means. The impulse causes the release of a neurotransmitter (e.g. acetylcholine or norepinephrine) from the presynaptic membrane of the axon terminal.
axodendrosomatic synapse one between the axon of one neuron and the dendrites and body of another. axosomatic synapse one between the axon of one neuron and the body of another. dendrodendritic synapse one from a dendrite of one cell to a dendrite
A synapse is a connection which allows for the transmission of nerve impulses. Synapses can be found at the points where nerve cells meet other nerve cells, and where nerve cells interface with glandular and muscular cells. In all cases, this connection allows for the one-way movement of data.
