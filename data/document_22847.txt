The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is defined as the area of 1 chain (22 yards) by 1 furlong (220 yards), which is exactly equal to 1⁄640 of a square mile, approximately 4,046.856 m 2, or about 40% of a hectare. One acre equals 0.0015625 square miles, 4,840 square yards, 43,560 square feet or about 4,047 square metres (0.405 hectares) (see below).
A standard acre as described above was one chain (66 feet) wide by ten chains (660 feet) long, or ten square chains. Before the age of pocket calculators and computers, surveyors used chain measure to measure land because it simplified the calculations. The length and width of a rectangular tract of land could be measured using a chain measure with the area expressed in square chains. Since there are ten square chains to an acre, the conversion from square chains to acres could be done mentally.
