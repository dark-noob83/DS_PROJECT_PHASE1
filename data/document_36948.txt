The Pueblo are natives of the Southwest deserts, particularly New Mexico. (The Hopi live in Arizona, while the Ysleta del Sur Tigua live in Texas .) Unlike many Native American tribes, the Pueblo Indians were never forced to leave their homelands and are still living there today. Though the Pueblo Indians all have closely related cultures, they do not all speak the same language. The Hopi language is a Uto-Aztecan language, distantly related to the language of the Aztecs. The Zuni language is a language isolate, not related to any other living language.
