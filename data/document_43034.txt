Assuming an electric heater with 100 percent efficiency, homeowners should expect to pay roughly $34.32 per million BTUs of heat. Natural gas is generally sold in therms, where one therm is equal to 100,000 BTUs. The EIA reports that one therm costs about $1.01 as of November 2012. Qualitysmith.com estimates the cost of a new electric furnace at $1,000 to $1,500 as of December 2012. Electric space heaters can be found for much less at most home improvement stores.
1 It would cost an average of £ 1800 per year for using electric combi boiler for supplying hot water as well as heating the house based on boiler size. If they require moving and it requires extra plumbing as well as fresh wiring, it will cost more money to you. Those who want a top range boiler for nearly £ 2000, it will cost them another £ 2000. Average cost of electric Combi boiler is approximately £ 1500 for 9kW model.
In colder climates heating is required 6 to 8 months of the year, with a furnace running 4 hours a day during the colder months. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of an electric furnace using 18,000 Watts for 2 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Running 2 hours a day is the same as running 4 hours a day for 6 of the colder months when a furnace is typically used. Cost Per Hour: Cost Per Day: 
The furnace itself usually costs $1,000 to $1,500, while labor adds an additional $1,000 to $2,000. Very high-efficiency models can cost $5,000 or more to buy and install. Removal and haul away of the old furnace usually costs $300 to $1,000, depending on size and difficulty. As with boilers, a new chimney liner for a high efficiency unit will cost anywhere from $500 to $1,500, with liners for gas units priced on the lower end of that range and liners for oil units on the higher end. No matter which type of boiler you buy, the unit’s energy efficiency rating has the greatest impact on price. Each type is available in varying efficiencies. Removal and haul away of your old boiler can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1,5
Assuming a furnace with a 78 percent efficiency, consumers should expect to pay roughly $12.96 per million BTUs of heat. While prices for gas and electricity vary over time and by region, gas furnaces typically cost much less to operate than electric furnaces or heaters. Qualitysmith.com estimates the cost of a new electric furnace at $1,000 to $1,500 as of December 2012. Electric space heaters can be found for much less at most home improvement stores.
1 Installing a standard boiler (80%-85% annual fuel utilization efficiency) typically costs about $2,500-$5,000 for a gas-fired model and $3,000-$6,500 for an oil-fired unit (generally used in areas without municipal gas lines). 1 Replacing an old oil-fired boiler with a gas model can cost thousands of dollars more than replacing one oil-fired unit with another, because of the need to install new gas lines and to update the existing fittings, valves, piping system and other parts to work with the new boiler.
1 Thermosave.co.uk with average costs of electricity per kW hour explains that boilers running costs for 210 litre Thermaflow electric combi boiler will cost £ 2025. 2  It is dependent on total of 13500kW at the 15 pence every kW. If they require moving and it requires extra plumbing as well as fresh wiring, it will cost more money to you. Those who want a top range boiler for nearly £ 2000, it will cost them another £ 2000. Average cost of electric Combi boiler is approximately £ 1500 for 9kW model.
As of March 2013, it costs $34.57 to generate one million BTUs of heat using electric baseboard heating, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This same million BTUs costs $14.39 using an electric heat pump, or $7.33 via a standard gas furnace. If you only need to heat one or two rooms in your home, electric baseboard heaters could serve as a cleaner and cheaper means of heating than whole-house heating systems.
Equipment Costs. The average price for a new gas furnace ranges from around $2,300 to $3,000 depending on manufacturer according to a November 2012 article by Consumer Reports. Qualitysmith.com estimates the cost of a new electric furnace at $1,000 to $1,500 as of December 2012. Electric space heaters can be found for much less at most home improvement stores.
Boilers are more expensive than furnaces. Mid-efficiency boilers cost anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000, while high-efficiency boilers run $5,000 to $10,000. Those prices include installation, but keep in mind that installing a boiler is more expensive than installing a furnace because the process is more complex. No matter which type of boiler you buy, the unit’s energy efficiency rating has the greatest impact on price. Each type is available in varying efficiencies. Removal and haul away of your old boiler can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1,500, depending on size and difficulty.
