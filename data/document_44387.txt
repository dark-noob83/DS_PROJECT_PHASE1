A Force Gauge is a measuring instrument used across all industries to measure the force during a push or pull test. Applications exist in research and development, labor … atory, quality, production and field environment. Newton meter measures energy E. A Newton measures force. A Nm (Newton Metre)is also the unit used to measure TORQUE which is the twistin … g energy available if a force of 1Newton was acting at a radius of 1metre on the end of a shaft. A Newton is equal to 0.102 Kilogram
A force can be a push or a pull. It is not something you can see or touch, but can see it in action. Forces can be measured using a device called force meter. The unit of force is called the newton. It is represented by the symbol N. A force of 2N is smaller that 7N. A force usually results from an inter
Yes it is, although it may be better calling it a force meter, a  force gauge or a dynamometer.    Most of the time they measure in Newtons (the SI unit for force)  b … ut they can also measure in pound.force too. 
A Newton meter does not measure force! Newton meter measures energy E. A Newton measures force. A Nm (Newton Metre)is also the unit used to measure TORQUE which is the twistin … g energy available if a force of 1Newton was acting at a radius of 1metre on the end of a shaft. A Newton is equal to 0.102 Kilogram.

Many instruments are used to measure force. The most important is  the force gauge or dynamometer. It's in fact a load sensor with a  display. Those gauges are often mounted … on a test stand or directly  integrated in the frame. Newton meter measures energy E. A Newton measures force. A Nm (Newton Metre)is also the unit used to measure TORQUE which is the twistin … g energy available if a force of 1Newton was acting at a radius of 1metre on the end of a shaft.

Best Answer: The types of forces which can be most redily measured are constraint forces. Like tension or the normal force. You cannot really directly measure any other force...not even gravity. To measure other forces, you need to use (or are subconsciously using) the technique of force balancing. The first force measurement device was the tensile spring scale, invented by Robert Hooke. 
Measuring forces. A force meter is used to measure forces. Forces can be measured using a force meter. Force meters contain a spring connected to a metal hook. The spring stretches when a force is applied to the hook. The bigger the force applied, the longer the spring stretches and the bigger the reading. For example, when you push open a door you have to apply a force to the door. You also have to apply a force to pull open a drawer. You cannot see a force but often you can see what it does. Forces can change the speed of something, the direction it is moving in or its shape.
