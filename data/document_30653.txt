DNA's structure is a double helix made up of two complimentary nucleic acid backbones twinned together. Depending on what you mean by structure, DNA helices also bend and twin … e with each other in the formation of chromosomes.
DNA is double helical in structure. each spiral strand, composed of a sugar phosphate backbone and attached bases, is connected to a complementary strand by hydrogen bonding (… non-covalent) between paired bases, adenine (A) with thymine (T) and guanine (G) with cytosine (C).
