Everybody knows that humans' closest animal relatives are chimpanzees. At least, that's been the accepted wisdom among scientists for more than 30 years. But now two biologists are arguing that orangutans, not chimps, are our closest cousins.

This family includes orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos. Of the great apes, humans share 98.8 percent of their DNA with bonobos and chimpanzees. Humans and gorillas share 98.4 percent of their DNA. Once the apes are not native to Africa however, the differences in DNA increase. Humans and orangutans share 96.9
These extraordinary images detail the remarkable similarities between humans and our closest living relatives, bonobos. Sharing 98.7 per cent of human DNA, the fascinating creatures exhibit the same expressions, mannerisms and behaviour as man displays on a daily basis. From turning taps on and off for a drink to cuddling their babies, the great apes are the closest thing to observing a human in a zoo-even suffering hair loss.
Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Although it is commonly known that chimpanzees are 99% human, the most updated studies show that they still have the closest DNA to humans of all the other animals, but are rather closer to 95% human.
Best Answer: As I recall, the Bonobo is the closest living relative to humans. However, as they are often called pygmy or dwarf chimps, they often get lumped into the whole chimp category. Here is a page from a prof at the University of Washington on Great Apes in general and the bonobo in particular.
