The thyroid is a gland that produces hormones important for energy levels, mood and metabolism. If your thyroid produces too few hormones, you have a condition known as hypothyroidism. Depending on the severity of your condition, your doctor may prescribe synthetic thyroid medications.
Processed Foods. Processed foods tend to have a lot of sodium, and people with hypothyroidism should avoid sodium, Frechman says. Having an underactive thyroid increases a person's risk for high blood pressure, and too much sodium further increases this risk.
People with hypothyroidism may want to limit their intake of broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, turnips, and bok choy. Cooking the vegetables can reduce the effect that cruciferous vegetables have on the thyroid gland.
People with hypothyroidism may want to consider minimizing their intake of gluten, a protein found in foods processed from wheat, barley, rye, and other grains, says Ruth Frechman, RDN, a dietitian and nutritionist in the Los Angeles area and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
Cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower, and leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens and kale, however, can interfere with thyroid function. Limit these vegetables, and emphasize thyroid-safe alternatives, such as bell peppers, squash, tomatoes and carrots.
1 Avoid foods that interfere with thyroid function, including broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, spinach, turnips, soybeans, peanuts, linseed, pine nuts, millet, cassava, and mustard greens. 2  If you take thyroid hormone medication, talk to your doctor before eating soy products.
