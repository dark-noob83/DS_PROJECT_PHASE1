After reading Richard Douthwaite’s article, “Shale Oil Drilling to Begin in Ireland (April 21, 2011), I felt compelled to post the letter which follows which I had recently written for our two local newspapers about the “fluids” used in natural gas exploration in Colorado which are carcinogenic and neurotoxic.
The company believes there is shale gas similar to that found in Newfoundland as both areas were joined together hundreds of millions of years ago. Chief executive Alan Minty said they were investing up to €650,000 in the initial exploration.
Shale gas drilling to begin in Ireland. Apr 21, 2011 3 Comments by Richard Douthwaite. The development of techniques which allow the extraction of gas from some carboniferous rocks known as shale has completely transformed the world’s natural gas market.
Here’s why that’s a critical question. February 1, 2014 | By Robert Emmet Hernan. As the Republic of Ireland (RoI) and Northern Ireland (NI) assess the possibility of allowing fracking for shale gas on the island of Ireland, we can learn from what others are doing to address this same question.
Northern Ireland Geology-Shale and Greywaches. Shale is a fine grained sedimentary rock which splits easily. It can contain fossils such as graptolites which are characteristic of the Silurian and Ordovician Periods. Some excellent shale outcrops with numerous graptolites can be found along the coast around Donaghadee.
So the governments in RoI and NI, and certainly the citizens on the island of Ireland, need to independently assess the realistic value of shale gas formations on the island of Ireland and weigh the potential returns with the real risks.
Shale gas is found in shale plays, which are shale formations containing significant accumulations of natural gas and which share similar geologic and geographic properties. A decade of production has come from the Barnett Shale play in Texas.
