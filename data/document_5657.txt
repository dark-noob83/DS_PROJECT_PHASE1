The object's distance from the planet's center is also important. The escape velocity from the Earth is about 11.3 kilometers (7 miles) per second. Orbital velocity is the speed needed to stay in orbit. At an altitude of 242 kilometers (150 miles), this is about 17,000 miles per hour. This is just a little less than full escape velocity. 
It is said that in order for an object or a projectile to leave Earth's gravitational pull, it must reach Earth's escape velocity, meaning reach a speed of 7 miles per second (~11 km per second). 
In physics, escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to break free from the gravitational attraction of a massive body. The escape velocity from earth is about 40,270 km/h (25,020 mph). In common usage, the initial point is on the surface of a planet or moon. On the surface of the Earth, the escape velocity is about 11.2 kilometers per second (~6.96 mi/s), which is approximately 33 times the speed of sound (Mach 33) and several times the muzzle velocity of a rifle bullet (up to 1.7 km/s).
In order be in orbit around the Earth, a satellite needs to go very fast (greater than 12,000 miles per hour), and very high (greater than 125 miles up). Ordinary airplanes can’t go that high or fast, and even the fastest jet ever built, the SR‐71, could only go 2,200 mph at 15 miles up. 
If a rocket is launched from the surface of the Earth, it needs to reach a speed of at least 7.9 kilometers per second (4.9 miles per second) in order to reach space. This speed of 7.9 kilometers per second is known as the orbital velocity, it corresponds to more than 20 times the speed of sound. © GFDL. However, the orbital velocity now refers to the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun: about 30 kilometers per second multiplied by the square root of 2 equals about 42 kilometers per second. The ‘fourth cosmic velocity’ is the escape velocity from our galaxy-the Milky Way.
Earth's radius is about 4000 miles. If you do the m … ath, you should get a velocity of about 18,000 miles per hour. Higher satellites orbit slower. A geosynchronous satellite (around 22,000 miles up) is stationary with respect to earth's surface.   The moon, earth's natural satellite, orbits once every 27.3 days. Satellites stay in orbit due to the balance of two factors: In order for a satellite to successfully orbit the Earth, it must travel a horizontal distance of 8000 meters before falling a vertical distance of 5 meters.
From any circular orbit you need to speed up by a factor of the square root of 2 to get to escape velocity. For Low Earth orbit, orbital speed is 17,500 MPH, and escape velocity is the square root of two (about 1.414) times as fast, or a little less than 25,000 MPH. A good example of the difference between orbital speed and escape velocity is when Apollo went to the moon. First the Saturn V rocket boosted the astronauts into near Earth orbit which required a speed of about 18,000 mph.
You need an even higher velocity to get beyond Earth orbit. A good example of the difference between orbital speed and escape velocity is when Apollo went to the moon. First the Saturn V rocket boosted the astronauts into near Earth orbit which required a speed of about 18,000 mph.
The orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low Earth orbit is about 7.8 km/s, but reduces with increased orbital altitude. Calculated for circular orbit of 200 km it is 7.79 km/s and for 1500 km it is 7.12 km/s. The delta-v needed to achieve low Earth orbit starts around 9.4 km/s. Atmospheric and gravity drag associated with launch typically adds 1.5–2.0 km/s to the launch vehicle delta-v required to reach normal LEO orbital velocity of around 7.8 km/s (28,080 km/h). Equatorial low Earth orbits (ELEO) are a subset of LEO.
