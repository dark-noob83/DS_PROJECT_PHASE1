A voltmeter is wired in parallel with the light bulb to measure voltage across the light bulb. Connect positive terminal (+) of voltmeter to positive terminal (+) of a dry cell and connect negative terminal (-) of voltmeter to negative terminal (-) of a dry cell (see figure). 
The most common units of measurement for measuring radio frequency radiation are microWatts per square meter (µW/m2), microWatts per square centimeter (µW/cm2), milliWatts per square meter (mWm²) and Volts per meter (V/m). And herein lies the problem, there is no accepted standard on this. 
The electromotive force (emf) of a cell is its terminal voltage when no current is flowing through it. The terminal voltage of a cell is the potential difference between its electrodes. A voltmeter cannot be used to measure the emf of a cell because a voltmeter draws some current from the cell. To measure a cell's emf a potentiometer is used since in a potentiometer measurement no current is flowing. It employs a null method of measuring potential difference, so that when a balance is reached and the reading is being taken, no current is drawn from the source to be measured. Internal Resistance of a Test Cell. OBJECT. To calibrate a one meter slide wire potentiometer using a standard cell and then to use this potentiometer to measure the emf of a test cell.
The terminal voltage of the same test cell is then measured as different load resistors are connected across the test cell and these data are used to determine the internal resistance of the test cell. Internal Resistance of a Test Cell. OBJECT. To calibrate a one meter slide wire potentiometer using a standard cell and then to use this potentiometer to measure the emf of a
What is the unit of measurement for measuring cells and what is its symbol? Cells are usually measured in microns (1 micron = 0.000001 meters, or 0.001 millimeters). Subcellular structures might be measured in microns or nanometers (1 nanometer (nm) = … 0.000000001 meters). ANSWER Generally in Science, you would use the Metric system of measurement. Therefore, when talking about cells and microscopic organisms, you would be measuring using MICROMETRE (abbreviated: µ --micron) or stated as: µm (micro metre).

Micrometre is 1 millionth of a meter, 1 thousandths of a milimeter (mm), or 1 x 10-6 meters. To give you the idea of how small a micro metre is, a human hair is about 100 µm, wide, and a red blood cell would be around 8 µm wide, the typical size of an animal cell would be from 10 - 100 µm. ANSWER Generally in Science, you would use the Metric system of measurement. Therefore, when talking about cells and microscopic organisms, you would be measuring using MICROMETRE (abbreviated: µ --micron) or stated as: µm (micro metre).
A load cell or loadcell is a highly accurate device that is used to measure weight or force in a number of different applications. They can be used to measure compression, tension, bending or shear forces. The load cell itself is a transducer that is used to convert force into an electrical signal. Within the load cell structure is an area, or group of areas, which are designed to be stressed when a load/force is applied, normally in a linear fashion. 1 A tension load cell is designed to measure tensile or ‘pulling’ loads. 2  A typical use of a tension load cell is for hanging scales and they are also popular for vessel weighing.
