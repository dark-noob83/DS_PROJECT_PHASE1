There are two types of hiatal hernias--sliding and paraesophageal. Sliding hiatal hernias are the result of part of the stomach and the area that joins the stomach to the esophagus bulging up into the diaphragm and chest. Most sliding hernias are small in size.
Para-esophageal hiatal hernias. A para-esophageal hiatal hernia that is large, particularly if it compresses the adjacent esophagus, may impede the passage of food into the stomach and cause food to stick in the esophagus after it is swallowed.
The hiatus is an opening in the diaphragm (a muscle separating the abdomen and chest) that the esophagus, or swallowing tube, passes through to reach the stomach. If the hiatus weakens and stretches, part of the stomach can squeeze into the chest cavity, producing a hiatal hernia. There are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding and paraesophageal (next to the esophagus). In a sliding hiatal hernia, the junction where the stomach and the esophagus meets slides up into the chest through the hiatus. This is the more common type of hernia.
Hiatal hernias are categorized as being either sliding or para-esophageal. Sliding hiatal hernias. Sliding hiatal hernias, the most common type of hernia, are those in which the junction of the esophagus and stomach, referred to as the gastro-esophageal junction, and part of the stomach protrude into the chest.
1 Hiatal hernia generally denotes upward displacement of the stomach through the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus into the thoracic cavity. 2  There are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding (type I) and paraesophageal.
Hiatal hernias are defined as herniation of the stomach into the chest, as the stomach pushes up from the abdomen into the chest cavity. Herniation occurs through the diaphragmatic esophageal hiatus, which is an opening in the diaphragm through which the esophagus connects to the stomach.
