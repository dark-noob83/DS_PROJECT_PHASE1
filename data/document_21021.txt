A 7kW generator will run for 66 hours, a 12kW generator will run for 36 hours on a 100 gallon tank at full load. Most of the time, the generator is operating between 25-75% capacity and the fuel supply will last much longer. Generators can run on most fuels including diesel, gasoline, natural gas, and Propane. Unfortunately, due to the standby nature of generators, they spend most of the time idle. When sitting for long periods of up to 6 months, diesel fuel and gasoline can gum up and clog the inner parts of the engine.
This allows for maximum fuel efficiency. Because our EU generators are so fuel efficient, they boast incredibly long run times-as much as 20 hours on a single tank of gas! Our EB, EM, and EG generators have large fuel tanks, so you can run your generator for long periods of time without refilling. 
For that reason, they weigh less than half of an 1800 RPM Diesel Engine. The alternator on a 3600 RPM Diesel generator spins twice as fast so it can get by with less than half of the copper of an 1800 RPM alternator. Due to the higher engine speed, these 3600 RPM generators wear out much sooner. Diesel Generator kW (General Info). Diesel generator kW (k=1000 W= Watt) is typically produced at lower RPMs. Example 8kW =8000 Watts. It takes 1.5 horsepower to make one kW. Turning at a slow 1800 RPM a Diesel generator kW requires large displacement. Most gas and even some Diesel generators run at 3600 RPM.
I wish I could answer this question in the kind of detail that I would like to but it really depends upon the size of generator that you plan to run. For example, if I were to convert my small Honda EU2000i generator to run on propane, I could get by with a 20 or 30 pound tank. If, however, you would like to power a very large standby generator for your home with propane, you will need a much larger tank.

For a heavy load, the manual says run the generator at no more two hours per 4 hour period. Lighter loads can run at 3 hours and no load continuous for 4 hours. It also says to never run the generator more than 8 straight hours which in my case, is about one tank of fuel. I have run mine for 20 hours in a 24 hour period without problem. It will run 6 to 8 hours on a tank of gas, depending on load. We were out of electric power for 24 days after hurricane Opal, and that generator ran almost continuously without being harmed.
