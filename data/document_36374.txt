Concerning how long does grass seed take to grow, if the conditions are good and the variety of grass used is of the type that grows fast, within a weekâ€™s time the result may be a lush green patch in the lawn. While it may not be properly grown yet the visible result may take about two to three weeks.
The seed of the grass germinates faster with the availability of proper light, water and nutrition of soil. Excess of heat, over irrigation and over-use of pesticides and insecticides may kill the germination. A temperate and warm condition is most favorable for no matter how long does grass seed take to grow.
How long does it take for seed to grow. Different seed mixtures establish at different speeds. As a general rule, hardwearing mixtures usually contain ryegrass and red fescue, two species that establish quite quickly-they can germinate in as little as 3-4 days, but 7-10 days is more average.
This is how many golf courses grow their grass and it can work for you as well. The key is to mix the soil and seed together BEFORE putting the seed down. This eliminates a lot of raking and it assures that you'll have plenty of seed covered with soil properly which will help it germinate quicker.
If stored in a cool, dry place, grass seed can last for 2-3 years. However, the germination rate (the number of seeds that will grow) will decrease over time, so you may not get the same results you would if you were using fresh seed. For best results, use fresh product and try to plant it within a year.
If the seed is sown during the time of year when it is wet the grass is most likely to germinate faster. As discussed earlier about how long does grass seed take to grow, the two seasons which are most suitable for sowing of grass seeds is spring and fall.

A fast growing variety of grass sown under good growing conditions will produce a green covering in about a week, although it will not yet be properly established.
The germination time for grass seed ranges from 5 to 30 days depending on the variety. It can be even longer than this in cooler temperatures. This is how long it will take to actually see the grass growing. Until this point, the seed, or the soil and mulch in contact with the seed, must stay moist.
