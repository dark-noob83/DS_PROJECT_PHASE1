Bond specificity is also called as relative specificity. Enzymes showing bond specificity are specific to substrates having similar bonds and similar structure. This means that they are specific only to certain types of bonds such as peptide bonds, glycosidic bonds, ester bonds etc.
Enzyme-substrate specificity means that a substrate can fit into an enzyme similar to a key fitting into a lock. The active site of the enzyme is what determines its specificity.
Enzyme Specificity and substrate selectivity. Specificity is a property of the enzyme and describes how restrictive the enzyme is in its choice of substrate; a completely specific enzyme would have only one substrate. The specificity of the serine proteases is usually not very high since they have similar active sites and act through the same proteolytic mechanism.
1 Group specificity-the enzyme will act only on molecules that have specific functional groups, such as amino, phosphate and methyl groups. 2  Linkage specificity-the enzyme will act on a particular type of chemical bond regardless of the rest of the molecular structure.
Supplement. In an enzyme activity, the substrate must bind with the enzyme to become a catalyst of a chemical reaction. And most enzymes are highly specific particularly to the nature of the substrate they bind to. Substrate specificity is one of the most essential distinctive features of enzymes.
Specificity of Enzymes. One of the properties of enzymes that makes them so important as diagnostic and research tools is the specificity they exhibit relative to the reactions they catalyze. A few enzymes exhibit absolute specificity; that is, they will catalyze only one particular reaction.
When the enzyme only can act on one substrate, it is said that the enzyme shows absolute specificity for the substrate. It is the case of succinate dehydrogenase, that is specific for succinate, or the L-glutamate dehydrogenase, specific for glutamate.
