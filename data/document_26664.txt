The pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach that plays a key part in the digestive process.
In about 15-20% of patients with acute pancreatitis, severe damage to the pancreas may lead to a life threatening illness that is often associated with prolong hospitalization, multiple surgical procedures, and death in some patients. This is often associated with development of a condition called a pancreatic psuedocyst and. 2  damage to surrounding structures in the abdomen from the inflammation and leakage of pancreatic juice such as the colon, blood vessels, splenic vein, and the duodenum.
1 Symptoms when a gastric ulcer damages the pancreas include pain and inflammation. 2  Pancreatitis. 3  Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is the result of gastric ulcer penetration. 4  The main symptom is intense and long-lasting pain. 5  This pain may increase with movement or a change in position.6  Treatment.

In pancreatitis, the enzymes become activated while still in the pancreas.
