The Ganges River, also called Ganga, is a river located in northern India that flows toward the border with Bangladesh (map). It is the longest river in India and flows for around 1,569 miles (2,525 km) from the Himalayan Mountains to the Bay of Bengal. 
The Brahmaputra River has its source in southwest Tibet. It flows there with the name Yarlung Tsangpo River. The river runs across south Tibet to penetrate the Himalayan mountain ranges in huge canyons and subsequently Arunachal Pradesh (India). In Arunachal Pradesh, it is called as Dihang. The average depth of the Brahmaputra River is 124 feet (38 meters) and utmost depth is 380 feet (120 meters). The Brahmaputra River fuses with the Ganges in Bangladesh and bifurcates into two: the Meghna and Padma River.
The annual flow of the Brahmaputra river basin from India to Bangladesh is 537.24 km 3. The annual flow of the Ganges river basin from China to Nepal is 12.0 km 3. All rivers in Nepal drain into the Ganges river with an annual flow of 210.2 km 3 to India. It has been estimated that the Ganges river basin in India and Nepal has an annual groundwater yield of 108.5 km 3, while the Brahmaputra river basin in Assam (India) has a yield potential of 10.7 km 3. Compared to India, groundwater recharge potential is lower in Bangladesh, estimated at 21 km 3 /year.
Brahmaputra River Basin. Brahmaputra River is one of the largest rivers in India, as well as in Asia and it originates in south western Tibet as the Yarlung River. Brahmaputra River traverses across the southern Tibet where it is called as Dihang River before it breaks through the Himalaya Mountains. The Brahmaputra River Basin covers the regions of Tibet, China, India and Bangladesh. The major tributaries of the Brahmaputra River are the Amochu River, Raidak River, Sankosh, Mans, Bhareli River, Dibang River and Lohit River. The Brahmaputra River basin includes rivers like Lohit River, Burhidihing River, Dihang River, Kameng River, Manas River, Sankh River, Teesta River, Rangeet River, Lachen River, Lachung River, and Jaldhaka River. Transportation in Brahmaputra River has been improvised after the independence of the country
The source of the Brahmaputra is located in Angsi Glacier of northern side of Himalaya Range. From its in Angsi Glacier to the mouth, the total length of the Brahmaputra river … is 3,848 km or 2,392 miles. Source: http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-08/22/c_131067137.htm.
About 1,800 mi (2,900 km) long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation and transportation. The average depth of the river is 124 ft (38 m) and maximum depth is 380 ft (120 m). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in spring when the Himalayan snows melt. Below the Lohit, the river is called Brahmaputra, enters the state of Assam, and becomes very wide—as wide as 10 km (6 mi) in parts of Assam. It is joined in Sonitpur by the Kameng River (or Jia Bhoreli).
Geography, population and climate. Geography. The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basin is a transboundary river basin with a total area of just over 1.7 million km 2, distributed between India (64 percent), China (18 percent), Nepal (9 percent), Bangladesh (7 percent) and Bhutan (3 percent) (Table 1). It has been estimated that the Ganges river basin in India and Nepal has an annual groundwater yield of 108.5 km 3, while the Brahmaputra river basin in Assam (India) has a yield potential of 10.7 km 3. Compared to India, groundwater recharge potential is lower in Bangladesh, estimated at 21 km 3 /year.
Ganges Delta. The Ganges Delta (also known as the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, the Sunderbans Delta, or the Bengal Delta) is a river delta in the South Asia region of Bengal, consisting of Bangladesh and the state of West Bengal, India. It is the world's largest delta, and empties into the Bay of Bengal.
