Each planet, as it goes around the Sun, sees the Sun move eastward among the stars once each year, and as a result the stars' movement around the sky, which defines the rotation period, is not the same as the day, which is defined by the Sun's movement around the sky.
For instance, if the sun and a planet are at the same point then the elongation is 0°. If a planet is at the opposite point in the sky from the sun, it has an elongation of 180°. However, some planets will never have such an elongation. To see why, we need to consider the difference between inferior planets and superior planets.
Mercury spins very slowly on its axis, only once every 58.6 Earth days (relative to background stars). However, the comparatively short Mercury year (just 88 Earth days) ha … s dramatic consequences for the length of the solar day -- sunrise to sunrise -- on the planet.
Both Pluto and Eris show these signatures. At the very low temperatures of Pluto and Eris, methane, which is in gaseous form on the earth, is frozen solid. The interior of Eris, like the interior of Pluto, is likely a mixture of rock and ice. Pluto and the new dwarf planet are not completely identical, however.
Period of rotation for all the planets? The rotation periods (time taken for the planet to rotate once on its axis relative to background stars) for each of the planets is as follows (using the Earth's mean solar d … ay of 24 hours exactly as 1 unit).
