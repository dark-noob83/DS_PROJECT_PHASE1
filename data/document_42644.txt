For retirement, eligibility is at age 62. If a person reaches age 62 in 2015, for example, then 2015 is the person's year of eligibility. We always index an individual's earnings to the average wage level two years prior to the year of first eligibility. Thus, for a person retiring at age 62 in 2015, we would index the person's earnings to the average wage index for 2013, or 44,888.16. To determine the national average wage index for 2013 at a level that is consistent with the national average wage indexing series for prior years, we multiply the 2012 national average wage index of 44,321.67 by the percentage change in average wages from 2012 to 2013 (based on our tabulated wage data).
