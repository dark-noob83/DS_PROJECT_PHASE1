(Also known as Hip Flexor Injury, Iliopsoas Strain, Psoas Strain, Hip Flexor Tear, Strained Iliopsoas Muscle, Torn Iliopsoas Muscle, Pulled Hip Flexor). A strain is a stretch or tear of a muscle or tendon, a band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. The tendon may be inflamed. Inflammation of a tendon is called tendonitis. The hip flexor muscles allow you to lift your knee and bend at the waist.
You put a lot of stress on your hip flexors when you sprint or kick. Thatâ€™s why athletes, especially runners, soccer players, and martial artists, are especially prone to hip flexor injuries that result in hip flexor pain. Hip flexor pain is usually felt in the upper groin region, where the thigh meets the pelvis.
Hip Flexor Strain is a muscle (psoas) strain felt in the front part of the hip. It is often associated with speed training or compensating for another injury, especially Achilles tendonitis or plantar fasciitis.
View image. A hip flexor strain is a stretch or tear of a muscle in your hip. You use the hip flexor muscles when you flex or lift your knee, do high kicks, or bend at the waist. Your muscles can get strained from overuse.
A hip flexor strain is characterized by tearing of one or more of the hip flexor muscles typically causing pain in the front hip or groin. The hip flexors move the knee towards the chest (i.e. bending the hip) during activity, particularly active when sprinting or kicking.
