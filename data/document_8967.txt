This song is about a guy who loved a girl, but he finds out that she never loved him back, hence: I'll still try and find my place in the diary of Jane. (thanks, Aaron-Pittsburgh, PA). The band did three versions of this song. The first version is pretty much the song as you probably know it. I'm not sure it's that simple...In the video-clip of the song, there is a woman (Jane) that dies and becomes a ghost.In the end of the clip, the singer, Benjamin, puts a rose and a diary on a tombstone.In the official video you can see the name Jane written on the tombstone, but you can barely see the last name.
Something's getting in the way. Something's just about to break. I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane..

I believe that whole statement meens something to the nature of finding his place within her life, what he really meant to her.
