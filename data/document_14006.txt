Yeah, it’s, like, teenager talk. “Yeah” is pronounced yah-uh. This is not a celebration word. This isn’t something you’d say when a friend has a new grandbaby born on her birthday (as the email I received told me).
Yea[h] , Mom, of course I fed the dogs. The two meanings not only have different pronunciation, but they're also not differentiable using context clues. For example, folks will commonly say Yeah as a one-word answer in a chat or a one-word comment in a forum.
Except, my beef is with the “word” yay. I use yeah and yea a lot, but I use yea to mean “Yes!” As in, “Yea! I got paid today!” (Yes! I got paid today!). Yeah is my sarcastic, “yeah, but” kind of word.
Many people use yah as a more modern, slang spelling of the word yeah. People often use it in instant messaging or texting, and it is likely just a shortening of the slightly longer word and indicates agreement in much the same way.
Yay rhymes with way and is used to indicate excitement or pleasure, etc., as in, Yay, our team won!. In English, as far as I know, ya is only used in place of the word you (Are ya coming with us to the game?) Usage of it to indicate yeah (yes) is a misspelling.
The older “yea” is pronounced like “yay” but it’s not a mere interjection. It can be an adverb or a noun, according to American Heritage and Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.).
YEA/YEAH/YAY. “Yea” is a very old-fashioned formal way of saying “yes,” used mainly in voting. It’s the opposite of—and rhymes with—“nay.” When you want to write the common casual version of “yes,” the correct spelling is “yeah” (sounds like “yeh”). When the third grade teacher announced a class trip to the zoo, we all yelled “yay!” (the opposite of “boo”!).
They are differentiated by spelling: 1  Yay [ jɛi ] (as opposed to, say, boo) is for joy and exultation; 2  Yeah [ jae ] (jæ synonym of, yes opposite of) nah is for ordinary; assent. 3  And [ yea ] (jɛi opposite of) nay is for formal assent during a.  vote
