So far, no bird known can match the flying speed of a peregrine falcon in its hunting dive. The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird – and in fact the fastest animal on Earth – when in a dive.
The fastest bird is representative by the peregrine falcon. During the the dive flight peregrine falcon can reach speed of up to 350 km / hour! Record speed of the falcon, which was able to measure was 389 km/h (242 mph) . Some sources claim that during the dive falcon can reach speed over 400 km/h (248 mph) ….
This is a list of the fastest flying birds in the world. A bird's velocity is necessarily variable; a hunting bird will reach much greater speeds while diving to catch prey than when gliding. The bird with the greatest airspeed velocity is the peregrine falcon, able to exceed 320 km/h (200 mph) in its hunting dives. The greatest self-powered horizontal flight speed is achieved by the white-throated needletail, capable of such speeds as 169 km/h (105 mph), typically during mating rituals.
1. Spine-tailed swift: 106 mph. The Spine-tailed Swift or White-throated Needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus), is the fastest flying bird in the world. They can fly at the speed of 170 km/h (105 mph). These birds characterized with its very short legs and spend most of their lives in the air.
