Knowing that the situations depicted in actor and filmmaker Adam MacDonald ’s Backcountry are based on “true events” only makes them more harrowing to watch unfold onscreen in a manner that may give pause to even the most experienced outdoors enthusiasts.
BACKCOUNTRY was the #2 Canadian film at the box office in its opening week! In our current and second week we've accomplished something that basically NEVER hap ... pens: Our box office not only held over, but WENT UP! Thank you to the tireless team at D Films for their amazing work.
Writer/director Adam MacDonald’s BACKCOUNTRY, which just had its world premiere at TIFF, is a Canadian movie that takes place in the Canadian wilderness, with Canadian protagonists who attempt to get the better of that natural Canadian majesty. That’s refreshing.
MacDonald’s been racking up acting credits for quite a while, having appeared on a number of shows including Being Erica and Rookie Blue, but now he’s at the Toronto International Film Festival with his feature directorial debut, Backcountry.
The film, which hits theaters today, is a fictionalized account based on a couple of real incidents in Canada’s vast wilderness, says Backcountry writer and director Adam MacDonald, who spent three years researching black bears for the film.
Backcountry. A survival thriller starring: Missy Peregrym, Eric Balfour & Jeff Roop. When a couple realize they have entered a predatory black bear’s territory, being lost suddenly becomes the least of their problems. Based on a true story.
Backcountry film. Shot on location in North Bay, Ontario and Squamish, British Columbia, we're thrilled to finally share Backcountry with our home country! Join us on Aug 28th across Canada at Cineplex Odeon theatres. Fair warning: You may never go camping again.
