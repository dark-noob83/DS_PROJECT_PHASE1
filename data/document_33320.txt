Making the world better, one answer at a time. The density of particleboard is 46 pounds per cubic foot, or about 2.88 pounds per square foot (psf) for 3/4 material. 38 lbs The Specific gravity of Walnut is .64 so it would weigh about 40 pounds per cubic foot, depending on the moisture content. Therefore a board foot would weigh between 3.
On average, a sheet of plasterboard that is 4 feet by 8 feet and  1/2 inch thick is around 52 pounds. A sheet that is 4 feet by 12  feet and 1/2 inch thick is approximately … 77 pounds. 
The faces of plywood are usually a higher grade of wood than the interior layer(s); however, the density of the plywood is consistent across the cross section of the board. The average density for a medium-quality pine plywood board is 600 kilograms per cubic meter. Furthermore, each species of wood has a different weight to volume, or density. Density is the best way to determine which product is heavier within the same species and grade of wood. In comparison, particleboard is the heaviest within the same species and grade of wood
Tagged: 0 Thread(s). Quoted: 4 Post(s). Liked: 12. 2 statements here that are absolutely false..... 1. a single sheet of 3/4 4x8 mdf does not weight 96 lbs..not matter how good a quality it is, you may find that it FEELS like it does...but it does NOT. I will weight one of my sheets tomorrow and report back...i bet it is closer to 70lbs. i have weighted 1mdf and it was 84bs....and felt like 120lbs
How much does black walnut weigh per board foot? 38 lbs The Specific gravity of Walnut is .64 so it would weigh about 40 pounds per cubic foot, depending on the moisture content. Therefore a board foot would weigh between 3. … 3 & 3.5 pounds.
Although plywood, particleboard and solid wood are all wood products, each has its own weight to volume, due to the inherent binding adhesive and the quality of the wood. Furthermore, each species of wood has a different weight to volume, or density. Density is the best way to determine which product is heavier within the same species and grade of wood. In comparison, particleboard is the heaviest within the same species and grade of
Find out the density of MDF sheets from the material specification; the density of MDF ranges from 680 to 830 kg/cubic meters. For this example, the density is 700 kg/cubic meters. Multiply the volume of the MDF sheet by its density to calculate the sheet weight. In this example, the sheet weight is 0.0377 cubic meters x 700 kg/cubic meters, or 26.39 kg. Multiply the weight (in kg) of the sheet by 2.205 to convert the weight to pounds. In the example, it is 26.39 kg x 2.205, or 58.19 pounds. For example, if the thickness is 1/2 inch, it will correspond to 0.5 x 0.0833, or 0.0416 feet. Multiply the sheet area and thickness to calculate the sheet volume. In this example, the volume is 32 square feet x 0.0416 feet, or 1.3312 cubic feet.
Multiply the weight per sheet by the number of sheets you have to get the total weight of your load of particleboard. For instance, 100 sheets of particleboard from the example would weigh a total of 41.23 pounds x 100 = 4,123 pounds. Instructions. Measure the length, width and thickness of the particleboard sheet in inches. For instance, you might have a 1/2-inch sheet measuring 48 inches wide by 96 inches long. Multiply the dimensions together. In the example, you would multiply 48 by 96 by 1/2 to get 2,304 cubic inches. This is your volume
