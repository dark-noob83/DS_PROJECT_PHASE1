For example, limestone is a sedimentary rock composed almost entirely of the mineral calcite. Other rocks contain many minerals, and the specific minerals in a rock can vary widely. Some minerals, like quartz, mica or feldspar are common, while others have been found in only one or two locations worldwide. A mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure formed by geological processes. A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals whereas a rock may also include organic remains and mineraloids.
Rocks are formed from minerals or mineroids solidified into one. A rock could be made up of either one or more than one minerals combined together. For example, the most common rock granite is a combination of quartz, feldspar and biotite minerals. The Earth’s crust is also known as a rock. Rocks are classified based upon various characteristics such as mineral and chemical composition, texture and permeability. Tweet. Key Difference: Rocks are formed from minerals or mineroids solidified into one. A rock could be made up of either one or more than one minerals combined together. Minerals are homogenous solids that have regular structures and are found in rocks, ore and mineral deposits in the earth’s crust.
Rocks are composed of minerals. For example, granite is an igneous  rock primarily made up of the minerals feldspar, quartz, and mica. 3 people found this useful. Edit.

Minerals are crystalline solids formed of specific molecules made … of specific elements-changing the element in the base molecule often changes the color and structure of the mineral.
Granite, for instance, is an intrusive igneous rock composed of the minerals quartz, feldspar, mica, hornblende, and other combinations or ratios of minerals. Elements are unique primary building blocks of matter, each defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Minerals are crystalline solids formed of specific molecules made … of specific elements-changing the element in the base molecule often changes the color and structure of the mineral.
A rock cycle defines how one rock form changes to another. For example, a sedimentary rock form is limestone that is composed only of the mineral calcite. Main rocks on earth contain minerals like magnetite, quartz, feldspar, mica, epidote etc. But more than half of the mineral types classified in geological studies are considered rare. Igneous rocks are formed when molten lava solidifies after a volcanic eruption and is known to be rich in the mineral granite. Sedimentary rocks are formed when deposition of organic matter, chemical precipitates etc takes place. These usually contain minerals like shale, siltstone, sandstone, etc.
Rocks: Rocks are a composed of one or more minerals. A rock can be made up of only one mineral or, as shown in the figure, a rock can be made up of a number of different minerals. So, rocks are composed of one or more minerals and minerals are composed of one or more elements. Minerals: Elements often are stacked together with other elements to form minerals. Minerals are simply a collection of one or more elements that are stacked neatly together in a form called a crystal structure. More details are available about this.
A rock is combinations of minerals and either has to be an igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rock. A mineral is a solid that was formed in nature, has a definite chemical … makeup, and has a crystal structure. 8 people found this useful.
