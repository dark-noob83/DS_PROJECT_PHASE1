The failure of the chemicalswitches in eukaryotic cells can cause certain types of cancer.In the final phases of eukaryotic cell life, the cells are programmed for death.The chromatin in the chromosomes begins to degrade and then the DNAbreaks into fragments. The cell eventually digests itself. The rate at which a cell divides is determined by many factors.However, the chemicals that control the phases of the cell cycle, called growthfactors, play an important role. The resting phase of the cell cycle is controlledby the G 0 factor.
Prokaryotic Cells are cells that have to have organelles that are not surrounded by a membrane and do have ribosomes. Their DNA is in the shape of a circle. They have no … nucleus, the DNA is bunched up in the cytoplasm. Both Prokaryotic Cells and Eukaryotic Cells have an outer cell membrane.   But, prokaryotic cells do not have membranes around their organelles (inside the cell …), whereas eukaryotic cells do. + 15 others found this useful.
Chapter 19 Bacteria and Viruses Section 19–1 Bacteria (pages 471–477) Key Concepts • How do the two groups of prokaryotes differ?• What factors are used to identify prokaryotes?• What is the importance of bacteria? Introduction (page 471) 1. Those bacteria may be a rich source of heat-stable enzymes, which can be used in medicine, food production, and industrial chemistry. 216 Chapter 19 Name______________________________ Class__________________ Date ______________ Reading Skill Practice © Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Prentice Hall.
a prokaryotic cell is a cell that does not have a nucleus or membrance covered organelles. and a a eukaryotic is a is a cell that has a nucleus membrane covered organelles. 2 people found this useful. Both Prokaryotic Cells and Eukaryotic Cells have an outer cell membrane.   But, prokaryotic cells do not have membranes around their organelles (inside the cell …), whereas eukaryotic cells do.
They are prokaryotes that produce methane gas. They live in oxygen-free environments, such as thick mud and the digestive tracts of animals. Identifying Prokaryotes (page 473) 14. Use the following labels to complete the illustration of a typical prokaryote: cellmembrane, cell wall, DNA, flagellum. 15.

Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (such  as chloroplasts) - Prokaryotic cells have neither of these. Both Prokaryotic Cells and Eukaryotic Cells have an outer cell membrane.   But, prokaryotic cells do not have membranes around their organelles (inside the cell …), whereas eukaryotic cells do.
