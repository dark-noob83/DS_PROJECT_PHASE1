Plate 121 of the Birds of America by John James Audubon, depicting the snowy owl. This yellow-eyed, black-beaked white bird is easily recognizable. It is 52–71 cm (20–28 in) long, with a 125–150 cm (49–59 in) wingspan. Also, these owls can weigh anywhere from 1.6 to 3 kg (3.5 to 6.6 lb). It is one of the largest species of owl and, in North America, is on average the heaviest owl species. 
The hard, inflexible bill of the great horned owl is 3.3–5.2 cm (1.3–2.0 in), although the culmen, the exposed bill portion as measured along the top of the beak, is only 2.1 to 3.3 cm (0.83 to 1.30 in). Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, 7.6 to 10.2 cm (3.0 to 4.0 in) long and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in width inside them.
a full sized barn owl's wingspan is 107 centimeters (42 inches). a very small barn owl could be 1/2 of that size. The wingspan of a Spotted Eagle Owl is 33cm (13 in). A Verreaux's Eagle Owl's wingspan is 66 t … o 75 cm (26 to 30 in) in length.
Description [edit]. The long-eared owl is a medium-sized owl, 31–40 cm (12–16 in) in length with an 86–100 cm (34–39 in) wingspan and a body mass of 178–435 g (6.3–15.3 oz). It has erect blackish ear-tufts, which are positioned in the center of the head. The ear-tufts are used to make the owl appear larger to other owls while perched. The long-eared owl (Asio otus, previously Strix otus) is a species of owl which breeds in Europe, Asia, and North America. This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls, family Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping of owls are the barn owls, family Tytonidae.
The wingspan of an Eurasian Eagle Owl can range from 138 to 200cm (55 to 79 in). The wingspan of a Spotted Eagle Owl is 33cm (13 in). A Verreaux's Eagle Owl's wingspan is 66 t … o 75 cm (26 to 30 in) in length. 6 people found this useful
Even tropical great horned owls have feathered legs and feet. The feathers on the feet of the great horned owl are the second longest known in any owl, although at 1.3 cm (0.51 in) are considerably shorter than those of the snowy owl, which has feathers up to 3.33 cm (1.31 in) long on its feet. The tarsal length is 54–80 mm (2.1–3.1 in). Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, 7.6 to 10.2 cm (3.0 to 4.0 in) long and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in width inside them.

In a pair of studies from Colorado, the average weight of prey for long-eared owls was 28 to 30 g (0.99 to 1.06 oz), 46 to 57.1 g (1.62 to 2.01 oz) for barn owl and 177 to 220 g (6.2 to 7.8 oz) for the great horned owl. Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, 7.6 to 10.2 cm (3.0 to 4.0 in) long and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in width inside them.
