The functions of muscle tissues depend on the type of muscle tissues and their locations in the body. Here is an overview of the 3 types of muscle tissues : : Skeletal muscle is called striated because of its appearance consisting of light and dark bands visible using a light microscope. As shown in the diagram (on the right), a single skeletal muscle cell is long and approximately cylindrical in shape, with many nuclei located at the edges (periphery) of the cell.
In summary, the three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Cardiac and skeletal are both striated muscle as repeating units called sarcomeres give the cells a striated appearance, while smooth muscle lacks such striations.
Types of Muscle Tissue. Skeletal muscle is associated with the bony skeleton, and consists of large cells that bear striations and are controlled voluntarily. Cardiac muscle occurs only in the heart, and consists of small cells that are striated and under involuntary control. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs, and consists of small elongated cells that are not striated and are under involuntary control. Special Characteristics of Muscle Tissue. Excitability, or irritability, is the ability to receive and respond to a stimulus.
Overview. The 3 types of muscle tissue are cardiac, smooth, and skeletal. Cardiac muscle cells are located in the walls of the heart, appear striated, and are under involuntary control. Smooth muscle fibers are located in walls of hollow visceral organs, except the heart, appear spindle-shaped, and are also
Unlike Skeletal and Cardiac muscle tissue, Smooth muscle is. . Smooth muscle fibers are small and tapered-with the ends reducing in size, in contrast to the cylindrical shape of skeletal muscle. Each smooth muscle fiber has a single centrally located nucleus.
