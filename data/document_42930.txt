A major advantage of WWN zoning is the ability to recable the fabric without having to redo the zone information. WWN zoning is susceptible to unauthorized access, as the zone can be bypassed if an attacker is able to spoof the World Wide Name of an authorized HBA.
A WWPN (World Wide Port Name) is physically assigned to a part in a Fibre Channel device, such as a FC HBA or SAN. It is the equivalent of the MAC address in the Ethernet protocol as it is supposed to be a unique identifier in the netwok. The WWNâ€™s are administred by the IEEE like the MAC Address is.
A WWPN (world wide port name) is the unique identifier for a fibre channel port where a WWN (world wide name) the unique identifier for the node itself.A good example is a dual port HBA. There will be two WWPN's (one for each port) and only a single WWN for the card itself.It's actually the firt octet that is changing. For example the portName for my multiport Emulex card is 10000000c9592f6c. The NodeName is 2000000c9592f6c. The 1 is simply changed for 2.
Learn the difference between World Wide Name zoning (WWN zoning) and port zoning, as well as the pros and cons of each on a Fibre Channel storage-area network (Fibre Channel SAN).
A World Wide Name, or WWN, is a 64-bit address used in fibre channel networks to uniquely identify each element in a Fibre Channel network.
KVM. A World Wide Name (WWN) is a unique identifier that is assigned to a manufacturer by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and hard-coded into a Fibre Channel (FC) device.
A WWPN pool is a WWN pool that contains only WW port names. If you include a pool of WWPNs in a service profile, the port on each vHBA of the associated server is assigned a WWPN from that pool.
