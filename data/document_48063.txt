Our free calculator uses recent, trusted data to estimate costs for your Gas Furnace Installation project. For a basic 1 furnace project in zip code 47474, the benchmark cost to Install a Gas Furnace ranges between $1,659.78 - $2,177.35 per furnace. To estimate costs for your project: 1
1 Floor furnaces cost $1,500 to $2,000 installed. 2  The average electric furnace cost is $1,750 to $3,500 installed. 3  The typical gas furnace cost is $3,000 to $6,000 installed, although higher efficiency models and/or complex installations could push the cost up to $7,500 to $10,000 or more. 1 Efficiency: Furnace efficiency measures how much fuel a unit converts to heat, and how much is lost up the chimney. 2  The national minimum efficiency standard is 78%, while some new models are up to 98.2% efficient. 3  The latter cost more, but will cut fuel costs and are better for the planet.
The Average Cost to Install a Furnace. The average cost to put in a furnace is $3,835. Most homeowners report paying between $3,250 and $4,420 for the installation of a new furnace.

The first thing you need to do if you are considering doing a new furnace installation is deciding what kind of furnace you want for your home. Most residential furnaces run on natural gas these days. To replace a gas furnace usually cost between $2,500 and $8,000 for an average home in the United States. 
1 Oil furnace cost is roughly $2,500 to $5,000 installed, but similar to gas furnace prices, it’s not unheard of to spend $10,000+. 2  The average propane furnace cost is $3,000 to $6,000 installed. 3  Again, though, costs could reach or exceed $10,000. 1 Efficiency: Furnace efficiency measures how much fuel a unit converts to heat, and how much is lost up the chimney. 2  The national minimum efficiency standard is 78%, while some new models are up to 98.2% efficient. 3  The latter cost more, but will cut fuel costs and are better for the planet.

If you want to convert from an electric furnace to a gas furnace, you will need to have gas piping and ductwork installed first. This will add an additional up-front cost to the furnace and installation process of around $5,000 to $15,000 or more depending on the space. 1 Leaky ducts can also cost homeowners about 10 percent to 30 percent in efficiency. 2  This will make a 96 AFUE high-efficiency furnace run at 66 percent to 86 percent and make an economical 80 AFUE not much better than an open fireplace. 3  The cost to replace ductwork is about $8 to $12 per linear foot of ducting.

1 Replacing an old furnace with a high-efficiency new one can also require installing a chimney liner for about $300 -$700 for a gas furnace or $700 -$1,800 for a fuel oil model. 2  If needed, make sure this is included in all estimates. 1 A building/mechanical permit is usually required to replace a furnace. 2  Permit and inspection fees are typically about $50-$300, but can cost more in some locations.
The average cost to install a new furnace is $3,602. As always, the price largely depends on the efficiency and size of your furnace, as well as its heat source. We have seen homeowners spend as little as $1,500 on a new furnace or as much as $7,000. However, know that most homeowners pay between $3,200 and $4,420.
