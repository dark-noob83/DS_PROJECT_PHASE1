Therefore, in a 60 minute game, each line typically plays 15 to 20 shifts, depending on power play and short handed situations. add a comment.
I think the average time a player spends on the ice in one shift probably 20, maybe 30 seconds. The average time on ice for a hockey player in one game... anywhere from 15 to â€¦ 30 minutes. Usually the better defensemen spend around 25-30 minutes on the ice each night, but average forwards usually spend around 20-25 minutes.
Length of an Average Shift in Hockey Generally speaking, an average shift in a hockey game should be about 45 seconds. In reality, it really depends on the player, the coach and the game situation. Defensemen tend to take shifts that are just a bit longer than forwards.
