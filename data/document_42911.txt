Most breccias are a mix of rock fragments and mineral grains. The type of rock that the fragments were produced from is often used as an adjective when referring to the rock. Some examples: sandstone breccia, limestone breccia, granite breccia, chert breccia, basalt breccia and others. Geologists have been very generous in their use of the word breccia.. It is common to hear the term used when referring to a rock or rock debris made up of angular fragments. Although it is mainly used for rocks of sedimentary origin it can be used for other types of rocks. A few more uses of the word are given below.
Breccia (/ˈbrɛtʃiə/ or /ˈbrɛʃiə/) is a rock composed of broken fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a fine-grained matrix that can be similar to or different from the composition of the fragments. Sedimentary breccia consists of angular, poorly sorted, immature fragments of rocks in a finer grained groundmass which are produced by mass wasting. It is lithified colluvium or scree.
Fault Breccia: Broken rock found in the contact area between two fault blocks and produced by movement of the fault. Flow Breccia: A lava texture produced when the crust of a lava flow is broken and jumbled during movement. Igneous Breccia: A term used for a rock composed angular fragments of igneous rocks. Flow breccia and pyroclastic breccia could be called igneous breccia. Impact Breccia: A deposit of angular rock debris produced by the impact of an asteroid or other cosmic body. See an article about impactites. Geologists have been very generous in their use of the word breccia.. It is common to hear the term used when referring to a rock or rock debris made up of angular fragments. Although it is mainly used for rocks of sedimentary origin it can be used for other types of rocks. A few more uses of the word are given below.
Breccia is a name given to clastic sedimentary rocks that are formed by clinging together of a large number of angular fragments. Breccia is formed with the space between the fragments either filled by smaller fragments or mineral cement, which is responsible for holding the rock together. In other words, Breccia has angular clasts. • Fragments are much more rounded in conglomerates. In other words, Conglomerate has rounded clasts. • This difference in grains is due to transportation of fragments, also because of the impact of transporting material (water).
Breccia is a rock formed from angular gravel and boulder-sized clasts cemented together in a matrix. The angular nature of the clasts indicates that they have not been transported very far from their source. There are several modes of formation for breccia. The cement that binds the clasts in a breccia is generally one of either calcite, silica or iron oxide. The matrix can consist solely of the cementing material, but may also contain sand and / or silt sized clasts cemented together among the coarser clasts.
Sedimentary [edit]. Sedimentary breccia is a type of clastic sedimentary rock which is made of angular to subangular, randomly oriented clasts of other sedimentary rocks. A conglomerate, by contrast, is a sedimentary rock composed of rounded fragments or clasts of pre-existing rocks. Both breccia and conglomerate are composed of fragments averaging greater than 2 millimetres (0.079 in) in size. Sedimentary breccia consists of angular, poorly sorted, immature fragments of rocks in a finer grained groundmass which are produced by mass wasting. It is lithified colluvium or scree.
Breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock composed of various sized visible pieces of other rock, cemented together by the processes of lithification. The pieces of rock that are … visible are angular fragments, meaning they have somewhat jagged edges. 1 The Different Types of Breccia Rock Breccia rock is a sedimentary rock. 2  It is made from several different broken pieces of rocks held together with matrix. 3  Breccia rock forms where broken or fragmented pieces o….

Breccia is a type of rock which is composed of broken fragments of minerals. It is commonly used as an aggregate and as dimension stone for decoration of walls and floors.

DESCRIPTION: Breccia is the name widely applied to a diverse group of rocks that consist of angular, greater-than sand-size fragments surrounded by a finer grained matrix. 1 Jasper breccia-term applied to two different materials: 1.breccias the larger fragments of which are jasper and 2.breccias that have been jasperized. 2  Mosaic 3  ...
