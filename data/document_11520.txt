A very simple way to use an inverter for emergency power (such as during a power outage), is to use a car battery (with the vehicle running), and an extension cord running into the house, where you can then plug in electrical appliances.
The inverter draws its power from a 12 Volt battery (preferably deep-cycle), or several batteries wired in parallel. The battery will need to be recharged as the power is drawn out of it by the inverter. The battery can be recharged by running the automobile motor, or a gas generator, solar panels, or wind.
4. For a 24-Volt inverter system, each 200 Watts of the inverter load requires approximately 10 DC Amps from the battery. The first step is to estimate the total Watts (or Amps) of load, and how long the load needs to operate.
2. Battery capacity is expressed by how many Amps for how many hours a battery will last-Amp-Hour (A.H.) capacity. 3. For a 12-Volt inverter system, each 100 Watts of the inverter load requires approximately 10 DC Amps from the battery. 4.
The Input Power Factor. A battery powers the inverter. Batteries have an amp-hour rating, the theoretical number of hours that a battery can deliver a current of 20 amps. A fully powered 200-amp-hour battery delivers 20 amps for 10 hours. A lower amp-hour battery will deliver 20 amps for less time.
