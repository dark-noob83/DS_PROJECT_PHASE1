In view of the scarcity of data on the toxic effects of M. oleifera seed extract in aquaculture farms, the present study aims to test the acute and sublethal toxicity of M. oleifera seed extract on hematological and biochemical parameters of fingerlings of C. carpio. Abstract. The study was carried out to investigate the acute and sublethal toxicity of Moringa oleifera seed extract on hematological and biochemical variables of a freshwater fish Cyprinus carpio under laboratory conditions.
Reaching a height of 7 to 12 meters, moringa is considered a vegetable tree because almost every part of the plant has food value. Moringa is known commonly as drumstick tree (for the seed pods), ben oil tree (for the seed oil) and horseradish tree (for the flavor of the roots). Roots are used as a substitute for horseradish, although the bark must be removed from the roots before they are used because it is toxic. 
The leaves, fruit, and seeds might be safe when eaten as food. However, it’s important to avoid eating the root and its extracts. These parts of the plant may contain a toxic substance that can cause paralysis and death. Moringa has been used safely in doses up to 6 grams daily for up to 3 weeks. There isn’t enough information to know if moringa is safe when used in medicinal amounts. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: It’s LIKELY UNSAFE to use the root, bark or flowers of moringa if you are pregnant. Chemicals in the root, bark, and flowers can make the uterus contract, and this might cause a miscarriage.
To grow from seed: Moringa seeds have no dormancy periods and can be planted as soon as they are mature. Note: If the soil is heavy, dig a larger hole of up to 3 ft (90 cm) in diameter and 3 ft deep, and backfill with 1 part sand and 2 parts original soil. Added compost or manure will help.

It is also used for salad oil, soap and cosmetics. The ground-up seeds have been successfully used in the Sudan, Burundi and Kenya to clear muddy water-a very valuable property. But leaves and the fruits are also used for medicinal purposes and livestock fodder.
