The phylum Chordata contains all animals that possess, at some point during their lives, a hollow nerve cord and a notochord, a flexible rod between the nerve cord and the digestive track.
The phylum Chordata is divided into three subphylums: Urochordata (tunicates), Cephalachordata (lancelets), and Vertebrata (vertebrates). The first two phyla are very small containing only about 2,000 species total. Tunicates are marine animals that only show the attributes of the chordata phylum in the larva stage, and when they turn into adults lose the notochord and nerve cord. Adult tunicates look like small sacs around 3 cm tall attached to the ocean floor.
This phylum includes all animals which have a hollow nerve cord and a notochord at some stage during their development. In the case of vertebrates, the notochord is present in the embryo, and develops into the vertebral body.
THE VERTEBRATES Chordates (phylum Chordata) are deuterostome coelomates whose nearest relatives in the animal kingdom are the echinoderms, the only other deuterostomes. However, unlike echinoderms, chordates are characterized by a notochord, jointed appendages, and segmentation.
The Chordata is the animal phylum with which everyone is most intimately familiar, since it includes humans and other vertebrates. However, not all chordates are
Phylum chordata is a classification in the animal kingdom that groups together species with common traits. Watch this video from About.com to learn more about how these animals are all related in the phylum chordata.
