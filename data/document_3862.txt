Newborn kittens generally open their eyes in 10 to 14 days. As far as raising new born kittens the mother generally does all the work. They are very particular about caring fo … r their babies and you shouldn't touch them really at all for about five days at least.
When kittens are first born they have their eyes closed... from the time they were born it will take about 7-14 days until they open their eyes! If you carry a baby kitten it will not die, assuming that that you would be gentle.
When cats are born they come out with a film over the eyes. A newborn kitten cannot see at birth. It is a natural occurrence and is nothing to be worried about, unless the film remains after a certain period of time. The cat cannot walk, see, or even hear until they are about six or seven days old.
1 1 week-10 days-Eyes beginning to open, ears still flat. 2  A kitten this age is smaller than your hand. 4 to 6oz weight. 3  2 weeks-Eyes open bright blue color, kittens will crawl a bit on their tummies, and basically just sleep and nurse. 4  No teeth yet. 6 to 8oz. weight.
Their eyes will open within 5-10 days but don't open fully for another 2-3 days. All kittens eyes are blue and will remain so until 12 weeks old (very much like babies) when they will develop their true colour, although some breeds do not change colour fully until 12 months of age. Hope this makes some sense.
Congratulations on the kittens! As you know, kittens are born with their eyes closed. They usually open when the kittens are between 8-14 days old. The eyes will stay blue for 2 more weeks.
