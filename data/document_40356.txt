Picture of Gallstones. There are two types of gallstones: 1) cholesterol stones and 2) pigment stones. 1  Patients with cholesterol stones are more common in the United States; cholesterol stones make up a majority of all gallstones. 2  They form when there is too much cholesterol in the bile.
Gallstones are common but cause no symptoms in two out of three people who have them. They sometimes cause problems such as pain, jaundice, pancreatitis, and gallbladder inflammation. Surgery is the usual treatment for gallstones that cause symptoms. Bile is a fluid made in the liver. Bile contains various substances including bile pigments, bile salts, cholesterol and lecithin.
Gallstones are stones or lumps that develop in the gallbladder or bile duct when substances in there harden. Some of the chemicals which exist in the gallbladder, such as cholesterol, calcium bilirubinate, and calcium carbonate, solidify into either one large stone or several small ones.
Gallstones can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. The gallbladder can develop a single large gallstone, hundreds of tiny stones, or both small and large stones. Gallstones can cause sudden pain in the upper right abdomen. This pain, called a gallbladder attack or biliary colic, occurs when gallstones block the ducts of the biliary tract.
Most gallstones don't cause symptoms for a long time. If they remain in the gallbladder, they may never cause symptoms. However, sometimes large stones can break down the wall of the gallbladder and get into the intestines causing a blockage. This is known as gallstone ileus. Usually, the stones pass from the gallbladder into the bile ducts.
Imbalances in the substances that make up bile cause gallstones. Gallstones may form if bile contains too much cholesterol, too much bilirubin, or not enough bile salts. Scientists do not fully understand why these imbalances occur. Gallstones also may form if the gallbladder does not empty completely or often enough.
