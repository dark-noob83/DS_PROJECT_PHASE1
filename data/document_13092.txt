An electrolyte is a substance that when dissolved in water will conduct electricity (Ex.: salt in water). A nonelectrolyte does not conduct electricity when dissolved in water: usually they are molecular compounds that are soluble in water. (Ex.: sugar in water, ethylene glycol in water, ethyl alcohol
When sugar is dissolved in water, the solution does not conduct electricity, because there are no ions in the solution. Some substances that are made of molecules form solutions that do conduct electricity. Ammonia is such a substance. When ammonia dissolves in water, it reacts with the water and forms a few ions. This is why laundry ammonia, which is a solution of ammonia in water, conducts electricity, but not very well.
When a solution conducts electricity, the charge is carried by ions moving through the solution. Ions are atoms or small groups of atoms that have an electrical charge. Some ions have a negative charge and some have a positive charge. Pure water contains very few ions, so it does not conduct electricity very well. When table salt is dissolved in water, the solution conducts very well, because the solution contains ions. The ions come from the table salt, whose chemical name is sodium chloride.
Return. Chapter 4: Aqueous Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry. We introduced aqueous solutions, which are any homogeneous mixtures that have water as the solvent. We defined two classes of aqueous solution according to whether they conduct electricity (electrolytes) or do not conduct electricity (non-electrolytes). If given the formula of a compound, it is important to be able to determine if it is an eletrolyte and to be able to draw a representation of the solution.
