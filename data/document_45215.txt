Standard temperature and pressure (STP) are considered to be 298 K and 1.0 atm. Predict which of the following changes will cause the volume of the balloon to increase or decrease assuming that the temperature and the gas filling the balloon remain unchanged. B) Balloon filled with helium underwater at 1.15atm is released and floats to the surface, which is at STP. C) Balloon filled with helium at STP floats into air where the pressure is equals 1 atm. D) Balloon filled with helium at STP floats into the atmosphere where the pressure is 0.5 atm.
Standard temperature is defined as zero degrees Celsius (0 0 C), which translates to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (32 0 F) or 273.15 degrees kelvin (273.15 0 K). This is essentially the freezing point of pure water at sea level, in air at standard pressure. Standard temperature and pressure, abbreviated STP, refers to nominal conditions in the atmosphere at sea level. This value is important to physicists, chemists, engineers, and pilots and navigators.
NIST uses a temperature of 20 °C (293.15 K, 68 °F) and an absolute pressure of 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi, 1 atm). The International Standard Metric Conditions for natural gas and similar fluids are 288.15 K (15.00 °C; 59.00 °F) and 101.325 kPa. An unofficial, but commonly used standard is standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP) as a temperature of 298.15 K (25 °C, 77 °F) and an absolute pressure of exactly 1 atm (101,325 Pa).
STP Definition: STP corresponds to 273 K (0° Celsius) and 1 atm pressure. STP is often used for measuring gas density and volume. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. 
The standard temperature is the freezing point of water and the standard pressure is one standard atmosphere. These can be quantified as follows: Standard temperature: 0°C = 273.15 K Standard pressure = 1 atmosphere = 760 mmHg = 101.3 kPa Standard volume of 1 mole of an ideal gas at STP: 22.4 liters. Standard pressure = 1 atmosphere = 760 mmHg = 101.3 kPa. Standard volume of 1 mole of an ideal gas at STP: 22.4 liters. The accurate masses of pure elements with their normal isotopic concentrations can be obtained from the periodic table. One mole of an ideal gas will occupy a volume of 22.4 liters at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure, 0°C and one atmosphere pressure).
Answer: STP in chemistry is the abbreviation for Standard Temperature and Pressure. STP most commonly is used when performing calculations on gases, such as gas density. The standard temperature is 273 K (0° Celsius) and the standard pressure is 1 atm pressure. At STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 L of volume (molar volume). STP commonly is used when standard state conditions are applied to calculations. Standard state conditions, which include standard temperature and pressure, may be recognized in calculations by the superscript circle.

The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is an older network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology for any bridged Ethernet local area network. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them.
