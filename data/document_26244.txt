If you look at the diagram above you can see the sump (or oil pan) is the lowest part of the engine. In a wet sump system, excess oil drains back into the sump when it has passed through the engine, and the oil pump then sucks it out of the sump and pumps it back to the top
Now consider what happens inside an engine with a dry-sump oil system. Multiple scavenge stages suck the oil out of the crankcase and deliver it to a remote tank. When this oil enters the tank tangentially, the air and oil separate, leaving a solid column of liquid to feed the pressure stage.
I should point out the important distinction between wet-sump and dry-sump oil systems. With a wet-sump system, an engine’s entire oil supply is contained within the oil pan; with a dry-sump system, the oil is stored in an external tank. This simple difference in how the two systems manage their respective oil reservoirs has huge implications for racers.
Auto-Craft found it necessary to manufacture an oil pump to enable an engine to use a wet sump oil system with a cam-driven fuel-injection pump, or a fan and generator. This pump is machined from the same aircraft quality aluminum as our dry sump pumps. It can be used with a fuel pump drive or with a blank cover plate.
Q-how do i adjust the oil pressure on the dry sump pump? A-at the rear of the pressure stage, on bottom, is a set screw and jam nut. Loosen the jam nut and turn the Allen screw in CLOCKWISE to INCREASE pressure, and COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to reduce pressure. Do this when the engine has been run, and oil is warm.
A dry sump oil system is different in that it doesn’t have an oil reservoir in the oil pan under the motor. Instead the oil is sucked out of the motor by an oil pump in one or several locations. It is then pumped up to an oil reservoir. The oil reservoir has an oil pump on it that then pumps the oil back into
