Decimals and fractions represent the same thing: a number that is not exactly a whole number. This page will show you how to convert a decimal into its equivalent fraction. (for negative decimal numbers the answer would be the same but negative, ex: -1.25 = -1). Quick!
Step 1: Write down the decimal divided by 1, like this: decimal/1. Step 2: Multiply both top and bottom by 10 for every number after the decimal point. (For example, if there are two numbers after the decimal point, then use 100, if there are three then use 1000, etc.). Step 3: Simplify (or reduce) the fraction. 
1 For example, convert 36.125 to a fraction. 2  Since 3 is in the ten's place, 6 is in the one's place, 1 is in the tenth's place, 2 is in the hundredth's place and 5 is in the thousandth's place we can say that 36.125 = (3*10)/1 + (6*1)/1 + (1/10) + (2/100) + (5/1000). How to convert a decimal to fraction (terminating decimals). To convert a decimal to a fraction you can use a shortcut to express the decimal as a fraction then reduce the fraction. 1 
2. Convert a non-periodic decimal to a fraction. Move the decimal point as many places to the right as you have decimals. This will now be your numerator, which you will divide over the denominator, which is a number starting with 1 and then as many zeros as you have decimals in your original number. Change a percent to a fraction. The percent becomes the numerator, which you divide over 100 and then simplify, or reduce to its lowest form. 1  Example: 36% turns to 36/100. 2  To simplify, look for the highest number that goes into 36 and 100.
For example, when you multiply the denominator of a fraction by a number, you also multiply the numerator by that same number. This lets you easily convert fractions to decimals if you can turn the denominator into a power of 10 -- such as 10, 100 or 1,000. You can use the same power-of-10 technique for improper and mixed fractions, which are fractions larger than 1. An improper fraction, such as 7/4, has a numerator that's higher than the denominator. To convert this fraction into a decimal, use the same trick by multiplying to get a power of 10.
Numerators, Denominators and Division. To convert a fraction into a decimal, you must understand numerators and denominators. The numerator is the top number in a fraction, and the denominator is the bottom number. For example, in the fraction 3/5, the numerator is 3, and the denominator 5. However, a fraction is also an expression of division. The value of a fraction is equal to the numerator divided by the denominator. You can use the same power-of-10 technique for improper and mixed fractions, which are fractions larger than 1. An improper fraction, such as 7/4, has a numerator that's higher than the denominator. To convert this fraction into a decimal, use the same trick by multiplying to get a power of 10.
Report Abuse. Decimal into a percent, just multiply by 100 (or move the decimal two places to the left). For example: 0.25 = 25% 0.375 = 37.5% 0.875 = 87.5% To turn a decimal into a fraction, remember tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc. Put the number after the decimal over 1 followed by the same number of zeroes
To turn a decimal into a percentage, multiply by 100 and add a % sign. To turn a decimal into a fraction put the digits over a denominator in multiples of 10. For instance: 0.5=5/10 0.55=55/100 0.555=555/1000 Then you can simplify the fraction if you want or if it's required. Decimal into a percent, just multiply by 100 (or move the decimal two places to the left). For example: 0.25 = 25% 0.375 = 37.5% 0.875 = 87.5% To turn a decimal into a fraction, remember tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc. Put the number after the decimal over 1 followed by the same number of zeroes
Step 1: Find a number you can multiply by the bottom of the fraction to make it 10, or 100, or 1000, or any 1 followed by 0s. Step 2: Multiply both top and bottom by that number. Step 3.
