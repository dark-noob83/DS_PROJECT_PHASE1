Watts = volts x amps a 12volt battery needs an incoming current of at least 13 volts to charge it; 13.5 volts is better. so if the output VOLTAGE of the panel is less than 13 volts it wont do anything. Even if it is, 10 / 13.5 = .74 amp.(three quarters). A deep cycle marine battery will typically be more than 40Ah. A 40Ah car battery at 50% charge will more than likely start your car in fair weather. Cold weather is another story. So, to get a completely dead car battery to 50% - 20Ah-would be maybe two days of full sunlight-with only a 50% charge, or about 12.2 Volts.
The weatherproofing includes UV protection and protects from weather effects of -35°F-175°F (-37°C - 79°C). How long does it take to charge a battery? This solar panel can generate 1.34 Amps per hour under ideal conditions. For example, under ideal conditions, the panel will generate 20 Watts x 7 hours x 7 days per week for a total of 980 Watts of power. You can connect multiple panels together to decrease overall charging time. By adding a second panel of the same output you will double your output and half the length of the charge time.
Most solar panels are 12 volt so use the same equation to find out how many amps the panel makes. 80W = 12V * X Amps 80/12 = 6.67 amps A 50 Amp Hour battery takes 50 hours to charge at 1 amp, 25 hours to charge at 2 amps, and 50/X hours to charge at X amps, just like the discharge calculation above. 50/6.67=7.5 hours. Now most CFLs are 120 volts AC and not 12 volts DC like the battery, so I assume you have an inverter to make 120V AC power from the battery. The inverter will not be 100% efficient so the lights will last a little less than the full 23 hours.
That depends on how much the solar panel has charged the battery. A 45 watt solar panel is certainly not suitable as a whole-house power source. However, 45 watts of power can be of benefit for some applications. The most common is a 350ah battery. This means it can provide 35 amps of power over the course of ten hours of usage. When it comes to the best solar panel needed to charge a deep cycle battery, a 12 volt panel is the most common that is used.
You have a 2 Watt, 6 Volt panel and a 1,000 mAh, 3.7V battery, how long does it take to completely charge? The quick and very wrong answer would be to figure out the Watt hours of the battery (3.7 * 1Ah = 3.7 Watt hours) and divide. The reality is about 2.5 times longer. It depends on the Voltage of your panel, the size of the car battery, your charge controller that you’re using and the weather conditions. You should be able to do it in about a day of full sun though.
How to charge a 12 volt battery using Solar Power. Learn how to charge any 12 volt battery using the power from the sun! How much battery in volt amperes hours by solar panels for computer using. can you send detail product to my email hisamks@yahoo.com.my. i would like to buy. 5 watts for an hour isn't quite enough to charge a battery... especially a fairly large one like that I have a 6 volt flashlight battery that I charge with my solar panel and it takes ... oh, I don't know... like 2-3 days for full charge...
5. How long does it take to charge the solar charger from the sun? SCOUT: Theoretical (1500 mAh) battery charge from 0% to 50% takes 2,5 hours in ideal conditions. Power absorption of the Li-Po battery slows down in the end of its charging cycle, causing the battery to charge up from 50% to 100% in a longer period. 
Amp Hours, or Ah, is the capacity of the battery. How much current a battery can delivery starting a car is called cold cranking amps. A deep cycle marine battery will typically be more than 40Ah. A 40Ah car battery at 50% charge will more than likely start your car in fair weather. Cold weather is another story. So, to get a completely dead car battery to 50% - 20Ah-would be maybe two days of full sunlight-with only a 50% charge, or about 12.2 Volts.
How long does it take to charge a battery? This solar panel can generate 1 Amp per hour under ideal conditions. For example, under ideal conditions, the panel will generate 15 Watts x 7 hours x 7 days per week for a total of 735 Watts of power. You can connect multiple panels together to decrease overall charging time.
