It's always annoying if you try to upload an image file and it won't let you, for the simple fact that it isn't a Jpeg. You don't have to be a computer whiz to convert your pictures -- you just have to know a few tricks of the trade.
Just follow these steps: 1  Make a backup of your original file. 2  Double-click the BMP image, and it will open in Preview. 3  Click File, then Save As. 4  With the Format drop-down selector, choose the format you want, such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc. 5  Click Save.
To export photos: Select the photo or photos you want to export. At the top of the Export Photos window, click the File Export button. To specify the file type for the exported photo, choose an option from the Kind pop-up menu: Original: Exports the photo as it was originally imported into iPhoto, before editing.

If you save a Word document that has an image in it as a web page, it will put the images in a separate file. If they are not jpg files you can convert them. As a test I just tried inserting jpg into a Word document and saving it as a web page.
That's all you have to do to convert a BMP image to a JPEG or PNG format. For the record, here are two screenshots to show what the Preview Save-As menu looks like. First, the menu as it appears when you first choose the Save-As option: Next, here are the image format options on my current Mac OS X 10.6.7 system:
If you want to resave it to another format, select the picture, right click it, click “Save as Picture” and save in the jpeg format to“My Pictures” folder, which will open, or select another folder or the Desktop for the picture to be saved to.
