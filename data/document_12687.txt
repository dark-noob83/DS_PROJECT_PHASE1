average system costs $ 95 per square foot average solar panel output 10 6 watts per square foot average solar energy system costs $ 8 95 per watt in order to compare the solar energy costs to conventional hydrocarbon fuels we must covert the $ 8 95 per into kwh the $ 9000 per kw for solar is not very helpful in comparing electric generation costs to other fuels like coal or gas since coal oil and gas can be measured on a cost per kwh we should measure solar costs on a kwh basis
in hawaii electricity costs $ 0 38 per kilowatt hour almost three times the national average solar power which costs as much as $ 0 30 per kilowatt hour is a bargain in comparison however in ohio where power costs around $ 0 14 per kilowatt hour roughly the u s average solar doesn t compete nearly as well so it s no wonder solar projects fell off a cliff when ohio passed senate bill 310 for example last year clean technica estimated that power from a solar panel installation in los angeles would have cost around $ 0 11 per kilowatt hour however take out government incentives and the price jumped over 40 % to $ 0 19
1 ton of coal costs $ 36 $ 0 006 per kwh 1 barrel of oil costs $ 70 $ 0 05 per kwh 1 cubic foot of gas $ 0 008 $ 0 03 per kwh in comparison to solar energy the hydrocarbon fuel costs are significantly lower without rebates tax benefits nor the cost of carbon emissions a two kilowatt kw solar energy system costs about $ 45000 and covers roughly half of a typical american household s energy needs the $ 9000 per kw for solar is not very helpful in comparing electric generation costs to other fuels like coal or gas since coal oil and gas can be measured on a cost per kwh we should measure solar costs on a kwh basis
we assume that as the national market for solar grows regional variation in prices will become insignificant based on these assumptions the levelized cost of solar today without any incentives varies from around $ 0 19 per kilowatt hour kwh in los angeles to $ 0 29 per kwh in seattle for more discussion on the cost of solar see the appendix or for some context see the sensitivity analysis the cost of these incentives is not insignificant for example the federal tax credit allows solar projects to get back 30 % of the installed cost claimed by nearly all solar projects in 2010 the tax credit amounted to nearly $ 1 6 billion for 878 megawatts of solar at an average price of $ 6 20 per watt
solar power cost per kwh a useful figure to use when looking at solar is cost per kwh as this can be directly compared to your current power bill a national renewable energy laboratory report spanning 7 u s states gives a levelised cost of solar of between $ 0 28 and $ 0 46 per kwh for residential solar systems an example the levelised cost of solar electricity in the 7 u s states calculated earlier drops to from between $ 0 28 and $ 0 46 per kwh to between $ 0 16 and $ 0 31 per kwh with the federal investment tax credit 3 many u s residents are eligible for additional federal and local government subsidies on top of the itc
the cost of the tax credit will reach $ 22 billion a year by 2016 and the tax credit isn t the only subsidy the federal government estimates that accelerated depreciation for solar and geothermal projects costs about $ 300 million per year forecast to rise to $ 7 billion by 2016 the cost of these incentives is not insignificant for example the federal tax credit allows solar projects to get back 30 % of the installed cost claimed by nearly all solar projects in 2010 the tax credit amounted to nearly $ 1 6 billion for 878 megawatts of solar at an average price of $ 6 20 per watt
39 texas utility austin energy is going to be paying 5 cents per kilowatt hour for solar power and it could mean lower customer rates city owned austin energy is about to sign a 25 year ppa with sun edison for 150 megawatts of solar power at just below 5 cents per kilowatt hour austin energy has suggested that the pv deal will slightly lower rates for customers this is one of the lowest if not the lowest reported prices for contracted solar that we have seen last year first solar fslr entered a 25 year ppa in new mexico for 50 megawatts of solar power at 5 79 cents per kilowatt hour that number included a significant ptc from the state
incentives differ between countries and states an example the levelised cost of solar electricity in the 7 u s states calculated earlier drops to from between $ 0 28 and $ 0 46 per kwh to between $ 0 16 and $ 0 31 per kwh with the federal investment tax credit 3 many u s residents are eligible for additional federal and local government subsidies on top of the itc
at $ 45000 a solar energy system equates to $ 9000 a kilowatt the $ 9000 per kw for solar is not very helpful in comparing electric generation costs to other fuels like coal or gas since coal oil and gas can be measured on a cost per kwh we should measure solar costs on a kwh basis
