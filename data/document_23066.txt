As the only true 2-way humidity control, Boveda has been exploding in the medical cannabis market because it maximizes efficacy, aroma, color and flavor while promoting a cooler burn. Boveda has become a staple in many dispensaries, grow operations and personal storage because you can now store cannabis indefinitely.
Grow it, dry it, package it with Boveda. You get perfect long term curing for the best possible cannabis. While 3rd party testing has determined the ideal storage humidity at 59-63% RH based on maximizing color, aroma and flavor, we offer a variety of RH levels to suit individual preference.
At humidity levels lower than 45%, the marijuana will dry too fast and the taste will suffer. At humidity levels higher than 55%, the marijuana will take a long time to dry, and it will be prone to mold. Keep a hygrometer and a thermometer in the drying area, close to the plants. A hygrometer will allow you to keep an eye on the relative humidity level in the room and a thermometer will display the temperature.
Humidity and temperature in your marijuana grow room. It is important to know that the amount of absorbable water depends on the temperature. With a temperature of 68°F (20°C), the air can absorb a maximum of 7.2 ml of water.
Just keep the temperature within the optimum range and your weeds will be fine. Humidity should be from 45% to 55%. If humidity is below 45% the marijuana will dry too quickly. Yes, you saved time but as consequence your weed will taste bad. However, a humidity level of over 55% will trigger the development of mold. Your best weapons for these predicaments are the thermometer and hygrometer.
With that said, Boveda (formerly Humidipak) has developed a solution that can make long-term cannabis storage much easier. Founded in 1997, Boveda’s patented 2-way humidity control has becoming a trusted option to maximize the storage of wooden instruments, electronics, food, herbs, and more.
