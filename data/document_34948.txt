1 Roth IRA: Roth IRAs are non-deductible, which means you use post-tax money to fund your account. 2  However, the distributions made during retirement age are tax exempt, which is the main reason people invest in a Roth IRA. 3  As with the Traditional IRA, early withdrawals may incur stiff penalties. After you have put in enough money to get the match, I would consider investing in a Roth IRA if you are eligible. Roth IRAs are beneficial because you will be able to withdraw this money tax free in retirement. Doing this diversifies your future tax liabilities by having a taxable and non-taxable retirement funds.
Personally, I think it is still a good idea to invest in the 401(k) and Roth IRA. We have maxed out our contributions for many years now and built a respectable retirement portfolio for our age. Mrs. RB40 will continue to max out her 401(k) contribution as long as she can. Those are the reasons why I like investing in the 401(k) and Roth IRA. The money is (somewhat) off limits until I’m 60, but that’s fine. These retirement funds are for the 60+ phase of my life. Fortunately, we also have investments in our taxable accounts.
Most people who consider investing assume that they should invest in Roth IRA because the investment will never be taxed again. However, the tax advantage of the 401k plan is still substantial even with no company matching. Let’s use an excel sheet to calculate which one is better for an average investor. The 401(k) portfolio grew to $815,558 at age 60 and the Roth IRA $611,668. We need to zoom into the withdrawal period to see the differences between the two. This graph shows the income after tax. The 401(k) plan has a bit of advantage here due to the lower tax rate after retirement.
For 2013, you can contribute the maximum to a Roth IRA if your adjusted gross income (AGI) is at or below $112,000 for single filers and $178,000 for married couples filing jointly. 4. A traditional IRA contribution for 2013 is fully deductible for single filers with a modified AGI of $59,000 or below. 
The 2014 contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $5,500 for normal contributions, and $1,000 additional contribution as a catch up if you are over age 50. In 2015 those limits will be adjusted for inflation, but those limits haven't been announced yet. 
As we expected the 401(k) portfolio grew much more than the Roth IRA because you start out with more money invested. The 401(k) portfolio grew to $815,558 at age 60 and the Roth IRA $611,668. We need to zoom into the withdrawal period to see the differences between the two. This graph shows the income after tax. The 401(k) plan has a bit of advantage here due to the lower tax rate after retirement.
The Roth IRA investor withdraws $30,583 and keeps the whole amount. We can see that if you invest in 401(k), you’ll have more retirement income even after tax. $4,000 might not seem like a large amount, but it is over 10% difference in income. In fact, the retiree will enjoy a total of $63,000 extra by investing in the 401(k) instead of the Roth IRA. The 401(k) portfolio grew to $815,558 at age 60 and the Roth IRA $611,668. We need to zoom into the withdrawal period to see the differences between the two. This graph shows the income after tax. The 401(k) plan has a bit of advantage here due to the lower tax rate after retirement.
There are income limits for Roth IRAs, so if your income is above those limits, then it's a no-brainer: a traditional IRA is the only one for you. Let's say you're eligible for both a Roth and a traditional IRA. Generally, you're better off in a traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire. 
Another Roth IRA advantage is you can withdraw your contributions anytime, without penalty (but not your earnings). For example, if you add $5,000 of your own money to a Roth IRA and your investments earn $6,000, you can withdraw up to $5,000 – the amount you put in. This can be really important, especially if you need to access that money in the event of an emergency. The case is not the same for a 401(k). There are limits to how much money you can contribute to a Roth IRA. For 2014, you can contribute up to $5,500, or $6,500 if you’re over 50. Contribute any more than that, and the IRS will tax you on an excess IRA contribution. A 401(k), on the other hand, allows you to contribute up to $17,500
