Reputation: 222. Dallas traffic is moderately heavy from 6 a.m. to about 7:15, but it rapidly becomes heavier after 7 a.m. It is my opinion, based on watching people drive, that many people find even moderate traffic off-putting.
I often go to the gym before work so I am often on the road between 5:45-6:15am and there is very little slowdowns. I travel north on I35E mostly during that time. It looks like it's moving pretty smoothly south at that time too but I'm not sure. I think for the most part traffic is a lot better before 7am. 635 can get clogged about pretty quick as soon as 7am hits, in my experience, but I avoid that thing like the plague between 35 and 75 so I'm not sure since I don't go on it much.
Southbound traffic on I-35 slows to a crawl in this 1007 photo as motorists approach the split at I-30 in downtown Dallas. Traffic in Dallas-Fort Worth is a mess — among the most congested in the nation — and it’s costing North Texas motorists hours of free time, hundreds of dollars and untold amounts of stress.

And Dallas-Fort Worth’s Travel Time Index rating was 1.26 in 2011, meaning that a 20-minute trip in light traffic took 25.2 minutes during peak times. The rating — about the same as Houston’s – was close to the 1.25 in 2010, but a big improvement over the 1.32 rating in 2006.
Once you are clear of Fort Worth it is clear.... clear of traffic, clear of scenery, clear of life. It looks like the posts before me describe traffic on other highways in the areas that are much more prone to traffic congestion. Source(s): Lived in Arlington for 20 years.
