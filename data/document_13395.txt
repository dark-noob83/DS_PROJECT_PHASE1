the average electricity consumption of a us family of four is in the neighborhood of 50 kwh per day or 1500 kwh per month similar figures apply for canada assuming an average electricity cost of $ 0 12 per kwh that translates into about $ 6 per day for electricity or $ 180 per month 
the average household in the united states uses about 8900 kilowatt hours of electricity each year there are 9000 hours in a year so 9e3 kwatt hour 9e3 about 1kw average usage averaged over time is 1000 watts at 10 per kw hr that is 10 per hour or $ 2 40 per day or $ 900 per year best answer the average household in america consumes about 14000 kilowatt hours kwh per year according to the department of energy
according to the energy information administration s statistics the per capita energy consumption in the us has been somewhat consistent from the 1970s to today the average has been 334 million british thermal units btus per person from 1980 to 2010 from the beginning of the united states until 1973 total energy including electrical use increased by about 3 % year while population increased an average of 2 2 % year per capita energy use from 1730 to 1870 was about 100 million btu person
how much electricity does an american home use in 2013 the average annual electricity consumption for a u s residential utility customer was 10908 kilowatthours kwh an average of 909 kwh per month louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15270 kwh and hawaii had the lowest at 6176 kwh 
the average electricity consumption is 4800 kwh per household 36 a smaller than average household is taken arbitrarily to be 3000 kwh i e roughly two thirds of the average and a larger than average household to be 7000 kwh i e roughly 50 % more 
but there s another value listed how much energy you actually used if you are a perfectly average american living in a perfectly average household your monthly electricity bill will read 903 kilowatt hours kwh which costs $ 107 per household but most of us don t live in perfectly average households the state that comes closest to matching the average monthly electricity usage is ohio depending on whether a state is hot or cold urban or rural an average household can use as little as 531 kwh a month maine or as much as 1245 kwh louisiana costs vary state by state too hawaiians pay the most for electricity $ 203 a month and new mexicans pay the least $ 75 a month
surprisingly the average person drives 37 miles per day and the average car mpg in 2008 was 25 mpg so that s about 1 5 gallons per person just on driving this means a per household fuel usage of gas is likely double that 3 gallons so on average we use about 4 times as much energy driving than we use in our home best answer the average household in america consumes about 14000 kilowatt hours kwh per year according to the department of energy
domestic energy consumption or domestic consumption of energy is the amount of energy that is spent on the various appliances used within housing the amount of energy used per household varies widely depending on the standard of living of the country climate and the age and type of residence in the united states as of 2008 in an average household in a temperate climate the yearly use of household energy can be composed as follows 
household electricity use 6000 kwh per household per year for 3 residents average per household so the household use per capita is 2000 kwh or about of per capita electricity from all applications household natural gas use 400 therms per household x 30 give 12000 kwh equivalent electricity since much of the electricity is generated by natural gas it is not totally unreasonable to compare these two in kilowatt hours
in the us typical household power consumption is about 11700 kwh each year in france it is 6400 kwh in the uk it is 4600 kwh and in china around 1300 kwh the global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3500 kwh in 2010
