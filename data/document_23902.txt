Sea stars, commonly called, starfish, are not fish. There are approximately 2,000 species of sea star, all of which live in marine waters. Sea stars live underwater, but that is where their resemblance to fish ends. They do not have gills, scales, or fins. Also, sea stars move by using tiny tube feet located on the underside of their bodies. Adult sunflower sea stars can move at the astonishing speed of one meter per minute using 15,000 tube feet. Tube feet also help sea stars hold their prey.
The underside of the body bears a mouth at the center and a groove running along each arm. The grooves contain rows of tiny, flexible appendages called tube feet. Sea stars move by means of the tube feet, which are operated by a hydraulic, or water-vascular, system unique to echinoderms. 
Many echinoderms have suckers on the ends of their feet that are used to capture and hold prey, and to hold onto rocks in a swift current. Sea Stars Sea stars (group name Stelleroidea) are sometimes called starfish, though they are not real fish (they lack both vertebrae and fins). There are two sub-types of sea stars: 1  Asteroideas are the true sea stars and sun stars. 2  Ophiuroideas are brittle stars and basket stars.
Sea stars used to be called starfish, but they're not fish at all. They're echinoderms, members of the same club as sea urchins, sea cucumbers, sea lilies and sand dollars. When most sea stars reproduce, they release their swimming larvae to the sea. But the blood star (Herica) holds on to her eggs, forming a pouch with her arms to protect her young. She holds them there, hunched over, until they are fully formed and ready to be released.
Sea urchin shell, or 'test'. Each white band is the location of a row of tube feet; each pair of white bands is called an ambulacrum. There are five such ambulacra; the penta-radial symmetry reveals a kinship with sea stars. Tube feet function in locomotion, feeding and respiration. The tube feet in a sea star are arranged in grooves along the arms. They operate through hydraulic pressure. They are used to pass food to the oral mouth at the center, and can attach to surfaces.
The grooves contain rows of tiny, flexible appendages called tube feet. Sea stars move by means of the tube feet, which are operated by a hydraulic, or water-vascular, system unique to echinoderms. Seawater, circulated through the radiating canals of this system, enters and extends the tube feet. sea star, also called starfish, echinoderm of the class Asteroidae, common in tide pools.

Each sea star had hundreds of tiny feet on the bottom of each ray. These are tube feet, or podia. These tiny feet can be filled with sea water. The vascular system of the sea star is also filled with sea water. By moving water from the vascular system into the tiny feet, the sea star can make a foot move by expanding it. This is how sea stars move around. Muscles within the feet are used to retract them. Each ray of a sea star has a light sensitive organ called an eyespot.

â€¢ Sea stars move using their tube feet. Sea stars move using hundreds of tube feet, which are located on their underside. The tube feet are filled with sea water, which the sea star brings in through the sieve plate, or madreporite, on its top side. Sea stars can move more quickly than you might expect. Instead of blood, sea stars have a water vascular system, in which the sea star pumps sea water through its sieve plate, or madreporite, into its tube feet to extend them. Muscles within the tube feet retract them. Sea star crawling back to the ocean after washing up on the beach. Hilton Head, SC.
