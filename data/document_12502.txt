RE: PVC Cat5 price per drop. If you have a good supplier that sells brand name stuff at a discount then you can calculate $100.00 per drop assuming the pathways are in place. Then add 500.00 on the the cost for patch panel(s) and rack. So for you I'd estimate $2500.00.
The project parameters indicate that roughly $500 of cable is required, and the average electrician costs will be roughly $50 per point of connection-meaning that another $500 will be necessary for proper installation.
A cable modem can vary greatly in cost. Anywhere from 40-230 dollars is a very good estimate. But, when you contract for one and have it installed, you will never wish to do w â€¦ ithout.
RE: Price per drop survey info requested-Thanks guys!! Based on that type of cable which is around $700 per 1000 ft from what I can find on Google and an average of 100 ft per run I would estimate around $300-$350 per location based on those numbers. Those numbers can drop if you can get a good rate on a bulk cable deal.

The cost of cabling to cat6 is $250 for every one thousand feet. For this discussion we will look at the costs of installing ten lines of Cat6 (with an average of 200 feet per line) the average home office to such service.
