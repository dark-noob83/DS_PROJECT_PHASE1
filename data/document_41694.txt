However, air-cooled chiller installed costs are typically lower than water-cooled chiller installed costs. In general, price per ton goes down as cooling capacity goes up, and price per ton goes up as efficiency goes up. Two manufacturers report that high-efficiency models tend to run 10 to 15 percent more, and adding a VFD to the chiller adds approximately $50 per ton. www.FPL.com Air-Cooled Chillers | 3. 
Forage Calculator. Calculating forages on a cost per ton of dry matter allows price comparisons between differing bale sizes and moisture levels of forage. Confusion about bale weights and moisture can easily lead to misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the true cost of buying feed. 
For example, assume a summer grass hay price of $100 per ton and an unimproved bluegrass pasture yield of from one to one and one-half tons per acre (Table 1). The rental rate per acre is from $25 ($100 per ton x 25 percent x 1 ton per acre = $25.00) to $37.50($100 per ton x 25 percent x 1.5 tons per acre = $37.50). A rental rate per AUM can be figured by using the current hay price and the quality rating of the pasture. Four forage quality ratings are shown in Table 3. For example, let’s assume the pasture is brome (tallgrass) pasture. Also, assume the average grass hay price during the summer is $100 per ton. The rental rate per AUM is $20 ($100 x .20). If 10, 000 1,000-pound cows with a calf by their side are pastured for three months, 30 AUMs of pasture are used during the summer. The rent is $600 (30 AUMs x $20 per AUM) for the summer
Q: What is the cost to a community to develop and build a WTE facility? A: Depending on the location, size, and other factors, the average capital cost per annual ton of capacity is estimated at about $650/annual ton (500 Euro). Since WTE plants have an overall availability of 330 24-hr days per year, on a daily basis the capital cost is $600*330= about $200,000 per daily ton of capacity. Of course, the capital cost may be lower or higher, depending on location and size of plant.
A ton of ice. The cooling capacity of air conditioners is usually measured in tons. One ton equals 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. The term one ton comes from the amount of heat required to melt a block of ice that weighs one ton. We don't want to increase the air speed beyond 500 feet per minute (about 5 miles per hour) or we'll get excessive noise and uncomfortable drafts in the home. Air conditioning systems typically move 400 to 450 cubic feet of air per minute per ton through a system.
All annual allowance prices and levelized values are reported in 2014 dollars per short ton of CO 2.  The Low case forecasts a CO 2 price that begins in 2020 at $15 per ton, and increases to $25 in 2030 and $45 in 2050, representing a $26 per ton levelized price over the period 2020‐2050. 
(Redirected from Refrigeration ton). A ton of refrigeration (commonly abbreviated as TR) is a unit of power used in some countries (especially in North America) to describe the heat-extraction capacity of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. It is equivalent to the consumption of one ton of ice per day and originated during the transition from stored natural ice to mechanical refrigeration. A refrigeration ton is approximately equivalent to 12,000 BTU / h or 3.517 kW. Air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment capacity in the U.S. is often specified in tons (of refrigeration). Many manufacturers also specify capacity in BTU / h, especially when specifying the performance of smaller
1 Average sales price of coal from U.S. mines decreased from $39.95 per short ton in 2012 to $37.24 per short ton in 2013 (6.8% lower than 2012). 2  Total U.S. coal stocks decreased 16.1% to 200.4 million short tons, a decrease of 38.4 million short tons. 1 The electric power sector consumed about 92.8% of the total U.S. coal consumption in 2013. 2
