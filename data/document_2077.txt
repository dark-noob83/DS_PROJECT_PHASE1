As Kidneys are the Purifying organs in Humans, it receieves blood from the Renal Vein and purifies the blood, the waste material in blood and water is filtered in the kidneys and that's how it produces Urine. The process of urine production is complex. The kidneys are composed of units, Nephrons.
(Answer #1). The renal artery carries blood into the kidneys, which once there is filtered by nephrons. The waste filtered by these nephrons is combined with water to make urine. As the urine is produced it drains out of a tube called the ureter and collects in the bladder. Once your bladder is about half way fill your body signals you that you have to urinate. The urine exits your body through a tube called the urethra.
The kidneys filter the blood to remove wastes and produce urine. The ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra together form the urinary tract, which acts as a plumbing system to drain urine from the kidneys, store it, and then release it during urination.
Nephrons then filter that inside the kidneys. That produces urine which is 96% water, 4% urea and other wastes. Uret â€¦ ers pass the urine from each kidney to the bladder that holds urine. Then it goes through the urethra and out of the body.
The urine 24-hour volume test measures the amount of urine produced in a day. The amount of creatinine, protein, and other chemicals released into the urine during this period is often tested.
Storage and Excretion of Wastes. After urine has been produced by the kidneys, it is transported through the ureters to the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder fills with urine and stores it until the body is ready for its excretion.
