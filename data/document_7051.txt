There are several different types of volcanoes: steep stratovolcanoes, wide shield volcanoes, and mounded lava domes. The shape of a volcano actually depends on the types of lava that it’s made up of. And so, there are several different types of lava.
Volcanoes are grouped into four types: cinder cones, composite volcanoes, shield volcanoes and lava volcanoes. They are: Cinder Cones: They are circular or oval cones made up … of small fragments of lava from a single vent. They have been blown into the air, cooled, and fallen around the vent.
There are four different types of volcanoes. A volcano is categorized both by formation and appearance. Different types of volcanoes also indicate the types of expected eruptions. The different types of volcanoes are: composite (or stratovolcanoes), shield, cinder cones and spatter cones. Throughout the world, one can see pictures of the four types of volcanoes, each type indicative of the active underground world we often view as static.
There are three main types of volcano-composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite Volcanoes. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows. The eruptions from these volcanoes may be a pyroclastic flow rather than a flow of lava. A pyroclastic flow is a superheated mixture of hot steam, ash, rock and dust.
