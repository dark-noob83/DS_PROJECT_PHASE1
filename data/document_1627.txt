Research does not support the theory that carbohydrates from wheat, other grains, or starchy vegetables are the source of injury that leads to chronic inflammation. In contrast, scientific research does solidly support that the source of injury leading to chronic inflammation is animal foods. 
Many anti-inflammatory diets are based around whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fresh vegetables and fruits, wild fish and seafood, grass-fed lean turkey and chicken which are thought to aid in the bodies healing of inflammation. They exclude foods that are thought. Research supports that diets high in sugar produce acute oxidative stress within the cells, associating it with inflammation. Elimination of high sugar foods such as sodas, soft drinks, pastries, presweetened cereals and candy has been shown to be beneficial. As well as switching from refined grains to whole grains.
If you have tried low-carb diet trends that drastically limit carbohydrate foods such as whole grains, it is highly unlikely that you are getting enough fiber, which not only plays an important factor in reducing inflammation, but also disrupts the probiotic conditions of your gut. Both phytonutrients and antioxidants help reduce oxidative stress, which indirectly reduce inflammation. Whole grains are also key source of fiber, which plays an important role in reducing inflammation. In fact, simply increasing intake of fiber has been shown to lower inflammation and C-reactive protein (5).
Anti-inflammatory eating. To reduce levels of inflammation, aim for an overall healthy diet. If you're looking for an eating plan that closely follows the tenets of anti-inflammatory eating, consider the Mediterranean diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. Foods that combat inflammation. Include plenty of these anti-inflammatory foods in your diet: tomatoes. olive oil. green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and collards. nuts like almonds and walnuts. fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines. fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, cherries, and orange
An anti-inflammatory diet should include the following guidelines: 1  Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. 2  Eat a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish or fish oil supplements and walnuts. 3  Eat plenty of whole grains such as brown rice and bulgur wheat. Healthy fats from olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, as well as omega-3 from fatty fish, walnuts and flax seed are also important. Getting enough dietary fiber is also important and should be gotten from many of the whole foods already mentioned, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds.
An anti-inflammatory diet should consist primarily of whole foods with an emphasis on plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. Healthy fats from olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, as well as omega-3 from fatty fish, walnuts and flax seed are also important. Getting enough dietary fiber is also important and should be gotten from many of the whole foods already mentioned, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds.
Of the 22 studies, one found neither inflammatory nor anti-inflammatory effects from whole grains. One involved a diet with large quantities of refined grains and therefore did not sufficiently address the question under consideration. For anyone wishing to know whether whole grains are inflammatory, a search of PubMed (a National Library of Medicine database) is highly recommended. Using the search terms “inflammation” and “whole grains,” a PubMed search (March 17, 2010) yielded 22 references.
Inflammation is part of the body’s immune response; without it, we can't heal. But when it's out of controlas in rheumatoid arthritisit can damage the body. Plus, it's thought to play a role in obesity, heart disease, and cancer. Foods high in sugar and saturated fat can spur inflammation.
Sedentary lifestyle, lack of sleep -- we have these repetitive insults that increase longer-term inflammation, says Jessica Black, N.D., author of The Anti-Inflammatory Diet and Recipe Book. The foods we choose to eat -- or not to eat -- can also affect inflammation. Getting your fair share of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat and omega-3 fatty acids -- similar, yes, to the Mediterranean diet -- has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory effects. Diet can serve as a protective function, says Sandquist.
