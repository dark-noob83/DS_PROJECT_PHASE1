Caveat emptor! Laguiole is not a brand: it's the name of the small town where Laguiole knives originated in 1829. The name, the Bee and design of the knife were never protected: Laguiole knives can be made anywhere and quality varies greatly. Our Laguiole are made by Jean Neron, a family business in Thiers, the French capital of cutlery. These are 100% handcrafted, not machine-made.
