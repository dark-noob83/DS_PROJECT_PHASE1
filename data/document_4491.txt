Milk Fever (Hypocalcaemia). Milk fever is a misnomer. It is not a fever, and doesn't always have to do with milk production. It is actually low blood calcium, which is known as hypocalcaemia.
Eclampsia, also called milk fever or puerperal tetany, is an acute, life-threatening disease caused by low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) in dogs and more rarely in cats. The lactating animal is especially susceptible to blood calcium depletion because of milk production.

Milk fever is probably the most common metabolic disorder in dairy cattle. The condition usually occurs just before, during or immediately after parturition. This condition is also likely to be the most common cause of apparent sudden death in dairy cows, and is a common cause of dystocia and stillborn calves.
Milk fever, postparturient hypocalcemia, or parturient paresis is a disease, usually of dairy cows, characterized by reduced blood calcium levels (see: Hypocalcemia). It is most common in the first few days of lactation, when demand for calcium for milk production exceeds the bodyâ€™s ability to mobilize calcium reserves.
Milk fever (or hypcalcaemia) is the result of a reduction of blood calcium in the early stages of lactation. This is due to the cow having a sudden, dramatically increased demand for calcium to produce milk.
