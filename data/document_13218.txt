The Surinam is found primarily in Northern South America whereas the Amazon Basin Emerald is found along the Amazon River basin from southern Surinam, southern Guyana, southern Venezuela to Colombia, Peru and Brazil into the surrounding jungle of the river. The Amazon Basin Emerald is a more desirable animal from a collectors' standpoint due to their impressive size, striking coloration and gentle nature. Our collection is focused entirely on this magnificent tree boa with the objective of selectively producing high white, deep emerald green animals.

The Amazon River basin is about 4,195 miles long, covering about 2,720,000 square miles in area, including its 15,000 tributaries and subtributaries (four of which are in excess of 1,000 miles long). It is the largest river basin in the world. The source of the Amazon is the lake, Lauricocha, in the Peruvian Andes. The width of the river ranges from one mile to 35 miles. The city at the heart of the basin, Manaus, has an altitude of only 144 feet. The average level of the basin is 300 feet above sea level. In the Amazon Basin, flooding often occurs between June and October. The climate is warm and humid, with an average temperature of 79 degrees and an average yearly rainfall of 80 inch
The Amazon basin (the watershed of the Amazon River) is 7,050,000 km2 in area (or about 2,500,000 miles2), and covers about 40% of South America. Of this area, approximately 5,000,000 km2 is (or was) covered by high tropical rainforest, with the remainder covered by savannah (campo) or scrubby woodland (cerrado). The Amazon basin covers significant portions of the countries of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Bolivia, though the major part of the watershed lies within Brazil. The next largest tropical watershed, that of the Congo River, at 3,690,000 km2, is only half the size of the Amazon basin.
The Amazon basin is bounded by the Guiana Highlands to the north and the Brazilian Highlands to the south. The Amazon River, which rises in the Andes Mountains at the west of the basin, is usually considered to be the second longest river in the world. However, a team of Brazilian scientists claim that the Amazon is the longest river in the world.
