A general recommendation is that the temperature be held constant in the range of 21-23°C (69-73°F). In summertime when outdoor temperatures are higher it is advisable to keep air-conditioned offices slightly warmer to minimize the temperature discrepancy between indoors and outdoors. 
However, in settings for general office work, temperatures between 20°-24°C is generally found to be a comfortable temperature in winter when employees are wearing winter clothes. In the summer months, temperatures between 23°-26°C is generally comfortable when staff are wearing lightweight clothes. 1 The Australian Standard AS 1837 – 1976 Code of practice for application of ergonomics to factory and office work recommends an average temperature range of between 20°-24°C for both offices and factories in summer. 2  In winter, the temperature should be approximately 2°C lower to account for extra clothing.
The majority of research has shown an optimal office temperature between 70 and 73 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 23 degrees Celsius) provides the best air temperature for maximum office worker productivity. There have been a number of studies conducted to determine what temperature your office thermostat should be set at for optimal productivity across your workforce. And it should come as no surprise that the more studies that are done the more disagreement there is as to what that temperature is.
1 70-72ºF (21-22ºC) is the temperature range that will make you the most productive. 2  Any temperature above 73º decreases your productivity. 3  At 86º and above, your productivity drops to about 90% of what it was before, a 10% decrease. 4  Any temperature below 68º also decreases your productivity. Summer can be harsh on your productivity. A recent survey found that during the summer, workplace productivity drops 20%, attendance drops 18%, project turnaround times increase 13%, and people are 45% more distracted. The temperature of your office has a huge impact on your productivity.
I just typed into a search engine average office temperature and this was the first article to pop up. The search began because my office is currently 77 degrees, my wpm drops when the office reaches this temperature because I am so warm that my fingers slip off of the keys. Many studies suggest that workers are most productive when the office temperature is about 71° or 72° Fahrenheit (21.7° to 22.2° Celsius). Productivity tends to decrease more suddenly as temperatures decrease below 68° Fahrenheit (20° Celsius) and more gradually as temperatures rise past 75° Fahrenheit (23.9° Celsius).
For HadCRUT4, this is 1961-1990. For example, if the 1961-1990 average September temperature for Edinburgh in Scotland is 12 °C and the recorded average temperature for that month in 2009 is 13 °C, the difference of 1 °C is the anomaly and this would be used in the calculation of the global average. Global records go back about 160 years, giving a long period from which to draw conclusions about how our climate is changing. There are three centres that calculate global-average temperature each month. Met Office, in collaboration with the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UK).

Within a certain range of temperatures, workers typically are more productive. When an office is too hot or too cold, workers' productivity typically drops. What is considered the ideal office temperature can vary, but it generally is considered to be 70° to 73° Fahrenheit (21.1° to 22.8° Celsius). Many studies suggest that workers are most productive when the office temperature is about 71° or 72° Fahrenheit (21.7° to 22.2° Celsius). Productivity tends to decrease more suddenly as temperatures decrease below 68° Fahrenheit (20° Celsius) and more gradually as temperatures rise past 75° Fahrenheit (23.9° Celsius).
