NOW Â® Carbo Gain is a 100% pure complex carbohydrate supplement derived from maltodextrin, an easily digestible blend of complex carbohydrates from corn starch. Maltodextrin contains glucose polymers, linked sugar compounds that are easier for the body to assimilate and use. 
Maltodextrin can be found in many supplements. For example, there are powder supplements which contain nutritional ingredients like vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs, and plant extracts. Within these supplements, Maltodextrin is used to provide benefits as a carbohydrate. Maltodextrin can also be found as a supplement by itself. As a supplement by itself its entire purpose is to provide carbohydrates and energy to the body. Maltodextrin can be found in sodas, desserts, cereals, soups, sauces, and artificial sweeteners. In addition to being used as a sweetener, Maltodextrin is used to thicken the consistency of other ingredients. Maltodextrin is somewhat gooey before being broken down into powder form.
Dextrose and maltodextrin are sugars sold as powdered supplements that you can add to post-workout shakes or meals to provide a quick hit of carbs. Both maltodextrin and dextrose process so quickly, they'll both offer the insulin surge you need to hasten muscle growth. Dextrose is usually slightly less expensive than maltodextrin, if cost is a concern. Dextrose tends to taste sweeter than maltodextrin, which could also be a deciding factor for you.
This is obviously counter-productive for bodybuilders. Now, the difference between dextrose & maltodextrin is this: -Dextrose: Glucose[dextrose] - Glucose has a chemical composition of 6 carbons, 12 hydrogen, and 6 Oxygen. This is the only sugar that affects blood sugar. Glucose, when present in excess in the bloodstream is stored in the muscles as Glycogen
1. You may not be aware that maltodextrin is the main component in almost all weight-gain products. It has a significant effect on the enzymatic process which allows individuals to perform better during exercise as well as bulk up on much needed muscle mass.

Maltodextrin is a polysaccharide that is used as a food additive. It is produced from starch by partial hydrolysis and is usually found as a white hygroscopic spray-dried powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose, and might be either moderately sweet or almost flavorless. It is commonly used for the production of sodas and candy. It can also be found as an ingredient in a variety of other processed foods.

Dextrose and Maltodextrin Details. Dextrose is such a simple sugar that your body doesn't have to break it down, so it raises insulin almost instantaneously. It's basically dietary glucose, one type your body breaks all other sugars -- including lactose and sucrose -- into before they can be used. Maltodextrin consists of a string of glucose molecules, which your body easily breaks down so it digests almost as quickly as dextrose. Both maltodextrin and dextrose process so quickly, they'll both offer the insulin surge you need to hasten muscle growth. Dextrose is usually slightly less expensive than maltodextrin, if cost is a concern. Dextrose tends to taste sweeter than maltodextrin, which could also be a deciding factor for you.
