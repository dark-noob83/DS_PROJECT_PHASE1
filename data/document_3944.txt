The HowMuchIsIt.org website says it commonly costs between $2,000 and $5,000 to move a mobile home less than 100 miles.

At minimum, you need to invest in your own domain name and hosting. Depending on the type of domain name you choose, the costs could run from just $10 a year, to hundreds or even millions !

While shared hosting can be as low as $50 per year, moving to a VPS (virtual private server) or a dedicated server can easily bump up the yearly price tag to over $1,000.
