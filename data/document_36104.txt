It takes Saturn 29.45 years (or 10,759 days) to orbit the Sun. Astronomers call the length of time an object takes to go around the Sun its orbital period. So the orbital period of Saturn is 29.45 years. And just like Earth, Saturn goes through seasons as it travels around the Sun. For half of its orbit, the northern hemisphere receives more of the Sun’s radiation, and then for the other half of its orbit, the southern hemisphere is in sunlight.
Confidence votes 496. It takes Saturn 29.45 years (or 10,759 days) to orbit the Sun. Astronomers call the length of time an object takes to go around the Sun its orbital period. How long does it take for Saturn to orbit the sun once? 29 Earth years and 167 Earth days. The planet Saturn takes about 29 1/2 Earth years (29.46 years) to revolve around the Sun in its orbit. It takes Saturn 29.45 years to orbit … the Sun, which works out to  10,759 days. Saturn is the most distant planet in the solar system  that is able to be seen with the naked eye
Orbit and Rotation of Saturn. Saturn’s average distance from the Sun is 1,400,000,000 km. The average orbital speed of Saturn is 9.69 km/s. It takes the earth 365 days to orbit the sun, Saturn takes 10,759 Earth days (or about 29½ years), to revolve around the sun; a year on Saturn is equivalent to 29.5 Earth years. Saturn has an elliptical orbit and is inclined at 2.48°
Different planets take different amounts of time to orbit the sun, depending on how far away they are. Uranus is much further away from the sun than Earth is, and it takes 84.3 Earth years for Uranus to complete its orbit. 
It takes Mars about 687 Earth days (1.882 Earth years) to orbit the  Sun.    The orbital path of Mars is about twice that of Earth. Mars orbits  about 227 million kil … ometers away from the Sun. The planet travels  a distance of approximately 1.43 billion kilometers (888 million  miles) in 686.971 Earth days. It takes 1.88 years for mars to make one revolution around the sun.
Saturn revolves or orbits around the Sun once every 29.4 Earth years, or once every 10,755.7 Earth days. Saturn travels at an average speed of 21,637 miles per hour or 34,821 kilometers per hour in its orbit around the Sun. 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos.

Mercury, the first planet in our solar system can completely orbit around the sun in a mere 88 Earth Days, but nearly takes 60 days to complete a turn of its axis. Venus, which is the closet planet to Earth, takes 224 days to orbit around the sun. Uranus and Neptune are the two farthest planets from the sun and the time it takes for them to orbit around the sun reflects this. Uranus takes 30,7999.09 days to orbit around the sun, which is impressive but cannot compare to the 60,190 days it takes Neptune to complete the same task.
Jupiter orbits the Sun every 11.86 Earth years (or 4,332 days). The longer orbital period for Jupiter is because it orbits at an average distance of 778 million km(Earth orbits at an average of 150 million km). Hubble Jupiter. Above I mentioned Jupiter’s semi-major axis is 778 million km. At perihelion Jupiter can be as close to the Sun as 740,679,835 km and at aphelion it is 816,001,807 km away. Jupiter is tilted on its axis by 3.13 degrees. With such a slight tilt, the planet does not experience seasons.
