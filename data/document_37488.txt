Extraverted Feeling (Fe) vs. Extraverted Thinking (Te). While the content of an Extraverted Feeling expression need not be emotional, there is a discernible difference in its packaging compared to that of Extraverted Thinking (Te) . Te comes across as rather dry, lifeless, and monotonal. It is often devoid of significant fluctuations in volume or expressions of feeling.
C. G. Jung applied the words extravert and introvert in a different manner than they are most often used in today's world. As they are popularly used, the term extraverted is understood to mean sociable or outgoing, while the term introverted is understood to mean shy or withdrawn. Jung, however, originally intended the words to have an entirely different meaning.
