Last Updated: April 22, 2015. Board and care homes typically provide seniors with the same services available in larger assisted living communities; the difference is that these facilities are regular houses in residential neighborhoods that are equipped, adapted and staffed to care for a small number of seniors. Assisted living communities are larger and board and care homes are smaller. A Place for Mom considers senior care facilities that have less than 20 residents and are not nursing homes to be board and care homes. In California specifically, board and care homes are licensed to care for a minimum of six residents.
