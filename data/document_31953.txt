A. Islam. Muslims claim that Muhammad was as great a prophet as Moses and Jesus, but he was the last of the prophets and his revelation replaced that of Jesus. Islam claims that the exact words of the Qur an were given to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel, and therefore the Qur an is verbally inspired. [Qur an 2:97-99; p. xv].
Contacts between Latin America and Islam date back to the 12th century. Muslims discovered America in 1178, not Christopher Columbus, the conservative president said in a televised speech during an Istanbul summit of Muslim leaders from Latin America. Muslim sailors arrived in America from 1178. Columbus mentioned the existence of a mosque on a hill on the Cuban coast, Erdogan said. Erdogan said that Ankara was even prepared to build a mosque at the site mentioned by the Genoese explorer.
Best Answer: Most religious historians view Islam as having been founded in 622 CE by Muhammad the Prophet (peace be upon him).* He lived from about 570 to 632 CE). The religion started in Mecca, when the angel Jibril (a.k.a. Jibreel; Gabriel in English) read the first revelation to Muhammad (pbuh).
Muhammad claimed he had a vision from Allah and was told You are the messenger of Allah.. This began his career as a prophet and he received many messages. By the time Muhammad died, the religion of Islam was exploding.
Islam created by God (Allah, SWT) and Muhammad, SAW is his messenger, and the word Islam in Arabic means Peaceful.
Islam is not a threat to the Jews as it was created by them and renders its practitioners completely spiritually powerless, and on a psychic and subliminal level creates a connection to the Jews. This allows the Jews at the top to control the mind of the people in Islam.
