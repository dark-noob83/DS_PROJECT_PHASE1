My sister-in-law is conplaining about the same thing. Her oven takes 20 minutes to heat up to 350 degrees. I timed our oven last night and it took 7-1/2 minutes. I was suprised it heated up so fast. share | improve this answer. answered Aug 19 '14 at 20:36. user26639. 11 1. add a comment |. up vote 0 down vote. my electric oven takes 25-30 min to reach 350. It takes at least 20 minutes after the I'm fully heated beep before the stone is fully up to temp. We have problems with things baking poorly if we don't preheat for quite a while, but on the upside, if we put a cold roast in or open the door a lot, the temperature in the oven stays pretty high.
Best Answer: it depends on your oven. electric ovens take much longer to heat up than gas ovens. My electric at my old house took 20 to 30 minutes to get to 375 my gas oven in the house im at now takes about 15 to 20 minutes. 
Report Abuse. For most ovens it takes about 10 minutes or so to warm up. I don't know if there is a difference in a gas or electric oven. I would thing that it would be around about the same time give or take a few minutes. Most standard electric cookers can take up to 15 minutes! A fan assisted oven slightly less.. Some say (myself included) that a gas cooker needs little or no time
My modern whirlpool electric oven take forever (about 20min) to heat-up to 200C. This seems similar to other electric ovens I have used in Ireland. Hoever, when visiting my mother in law in the USA, I noticed that her very old(20+ years) electric oven heats up very quickly, about 5 minutes. There are two ovens in my house. A newer oven that might take up to 30 minutes to heat up to 375 F(190.5 C). While my old oven only takes like 10 minutes. I was kind of curious too. â€“ Jay May 9 '12 at 15:42
To heat up fully to the degrees specified (preheat) you should allow 15 minutes from when you turned the oven on. So that way it has already reached the temperature it needs to be for baking rather than just being warm. 
Oven takes forever to heat up. The stove/range has been working good for years. So electrical connection isn't a problem. I guess when I said 20-30 minutes to heat up to temperature was a misunderstatement, it sometimes takes 40-60 minutes to heat up, for both the broiler and oven elements. I can set the thermostat for the oven to 350 degrees and it takes 20-30 minutes to reach desired temperature. But it eventually does, just takes to long. Everything else seems to work otherwise. Stove top, clock, thermostat, timer, etc. all work fine.
I have a Kitchen Aid stove/range, Model No. KEDC205YWH. It takes forever for my oven heating elements (both bottom and broiler) to heat up to temperature.
