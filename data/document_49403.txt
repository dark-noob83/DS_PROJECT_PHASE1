Best Answer: It usually takes 4-6 weeks after you mail it in. You can check the status by calling CRA at 1-800-267-6999. They will ask you a couple of questions like your SIN, birthday and your net income that you calculated on line 150 of your return so have that stuff handy.
I understand that you would like to know that how long does it take netfile Canada tax return. Look if you have filed your returns through the normal paper work then it will take at least six weeks to get the tax refund back.
Processing Times for Tax Refunds. The length of time it takes the CRA to process your income tax return and refund depends on how and when you file your return. Processing Times for Paper Returns. Paper returns usually take four to six weeks to process. For paper tax returns filed before April 15, wait four weeks before you check on your refund. For paper tax returns filed after April 15, wait six weeks before you check. Processing Times for Electronic Returns. Electronic (NETFILE or EFILE) returns can take as little as eight business days to be processed.
The CRA says 6 weeks if you mail it but it is usually a bit longer, given that you filed right at the deadline and so does everyone else. I would expect it by end of June/early July. You can check the status of your refund online through the CRA website's Access. Next year, I suggest filing online via Netfile.
Answer: When you get your Canadian tax refund depends on when and how you filed your Canadian income tax return. The Canada Revenue Agency advises that they usually process paper tax returns in four to six weeks.
