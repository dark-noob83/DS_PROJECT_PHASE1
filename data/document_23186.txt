Doctors associate signs and symptoms of adhesions with the problems an adhesion causes rather than from an adhesion directly. As a result, people experience many complaints based on where an adhesion forms and what it may disrupt. Surgery. Two common surgical techniques used to treat abdominal adhesions are laparoscopy and laparotomy. 1  With laparoscopy, a doctor places a camera into your body through a small hole in the skin to confirm that adhesions exist. 2  The adhesions then are cut and released (adhesiolysis).
Adhesions can also form between loops of the small and large intestine. Adhesions form when inflammation occurs on the surface of the abdominal organs or the peritoneal lining of the abdominal cavity; the formation of scar tissue is a normal part of healing when there is inflammation. The cause of the inflammation can vary considerably
Adhesions involving the bowel can cause bowel obstruction or blockage. Adhesions may form elsewhere such as around the heart, spine and in the hand where they lead to other problems. Adhesions occur in response to injury of various kinds. For example, non-surgical insults such as endometriosis, infection, chemotherapy, radiation and cancer may damage tissue and initiate ADHESIONS. By far the most common kind of ADHESION is the one that forms after surgery. Adhesions can cause severe clinical problems. For example, adhesions involving the female reproductive organs (ovaries, Fallopian tubes) can and do cause infertility, dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and debilitating pelvic pain.
1 Abdominal adhesions: Abdominal adhesions are a common complication of surgery, occurring in up to 93% of people who undergo abdominal or pelvic surgery. 2  Abdominal adhesions also occur in about 10% of people who have never had surgery.

Shiel, Jr., MD, FACP, FACR. 1  Abdominal adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form between abdominal tissues and organs, causing them to stick together. 2  Symptoms caused by abdominal adhesions vary; however, most adhesions do not cause symptoms.
Adhesions Overview. An adhesion is a band of scar tissue that binds 2 parts of your tissue that are not normally joined together. Adhesions may appear as thin sheets of tissue similar to plastic wrap or as thick fibrous bands. Surgery.

Pathophysiology [edit]. Adhesions form as a natural part of the bodyâ€™s healing process after surgery in a similar way that a scar forms. The term adhesion is applied when the scar extends from within one tissue across to another, usually across a virtual space such as the peritoneal cavity. An unfortunate fact is that adhesions are unavoidable in surgery, and the main treatment for adhesions is more surgery. Besides intestinal obstructions caused by adhesions, which can be seen through an X-ray, there are no diagnostic tests available besides surgery to physically see and accurately diagnose an adhesion.
Adhesions are fibrous bands that form between tissues and organs, often as a result of injury during surgery. They may be thought of as internal scar tissue that connects tissues not normally connected.
