The lowest possible temperature, or absolute zero as it is called, is −459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or −273.15 degrees Celsius. It is also called 0 degrees Kelvin, a temperature scale with increments equivalent to degrees of Celsius, but uses absolute zero rather than water's freezing point as its starting point.
The lowest possible temperature, or absolute zero as it is called, is -459.67°F (-273.15°C). It is also called 0 kelvin, a scale with increments equivalent to degrees of Celsius, but which uses absolute zero rather than water's freezing point as its starting point. This is the point at which all atomic motion ceases.
The lowest possible temperature is 0 kelvin = -273.15 Celsius = -459.67 Fahrenheit This temperature is called absolute zero. ----------------- never happened, theretically … , it is when there is no vibration in atoms.
(Answer #2). Scientists believe that the lowest possible temperature that can be achieved is -273.15 degrees centigrade. This temperature, which is also called absolute zero, has been established on the basis of observation of relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas.
