Closed circulatory systems (evolved in echinoderms and vertebrates) have the blood closed at all times within vessels of different size and wall thickness. In this type of system, blood is pumped by a heart through vessels, and does not normally fill body cavities. Blood flow is not sluggish.
Carbon Dioxide and wastes are transferred for oxygen. The  blood then travels to the left atrium by the pulmonary artery and  then to the left ventricle. The blood leaves the heart by the aorta  to the other parts of the body.. The circulatory system is the organ system that carries substances around our body. There is no such thing as a circulary system.
The circulatory system comprises of the heart, the lungs and the  blood vessels. The main objective of the circulatory system is  transporting oxygenated (rich saturation of oxygen) blood around  the body. The de-oxygenated blood enters through the vena cava and  into the right atrium of the heart. It then goes to the right  ventricle, directly below the atrium.

As a protist, Karenia Brevis does not have specific cell structures dedicated to excretion. Instead, the cell's waste are excreted directly through the cell membrane through diffusion.
Circulatory systems may be open or closed. Allvertebrates have a closed circulatory system, in whichblood circulates away from the heart in arteries andback to the heart in veins. The circulatory system servesa variety of functions, including transportation,regulation, and protection.
The circulatory system is an organ system that moves nutrients, gases, and wastes to and from cells to help fight diseases and help stabilize body temperature and pH to mainta â€¦ in homeostasis.
