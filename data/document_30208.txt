In Excel, as well as most other spreadsheet applications, a row is a grouping of cells that run from the left to right of a page and a column is a grouping of cells that run from the top to the bottom of a page. Rows run horizontally in an Excel worksheet. They are identified by a number in the row header.
In a Excel table (or spreadsheet), the intersection of a column and row is called a cell.. Where a column and row intersect you get a cell. The cell is reference by the colum â€¦ n letter and the row number. So, for example, where column C meets row 15, is cell C15.
The intersection point between a column and a row is a cell. Cells are the basic storage unit for data in a spreadsheet program. Columns are used as part of a cell reference which identifies the location of data such as A1, B23, or AA456. In a cell reference the column letter always comes first. There are 16,384 columns in an Excel worksheet. In Excel 2003 and earlier versions of the program there are 256 columns.
Definition: Columns are a fundamental part of any spreadsheet program such as Excel and Google Spreadsheets. Columns run vertically in a worksheet. Each column is identified by a letter in the column header starting with Column A and running through to Column XFD.
