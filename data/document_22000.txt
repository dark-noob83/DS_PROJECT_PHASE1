Tresses can be manufactured at a factory and shipped to a house, which lowers the cost of adding tresses to a flat roof. Overall costs may be as low as 60p ($1) per square foot for the tresses, allowing for 450 feet of new space for under £3,250 ($5,000), not including the new roofing materials.
New Roof. Raising the pitch of a roof often requires not only tresses but new supports, new roofing and, in the end, a full replacement of the rooftop itself. According to Costhelper.com, a typical new shingle roof can cost between $1,700 and $8,400 to have built. Do-it-yourself options are not available for raising a pitch because of the technical work involved, which will add onto the cost. Replacing the framing entirely, a common move in roof remodeling, can cost an extra $1,000 to $10,000.
However, owners with a flat roof may prefer to raise the pitch of their roof as well. This can help reduce the frequency of leaks and makes it much easier to deal with detritus and snow problems. The costs of this project depend on the roof specifications.
For instance, if the pitch is too low then the roof may not have enough support to qualify for tile or concrete shingles. If the pitch is high, these heavier materials are a better option. Shingles for a typical roof can cost between $700 and $4,000. Wood shakes can cost as much as $200 per square foot.
If the pitch is high, these heavier materials are a better option. Shingles for a typical roof can cost between £455 ($700) and £2,600 ($4,000). Wood shakes can cost as much as £130 ($200) per square foot.
