Though goldfinches carry the reputation of being finicky eaters, you'll have no problem finding a suitable offering that will please their palate. At the feeders Goldfinches do like to eat fresh, dry Nyjer® (thistle) and sunflower seeds.
The truth is that while finches eat a lot of seeds in the wild, they also eat a wide variety of other foods, including leaves, fruits, shoots, flowers, insects, spiders, worms, and other invertebrates.
By creating an attractive habitat and providing feed preferred by yellow finches, you can hopefully attract these fine feathered friends to your backyard or garden.
In nature, finches eat a diet that mostly comprises seeds. This has led some keepers to believe that finches can thrive on just seeds, but such a limited diet is no more healthy for a finch than an all-cheese diet would be for a person.
Finch Feeding Tips: Unlike most other birds that come to our feeders, Goldfinches eat seed almost exclusively. In fact unlike many other Finches, Goldfinch chicks are fed few, if any, insects. Instead they get the same seeds their parents eat.
Place your feeder in a safe and visible location. 1  Protect yellow finches from predators and other animals that might eat their food or them, by hanging your feeder from a tree or pole between six and eight feet from the ground.
Best Answer: Thistle or nyjer seed is a finch's favorite seed to it. You can buy Kaytee Wildfinch seed mix in the petstores, like Petco or Petsmart, and the finches will eat that, too.
Part 2 of 2: Providing Desirable Feed for Yellow Finches. 1. Choose an appropriate bird feeder for yellow finches. Finches are classified as “cling and peck” feeders, meaning that they prefer cling to the end of flowers or grass stocks to eat in the wild. So, choose a feeder that allows them to hang or cling on the side at varying angles and avoid feeders with perches.
