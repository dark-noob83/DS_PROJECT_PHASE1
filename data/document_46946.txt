The pence per mile allowance is to cover the costs of your business mileage – so there is no reason for your employer to pay you a car allowance on top. However, the tax-free amount is 45p per mile; so you are correct in your assumption that you will be taxed on the additional 5p per mile.
HMRC will allow you to claim 45 pence per mile for the first 10,000 miles in a year and 25 pence thereafter. For example if your business miles were say 5,000 for the year. 5,000 x 45p = £2,250 can be claimed.
Example…. So, if you are only given, for example 30 pence per mile from your employer, the extra 15 pence (to total to 45 pence) is being paid out of your own, already taxed income. You can therefore claim mileage tax relief on the extra 15 pence per mile.
1 Authorised Mileage Allowance Payments (AMAP) are normally claimed by drivers driving their own car on company business. 2  These are set in law and are currently 45 pence for the first 10,000 business miles in the tax year and 25 pence per business mile after that.
If you use your own car for business, you will be able to claim 45 pence per mile for the first 10,000 miles, and then 25 pence per mile for each mile thereafter. These are tax free and known as Approved Mileage Allowance Payments (AMAPS).
Under current legislation, that money is paid to tax free, so it's a very tax-efficient way for companies to pay for business miles. And under the current Inland Revenue mileage allowance rates, it's 45 pence per miles for the first 10,000 miles and 25 pence thereafter.
Per employment, not per vehicle. The current rates (as of 2011) for mileage allowance are 45p per mile for the first 10,000 miles and 25p thereafter. This applies to each employment, so if you have two employments either concurrent or consecutive you will potentially receive two lots of 10,000 miles at 45p.
