The easiest way to connect the audio output of your computer is to use the line output of your sound card. We recommend a stereo 3.5mm mini phone plug to dual RCA cable or mini plug to dual RCA jack adapter with a RCA jack stereo cable to go to the audio input of your sound system, such as the aux input.
1 Connect the other end of the cable either to the audio input port on your Mac, or, to your Mac-connected audio interface. 2  Turn on your home stereo. 3  Make sure your stereo is set to output via auxiliary. 4  From the Apple () menu, choose System Preferences, then click Sound.
