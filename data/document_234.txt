mRNA, abbreviation for messenger RNA. An RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecule which has coding regions and translation signals derived from a gene, carries the reverse template message from DNA, and is required for protein synthesis. mRNA is a nucleic acid intermediate that specifies the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide during translation.
MRNA. Definition. noun. Abbreviated form for messenger ribonucleic acid, the type of RNA that codes for the chemical blueprint for a protein (during protein synthesis). Supplement. In prokaryotes, mRNA is produced by splicing a large primary transcript from a DNA sequence.
The have anti-codons that are complimentary to the codons â€¦ on the mRNA. They carry an amino acid that is specific to their anti-codon. mRNA is an RNA copy of a gene in the DNA that sends instruction for making a protein to the cytoplasm from the nucleus.
transfer RNA / tRNA. Transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) is a type of RNA molecule that helps decode a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a protein. tRNAs function at specific sites in the ribosome during translation, which is a process that synthesizes a protein from an mRNA molecule.
The noun MRNA has 1 sense: 1. the template for protein synthesis; the form of RNA that carries information from DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome sites of protein synthesis in the cell. Familiarity information: MRNA used as a noun is very rare. Dictionary entry details.
