Sunday, July 20, 2014 4:42pm. Getty Images. Uber has made some lofty claims about just how much its drivers can make a year. The company has said its UberX drivers can make $90,000 a year in New York and up to $60,000 in Dallas. Even though Uber has said its low-cost drivers in New York could make up to $90,000 per year driving at least 40 hours per week, this driver isn't too fazed by that because he's still able to make a living off being solely an Uber driver. I don't have any complaints, he said.
As I already explained, how much money an Uber driver makes depends on numerous factors. As a practical example, let’s assume you make $20 an hour after taxes and expenses, and you work 40 hours a week, like a regular full-time job: $19 x 40 hours/week= $760 a week. Uber driver pay varies depending on where you live and how many hours you drive. I make between $20 and $25 an hour in Los Angeles. Studies across the nation show that Uber drivers make over $19 an hour on average. In New York City, the average Uber driver makes over $30 an hour
Back in May, Uber released data showing at least half of its New York City uberX drivers earn more than $90,000 a year. In San Francisco, Uber claims its uberX drivers can earn up to $70,000 a year. I would have to work 80-120 hours a week to make ends meet, an uberX driver wrote on Quora. But at least Uber gives me the opportunity to work that much. Most companies will only hire you for low pay at only 35-40 hours a week..
Uber has made some lofty claims about just how much its drivers can make a year. Uber has said its UberX drivers can make $90,000 a year in New York. “Clean money” is how Uber drivers explain their salaries after taking into account for things like gas fees, car payments, and of course, Uber’s 20 percent cut. “They say you could make up to $90,000, but nobody can drive 60 plus hours a week,” another UberX driver told us.
If you want to make a living off of Uber, you're going to have to drive an insane number of hours. In order to make $75,000 a year driving for uberX in San Francisco, you'd have to work 3,000 hours per year, which is effectively a 58-hour work week, financial journalist Felix Salmon concluded.

Ouch. Contrastingly, Uber drivers tend to make much more than that. According to a recent interview Uber executives did with the Washington Post, UberX drivers in New York City can earn upwards of $90,000 a year. San Francisco drivers earned a cool $74,191 for a 40-hour work week
Business Insider wrote a piece called  Here's How Much Money You Can Really Earn As An Uber Driver . Uber claims $15/hour. The article states that after tolls, Uber's 20% cut, gas, car insurance, vehicle financing, and self employment taxes, the driver really only made $54.50 for 12 hours of driving. Uber gets 20% of that, the limo company gets approx 40% & the driver gets approx 40%. So if revenue is $400, uber gets $80, limo company gets $160 & driver gets $160. Driver needs to pay for gas so $160 - $25 gas = $135 net for an 8 hour shift. SUN-Wed are slower nights so approx $250-300 revenue for 8 hr shift.
