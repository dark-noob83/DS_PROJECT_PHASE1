Can I play a Blu-ray Disc on my PC with my DVD writer drive?. Blu-ray discs require a Blu-ray compatible drive in order to play Blu-ray movies on your PC or in your home entertainment system. A standard DVD-RW or DVD+RW drive will not play Blu-ray movies on your PC.
========================================. Blu-ray is a BD...not a DVD...the technology is different. You cannot play a BD Blu-Ray with a DVD drive. Also you need software that will recognize the Blu-ray. If you happen to have a PlayStation 3...it will play the disk. .......Volunteer J-MS-MVP...........

So i have a relatively new computer built by I-Power that came equipped with a cd-dvdrw drive that will not play Blu-Ray dvd's. According to all the info from device manager options say the device is working properly, and all drivers are as up to date as are possible.
