A variable whose value determines the value of other variables. For example, in the function y = x - 4, x is the independent variable because its value determines the value of y.
In this function, y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable. Variable used in an experiment or modelling can be divided into three types:  dependent variable ,  independent variable , or other.
