Prices on high quality 180 watt LED grow lights range from under $300 – $900. Depending on your electricity prices, a 600 watt HID will cost $300 – $600 each year of use, plus the cost of replacement bulbs. LEDs meant to replace 600w HIDs average around 300 watts.
Your average daily power consumption will be expressed in watt hours per day. (watt-hours or wh). RULE OF THUMB: LED lights use less energy and produce more light with lower wattage, a rule of thumb to use is that for every 240 Watts of high powered LEDs you get the equivalent of 1000 watts.
The LEDs that claim to replace 1000w lamps average around 500 watts. A 500 watt LED will cost $250 – $500 each year of use, saving $250 – $500 in annual electric costs with no need for replacement bulbs.
The result is the cost to run the lights for one hour. Multiply $0.0195374 by the number of hours you plan to run the lights (14 hours). The cost to run the lights per day is $0.2735236 or $8.20 per month. If I have an HID (high intensity discharge) light with a 600 watt bulb in it, using the same method of calculation, it would cost me $30.90 per month. Of course, with a metal halide HID light I could grow my own tomatoes and other vegetables indoors.
Prices on high quality 300 watt LED grow lights range from $600 – $1,300. Depending on your electricity prices, a 1,000 watt HID will cost $500 – $1,000 each year of use, plus the cost of replacement bulbs.
Savings – Super Grow LED vs 1000w HPS. Super Grow LED electricity costs are approximately 50% of an equivalent HPS and the LED offers more intense light across a full spectrum which gives bigger yields per Watt.
If you grow short plants, you should definitely try LEDs. 1  The first series of costs on the chart represents an electricity cost of $0.12/kwH, or 12 cents per kilowatt hour (a kilowatt hour is 1,000 watts being used for one hour). 2  $0.12/kwH was the US national average cost for electricity in 2011.
