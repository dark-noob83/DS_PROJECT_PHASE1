In a very young child, the presentation of symptoms associated with appendicitis tends to be different from adults, so when trying to decide between fast-track surgery versus watchful observation, you're often damned if you do and damned if you don't, Bundy said. A 5-year-old with abdominal pain, nausea and fever may have appendicitis or any of a number of other problems.
Early appendicitis symptoms in children are less common. Infants and young children are usually more difficult to diagnose with appendicitis because they cannot communicate their symptoms with their parents or doctors. Without a clear explanation of symptoms, doctors must rely on a physical exam and less specific symptoms, such as vomiting and fatigue.
Many children do not report the early symptoms of appendicitis and only appreciate the pain when it localizes to the RLQ. In addition, children with a retrocecal appendicitis may have a delay in the appreciable pain, leading to a delay in presentation. Certain features of a child's presentation may suggest a perforated appendix. A child younger than 6 years with symptoms for more than 48 hours is much more likely to have a perforated appendix. The child may have generalized abdominal pain and may have a high heart rate and a temperature higher than 38Â°C.
Usually, diagnosis of appendicitis in children is difficult, as the symptoms can be confused with some other disease.

Children with the appendicitis pain have a tendency of frequent urination and are unable to control their bladder for long. A slight swelling in the abdomen is also an important sign that indicates appendicitis in children
