Problem: After running a few miles (1-2) the ball of my right foot (note only right not left) will start to tingle then go numb, almost like when your arm or hand falls asleep.. It stays that way for the remainder of the run regardless of the distance.
An unusual tingling or pins-and-needles feeling to the skin not only annoys but introduces fear into an otherwise blissful run. The runner's toes tingle and feel numb, and the numbness can progress along the top or bottom of the foot and occasionally into the ankle. Although the runner need not stop, a reassuring trip to the doctor may be in order. Foot numbness most often implies nerve compression.
I've been using the treadmill, jogging for 30 minutes, but about 15 minutes or so into my run, my feet start to go numb.
Ask the Coach: Numb toes while running. A: When you mention foot pain and tension, the first thing that comes to my mind is snow skiing when conditions are icy. When I ski in icy conditions, I find that my whole body gets tense -- most of all my feet.
I love running and have become very frustrated as my feet tingle and go completely numb at about mile 4. I have been told to make sure my shoes aren't to tight or too lose which I do. I also have good running shoes not too small or too big.
Q: Tingling and Numbness in Feet: After about 15 minutes or so of running the back of my lower leg (lower calf down to foot) completely cramps up, then my feet start to tingle and eventually go numb. This has been happening off and on for about 3 years. Recently it has happened everytime I run.
When I walk on a flat, packed gravel path or on a level treadmill both of my feet, starting with my left foot go numb after 10 minutes or so. The feeling in my feet alternates between numbness and pins-and-needles while I am walking. My shoes are not too small, in fact they may be slightly big.
