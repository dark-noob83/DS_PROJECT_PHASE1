This all depends on the breed of horse, how often it is worked, and how well it is fed. Endurance is a horse sport where riders ride horses, often Arabians (as they are well known for their stamina over long distances) and race over a course of 100 miles (160 km).
Well that all depends on what kind of horse the rider is riding. A rider can obviously ride for forever but horses have their own limits. An Arabian can travel up to 100 miles a day but horses like the Racking horse for instance, could only do 25-50 miles depending on the stamina of that certain in horse.
Just to add to this answer, a horse traveling with a rider including rests and meals can travel 20 miles in a day. If pushed, a properly bred and trained horse can go 100 miles in 24 hours, but then your horse will need a long rest, so don't expect it to do that for 3 days in a row.
Times 3 equals about 30-45 miles in 3 days. Endurance horses can go 100 miles in 10-12 hours, so if your horse is super fit, he could go 100 miles a day (he would be too tired to go all 24 hours, so we'll say 100 miles a day) so 300
2 Answers. Answers 0 How far and fast a horse runs in one day really depends on the condition and breed of horse, as well as the terrain and weather conditions. That being said it is possible for some horses to travel as far as 60 miles or more in a day, but a more average distance is around 20-30 miles a day.
