According to Harris, if you lease out your commercial property and the turnover of the lease is less than $75,000, you may not need to pay GST. However, in the case where turnover is greater than $75,000, you will generally need to register for GST and pay 10 per cent on any rent charged. So your $1,000,000 sale will only net you $909,091. However, had you registered for GST prior to the sale, you would have sold the property for a GST-inclusive price of $1,100,000 (buyers pay the GST up front but can claim it back).
You could not claim a GST deduction on the purchase price, if the sale is zero-rated. If the commercial property is to be sold without the existing tenant, GST will be payable by the vendor and the vendor would wish to increase the price by an additional 12.5 per cent on account of the GST payable. You could claim a GST deduction on the purchase price of an untenanted commercial property if you acquired it for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and registered for GST. This would be the case if you intended to find another commercial tenant once you purchased the commercial property
As a business, you charge the consumer no GST HST on GST exempt or GST zero-rated goods and services, but the two classes of goods are different when it comes to Input Tax Credits. With GST exempt goods and services, you do not charge GST/HST and you cannot claim Input Tax Credits. 
A. As the property is a commercial property and the vendor is registered for GST the sale of the property to you will be a taxable supply. In that case, GST will be either nothing or charged at 12.5 per cent. You could claim a GST deduction on the purchase price of an untenanted commercial property if you acquired it for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and registered for GST. This would be the case if you intended to find another commercial tenant once you purchased the commercial property
Generally How Rebates Work. GST is payable on the full contract price for a new residential property. In Saskatchewan, if a builder wants to net $300,000.00 for a new home and the GST rate is 5% (remember it changes every once in a while) then there will be $15,000.00 of GST payable. This brings the selling price to $315,000.00. For any price higher than $350,000, the rebate gets smaller at the rate of $63 for every $1,000 in price until the entire rebate vanishes to zero by the time you hit $450,000. I am referring to the rebate on a single family dwelling (not including GST). At $450,000 there is no rebate. At $449,000 the rebate is only $63.
For example, if you sold a property for $1,000,000 with no GST, but should have been registered, you’ll still have to pay the GST and it’ll come straight out of your pocket. So your $1,000,000 sale will only net you $909,091. However, had you registered for GST prior to the sale, you would have sold the property for a GST-inclusive price of $1,100,000 (buyers pay the GST up front but can claim it back). You then pay your GST liability of $100,000, and take home your $1,000,000 n
Generally, the harmonized sales tax (HST) applies to the same base of property and services as the GST. HST is imposed in provinces that have harmonized their provincial sales tax with the GST; these provinces are referred to as the “participating provinces”. Most goods and services supplied in or imported into Canada are taxable supplies and are subject to the GST/HST. Some supplies of goods and services are taxable at the rate of 0% (zero-rated). GST/HST is charged at a rate of 0% on these supplies.
When buying or selling a property, especially one of a commercial nature, it is important to consider any GST implications that may arise in addition to your other tax obligations. The potential to attract ten percent (10%) on the purchase price of a property deserves consideration. 1 Commercial properties generally are taxable supplies but if you sell a property that is part of a GST-free sale of a going concern you are not liable for GST on the sale. 2  Sale of a Going Concern. 3  To be classified as part of a GST-free sale of a going concern the following requirements must be met:
