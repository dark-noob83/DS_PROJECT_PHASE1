If you are missing all of your teeth, an implant-supported full bridge or full denture can replace them. Dental implants will replace both your lost natural teeth and some of the roots. First, implants, which looks like screws or cylinders, are placed into your jaw. Then, over the next two to six months, the implants and the bone are allowed to bond together to form anchors for your artificial teeth. During this time, a temporary teeth replacement option can be worn over the implant sites.
If you need to replace most or all of your teeth, dentures are clearly the cheaper alternative, costing around $2,500 for a set (upper and lower jaws). But the implants won’t move around, nor interfere with your sense of taste, as a denture might. For all their advantages, implants are expensive. Insurance coverage is usually minimal, and patients often are surprised by high out-of-pocket costs. An implant to replace a single tooth can cost $3,000 to $4,500, depending on where you live.
