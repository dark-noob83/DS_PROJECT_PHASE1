A Cavalier full grown weighs an average of 15 to 18 lbs. A Cavalier is generally full grown at 10 months of age. So a 7 month old should weigh approximately 12 to 15 lbs. But i do know of two Cavaliers that weigh 40 lbs and 35 lbs.
The Breed standard says:- weight 12 - 18lbs, small and well balanced. However Cavaliers can be smaller than this or, more often, a bit larger. For showing, of course, it is desirable to have them at breed standard size and weight.
Your dogâ€™s weight (lbs) X 10 = grams of meat and bones per day + 25% of this in veggies. Mine is a little over 70 lbs so 750 gr meat a day + 250 gr veggies, so 1000gr/day split in 2 portions. One in the morning and one at night.
Seeing as the pup is only 5 months old, she is still growing so you don't have to worry too much about her weight. My (now 6 year old) Cavalier kept growing until he was a year old so until then, as long as she isn't getting fed scraps and other nonpuppy foods, her weight is probably what it should be.
