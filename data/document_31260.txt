The term ‘prosumer’ was first introduced by Alvin Toffler in his 1980 book, The Third Wave, and explores the idea that as society shifts towards the post-industrial age, the producer and the consumer have amalgamated into the prosumer.
prosumer. (PRO fessional con SUMER) A person who is very knowledgeable about a subject and likes to purchase high-quality equipment. For example, many digital cameras fall into the prosumer category (see viewfinder).
The next level up from consumer is prosumer. This is a digital camera that is almost identical to consumer, save for the fact there are more features. In most prosumer cameras you will get some manual focus ability.
The Concept of the Prosumer [edit]. The concept of a ‘prosumer’ was a phrase first coined by cultural theorist Alvin Toffler in 1980. The phrase is relevant to the hybrid model that combines two separate binaries which are the consumer and the producer.
Prosumer is a mix of pro and consumer, of course, and that's basically what it means: the price point above mass-market or entry-level cameras, but not the higher-end workhorses. As a rule of thumb, I'd say it's cameras which are introduced in the $1000-$1500 range. – mattdm Feb 21 '14 at 15:46.
