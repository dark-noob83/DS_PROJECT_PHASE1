An example formula would be: Break fee = Loan amount x Remaining fixed term x Change in cost of funds. Because the term of the loan is used in the calculation, break costs tend to be very high for 10 year or 15 year fixed rate loans and also for larger home loans. Break fee = Loan amount x Remaining fixed term x Change in cost of funds. Break fee = $300,000 x 2 years x 1%. Break fee = $6,000 approximately. IMPORTANT: This is an example only.
You should refer to the terms and conditions of your home loan for the specific situations where you may be charged a break fee. As a rule of thumb, a break fee will apply if: 1  You repay the loan in full before the end of the fixed rate term; or. 2  You make a repayment in excess of the allowed amount. Break fee = Loan amount x Remaining fixed term x Change in cost of funds. Break fee = $300,000 x 2 years x 1%. Break fee = $6,000 approximately. IMPORTANT: This is an example only.
1 The prepayment charge will be the greater of 3 months interest or interest for the remainder of the term on the amount prepaid calculated using the interest rate differential for fixed rate mortgages, and the 3 month interest charge for variable rate (at the contract rate) and Ratecapper mortgages (at the capped rate). Prepayment charges are connected to mortgages where the interest term is closed. The closed term allows for prepayments up to 10% of the original mortgage balance. The prepayment restriction permits you to receive a lower rate than you would normally be able to receive if the term was open.
Break costs are fees charged by lenders when you make extra repayments on a fixed rate home loan. Most lenders will allow you to pay a small amount off of your mortgage each year without being charged but if you go over this amount or pay off the loan entirely then you will be charged break fees. Break fee = Loan amount x Remaining fixed term x Change in cost of funds. Break fee = $300,000 x 2 years x 1%. Break fee = $6,000 approximately. IMPORTANT: This is an example only.
