The building of the Kimberley Public Library was opened on 23 July 1887 and vacated by the Public Library in 1984. The building was later restored and inaugurated on 30 March 1986 as an Africana Library to cater specifically for researchers. In February 1990 the building was declared a National Monument. Although the Kimberley Tramways Company was formed in 1880, it took until 1886 for the Gibson Brothers to set up the Victoria Tramways Company and construction on the first tramways started in 1887. It was a 3’6” gauge tramway linking Kimberley and the then separate Borough of Beaconsfield.
When the Kimberley Public Library moved to its new premises in 1984, the old library building was restored and refurbished and opened its doors to the public as an exclusively Africana research library, open to all bona fide researchers in 1986. The highlights of the collection are the books, pamphlets in indigenous languages dating from 1826 as well as records by early European travellers to the region and material dealing with the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902).
The university was founded in Kimberley in 1896 as the South African School of Mines. Eight years later, in 1904, the school was moved to Johannesburg and renamed the Transvaal Technical Institute. The school's name changed yet again in 1906 to Transvaal University College. The university's first library, housed at the time in what was meant to be a temporary construction, was destroyed in a fire on Christmas Eve in 1931. Following this, an appeal was made to the public for ₤80,000 to pay for the construction of a new library, and the acquisition of books.

In 1880, sheep stations were built nearby at Yeeda and a landing port was built. The massive 11 metre (36 feet) tides, rips and scattered islands of the Dampier Archipelago made a port necessary for the development of the West Kimberley outback. In 1885, a jetty was constructed to service the growing pastoral areas and the thousands that flocked to Western Australia for the gold rush. Lee Sing established the Kimberley's first market garden at Goody-goody, about six miles from Derby. Town residents established a cricket club, and camels were introduced as beasts of burden.
The suggestion that a high school could function equally as well was made by a parent in 1992 and an eight year campaign saw Kimberley College established in 2000. Parents are welcome to visit the school at any time. I opened Kimberley Park State School in 1985. A multi-age structure was established to ensure that children were taught according to individual needs rather than the date on their birth certificate. To explain the above, the grade number of a child – e.g.
Kimberley is the capital of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. It is located approximately 110 km east of the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers. The city has considerable historical significance due to its diamond mining past and the siege during the Second Boer War. As miners arrived in their thousands the hill disappeared and subsequently became known as the Big Hole or, more formally, Kimberley Mine. From mid-July 1871 to 1914, 50,000 miners dug the hole with picks and shovels, yielding 2,722 kg of diamonds.
The university has an enrolment of 30,833 students as of 2013, of which approximately 18 percent live on campus in the university's 22 residences. As of 2013, 67.14 percent of the university's total enrolment is for undergraduate study, with the remaining 30.86 percent being postgraduate. The university's first library, housed at the time in what was meant to be a temporary construction, was destroyed in a fire on Christmas Eve in 1931. Following this, an appeal was made to the public for ₤80,000 to pay for the construction of a new library, and the acquisition of books.
Founded in 1896 as the South African School of Mines in Kimberley, it is the third oldest South African university in continuous operation, after the University of Cape Town (founded in 1829), and Stellenbosch University (founded in 1866). The university's first library, housed at the time in what was meant to be a temporary construction, was destroyed in a fire on Christmas Eve in 1931. Following this, an appeal was made to the public for ₤80,000 to pay for the construction of a new library, and the acquisition of books.
The building housing the Kimberley Africana Library was opened on 23 July 1887 as the Kimberley Public Library, the institution which initiated the collection of rare books and Africana now housed in the Africana Library. The highlights of the collection are the books, pamphlets in indigenous languages dating from 1826 as well as records by early European travellers to the region and material dealing with the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902).
