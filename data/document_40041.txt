Blood vessels which carry blood back to the heart from the rest of the body are called veins.   The main vein is the vena cava, which carries deoxygenated blood to th â€¦ e right atrium. The pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium.   The arteries are blood vessels which carry blood away from the heart. The main artery is the aorta, which carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body.
The blood circulatory system (cardiovascular system) delivers nutrients and oxygen to all cells in the body. It consists of the heart and the blood vessels running through the entire body. The arteries carry blood away from the heart; the veins carry it back to the heart. The system of blood vessels resembles a tree: The trunk, the main artery (aorta), branches into large arteries, which lead to smaller and smaller vessels.
