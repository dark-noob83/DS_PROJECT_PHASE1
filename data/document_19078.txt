Seems funny that a couple college kids with a fascination for the outdoors and, interestingly enough, human-friendly squirrels, could end up building one of the most respected outdoor apparel and gear brands in the world, but Marmotâ€™s ascent is no joke.
Marmot is my goto company for outdoor jackets. I've had 4-5 over the last few years for hiking 4 seasons in the white mountains. I love their products and usually they fit great. I was planning on replacing my Marmot Precip raincoat with this jacket, but upon trying it on the sleeves are way too long.
Home | marmot. Marmot was founded in 1974 by two college students and is a pioneer of outdoor product brands. From creating innovative projects out of a dorm room to fulfilling an order of puffy jackets for a Clint Eastwood movie to being one of the first customers of W.L.
The brand has come a long way since its humble beginnings in Grand Junction. Marmot is now one of the premier manufacturers of technical jackets, pants, and extreme weather suits, as well as accessories, tents, backpacks, and sleeping bags for all season, conditions, and activities.
