A Dr. Kristofer Jones, MD, Orthopedic Surgery, answered on behalf of UCLA Health. Total recovery from rotator cuff surgery can take up to about six months, but it will take about 12 months for you to feel completely happy with your outcome. While pain relief during recovery is predictable, function and range are not always as predictable.
Most of your pain should subside in a period over 8-12 weeks...however, the rotator cuff has a very poor blood supply and it may give you trouble for 6 months to a year.
What a lot of athletes really want to know is when they can get back in the game after a rotator cuff tear. But it's hard to say. Recovery time depends on how serious the tear is. It may take weeks or months. People heal at different rates. Obviously, if you need surgery, recovery will take longer. But whatever you do, don't rush things. Do not resume the activity that caused your injury until: 1  You feel no pain in your shoulder.
I think it's around 6 weeks. Depends on the severity. If it requires surgery, it'll take some time (1 year). Get it looked at and see what the doctor finds. I hurt my rotor cuff and didn't get it looked at and about 5 months later, while playing football, I threw a long pass and my should gave out.
