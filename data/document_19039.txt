More than sixty plants, including those that give us coffee, tea, cola, and cacao, produce caffeine from the purine xanthine. Whereas caffeine is a natural constituent in coffee, tea, chocolate, and some cola drinks, it is added to consumer products such as soft drinks, diet pills, and analgesics.
A white, crystalline compound, C5H4N4, from which is derived a group of compounds including uric acid, xanthine, and caffeine. Or a purine derivative, especially the bases ad … enine and guanine, which are fundamental constituents of nucleic acids.
The purine alkaloids are a distinct form that have a nitrogen containing ring structure resembling that of purine. They are termed pseudoalkaloids, as they are not derived from amino acids like true alkaloids (2). The aromatic structure makes them recalcitrant to degradation.
It has the systematic name 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione; it is also known as 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, and 1,3,7-trimethyl-2,6-dioxopurine. Caffeine can be classified as an alkaloid, a term used for substances produced as end products of nitrogen metabolism in some plants.
pu•rine. 1. a white, crystalline compound, C 5 H 4 N 4, from which is derived a group of compounds including uric acid, xanthine, and caffeine. 2. one of several purine derivatives, esp. the bases adenine and guanine, which are fundamental constituents of nucleic acids.
In bacteria, it is the process by which caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) and other purine alkaloids are catabolized by N-demethylases, producing xanthine and then further degraded by oxidases. An alternative pathway involves solely oxidative methods.
You'll notice from Table 1 that most of the purine-containing foods included within the World's Healthiest Foods-asparagus, cauliflower, chicken, kidney beans, lima beans, mushrooms, navy beans, oatmeal, peas salmon, spinach, and tuna-contain about 5-50 milligrams of purines in a 3.5 ounce serving.
