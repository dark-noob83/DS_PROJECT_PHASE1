Questions that ask you to draw a best fit line or trend in the data usually do not want you to connect the dots. Instead, the question is asking you to think about how the two sets of data behave in relation to one another.
To get started with regressions, you'll need some data. You can copy data from a spreadsheet and paste it into a blank expression in the calculator. Next, enter your regression model, like y_1~mx_1+b. You can also long-hold the colored icon and make the points draggable to see how their values change the equation.
Add a table to your expression list to start plotting points. Next, fill in the table cells: Note that you can have multiple scatter-plot columns in the same table: If a table heading is a function, we'll fill in all of the values for you. One special case: a column heading can reference any of the previous column headings in your table. For example, if you have an x column, a y column, and an x+y column, we'll fill in the x+y column based on the first two columns: You can long-hold the icon next to a scatterplot to see various options, including the ability to connect the points, to hide the points, to drag the points, and change the color:
1 You have just constructed a best fit line through the data! 2  Note that it is not necessary for the line to pass through ANY of the points on the plot, it is only important that your line bisect (cut in half) the area that encloses the data points. 3  Now you can use the line to predict behavior.
