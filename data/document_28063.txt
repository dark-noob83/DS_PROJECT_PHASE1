The chordae tendineae, or heart strings, are cord-like tendons that connect the papillary muscles to the tricuspid valve and the mitral valve in the heart. Chordae tendineae are approximately 80% collagen, while the remaining 20% is made up of elastin and endothelial cells.
The chordae tendineae keep the tricuspid and bicuspid valves from compressing past the point of closure when the ventricles contract. If the chordae tendineae were not functio â€¦ ning properly, the pressure from ventricular contraction would force the valve to open into the atrium and cause backward flow of blood.
Confidence votes 1.2K. The chordae tendineae, or heart strings, are cord like structures that connect the Mitral and tricuspid valve to the papillary muscles. The functions of chordae tendineae are: 1) bring the right ventricular walls closer together during contraction. 2) pull the semilunar valves open to allow ventricular ejection.
Chordae Tendineae. The Chordae Tendineae is a sort of a tendon and it acts as the connecting medium of the papillary muscles to other organs like the tricuspid valve and the mitral valve. These are organs mainly located in the heart.
The chordae tendineae, as their Latin name suggests, are tendinous cords found in the right and left ventricles of the heart. These chordae tendineae connect the papillary muscles to the leaflets of the atrioventricular (AV) valves. The vernacular term for these structures is heart strings.
When the cusps close, the chordae tendineae prevent them from swinging back into the atrium cavity (the upper chamber). The chordae tendineae are strong, fibrous strings attached to the leaflets (or cusps) of the heart on the ventricular side; i.e., the lower chamber.
