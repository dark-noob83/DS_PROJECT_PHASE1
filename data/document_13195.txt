What most people call salt is a compound called sodium chloride (NaCl). Epsom salt is a compound called magnesium sulfate (MgSO4.7H2O) that looks similar to common table … salt, but is entirely different. Epsom salt is a laxative and common table salt is used to enhance flavor and preserve foods, and has many other uses. Epsom salt is Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4; Magnesium, Sulfur, Oxygen). If you sprinkle it on your food, it won't kill you but it will definitely give you bad diarrhea.

Skin exfoliator: Massage handfuls of epsom salt over your wet skin, starting with your feet and continuing up towards the face.
Epsom s salt, or its mineral name, Epsomite, which occurs naturally as heptahydrous magnesium sulfate mineral, a hydrated form of Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4). Its chemical compound is magnesium, sulfur, oxygen, with seven water molecules, and the chemical formula is (MgSO4 7H2O). Epsom Salt. Magnesium sulfate in its unaltered state is called anhydrous magnesium sulfate, which means having no water. Its physical appearance is that of a white powdery material. Magnesium sulfate anhydrous magnesium sulfate. One of its properties is it readily absorbs water, and so will Epsom salt. Furthermore, if an anhydrous magnesium sulfate compound accepts water molecules it becomes hydrated, and thus it becomes a hydrated magnesium sulfate compound, which is the basis for other hydrated mineral forms like Epsomite. Epsom Salt, or Bitter salts, forms as a powdery, fibrous or globular crust growing as efflorescence, (flowering out), on cave walls, sulfide, coal, and metal mines from saline springs, or depositions of sulfur and magnesium-rich water due to mining operations. Salt deposits also occur among hot springs.
(August 2014). Magnesium sulfate (or magnesium sulphate) is an inorganic salt (chemical compound) containing magnesium, sulfur and oxygen, with the formula MgSO 4. Epsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts. Epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product. Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles, while gardeners use it to improve crops. It has a variety of other uses.
It is also traditionally used for treating sore and painful muscles by soaking in a bath of warm water mixed with one or two cups of Epsom salt.

Good sources of sulfur include any protein-rich foods, such as eggs, meats, legumes, nuts and seeds. Oxygen is a highly flammable gas that makes up 21 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.
It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O), commonly called Epsom salt, taking its name from a bitter saline spring in Epsom in Surrey, England, where the salt was produced from the springs that arise where the porous chalk of the North Downs meets non-porous London clay. Epsom salt has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts. Epsom salt can also be used as a beauty product. Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles, while gardeners use it to improve crops. It has a variety of other uses.
Now, Epsom Salt is also a 'salt' but instead of being made of magnesium, oxygen and carbon, as is the case with the carbon salt, its constituents are magnesium, oxygen and sulphur. Chemically it is known as Magnesium Sulphate.
