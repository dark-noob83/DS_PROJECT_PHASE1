Nerve damage or irritation. The most common cause of long-term hiccups is damage to or irritation of the vagus nerves or phrenic nerves, which serve the diaphragm muscle.Factors that may cause damage or irritation to these nerves include: 1  A hair or something else in your ear touching your eardrum. 2  A tumor, cyst or goiter in your neck.
Ad. Swallowing air seems to cause hiccups in some cases. Eating or drinking too quickly can cause spasms, because swallowed air can exert sudden pressure in the abdomen. Certain foods with large pockets of air, such as sourdough bread, can also cause the diaphragm to contract.
Best Answer: Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound. Irritation of the nerves that extend from the neck to the chest can cause hiccups.
Causes of hiccups. Hiccups occur when your diaphragm (the thin layer of muscle that separates your chest cavity from your abdomen) suddenly and involuntarily contracts (tightens). As your diaphragm contracts, it causes you to breathe air in very quickly.
Nerve irritation is one of the most common causes of hiccups. The nerve that relays messages to and from the diaphragm muscle is called the phrenic nerve, according to Dr. Williiam Whitelaw, a professor at the University of Calgary. Irritation of the phrenic nerve, either temporary or more permanent, can cause hiccups.
