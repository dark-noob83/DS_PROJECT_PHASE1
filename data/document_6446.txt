Julie Andrews starred as flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the Broadway premiere of My Fair Lady. When a Broadway musical feels as effortlessly right as Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's did to audiences in 1956, it's easy to imagine that it simply sprang to life that way.
My Fair Lady was last seen on Broadway in 1993, starring Melissa Errico and Richard Chamberlain. Cameron Mackintosh is currently planning a My Fair Lady film adaptation, and both Carey Mulligan and Hathaway have been rumored to be starring as the Cockney flower girl.

The story concerns Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl who takes speech lessons from professor Henry Higgins, a phoneticist, so that she may pass as a lady. The original Broadway, London and film versions all starred Rex Harrison.
Directed by Tony winner Bartlett Sher, the new Broadway revival will be produced by music mogul Clive Davis. Featuring music by Frederick Loewe and a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, My Fair Lady premiered on Broadway March 15, 1956, starring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison.

MY FAIR LADY played for 2,717 performances on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger, Broadhurst and Broadway Theatres starring Rex Harrison, Julie Andrews, Stanley Holloway and Robert Coote.
