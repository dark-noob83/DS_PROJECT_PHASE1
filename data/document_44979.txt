Above and beyond tissues, plants also have a higher level of structure called plant tissue systems. There are three types of tissue systems: dermal tissue, vascular tissue, and ground tissue systems. The dermal tissue system consists of the epidermis and the periderm. The epidermis is generally a single layer of closely packed cells. 
The tissues of a plant are organized to form three types of tissue systems: the dermal tissue system, the ground tissue system, and the vascular tissue system. 3. Vascular Tissue System: It consists of xylem and phloem tissues which are found as strands termed as vascular bundles. The main function of xylem is to conduct water, materials to different parts of the plant body.
BioCoach Activity. The tissues of a plant are organized into three tissue systems: the dermal tissue system, the ground tissue system, and the vascular tissue system. Use information from the table to answer the questions below it. Concept 3: Plant Tissue Systems. The tissues of a plant are organized into three tissue systems: the dermal tissue system, the ground tissue system, and the vascular tissue system.
Tissues are groups of cells with similar structures & functions. Plants have 3 tissue systems --- ground, dermal, and vascular tissues. Plant tissues make up the main organs of a plant --- root, stem, leaf, & flower. Meristems: There are 3 main types of meristematic tissue in vascular seed plants ---- apical, intercalary, & lateral meristems. Apical Meristem occur at the tips of roots and shoots and are responsible for the length-wise extension of the plant body known as primary growth.
Each apical meristem will produce embryo leaves and buds as well as three types of primary meristems: protoderm, ground meristems, and procambium. These primary meristems will produce the cells that will form the primary tissues. Lateral meristems account for secondary growth in plants. 1 Parenchyma cells form parenchyma tissue. 2  Parenchyma cells are the most abundant of cell types and are found in almost all major parts of higher plants (we will discuss higher plants later in the tutorial). 3  These cells are basically sphere shaped when they are first made.
The three basic types of tissue in plants are 1. Dermal 2. Ground 3. Vascular Dermal tissue is composed of epidermal cells, closely packed cells that secrete a waxy c … uticle that aids in the prevention of water loss. The ground tissue comprises the bulk of the primary plant body. Parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells are common in the ground tissue. the three types of plant tissue are: Dermal Tissue Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis. You can think of the epid … ermis as the plant's skin. It mediates most of the interactions between a plant and its environment.
The three types of plant tissue are dermal, vascular, and ground. The function of dermal tissue is to cover the outer surface of the plant to protect it from physical damage … as well as possible pathogens. The cuticle, a component of leaves and stems, also prevents water loss. the three types of plant tissue are: Dermal Tissue Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis.

Plants have ONLY 3 types of tissue... Dermal, Ground, and Vascular. 1  Dermal: covers the outer surface of herbaceous plants & composed of epidermal cells with a waxy cuticle that helps protect it from water loss. 2  Ground: is the bulk of the primary plant body, commonly has parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells. the three types of plant tissue are: Dermal Tissue Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis.
