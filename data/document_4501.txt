Definition. Like mimesis, diegesis is a term explicated in the works of Plato (Ion, The Republic) and Aristotle (Poetics). The opposite of mimesis, it refers to the information related by the narrator and many times is comprised of characters thoughts and actions. This excludes dialogue, which is categorized under mimesis.
The diegesis/mimesis complex is introduced by Socrates at Republic 392c ff. to help categorize different ways of presenting a story, especially in poetry. His aim is to sketch a basic psychology and ethics of narrative. From Republic 2.376c ff.
Diegesis. Diegesis is a style of fiction storytelling which presents an interior view of a world and is: ⁕that world itself experienced by the characters in situations and events of the narrative ⁕telling, recounting, as opposed to showing, enacting. In diegesis the narrator tells the story.
D IEGESIS: A narrative's time-space continuum, to borrow a term from Star Trek. The diegesis of a narrative is its entire created world. Any narrative includes a diegesis, whether you are reading science fiction, fantasy, mimetic realism, or psychological realism. However, each kind of story will render that time-space continuum in different ways.
