Stone for Gabions. Not every stone is suitable for gabions, and it is a fact. You may think it is enough to sketch in a metal grid of stones from the street and in front of you will be strong gabion construction, which will be an excellent reference for the wall of the pond on the site. Sometimes the project requires that the stones in the gabion were similar in shape, and strictly rounded or rectangular, but sometimes it does not matter, and then gabions filled with a variety of stones. 2. The size of stone for gabions The size of the stones for gabions are from 70 to 400 millimeters.
Definition of GABION. : a basket or cage filled with earth or rocks and used especially in building a support or abutment. ADVERTISEMENT.
A gabion is a welded wire basket or cage filled with earth or rocks. It is typically used to build a support or abutment. From Wikipedia: Gabion (from Italian gabbione meaning big cage; from Italian gabbia and Latin cavea meaning cage) are cages, cylinders, or boxes filled with soil or sand that are used in civil engineering, road building, and military applications.
gabion. n. 1. (Civil Engineering) a cylindrical metal container filled with stones, used in the construction of underwater foundations. 2. (Fortifications) a wickerwork basket filled with stones or earth, used (esp formerly) as part of a fortification.

What Is a Gabion. Gabions are free-draining walls that are constructed by filling large galvanized steel baskets with rock. Gabion walls are in many applications the most cost effective structural wall available. Gabion baskets are available in a variety of different sizes. They come in 1/2 or 1 meter high, and 2, 3, or 4 meters long. There are several types and colors of rock available from common river type round rock, to multi-colored light and dark fractured rock.
A gabion (from Italian gabbione meaning big cage; from Italian gabbia and Latin cavea meaning cage) is a cage, cylinder, or box filled with rocks, concrete, or sometimes sand and soil for use in civil engineering, road building, military applications and landscaping. For erosion control, caged riprap is used. The life expectancy of gabions depends on the lifespan of the wire, not on the contents of the basket. The structure will fail when the wire fails. Galvanized steel wire is most common, but PVC-coated and stainless steel wire are also used. PVC-coated galvanized gabions have been estimated to survive for 60 years.
The most common civil engineering use of gabions was refined and patented by Gaetano Maccaferri in the late 1800s in Sacerno, Emilia Romagna and used to stabilize shorelines, stream banks or slopes against erosion.

There are several types and colors of rock available from common river type round rock, to multi-colored light and dark fractured rock. Flexibilty is an important beneft of any gabion structure. Since the baskets are constructed of galvanized mesh wire and filled with rock, the flexibility of a gabion structure allows it to withstand pressure without deforming, cracking or breaking as in the case of concrete and other materials. There are very few limits when it comes to the construction of a gabion wall.
