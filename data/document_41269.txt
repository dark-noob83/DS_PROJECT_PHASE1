Antibiotics are chemicals that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria and are used to treat bacterial infections. They are produced in nature by soil bacteria and fungi
Candida albicans is a dimorphic fungus. This means that that C. albicans has to different phenotypic forms, an oval shaped yeast form and a branching hyphal form. C. albicans normal habitat is the mucosal membranes of humans and various other mammals including the mouth, gut, vagina, and sometimes the skin. 
Overview. Penicillin is a prescription antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Ampicillin, amoxicillin and benzylpenicilllin are next-generation antibiotics, and are more commonly used today. When the immune system is weak and unable to fight infection, antibiotics are prescribed. 
Penicillin is not used to prevent infections. It is used to treat bacterial infections and cause the infection to be cured. I … t is derived from a common mold.       Penicillin treats bacterial infections, such as gonorrhea, which is a male oriented malady.
One of the things Penicillium is most famous for is the drug penicillin. It was used to create the first antibiotic. The originial strain, Penicillium notatum, was discovered in 1920 by Sir Alexander Fleming. Penicillium is often reffered to as Deuteromycetes, or Fungi imperfecti. The name Penicillium comes from the word brush; this refers to the appearance of spores in Penicillium. One species, Penicillium chrysogenum 9' , is classified as a psychrotrophic microorganism. Bancerz et. al.
Thus, it is most common to find the fungus in temperate areas. Common natural habitats of P. chrysogenum include soil, decaying vegetation, cultivated land, and temperate forest areas. You may also encounter P. chrysogenum in your own household in moist areas such as the bathroom, refrigerator, or window sills. 
A drug that is used to treat infection. It belongs to the family of drugs called antibiotics. Definition (MSH). A group of antibiotics that contain 6-aminopenicillanic acid with a side chain attached to the 6-amino group. The penicillin nucleus is the chief structural requirement for biological activity. The side-chain structure determines many of the antibacterial and pharmacological characteristics.
Penicillium (/ˌpɛnɪˈsɪlɪəm/) is a genus of ascomycetous fungi of major importance in the natural environment as well as food and drug production. Some members of the genus produce penicillin, a molecule that is used as an antibiotic, which kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of bacteria inside the body. Penicillium species are present in the air and dust of indoor environments, such as homes and public buildings. The fungus can be readily transported from the outdoors, and grow indoors using building material or accumulated soil to obtain nutrients for growth.

Penicillium chrysogenum is of major medical and historical importance as the original and present-day industrial source of the antibiotic penicillin. The species was considered asexual for more than 100 years despite concerted efforts to induce sexual reproduction. Penicillium species are present in the air and dust of indoor environments, such as homes and public buildings. The fungus can be readily transported from the outdoors, and grow indoors using building material or accumulated soil to obtain nutrients for growth.
