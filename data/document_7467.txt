Plant Propagation Technique. A Rhizome is actually a stem of a plant, most commonly growing underground, that produces roots and stem shoots along its length from nodes. They are also known as rootstocks and creeping rootstalks. Often confused with a Rhizome is the Stolon, and while similar, a stolon sprouts from and existing plant stem, has much wider internodal spacing, and generates its new shoots at the terminating end. Strawberry plants are an example of a plant that produces Stolons, as opposed to true Rhizomes.

Full Definition of RHIZOME. : a somewhat elongate usually horizontal subterranean plant stem that is often thickened by deposits of reserve food material, produces shoots above and roots below, and is distinguished from a true root in possessing buds, nodes, and usually scalelike leaves. — rhi·zo·mic \rī-ˈzō-mik, -ˈzae-\ ˈzä. adjective
Definition: Rhizomes are horizontal underground stems that strike new roots out of their nodes, down into the soil, and that shoot new stems out of their nodes, up to the surface. This rhizome activity represents a form of plant reproduction. 
In botany and dendrology, a rhizome (/ˈraɪzoʊm/ , from Ancient Greek: rhizōma rhízōma mass of, roots from rhizoō rhizóō cause to) strike root is a modified subterranean stem of a plant that is usually, found underground often sending out roots and shoots from. Its nodes rhizomes are also called creeping rootstalks. and rootstocks The plant uses the rhizome to store starches, proteins, and other nutrients. These nutrients become useful for the plant when new shoots must be formed or when the plant dies back for the winter. This is a process known as vegetative reproduction and is used by farmers and gardeners to propagate certain plants.

Ginger is a plant with an underground stem called rhizome, that grows horizontally. instead of vertically. rhizome is a plant. A rhizome is an underground stem, thick and swollen that sends up shoots or flowering stems and roots further deep in the soil. Rhizome generally store plenty of food material to be used during unfavourable conditions to survive. Yes they are. However there are slight differences in their definitions. A basal shoot, root sprout, adventitious shoot, water sprout or sucker is a shoot or cane which grows … from a bud at the base of a tree or shrub or from its roots. This shoot then becomes, or takes the form of a singular plant.
A stolon is similar to a rhizome, but, unlike a rhizome, which is the main stem of the plant, a stolon sprouts from an existing stem, has long internodes, and generates new shoots at the end, such as in the strawberry plant. The plant uses the rhizome to store starches, proteins, and other nutrients. These nutrients become useful for the plant when new shoots must be formed or when the plant dies back for the winter. This is a process known as vegetative reproduction and is used by farmers and gardeners to propagate certain plants.
