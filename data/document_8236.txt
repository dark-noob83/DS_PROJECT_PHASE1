Ammonia is a chemical made by bacteria in your intestines and your body's cells while you process protein. Your body treats ammonia as a waste product. It turns it into an amino acid called glutamine and a chemical compound called urea. Your bloodstream moves the urea to your kidneys, where it is eliminated in your urine. But ammonia will build up in your body if you can't get rid of urea. This can sometimes happen if you have kidney or liver failure.
You will need tests like BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and a Creatinine test to check if you really have excess ammonia in the body. If these tests are normal, then your hallucinations are due to some other cause, not due to excess ammonia. It is usually removed by the kidneys. If you have excess ammonia, then you could have either a kidney problem which has failed to excrete the ammonia or you have a liver problem which is causing problems with metabolism of proteins.
An ammonia test measures the amount of ammonia in the blood. Most ammonia in the body forms when protein is broken down by bacteria in the intestines. The liver normally converts ammonia into urea, which is then eliminated in urine. Ammonia levels in the blood rise when the liver is not able to convert ammonia to urea. This may be caused by cirrhosis or severe hepatitis. The higher the ammonia level, the more severe the HE, and the more severe the HE, the more difficult it will be for you and your liver doc to manage your liver disease. You have to control the HE, so that you can manage your meds, your diet, and other aspects of your liver care.

Urea is then excreted in the urine. If your kidneys cannot handle the load of nitrogen, then the nitrogen will be excreted as ammonia in your sweat. One other factor to consider is water intake. The methods used for getting rid of excess ammonia, such as urine and sweat, all require water as a transport mechanism. The skeleton molecule that is left behind is then further converted into glucose and used as fuel. In order to get rid of the excess nitrogen, your body typically processes the nitrogen in your kidneys and forms urea, CO(NH2)2 - basically, a carbon dioxide molecule bound to nitrogen and hydrogen.
Hello, Ammonia is a byproduct or protein breakdown in the body. It is usually removed by the kidneys. If you have excess ammonia, then you could have either a kidney problem which has failed to excrete the ammonia or you have a liver problem which is causing problems with metabolism of proteins.
There is no medically sanctioned way to detox the body from ammonia. Since removal of ammonia starts at the liver, keeping your liver healthy and strong, in theory, will help to improve ammonia removal. Detoxing the liver may be one way to essentially detox ammonia from the body. Milk thistle is an herbal supplement that may improve liver function. Photo Credit graffoto8/iStock/Getty Images. Ammonia is a by-product of the breakdown of protein. One function of the liver is to take potentially toxic substances and make them inert, so the body can remove them. When ammonia enters the blood, the liver filters it out and combines it with other compounds, such as carbon, to produce urea
However, there are a number of ways to help lower ammonia levels in the body. With a close relationship with your medical practitioner and proper medications and treatments, you can effectively control hyperammonemia.
