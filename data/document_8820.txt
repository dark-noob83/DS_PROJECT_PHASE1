Report Abuse. It won't give you worms. It can give you salmonella because of the raw eggs, but only if there is salmonella present in the eggs. If you want to make cookies and be able to eat the dough you can buy pasteurized eggs nowadays.
yes,i once ate cookie dough and got worms. ............................................................................ no, not unless one of the ingredients in the cookie dough was already contaminated. The most common concern in eating raw cookie dough is the possibility of salmonella from the raw eggs in the unbaked dough, not worms.
This one is fairly straight forward. We know that the raw eggs in dough can cause salmonella (yes a nasty sickness, vile indeed). But, the raw cookie dough will not inoculate you with intestinal parasites, nor saturate you with squirmy worms. If you want my personal opinion, this myth was started by a frustrated mother. While trying to get children to leave her alone in the kitchen, she finally had enough.
Salmonella bacteria can cause an infection of the small intestine's lining called salmonellosis. For this reason, you should avoid eating raw cookie dough or any other product that contains raw or undercooked eggs.
No you cant get worms from cookie dough, it has raw eggs in it but people some times drink raw eggs for health reasons.
