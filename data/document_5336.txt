14.3%. Dairy Crest produces and markets the UK’s leading cheese brand, Cathedral City, as well as the premium Davidstow cheddar brand. The short supply chain starts with milk from around 400 dairy farms in Cornwall and Devon. This is made into cheese at our Davidstow creamery in Cornwall. The cheese is then matured for on average 11 months at our purpose-built Nuneaton facility before being cut packed and distributed to customers. We also operate a highly flexible packing site in Frome, Somerset. The whey produced as a by-product of cheese making is also processed at Davidstow.
