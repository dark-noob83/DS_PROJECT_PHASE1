The name tricuspid comes from the fact that it has three flaps. The valve between the left atrium and left ventricle is called the bicuspid valve. It also allows the flow of blood in one direction. After the oxygenated blood flows from the atrium to the ventricle the valve closes to prevent the blood from flowing back. This valve has only 2 flaps which give it the name bicuspid.
The major valves are in the heart and in the veins. Small one-way valves in the veins prevent the blood from going backwards as it is returning to the heart. The valves in the heart prevent the blood from flowing backwards from one chamber of the heart to the other.
The highest pressure in the circulatory system is experienced by the left ventricle, aortic valve, and ascending aorta. When the heart muscle of the left ventricle contracts, the aortic valve leaflets separate, making an opening and allowing blood to flow from the heart into the aorta.
The valve between the right atrium and the right ventricle is called the tricuspid valve. This valve opens to allow blood to be pumped from the right atrium in to the right ventricle. Once the blood has passed through the valve closes so the blood cannot pass back.
The bicuspid valve or mitral valve is located between left atrium and left ventricle, and it allows the flow of blood to flow from left auricle to left ventricle. The mitral valve is also known as the bicuspid valve because of the presence of two, cusps that is valves.
The purpose of the valve is to close when the ventricle pumps blood â€¦ into the pulmorary arteries that lead to the lungs. The bicuspid valve, or mitral valve, functions similarly to maintain blood flow in one direction only. The bicuspid valve is located on the right side of the heart.
