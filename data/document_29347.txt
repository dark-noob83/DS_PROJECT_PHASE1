To be precise, millennium is not itself a number; it is a number of years. A millennium is one thousand years. The 'mill' affix means one thousand, and the 'ennium' has its or … igin in the word annum, the Latin word for year.
Longer explanation. Because one Millennium is 1000 years, the first Millennium ends with year 1000. The next (2nd) Millennium starts 1000 years after the first, that is in year 1+1000 = 1001. And the 3rd one starts 1000 years later than the 2nd: 1001+1000 = 2001. The same procedure could be followed for centuries.
