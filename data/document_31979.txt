It was the initial emergence of the Olmec along the Gulf coast (1200 - 400 bce) that set many of the patterns of future civilization in Mesoamerica. Though isolated, it is clear that Mesoamerican civilization achieved some very impressive mathematical, architectural, engineering and calendrical advances. In addition, civilization in Mesoamerica did not have the cultural unity like that enjoyed by, for example, Egypt or China. There were several different societies in Mesoamaerica that rose and fell over time, (most widely known were the Olmec, Zapotec, Toltec, Mixtec, Mexica, Aztec, Inka).
European colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The ancestors of today's American Indigenous peoples were the Paleo-Indians; they were hunter-gatherers who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge, Beringia, the land mass now covered by the cold ocean waters in the Bering Strait.
The prehistory of the Americas (North, South, and Central America, and the Caribbean) begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an Ice Age. The ancestors of today's American Indigenous peoples were the Paleo-Indians; they were hunter-gatherers who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge, Beringia, the land mass now covered by the cold ocean waters in the Bering Strait.
Historically, a civilization was an advanced culture in contrast to more supposedly barbarian, savage, or primitive cultures. In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized feudal or tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists or hunter-gatherers. Writing, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark of civilization and appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state.. Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records.
Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day Brazil while England established colonies in the Eastern coast of the United States, as well as the North Pacific coast and most of Canada. France setteled in Quebec and other parts of Eastern Canada and claimed an area in what is today Central United States. The ancestors of today's American Indigenous peoples were the Paleo-Indians; they were hunter-gatherers who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge, Beringia, the land mass now covered by the cold ocean waters in the Bering Strait.
Unlike many other ancient cultures, China was effectively isolated from many other early civilizations. Geography played a huge role in this isolation-this lesson will help you learn how. However, while geography allowed the Mesopotamians, Indians and Egyptians to have some limited contact with each other, it effectively trapped the Chinese. In this lesson, we will take a look at how geography isolated early Chinese development.
The Silk Road is the name given to a series of trade routes formally established during the Han Dynasty around 200 B.C. that connected ancient civilizations across Asia, North Africa and Europe. These routes aided in establishing early global commerce, as well as the dissemination of culture, knowledge and technology. 
Civilization can also refer to the culture of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Writing, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark of civilization and appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state.. Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records.
Uncontacted people or isolated tribes are communities who live, or have lived, either by choice or by circumstance, without significant contact with globalized civilization. There are few people have remained totally uncontacted by global civilization. They still living in some of the most isolated regions of the world. The Mashco-Piro, also known as the Cujareno cujare√±o, people are an indigenous tribe of nomadic-hunter gatherers who inhabit the remote regions of The amazon. Rainforest they live In Manu park in The madre De Dios region In. Peru they have in the past actively avoided contact with-non native. peoples
