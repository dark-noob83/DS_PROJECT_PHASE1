First we must approximate the tension in the chain. To accelerate, the engine produces torque at the drive sprocket; which applies tension to the chain; which then drives the rear sprocket. We will choose a 250cc engine that produces about 25 ft/lbs of torque. For any torque, the force exerted is dependent on the leverage arm length. In our example the front sprocket diameter is 3.5. The radius is 1.75 or .145 ft. Dividing 125ft/lb of torque by the front sprocket radius of .145ft. yields approximately 850 lbs of potential chain tension (125/.145 = 850). Since the rear tire typically slips in second gear, it is apparent that tire traction cannot contain all the available engine
The torque required to go a certain speed increases as the square of the speed, so it would take 4 times as much torque to go 100mph as it does to go 50mph but it would also require the engine to rev twice as high. And 4 times as much torque revving twice as high is 8 times as much horsepower. If our bike weights in at 500 lbs plus a 200 lb load for fuel and rider, that's 700 lbs of weight. From one of Newton's laws of motion: f = ma or more useful for us: a = f/m. a = 829/700 = 1.18 g's.
High revs motorcycles. A motorcycle with a low capacity (few cubic inches), and relarively much power, will be a high rev-motorcycle. Think for instance of the 125's and the 250's two-strokes that you see in motorcycle races. When you know the torque of your motorcycle with a given rpm, you can deduce the power, by multiplying the torque with the number of revolutions per minute (and of course with a constant factor to adjust the different dimensions like rpm, Hp and Nm).
Motorcycle testing and measurement includes a range of more than two dozen statistics giving the specifications of the motorcycle, and the actual performance, expressed by such things as the output of the engine, and the top speed or acceleration of the motorcycle. 
Let's say that we loose 20% of our torque do to transmission losses, we end up with 864 ft lbs of torque at the rear wheel. This is the maximum amount of torque at the rear wheel of our test bike in first gear and will only be available at one rpm, peak torque s rpm. At all other rpms the torque will be less. If our bike weights in at 500 lbs plus a 200 lb load for fuel and rider, that's 700 lbs of weight. From one of Newton's laws of motion: f = ma or more useful for us: a = f/m. a = 829/700 = 1.18 g's.
The disadvantage of the traditional chain alignment is that 100 lbs of the bike weight is carried by the rigid chain connection between the frame and rear wheel, thus the rear wheel behaves as if it had 100 extra pounds of unsprung weight during acceleration. For any torque, the force exerted is dependent on the leverage arm length. In our example the front sprocket diameter is 3.5. The radius is 1.75 or .145 ft. Dividing 125ft/lb of torque by the front sprocket radius of .145ft. yields approximately 850 lbs of potential chain tension (125/.145 = 850). Since the rear tire typically slips in second gear, it is apparent that tire traction cannot contain all the available engine torque
If the test engine produced 80 ft lbs of torque the clutch has to handle 120 ft lbs of torque (80 ft lbs times 1.5 primary drive ratio). The output from the transmission in first gear is 120 x 3.0 or 360 ft lbs. The torque is further multiplied by the 3.0 final drive ratio to 1080 ft lbs. If our bike weights in at 500 lbs plus a 200 lb load for fuel and rider, that's 700 lbs of weight. From one of Newton's laws of motion: f = ma or more useful for us: a = f/m. a = 829/700 = 1.18 g's.
One of the nice things about chain and sprocket drive on a motorcycle is that it's easy to mess with the ratios and find different levels of performance. But another big lesson that we learned is that everything is a compromise, and changing a sprocket size can have implications that might not be readily apparent. Our Triumph Thunderbird Sport sample motorcycle came with a 17-tooth front sprocket and a 43-tooth rear, for a 2.53:1 ratio (43/17 = 2.53), shown in red in the matrix above. This means that the front sprocket turns 2.53 times to turn the rear wheel once.
