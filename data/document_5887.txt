Datacollected for veriﬁcation of the temperature model were part ofa comprehensive continuous test performed on June 23 to 24, 1997,at the Rock Creek WWTP (Makinia and Wells, 2000). The dataused for the temperature study included the following: Temperature of incoming wastewater. To verify this hypothesis, the original DISP model wasmodiﬁed by removing the biological-process term (U bp) from thenet heat ﬂux. The new model was termed DISP w/obp .Tanks-in-Series Model. Activated-sludge systems are generallymodeled as dynamic tanks-in-series.

Above wind speed of 4 mph, heat losses due to evaporation and aeration for surface aeration system are high enough to reduce the tank temperature to less than air tem­perature of 25.6 ° C. For diffused aeration, tank temperature approaches air temperature of 10.5 ° C for wind speed of 15 mph. 2.1 SOLAR RADIATION Energy from Sun in the form of short wave radiation is an important factor for the heat balance of open surfaces. Short wave radiation contains most of its energy in the 0.1 to 4.0 1-1m wavelength range.
The types of cooling equipment available for use to the CPI industry will also be provided with their advantages and disadvantages.

This evaluation should be completed using data from different seasons of the year taking into account local weather data, the storage volume of the tanks or basins, materials of construction for these systems, as well as the energy (heat) input to the overall process through aeration and/or mixing.
An equilibrium model was developed in the 1970s (Comprehensive Temperature Model For Aerated Biological Systems, Argaman and Adams, 1977) to predict average monthly temperatures of in-ground basins for the biological wastewater treatment reactor in both winter and summer conditions. This evaluation should be completed using data from different seasons of the year taking into account local weather data, the storage volume of the tanks or basins, materials of construction for these systems, as well as the energy (heat) input to the overall process through aeration and/or mixing.

wastewater is equivalent to (1 - efficiency /100) of the compressor. Therefore for a compressor of 70% efficiency, 30% of the brake horsepower is translated into heat energy. Equations (55) and (56) are used to calculate heat gained from power input in surface and diffused aeration systems respectively. 2.1 SOLAR RADIATION Energy from Sun in the form of short wave radiation is an important factor for the heat balance of open surfaces. Short wave radiation contains most of its energy in the 0.1 to 4.0 1-1m wavelength range.
The aeration basin is 100 ft in diameter (30.5 m) and has a side wall depth of 33 feet (10 m). Prior to the aeration basin there is an equalization tank and a primary clarifier; a secondary clar ifier follows aeration. For clarity, we modeled the 15 th day of every month. This evaluation should be completed using data from different seasons of the year taking into account local weather data, the storage volume of the tanks or basins, materials of construction for these systems, as well as the energy (heat) input to the overall process through aeration and/or mixing.
Sedory and Stenstrom(1995) used the equations from the model by Talati and Stenstrom(with slight changes with respect to solar radiation and biochemical-process energy) and developed a dynamic model to predictactivated-sludge-basin temperature. To verify this hypothesis, the original DISP model wasmodiﬁed by removing the biological-process term (U bp) from thenet heat ﬂux. The new model was termed DISP w/obp .Tanks-in-Series Model. Activated-sludge systems are generallymodeled as dynamic tanks-in-series.
In the activated sludge process, the dispersed-growth reactor is an aeration tank or basin containing a suspension of the wastewater and microorganisms, the mixed liquor. The contents of the aeration tank are mixed vigorously by aeration devices which also supply oxygen to the biological suspension. 3.3.4 Nutrient film technique. Natural low-rate biological treatment systems are available for the treatment of organic wastewaters such as municipal sewage and tend to be lower in cost and less sophisticated in operation and maintenance.
