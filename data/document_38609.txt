My 4ft tank has a Siamese Algae Eater and a Flying Fox. Here I outline some features of each fish and how to distinguish them in my planted tank. I hope this helps some people with the confusion as these algae eaters and others look very similar especially the chinese loach.
A wonderful fish that is known to even eat red algae. Not to be confused with the Flying Fox or False Siamese Algae Eater. These fish are jumpers though, and won't hesitate to leap out of the water. A good cover for the tank is required.
