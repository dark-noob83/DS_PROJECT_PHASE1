The vagus nerve is one of 12 cranial nerves. It is the longest of the cranial nerves, extending from the brainstem to the abdomen by way of multiple organs including the heart, esophagus, and lungs.
The vagus nerve is actually two cranial nerves that extend from the brain stem and connect down to the viscera. Sometimes this nerve is referred to as cranial nerve X, the 10 th cranial nerve or the wandering nerve.
Introduction to the Vagus Nerve. The vagus nerve is the paired tenth cranial nerve that branches out from the brain and supplies parts of the gastrointestinal system such as the stomach, and parts of the respiratory system such as the lungs. To supply vital organs, it has further to travel than the other cranial nerves.
The vagus nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves, which conduct impulses between the brain and other parts of the brain and va rious body structures, mostly in the head and neck. The vagus nerve-the longest of the cranial nerves-also extends to organs in the chest and abdomen. (The word vagus comes from a Latin word for wandering.') It serves many organs and structures, including the larynx (voice box), lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract.
Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, called vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), is sometimes used to treat people with epilepsy or depression. The vagus nerve is involved in one of the most common causes of fainting, called vasovagal syncope. This is an overreaction of the body to certain stimuli, like the sight of blood, which involves the stimulation of the vagus nerve. This stimulation causes a drop in blood pressure and heart rate.
