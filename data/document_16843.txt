This article is about the headquarters of Google. For the number, see Googolplex. The Googleplex is the corporate headquarters complex of Google, Inc. , located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California, United States, near San Jose. The Googleplex is located between Charleston Road, Amphitheatre Parkway, and Shoreline Boulevard in north Mountain View, California close to the Shoreline Park wetlands. Employees living in San Francisco, the East Bay, or South Bay may take a free wifi-enabled Google shuttle to and from work.
One googol is also presumed to be greater than the number of hydrogen atoms in the observable universe, which has been variously estimated to be between 1079 and 1081. It is also the headquarter building for google, and a super-computer in the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, a novel by Douglas Adams. But it has no use. It's so big, that there is not enough room in the universe to write it out.   A googolplex is 10 raised to the power of a googol (or 1 followed by … a googol of zeros). A googol is 10 raised to the power of 100 (or 1 followed by 100 zeros). Googleplex is actually the name of Google's headquarters. They meant to name themselves after the number, googol, to show the number of searches they can do. But they spelled it wrong and it came out google.. So googolplex with an o is a large number, but googleplex with an e is a large building
The other author (superhero boy) of the definition of googleplex is wrong on a few things. 1. The word is Googol, not Google, and Googolplex, not googleplex. 2. His nephew, Milton Sirotta, was the one who asked what the number was called and ended up naming it. There is not a googleplex of anything in the known Universe or any other universe. Perhaps of you were to add up all the atoms in all parallel universes in all dimensions of existence and then raise that to the power of itself, you might begin to approach a fraction of a percent of a
Googolplex is a large number equal to (i.e., 1 with a googol number of 0s written after it). The term was coined in 1938 after 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of Edward Kasner, coined the term  googol  and Kasner extended it to this larger number (Kasner 1989, pp. 20-27; Bialik 2004). 
googolplex. 10^Googol (Ten to the Googol power), or 10^10^100. In decimal form, a Googolplex is a 1 followed by a Googol of zeroes. It is physically impossible to write out or type out this number, even if all the matter in the universe was transformed into ink and paper or data disks. A Googolplex is 10 to the power of Googol a Googol is ten to the power of one hundred (10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000) .
Google calls its campus the Googleplex, which combines the words Google and complex. It's also a play on the world googolplex. A googolplex is an enormous number, but let's start smaller with just a googol. A googol is 10 100 -- a one followed by 100 zeroes. But a googolplex is 10 to the power of googol. So 10 googol is a 1 followed by a googol of zeroes. Google purchased the grounds of the main campus­ from a technology company called Silicon Graphics (SGI)
Part of the Mathematics glossary: A googol is 10 to the 100th power (which is 1 followed by 100 zeros). A googol is larger than the number of elementary particles in the universe, which amount to only 10 to the 80th power. Such a number, Milton apparently replied after a short thought, could only be called something as silly as a googol.. Later, another mathematician devised the term googolplex for 10 to the power of googol-that is, 1 followed by 10 to the power of 100 zeros.
googolplex. A number equal to ten to the power of a googol. That is, 10^10^100. If you wanted to see an example of a googolplex, you would have to look at the entirety of the universe on a subatomic level: the estimated number of atoms in the universe is around 10^10^78. A Googolplex is 10 to the power of Googol a Googol is ten to the power of one hundred (10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000) .
Googleplex is a portmanteau of Google and complex and a reference to googolplex, the name given to the large number 10, or 10 (with complex meaning a complex of buildings). Contents.
