Colorectal cancer usually begins as a polyp, a nonspecific term to describe a growth on the inner surface of the colon. Polyps are often non-cancerous growths but some can develop into cancer. The two most common types of polyps found in the colon and rectum include: 1  Hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps.
Polyps of the uterus are benign overgrowths, or bulges, of the normal tissue lining the uterus into the uterine cavity. Polyps may also be found in the uterine cervix. Polyps are usually attached to the underlying tissue by a base or stalk, and they vary in size. Polyps only rarely contain cancerous cells.
Nasal polyps are generally soft pearly gray, non-cancerous growths found on the linings of the nasal passages and sinuses cavities. Nasal Polyps usually grow in response to irritated or damaged mucus and nasal membrane linings.
Nasal polyps looks like small, greyish, teardrop-shaped growths on the lining of the sinus cavity or nasal passages. You might also picture them as small, peeled grapes. When viewing a CT scans of the sinuses, cloudy spots typically mean nasal polyps are present.
A polyp is a projection (growth) of tissue from the inner lining of the colon into the lumen (hollow center) of the colon. Different types of polyps look different under the microscope. Polyps are benign (non-cancerous) growths, but cancer can start in some types of polyps.
Bowel (colonic) polyps are small non-cancerous (benign) growths on the inside lining of the colon or back passage (rectum). They are common in older people. They usually cause no symptoms or problems.
Nasal polyps are common, noncancerous, teardrop-shaped growths that form in the nose or sinuses, usually around the area where the sinuses open into the nasal cavity. Mature nasal polyps look like seedless, peeled grapes.
