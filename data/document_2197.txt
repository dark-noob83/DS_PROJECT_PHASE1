The first games of Australian football were played with a round ball, because balls of that shape were more readily available. In 1860, Australian football pioneer Tom Wills argued that the oval rugby ball travelled further in the air and made for a more exciting game. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colors and patterns. A regulation football is 28–30 cm (11–12 in) long and 58–62 cm (23–24 in) in circumference at its widest point. It weighs 410–460 g (14–16 oz) and is inflated to 65.7–68.8 kPa (9.5–10.0 psi).
Since 1955, the official NFL footballs have been made at the Wilson factory in Ada, Ohio. Each football is handmade from cowhide sourced from Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa. Football fans often perpetuate the idea that footballs used to be made of pigskin, which is how they got their nickname, but it turns out this isn't the case. In fact, pigskins were originally made out of animal bladders—sometimes the bladder of a pig, which is thought to be how the moniker pigskin came about.
How NFL footballs are made JAN 03 2011. The manufacturing process for the official NFL football made by Wilson: It's fascinating that every football used in the NFL for the past 20-30 years has been made by Deb, Loretta, Peg, Glen, Emmitt, Tina, Etta Mae, Pam, and Michelle. Also, they call the pre-laced, pre-inflated ball a carcass! (thx, peter).
But nope! The NFL’s official footballs are made of premium cowhide leather. According to the NCAA, college teams also use leather footballs, but they’re a little bit smaller than NFL balls. Younger kids (six to eight years old) use smaller footballs made of rubber. That makes it easier for little hands to grip the ball. 
Many companies throughout the world produce footballs. The earliest balls were made by local suppliers where the game was played. It is estimated that 40% of all footballs are made in Sialkot, Pakistan, with other major producers being China and India. In 1863, the first specifications for footballs were laid down by the Football Association. Previous to this, footballs were made out of inflated leather, with later leather coverings to help footballs maintain their shapes.

The first balls were made of natural materials, such as an inflated pig bladder, later put inside a leather cover, which has given rise to the United States slang-term pigskin. Modern balls are designed by teams of engineers to exacting specifications, with rubber or plastic bladders, and often with plastic covers. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colors and patterns.

According to Timothy Gay in Football Physics: The Science of the Game, the shape of the ball is a prolate spheroid. The first footballs to be thrown in the 1860s were not thrown in a tight spiral. They were tossed with two hands because they were round. In the days before vulcanized rubber became a commonly produced and purchased material, footballs were made out of pig's bladders.
The oldest football still in existence, which is thought to have been made circa 1550, was discovered in the roof of Stirling Castle, Scotland, in 1981. The ball is made of leather (possibly from a deer) and a pig's bladder. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colors and patterns.
