Climate. Deserts are determined by low amounts of rainfall, not temperature. They typically receive less than 30 cm of rain per year. The driest deserts often receive less than 2 cm of rain per year. Temperatures in the desert are extreme. Because of the lack of moisture in the air, heat quickly dissipates as the sun sets. In hot deserts, the temperatures can range from above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the day to below 32 degrees Fahrenheit at night. 
The Climate In The Desert. To start off with, I would like to say that there are 4 different types of deserts. There are the hot and dry desert, the semiarid desert, the coastal desert, and the cold desert. The Hot Desert. This desert's average temperature ranges from 64 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. The extreme temperature is 110.3 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The sand's average temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit. The winter brings a little rainfall, but the summers are hot and dry. The average rainfall is about one inch of rain. The soil is rocky and shallow. The Semiarid Desert The semiarid desert's average temperature in the summer is 110.3 to 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Temperate desert. The desert biome is an example of terrestrial (land) biome. Daytime temperatures are high in summer and low in winter in temperate desert biomes. The average temperature range in temperate desert biomes is between 30° F and 70 ° F. Winters are long and cold below 32F. Most precipitation is in the winter when the snow melts. One example is the sagebrush vegetation of the Great Basin and northern Colorado Plateau. 
The average temperature for the Australian Savanna biome is 78  degrees Fahrenheit, with a range from 75 to 80 degrees annually.  The average temperature for the African Sav … anna biome is  approximately 77 degrees Fahrenheit, with a range from 68 to 86  degrees annually. In a hot and dry desert annual temperatures … range from 20-25° C = 68 - 77° F In a cold desert the winter temperature is between -2 to 4° C = 28.4 - 39.2 F and the summer temperature is between 21-26° C = 69.8 - 78.8° F. 2 people found this useful.
The precipitation scale, in centimeters per year, is the average of the total precipitation for a typical year. For example, Phoenix, Arizona, a subtropical desert, has an average temperature of 29.2˚ C (84.6 ˚F) and receives an average of 21 cm (8.3 in) of rain per year. Click on the image for a larger view. Consider the advantages of organizing biome types in this manner.
For example: The desert biome Hot and dry desert: annual temperatures range from 20-25° C = (68 - 77 F). 
The average summer temperature ranges from 13-24° C; winter temperatures are 5° C or below. The maximum annual temperature is about 35° C and the minimum is about -4° C. In Chile, the temperature ranges from -2 to 5° C in July and 21-25° C in January. The average rainfall measures 8-13 cm in many areas.
There are many different desert biomes, and the average temperature  for each varies. Hot deserts have an average daytime temperature of  100 degrees Fahrenheit, while cold … deserts have an average  temperature of 28 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Hot and Dry Deserts temperature ranges from 20 to 25° C. The extreme maximum temperature for Hot Desert ranges from 43.5 to 49° C. Cold Deserts temperature in winter ranges from -2 to 4° C and in the summer 21 to 26° C a year. The precipitation in Hot and Dry Deserts and the precipitation in Cold Deserts is different.
