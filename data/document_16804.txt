If you do nothing with the magnet, nothing from its energy will be noticed, but the characteristic of energy is, that it occurs when a pressure (force) is applied. That means: only if the magnet is e.g. moved in a field, something will happen-what we call the occurence of energy.
yes magnet is energy, surprisingly. magnets have at least one north pole and south pole, which make magnets have energy. Magnets provide energy. When you have two magnets and … they are pushing against each other, that is how magnets provide energy. Magnets are better for the enviornment, because magnets are pollution-free.
If I separate two magnets whose opposite poles are facing, I am adding energy. If I let go of the magnets, then presumably the energy that I added is used to move the magnets together again. However, if I start with two separated magnets (with like poles facing), as I move them together, they repel each other.
However, if you do move the magnets, then you need to give some energy. This energy is stored in the system because you cause a variation of magnetic flux: magnet 1 moving induce a variation of flux seen by magnet 2, and this will change the state of magnet 2, increasing its potential energy.
Magnetic energy is the energy stored in a magnetic field in the form magnetic field lines. Power transformers used in electricity supply send energy from one coil to another, at a different voltage, via the magnetic field.
Magnetism is not an energy in itself. Magnets have a force, and if that force is used to move an object over a certain distance, the energy is called work. If energy is … used to hold an object attracted or repelled by the magnet from moving, then there is potential energy stored in the held object/magnet system.
