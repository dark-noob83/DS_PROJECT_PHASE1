Central highlands around Windhoek. Between the Kalahari in the east and the Namib Desert in the west lies the Namibian central highland with the capital Windhoek in its centre. Due to its altitude of 1700 metres on average (at Windhoek even up to 2000m) this highland has moderate temperatures and average rainfalls. Rain in the Namib Desert in the record rainy season of 2010/2011. Generally when looking at the average weather the yearly cycle can be summed up as follows: During the months December to March it is generally hot throughout the country.
The average temperature of 16 C on the Namib coast is among the lowest in a tropical altitude anywhere in the world. On the central coast, fog forms on 146 days of the year. Surface sea temperatures average 13 to 15 C in winter and 15 to 17 C in summer. The rainy season, such as it is, is of short duration. The average number of rainy days in a year, days with rainfall of 1 millimetre or more, do not exceed 50 anywhere in Namibia. In most of the country, east of the Namib, the total is 15 to 40 days. In the desert rain falls, on average, on only 5 to 15 days in a year. By and large, Namibia is blue-sky country. For the most part, the interior receives an average of 9 to 11 hours of sunshine per day, as measured over a full yea
Except for the temperature, the climate of Namibia's parks is similar to Windhoek. Windhoek is located on the semi-arid central plateau at 1700m/5577ft and most parks are located around 1000m/3280ft and lower. Temperatures increase by about 6°C for every 1000m you descend (or 3.5°F per 1000ft). As a result Namibia's parks are hotter, especially those located in the desert.
Namibia''s yearly weather cycle. Rain in the Namib Desert in the record rainy season of 2010/2011. Generally when looking at the average weather the yearly cycle can be summed up as follows: During the months December to March it is generally hot throughout the country. The main rainy season starts in January (often with thundershowers)
Annual precipitation ranges from 2 millimetres (0.079 in) in the most arid regions to 200 millimetres (7.9 in) at the escarpment, making the Namib the only true desert in southern Africa. The Namib's northernmost portion, which extends 450 kilometres (280 mi) from the Angola-Namibia border, is known as Mocamedes Moçâmedes, desert while its southern portion approaches the Neighboring Kalahari. desert
Since 2010, rainfall has been above average in many parts of sub-Saharan African—including Angola, Namibia, Tanzania, Cameroon, Congo, and Madagascar—according to the Climate Prediction Center of the U.S. National Weather Service. In early May 2011, more rain fell in one day in the Namib desert than typically falls in an entire year. The map above depicts rainfall for Namibia and South Africa on May 5, 2011.
The terrain: mostly high plateau; Namib Desert along coast; Kalahari Desert in east. For Windhoek in January the daily average maximum temperatures is 31°C with the average minimum 17°C, while in June the average maximum is 22°C with a minimum of 7°C. 
Greatest Places Physical Geography: Dr. Cecil Keen, July 1997 Namib Geographic Description: The Namib Desert parallels Africa's Atlantic Coast, from Mossamedes in Angola across the length of Namibia to the mouth of the Orange River in the Cape Province of South Africa, a distance of nearly 1,200 miles. 
As a result, the Namib receives an average annual rainfall of only 2.5cm (1in). The sand dunes of the desert receive moisture from the atmosphere, in the form of fog. Every 10 days or so, a dense night fog rolls inland for a distance of 80km (50mi) or more, shrouding the coast and much of the desert. The fog condenses into a thick dew, creating an annual average of 4cm (1.6in) of moisture. Temperature in the Namib reaches a high of 66°C (150°F) in the middle of the day
