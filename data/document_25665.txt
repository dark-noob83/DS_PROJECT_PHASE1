*Abdominal adhesions facts Medically Edited by: William C. Shiel, Jr., MD, FACP, FACR. 1  Abdominal adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form between abdominal tissues and organs, causing them to stick together. 2  Symptoms caused by abdominal adhesions vary; however, most adhesions do not cause symptoms. 1 Other causes of abdominal adhesions include inflammation of an organ such as cholecystitis or appendicitis, peritonitis, foreign objects left inside the abdomen at the time of surgery, bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, or inflammatory conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease.

Adhesions can also form between loops of the small and large intestine. Adhesions form when inflammation occurs on the surface of the abdominal organs or the peritoneal lining of the abdominal cavity; the formation of scar tissue is a normal part of healing when there is inflammation. 1 Other causes of abdominal adhesions include inflammation of an organ such as cholecystitis or appendicitis, peritonitis, foreign objects left inside the abdomen at the time of surgery, bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, or inflammatory conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease.
Adhesions that formed in the years after a surgery are common causes of unexplained abdominal and pelvic pain. Endometriosis, infection and inflammation of digestive organs frequently cause abdominal adhesions and pain. We have treated many patients suffering from ongoing abdominal or pelvic pain and dysfunction. Clear Passageis a world leader, with over two decades of experience treating the adhesions that cause chronic or severe abdominal pain using a non-surgical manual physio/physical therapy for adhesions.
