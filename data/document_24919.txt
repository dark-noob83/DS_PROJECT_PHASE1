The term “ Aryan ” has had a history filled with controversy. The source of the English word Aryan comes from the Sanskrit word ārya, which is the self-designation used by the Vedic Indic people who migrated into the Indian subcontinent about 1500 BCE.
The Aryan Migration. Before the time of the Aryan migration into the Indian subcontinent, there was a highly developed civilization in ancient India known as the Indus Valley Civilization, which was located in what is Pakistan and northwest India today, on the fertile flood plain of the Indus River and its vicinity.
The Aryan people of India. The ancient Aryan dynasty began in 1200 BC when the Indo-Europeans migrated from central Asia into upper India, Iran, Russia, and parts of Europe. The Aryans brought new technology and innovations into India. This is important because it increased trade. They used a barter system rather than a monetary system.
A group of warrior nomads, the Aryans, began to migrate into the Indus Valley region around the time that the Harappan Civilization began to decline. Scholars disagree about … whether the Aryans overtook the Harappan Civilization by force, or simply moved in and coexisted with them during their decline.
DNA evidence from South Asia indicates that nearly all Europeans are descended from a small group of women who lived in South India about 50,000 years ago. So the Aryans migrated from south to north, and out of India into the Near East and Europe.
