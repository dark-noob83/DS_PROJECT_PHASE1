To maintain weight, the chart below shows you your daily calorie limit. It's based on your age, activity level, and the BMI (body-mass index) of 21.5 for women and 22.5 for men. To lose weight -- about 1 pound a week -- reduce total calories in the chart by 500 a day.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 report that active women need 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day for healthy weight maintenance. According to Harvard Medical School, active women need about 18 calories per pound of body weight.
For people with only a small amount of weight to lose, 1000 calories will be too much of a deficit. As a guide to minimum calorie intake, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that calorie levels never drop below 1200 calories per day for women or 1800 calories per day for men. Even these calorie levels are quite low.
So when it comes to dieting, how many calories does your body need to stay healthy and lose weight? Active women should aim for a minimum of between 1,200 and 1,400 calories per day, says nutrition expert Michelle Davenport, Ph.D.
So, if you create a 3500-calorie deficit through diet, exercise or a combination of both, you will lose one pound of body weight. (On average 75% of this is fat, 25% lean tissue) If you create a 7000 calorie deficit you will lose two pounds and so on.
Sedentary women don’t participate in exercise outside of normal, day-to-day activities—such as house cleaning. Based on USDA guidelines, inactive women need about 1,600 to 2,000 calories per day for healthy weight management. To estimate a sedentary woman’s individualized calorie needs, multiply her body weight by 13.
Weight Loss. The minimum a woman should consume daily is 1,200 calories, according to Medline Plus. One pound of fat equals about 3,500 calories. To lose one pound a week, a woman should reduce her calories or increase her physical activity by 500 calories a day. To lose two pounds a week, a deficit of 1,000 calories is needed.
