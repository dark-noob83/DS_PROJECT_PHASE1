Skin discoloration, a change in the color of the skin, is caused due to health problems and/or side effects of medications. Read on to know more about its different types and associated symptoms.
Tinea Versicolor Overview. Tinea versicolor is an infection that causes discoloration of your skin. Most humans have a yeast fungus, called Pityrosporum ovale, on the surface of his or her skin. When this fungus starts to grow too much, the skin becomes infected. The overgrowth of yeast interferes with the skinâ€™s normal pigment.
1 Hypopigmentation-This type of skin discoloration is caused due to loss of skin pigment, melanin. 2  A person having this skin problem has lighter skin tone in comparison to the normal skin color. 3  Examples of hypopigmentation include vitiligo and tinea versicolor.
Tinea versicolor and ringworm are infections caused by different types of fungi. These fungal infections can cause patches of skin to turn white, pink, tan, or brown and scaly. The patches can occur all over the body, depending on the exact type of fungus.
Skin discoloration can be due to changes in melanin. Melanin is a skin pigment that gives color to the skin. Changes in melanin can also cause skin to be patchy. Treatment for skin discoloration includes using topical treatments. Common drug classes used to treat skin discoloration are melanin synthesis inhibitors, melanin synthesis inhibitor / retinoid / corticosteroid combinations, psoralens, and retinoids.
