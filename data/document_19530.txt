Facial symmetry has been suggested as a possible physical manifestation of the 'big-five' personality traits. For example, it is found that extraversion and openness are strongly associated with the symmetry of the face.
Let’s take a look at our environment and surroundings. The beauty of flowers, tree leaves, and many other natural objects show us symmetrical beauty. Scientific research has shown that our eyes are more drawn to symmetric patterns, then to an object itself.We find beauty in symmetry. That means, at first sight what people see is not the individual parts of your face but the symmetry in your face.
No one is perfectly symmetrical. One eye is higher, or larger than the other. One ear is larger, higher, sticks out more than the other. Usually these things are so small they are not noticeable to anyone but ourselves.
Most of us have an “asymmetrical” face, mostly caused by unconscious repetitive movements throughout the day. In this video, I will show you a simple eye exercise to make your eye area, especially eye brow more symmetrical. You will be surprised to see how the Face Yoga Method can change your face.

More symmetrical faces are perceived as more attractive in both males and females, although facial symmetry plays a larger role in judgments of attractiveness concerning female faces. A wide variety of methods has been used to examine the claim that facial symmetry plays a role in judgments of beauty.
I went down to the eye doctor to get my eyes checked but he said that my eyes are fine. but I have actually noticed a slight change in my left eye. Maybe it was so slight that the eye doctor thought it was normal. I am nearsighted and my left eye is better vision than my right eye but no double vision at all.
