If you are using liquid fabric softener, you can still get a clog if the product is too thick. For softener that is too thick, dilute it by half with water to prevent a clog from happening. If the fabric softener is still sitting in the dispenser, try adding warm water and mixing with your finger to dilute.
Ensure that you remove all the screws that secure the fabric softener dispenser to the washing machine. Pull off the fabric softener dispenser unit from the washing machine. Fill a sink with hot water and add three or four squirts of dish soap. Soak the fabric softener dispenser in the hot, soapy water for 20 minutes. The dish soap will loosen the dried fabric softener and make it easier to scrub. Scrub the fabric softener dispenser with a scrubbing pad and rinse thoroughly with hot water.
4. Rinse the dispenser under warm water to remove the fabric softener. Wipe it gently with a soft cloth if the softener does not rinse away on its own. Dry the dispenser with a fresh cloth, then put it back into position in the washing machine.
Cleaning a Clog. If you can see buildup from fabric softener in the dispenser, you can clean it on your own. Use warm water and a clean cloth to clean the clog. Work the cloth in the grooves to loosen and remove as much residue buildup as you can. In most models, the dispenser tray can be pulled out for easy cleaning.
Set the dispenser in a bucket or wash tub. Add enough warm water to cover the dispenser. Mix in a tablespoon or two of liquid laundry soap, swirling it into the water with your hand. Allow the dispenser to soak for 10 minutes or so, touching the fabric softener buildup to see if it has loosened. If not, soak the dispenser for another 20 minutes.
