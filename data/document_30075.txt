If you read the Windows PowerShell documentation for the Out-Printer cmdlet, you'll learn that to send output to a nondefault printer, you need to specify the printer's name. However, the documentation doesn't tell you how to find that name. 
The Remove-PrinterDriver cmdlet deletes a printer driver from the specified computer. You can specify the printer driver to remove by using either a printer object retrieved by Get-Printer, or by specifying a printer name. This set of commands retrieves a printer object into a variable ($PrinterDriver) using Get-Printer, and then passes the contents of the variable to Remove-PrinterDriver. Windows PowerShell. Copy.
Example2: Remove the printer driver using object. This set of commands retrieves a printer object into a variable ($PrinterDriver) using Get-Printer, and then passes the contents of the variable to Remove-PrinterDriver. Windows PowerShell. Copy. Windows PowerShell. Copy.
If you're even a bit PowerShell-adept, you'll already know that PowerShell's verb for deleting or eliminating something is remove, and you'll have guessed that you delete a printer with remove-printer, as in. remove-printer Downstairs Printer. The first option is just the name you want to appear in Devices and Printers (e.g., Upstairs laser). The driver name is the same name you used in add-printerdriver (e.g., Brother HL-4040CDN Series, HP Deskjet 5700 Series, Dell Color Laser 1320c).

In that case, I'd end up with a printer named \\netdoor\ColorDell and yes, you read that right: PowerShell gives that connection a name that isn't blindly equal to the UNC path but rather blends the server's name and printer name perceived by the print server. The first option is just the name you want to appear in Devices and Printers (e.g., Upstairs laser). The driver name is the same name you used in add-printerdriver (e.g., Brother HL-4040CDN Series, HP Deskjet 5700 Series, Dell Color Laser 1320c).
In a more recent situation, I was handed a spreadsheet of computers with printer shares that needed to be removed for security reasons. After getting the list of computer names from the spreadsheet into PowerShell, I had to figure out how to remove the printer shares.
