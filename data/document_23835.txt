TriPollar 3rd generation RF technology has a unique configuration of sophisticated control algorithms that prevents overheating and eliminates the need for skin and applicator cooling. This means safer, more efficient continuous heating, shorter treatment duration and fewer treatment sessions. TriPollar technology enables treatment of fine lines and very delicate areas of the face without causing damage or pain. These include areas around the lips (peri oral) and around the eyes (peri orbital).
A: TriPollar Radio Frequency (RF) technology is an innovative proprietary 3rd generation RF technology developed by Pollogen Ltd. TriPollar harnesses the inherent benefits of RF technology and overcomes the limitations of previous mono-polar and bi-polar technologies. It is simple to use and extremely efficient. Lumiere’s TriPollar treatment involves a handheld device that the practitioner applies along the target area, such as your thighs, stomach, arms and even the face. As the skin and underlying tissue heats up, existing collagen contracts, inducing immediate tightening.
TriPollar s unique technology offers facial rejuvenation without surgery. TriPollar has taken technology that previously used two nodes to deliver the electromagnetic pulse and upgraded to three nodes thereby better controlling the amount of energy in and more precisely controlling the amount of energy out.
The TriPollar radio frequency system is an all-in-one solution to your skin tightening needs, removing wrinkles and reversing the signs of aging. It’s versatile – it can be used on small areas such as the face, or larger areas like the abdomen, buttocks, and thighs. The key benefits of the TriPollar RF skin tightening system are: 1  Fast – 35-45 minute treatment time. 2  Safe – RF treatments have been utilized in medicine for over 75 years, and over 10 years in aesthetic medicine.
TRiPollar (RF) skin tightening is a non invasive, non-surgical process that uses high-frequency electrical current source to tighten skin by heating the collagen under the skin’s surface, causing the skin to contract (tighten). 
TriPollar™ technology painlessly delivers focused and optimal radio-frequency (RF) energy to the skin surface and to subcutaneous fat layers. Controlled energy is delivered via three or more electrodes and is limited to the treatment area. This focused delivery results in immediate visible results. TriPollar™ is a non-invasive treatment so no downtime will be experienced with this treatment. The TriPollar™ treatment helps patients achieve younger-looking, smoother skin without undergoing expensive surgeries such as a face lift or a tummy tuck – and the results won’t fade after a few months.

TriPollar Apollo is a non-invasive method for skin tightening and contouring that is based on radio frequency technology. Launched in 2007 by Pollogen, it is a relatively new technology, yet it has already managed to receive a clearance by the FDA. 
How TriPollar Works. TriPollar technology painlessly delivers focused and optimal radio-frequency (RF) energy to the skin surface and to subcutaneous fat layers. Controlled energy is delivered via three or more electrodes and limited to the treatment area. This focused delivery results in immediate visible results. TriPollar technology enables treatment of fine lines and very delicate areas of the face without causing damage or pain. These include areas around the lips (peri oral) and around the eyes (peri orbital).
TriPollar is a clinically proven, radio frequency (RF) skin tightening treatment that diminishes the appearance of fines line and wrinkles, revitalizes the skin, shapes the facial skin, contours the body, reduces unwanted fat deposits, minimizes the appearance of cellulite, and improves the appearance of stretch marks. The key benefits of the TriPollar RF skin tightening system are: 1  Fast – 35-45 minute treatment time. 2  Safe – RF treatments have been utilized in medicine for over 75 years, and over 10 years in aesthetic medicine.
