The Class A Motorhome is the largest and most luxurious category of motorized RV's. It is a real coach, built on a special chassis, and equipped for either short trips, longer vacations or full-timing.

The standard width is 96 inches (2,45 meters), but there are wide-bodies from 100 to 102, not including the slideouts. The Class C (mini) Motorhome offers much of the luxury and comfort of the Class A motorhome, but then packaged as a smaller and less expensive version. It is built on a pickup truck chassis, and the average length is between 20 and 32 feet (6 to 9,75 m).

I am planning on building a shelter for my RV. I am building it with a possible newer rig down the road. What that rig would be is unknown at this time. Too far in the future. My current Southwind has a tight clearance of 11 foot 6 to the top of the AC Shrouds. I think 13' 6 or about that is the maximum legal limit. If you can, build the opening to fit that size. My coach is 12' 7 to the top of the Sat dome. Larger (in price and length) are going 13'+. Consider not only the coach height but anything that may be put on the roof.
