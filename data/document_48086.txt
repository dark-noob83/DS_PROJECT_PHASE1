Spina bifida. Doctors aren't certain what causes spina bifida. As with many other problems, it appears to result from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, such as a family history of neural tube defects and folic acid deficiency.
Spina bifida is a type of birth defect called a neural tube defect. It occurs when the bones of the spine (vertebrae) don't form properly around part of the baby's spinal cord. Spina bifida can be mild or severe. 1  The mild form is the most common. 2  It usually doesn't cause problems or need treatment.
Causes of Spina bifida. Spina bifida is a birth defect due to unknown causes in most situations. However, research shows that a deficiency of folic acid during early pregnancy can play a role in neural tube development. In addition, a family history of spina bifida increases the probability of the birth defect.
Spina bifida is a congenital malformation in which there is something wrong with the bone in the vertebral column, exposing the spinal cord which should be protected within the vertebral column. It is caused by the incomplete closing of the embryonic neural tube. Congenital malformation means a birth defect.
Spina bifida is a birth defect in which an area of the spinal column doesnâ€™t form properly, leaving a section of the spinal cord and spinal nerves exposed through an opening in the back. Myelomeningocele (MMC), the most common and serious form of spina bifida, may be treated before birth with fetal surgery.
Spina bifida is a type of neural tube defect. Neural tube defects, including spina bifida (open spine) and anencephaly (open skull), are seen in one out of 1,000 pregnancies. During pregnancy, the human brain and spine begin as a flat plate of cells, which rolls into a tube, called the neural tube.
