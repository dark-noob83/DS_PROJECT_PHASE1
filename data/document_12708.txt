How / Where do you store your Biltong once it is dry... When I have my carcasses processed, I have the biltong cut and spiced and then vacuum packed in 4 kg bags which I freeze. I have a biltong maker that take the 4 kg and dry it in about 4 - 5 days.
529. When I have my carcasses processed, I have the biltong cut and spiced and then vacuum packed in 4 kg bags which I freeze. I have a biltong maker that take the 4 kg and dry it in about 4 - 5 days. I do not like dried biltong that spent too much time in the freezer but prefer making my biltong fresh as I need it.
Never store in a sealed container, it will sweat. This will lead to mould. Biltong needs to 'breathe'. 250g bags of our biltong can last up to 4-months, and we have food testing certificates to prove this, however, we do not advise that you keep it that long. The larger the bag of biltong, i.e 500g or 1kg, the more moisture is contained within the sealed bag. Once again, MOISTURE + OXYGEN + WARMTH = MOULD.
Vacuum sealed food can last up to 3-5 times longer than non vacuum sealed food. The taste of the food, for obvious reasons, is also much better after a long period of time. Be sure to write a date on the outside of the vacuum-sealed meat to provide you, or whoever will be cooking the food, an idea as to how old it is.
Vacuum packed smoked meat in a plastic package will last 4 to 6  months in the refrigerator if it has not been opened. Vacuum packed  smoked meat in the can will last 2 to 3 … years or longer.
Vacuum packed ham lasts depending on where it is being stored and  how it is being stored. If you open it, it can only last for 3 to 4  days. If it is unopened it will stay … safe for 6 to 9 months.
