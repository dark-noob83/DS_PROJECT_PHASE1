A fever is a body temperature above 100.4°F. A normal oral temperature for a resting, healthy adult is about 98.6°F (37°C) (for someone over 70 normal temp is 96.8°F (36°C)). Your temperature can go up or down 1 to 2 degrees throughout the day. Fever is a sign of inflammation or infection and is a common symptom of illness. Fever is not a disease. 
These temperatures are the core body temperature. It is in the normal range if the orally measured temperature of adults is 98.2°F, with fluctuation of 1.3°F higher or lower. If the adult shows oral temperature of more than 99.5°F, then it is considered as fever or some other medical conditions. In elderly people, the temperature is lower. It is the lowest in the early morning between 4 and 6 a.m., and the highest in the early evening between 6 and 8 p.m. Normal temperature is about 37°C or 98.6°F. However, it can be as low as 36.1°C (97°F) in the early morning to a high of 37.2°C (99°F) in the evening and still be considered normal.
In grown adults, a normal temperature can range from 97.8°F to 99°F, or between 36.5°C and 37.2°C. Fevers. When an adult's body temperature is above the normal range, he or she is considered to have a fever. Medically speaking, a fever is present with temperatures above 98.6°F with an oral thermometer or above 99.8°F with a rectal thermometer.
The normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). In adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 33.2–38.2 °C (91.8–100.8 °F) for normal temperatures, depending on the gender and location measured. 
The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. Abstract: A recent study of body temperature in 148 healthy adults revealed that only 8 percent of 700 readings were normal, i.e., 98.6 °F or 37 °C. In addition, diurnal, sex, and racial differences were observed.
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally. 
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period.
A fever is a rise in body temperature. It's usually a sign of infection. The fever itself is generally harmless and probably helpful. Fevers usually don't need treatment. The average body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). But normal body temperature can range between 97 (36.1) and 99 (37.2) or more. Your body temperature can vary depending on how active you are or the time of day. Generally, older people have lower body temperatures than younger people. 
Fever symptoms. A fever is a high temperature when the body's temperature rises above 37.5C (99.5F). The normal body temperature is between 36C-37C (96.8F-98.6F). The high temperature or fever often lasts around two to three days. Check for high temperature or fever using an appropriate thermometer and following the instructions.
