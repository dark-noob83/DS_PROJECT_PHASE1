The Flying Snake is in the genus Chrysopelea and has only five species according to Mertens' 1968 classification. [1] People call it the flying snake because the snake can glide through the air up to 100 meters. [2] Their habitats are mostly in South Asia, India, and Melanesian islands. [3]. The adult snakes are about 4 feet long. Because the size of snake is bigger compared to other flying snakes, it has weaker ability to glide. [6] They have many different body color which are green or greenish-yellow and other colors.
Size and Appearance. Paradise flying snakes are some of the smaller snakes in the genus, reaching a maximum length of about 4 feet. Adults have long tails and slender bodies that they flatten out when they glide from tree to tree. The paradise flying snake, also called the paradise tree snake (Chrysopelea paradisi) is one of five species in the Chrysopelea flying snake genus. All of these snakes are colubrid snakes native to South and Southeast Asia
Can snakes really fly? No, but there's a group of snakes called flying snakes. There are five different species. Most of them are about three to four feet long (1 to 1.2 meters.) They can be found in trees in the lowland tropical rainforests of Southeast and South Asia. Flying snakes don't have wings.
