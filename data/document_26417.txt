Simple Harmonic Motion. Simple harmonic motion is typified by the motion of a mass on a spring when it is subject to the linear elastic restoring force given by Hooke's Law. The motion is sinusoidal in time and demonstrates a single resonant frequency.
1 Simple harmonic motion occurs when the force F acting on an object is directly proportional to the displacement x of the object, but in the opposite direction.
The frequencies of the various harmonics are multiples of the frequency of the first harmonic. Each harmonic frequency (fn) is given by the equation fn = n • f1 where n is the harmonic number and f1 is the frequency of the first harmonic. f 3 = 3 • f 1 = 3600 Hz.
A harmonic is a signal or wave whose frequency is an integral (whole-number) multiple of the frequency of some reference signal or wave. The term can also refer to the ratio of the frequency of such a signal or wave to the frequency of th

harmonic motion. n. 1. (General Physics) a periodic motion in which the displacement is symmetrical about a point or a periodic motion that is composed of such motions.
Simple harmonic motion is any motion where a restoring force is applied that is proportional to the displacement and in the opposite direction of that displacement.
