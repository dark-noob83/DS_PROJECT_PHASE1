While it's easy to claim the PMI deduction, make sure you meet the requirements. First, note when you paid the mortgage insurance. The deduction is allowed only if you took out the mortgage on which you pay PMI on or after Jan. 1, 2007. Counted as interest. Many homeowners itemize deductions because their mortgage interest and property tax payments exceed the standard deduction amount they could claim. It's in the Interest You Paid section of your Schedule A that you'll find the private mortgage insurance deduction. It is claimed on line 13.
The PMI deduction is reduced by 10 percent for each $1,000 a filer's income is over the AGI limit. The deduction disappears completely for most homeowners whose AGI is $109,000 or $54,500 for married filing separately taxpayers. Counted as interest.

Income Phase-Outs. You can’t claim the PMI deduction if your adjusted gross income was $109,000 or more in 2013, or $54,500 if you were married and filed separately. If your AGI was more than $100,000 -- or $50,000 if you were married filing separately -- your deduction drops by 10 percent for every $1,000 over these limits.

You will also qualify to get the PMI deduction if you refinanced your home after January 1st 2007. You should be careful how the refinance is structured though. The deduction applies to refinances up to the initial mortgage loan amount, not to any additional money you might get from the new refinanced mortgage.

If you paid a PMI on your mortgage on or after January 1st 2007, the deduction is eligible. Prior to that date PMI deductions are not eligible. Any new mortgages up to and including 2015 will qualify for the PMI deduction. You will also qualify to get the PMI deduction if you refinanced your home after January 1st 2007.

The deduction is allowed for both purchase-money and refinance mortgages, but there is a gray area as to whether PMI paid for the cash-out portion of a refinance would be deductible. If you obtain a refinance loan with cash out and PMI in 2007, you'll need to consult a tax professional for advice. Your lender or loan servicer might report the annual amount of PMI you paid to you on the same year-end form that's used to report annual mortgage interest or another form. This report is required only if the total PMI is more than $600.
If you took out a mortgage to buy property and the loan was for 80 percent or more of the purchase price, your lender probably required you to buy PMI -- private mortgage insurance. From 2007 until Dec. 31, 2011, the premiums you paid on that insurance were tax-deductible. If you co-own the property bought with the insured mortgage and your partner paid any portion of the PMI premium, you may not claim a full deduction. Your tax write-off is equal only to the amount you paid with your own resources.
