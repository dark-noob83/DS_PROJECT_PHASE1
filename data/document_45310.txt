4.3 Explain the roles of regulatory bodies relevant to the education sector which exist to monitor and enforce the legislative framework. As well as local and national government schools are answerable to regulative bodies and these include, the schools governing body, the health and safety executive and OFSTED.
The health and safety executive is a regulatory body that has a job to make sure that workplace's are as safe as possible in many different ways.
A regulatory body is like a professional body but it is not a membership organisation and its primary activity is to protect the public.
The prime responsibility for safety is assigned to the operator. The primary objective of the regulatory body is to ensure that the operator fulfils this responsibility to protect human health, and the environment from possible adverse effects arising from nuclear facilities and management of radioactive waste.
In England, Scotland and Wales regulatory bodies such as the General Medical Council (GMC) and Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) have important roles to play in ensuring that professional standards are maintained and may be better placed than HSE to secure justice, improve standards or prevent a recurrence.
HSE is the national independent regulator for health and safety in the workplace. This includes private or publicly owned health and social care settings in Great Britain. We work in partnership with our co-regulators in local authorities to inspect, investigate and where necessary take enforcement action.
In addition to these regulators, there are also professional regulatory bodies who aim to ensure that proper standards are maintained by health and social care professionals and act when they are not. In order to practice in the UK, professionals are required to register with the appropriate body.
