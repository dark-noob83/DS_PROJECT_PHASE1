Generally, kittens are vaccinated for the first time at between six and eight weeks of age and booster doses are given at ten to twelve weeks and sometimes again at fourteen to sixteen weeks. A kitten will not be fully protected until seven to ten days after the second vaccination.
Vaccinations. Often, the kitten is first brought to the clinic when he is due for a vaccination. Kittens should be vaccinated beginning at six to eight weeks of age and every three to four weeks until 16 to 20 weeks of age. Sometimes, the breeder will have given the first vaccination and dewormer.
Your kitten needs feline distemper boosters every three weeks until over 14 weeks of age, feline leukemia vaccinations at 9 and 12 weeks of age, and a rabies vaccination at 12 weeks of age.
Kittens normally receive their first set of vaccinations, excluding the rabies vaccination, once they reach six to eight weeks of age. Your veterinarian will administer additional kitten booster shots three to four weeks after the initial vaccination.
Kitten Rabies Vaccinations. Kittens generally receive their first rabies vaccination when they reach 12 to 16 weeks of age. The initial rabies vaccination protects your kitten from this disease for a one year period. Once a year has passed, your veterinarian will administer either a one or three year rabies vaccination to your adult cat.
