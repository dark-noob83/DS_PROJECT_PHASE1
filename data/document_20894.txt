1 Parenchyma tissues are made of simple, thin-walled cells. 2  In a carrot, for example, the parenchyma cells become a storage unit called the cortex. 3  In leaves, a layer of parenchyma tissues under the epidermis is active in photosynthesis. In reviewing plant physiology, plant cells are grouped into tissues based on similar characteristics, then into five distinct structures (organs). 1  Cells – individual building blocks for life processes and growth.
1 Sclerenchyma tissues are thick-walled support cells found throughout the plant as fiber. 2  Xylem is a structurally complex tissue that conducts water and nutrients from the roots to all parts of the plant. 3  The xylem is comprised of a series of long tubes made up of shorter vessel members.

1 Epidermis is the single exterior layer that protects the stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. 2  The outside surface of the epidermis tissue is usually covered with a waxy substance called cutin, which reduces water loss. 3  Parenchyma tissues are made of simple, thin-walled cells.

In plants, the formation of new cells, tissues and organs is restricted almost entirely to regions known as meristems. Meristems: There are 3 main types of meristematic tissue in vascular seed plants ---- apical, intercalary, & lateral meristems. Tissues are groups of cells with similar structures & functions. Plants have 3 tissue systems --- ground, dermal, and vascular tissues. Plant tissues make up the main organs of a plant --- root, stem, leaf, & flower.
Leaves, stems, roots, and flowers are all made up of various tissues. Plant Tissues Plant Tissues fall into two large categories: Meristematic, or Permanent (Non-Meristematic) Meristematic Tissues Meristems are places in plants where cell division is occurring. During cell division, one cell becomes two cells. Each new cell can also divide.
As the plant grows, new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells. In stems and roots, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium.
There are other tissues in plants that do not actively produce new cells. These tissues are called nonmeristematic tissues. Nonmeristematic tissues are made of cells that are produced by the meristems and are formed to various shapes and sizes depending on their intended function in the plant. These plants do have apical meristems and in areas of leaf attachment, called nodes, they have the third type of meristematic tissue. This meristem will also actively produce new cells and is responsibly for increases in length. The intercalary meristem is responsible for the regrowth of cut grass.

Fibers A cluster of many fiber cells make up a fiber Fibers Cortex Xylem Phloem Fibers Vascular Bundles in Corn The End Plant Organs The 3 primary organs found in plants are: Leaves Stems Roots Since flowers are thought to have evolved from leaves, they are called “reproductive structures”. Plant Tissues Plant Tissues fall into two large categories: Meristematic, or Permanent (Non-Meristematic) Meristematic Tissues Meristems are places in plants where cell division is occurring. During cell division, one cell becomes two cells. Each new cell can also divide.
In biology, tissue is a cellular organizational level intermediate between cells and a complete organ. A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues. 1 Epidermis-Cells forming the outer surface of the leaves and of the young plant body. 2  Vascular tissue-The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. 3  These transport fluid and nutrients internally.
1 Tissues – Groups of cells that are similar in appearance and function, for example: 2  Epidermis is the single exterior layer that protects the stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. 3  The outside surface of the epidermis tissue is usually covered with a waxy substance called cutin, which reduces water loss.
