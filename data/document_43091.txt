Best Answer: Cubic Centimeters: it is a measurement of the volume between when the piston is at the very top and very bottom of it's travel inside the cylinder, multiplied by the number of cylinders. Because it's a metric measurement, it can be easily converted to liters. 1000cc = 1 liter, so 2.4L=2400cc.
Bikes By CC. CC or cubic centimeters means the size of the engine. This means that how many cubic centimeters of air is displaced by the engine in proportional to the given amount of cylinder bores in the engine. It means the size of the bike engine and it is not directly proportional to power.
Best Answer: Means displacement in cubic centimeters. It is volume of each cylinder, from piston bottom stroke to top, added together. Roughly, Vol= pi x radius of bore^2 x height of cyl. The top of head dome, if any, adds some displacement. More cc's, generally, means more torque/horse power. Some are rated in inches.
Ryan. the term cc in any engine is the displacement of the motor measured in cubic centimeters. a car that has a 1.8L engine will have an 1800cc engine. The displacement is a calculation of the bore and the stroke.
CC is a term used to denote the power of bikes or cars. CC stands for cubic centimeters. It is the amount of fuel displaced by the piston inside a cylinder of an engine, when the piston moves from top to bottom during a stroke.
