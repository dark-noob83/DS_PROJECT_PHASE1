A geothermal cooling and heating system has three main components: the heat-pump unit, the liquid heat-exchange medium (open or closed loop), and the air-delivery system (ductwork) and/or the radiant heating (in the floor or elsewhere). Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes usually use between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.
Fact 3: Geothermal has real benefits. Much lower operating costs than other systems. A geothermal heat pump will immediately save you 30 to 60 percent on your heating and 20 to 50 percent on your cooling costs over conventional heating and cooling systems. Uses clean, renewable energy (the sun). 
This is around double the cost of a conventional heating, cooling, and hot water system, but geothermal heating/cooling systems can reduce utility bills by 40% to 60%. The payback for a system can range from 2-10 years, while the lifetime of a system can be 18-23 years, almost double a conventional system. Geothermal heating system price varies depending on the type of loop system, usually either vertical or horizontal. On average, a typical home of 2500 square feet, with a heating load of 60,000 BTU and a cooling load of 60,000 BTU will cost between $20,000 to $25,000 to install.
The Family Handyman magazine estimates that geothermal saves you 30 to 60 percent on heating and 20 to 50 percent on cooling costs compared to a traditional furnace and central air conditioner. Renewable Energy Vermont estimates the cost of the above ground geothermal components at $3,800 to $5,000 per ton of capacity at the time of publication, plus $1,500 to $2,000 per ton for the underground portion of a typical geothermal system.
Geothermal heating systems offer a whopping 300 to 600 percent efficiency rating, which can save you money on energy bills while helping to ease your impact on the environment. Despite the efficiency and potential savings associated with these systems, many buyers may be deterred by the high up-front cost of geothermal. Renewable Energy Vermont estimates the cost of the above ground geothermal components at $3,800 to $5,000 per ton of capacity at the time of publication, plus $1,500 to $2,000 per ton for the underground portion of a typical geothermal system.
Energy Savings. While geothermal heating and cooling costs several times more than other technologies, these systems pay for themselves in energy savings in 5 to 10 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Renewable Energy Vermont estimates the cost of the above ground geothermal components at $3,800 to $5,000 per ton of capacity at the time of publication, plus $1,500 to $2,000 per ton for the underground portion of a typical geothermal system.
NEXT STEP. Find out how much your project will cost. Provide a few details about your project and receive competitive quotes from local pros. The average national cost to install a geothermal heating or cooling system is $5,745, with most homeowners spending between $3,534 and $11,089. The installation of a geothermal heating and air conditioning system will pay for itself after two to 10 years. The exact payback time depends on several factors including current utility rates, how energy efficient the rest of the home is and how much energy the home typically uses for heating and cooling purposes.
Geothermal Comfort System vs. Traditional Heating and Cooling. The largest draw to a Geothermal system when compared to any traditional heating and cooling system is a potential savings of 55 – 65% on heating and cooling costs each month. Since HVAC costs typically account for 65 – 75% of a utility bill you could see an average savings of $150.00 per month. Therefore, after we pay $200.00 per month (and save $150.00 in utility costs), we have installed a brand new highly efficient geothermal heating and cooling system for a net of $50.00 per month.
