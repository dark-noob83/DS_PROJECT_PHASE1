The RACC for the product category is 85 grams cooked or the amount to prepare 85 grams cooked for product labeled on an uncooked basis. Using T-bone steak data from AH-8-13 (items 13233 and 13234), one pound of raw steak with refuse (22 percent bone) yields 254 grams broiled steak, edible portion. If labeled as one unit, the serving size would be expressed as about 9 oz (265 g). The nine-ounce value is obtained by multiplying the 340 gram weight with bone by 0.78 to convert the steak to an edible portion basis (340 g x 0.78 = 265 g; 265 g/28 g/oz = 9.46 oz rounded to nine).
The amount of raw bone-in steak to prepare 85 grams cooked steak, edible portion, is 152 grams (85 g/0.56).

The 12-ounce raw steak weighs 340 grams (12 oz x 28.35 g/oz) and the edible portion weighs 265 grams (340 g x 0.78). If labeled as one unit, the serving size would be expressed as about 9 oz (265 g). The nine-ounce value is obtained by multiplying the 340 gram weight with bone by 0.78 to convert the steak to an edible portion basis (340 g x 0.78 = 265 g; 265 g/28 g/oz = 9.46 oz rounded to nine).
