Harding in 1920.

Sherman, making Sherman the first sitting vice-president to be nominated for re-election since John C. Calhoun in 1828. The United States presidential election of 1912 was the 32nd quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 1912. The election was a rare four-way contest.
