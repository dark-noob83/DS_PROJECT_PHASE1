4. Change the Service Set Identifier (the network name or SSID) from the default to something unique. A default SSID indicates to hackers that the network was set up by a novice and that other options (such as the password) are also left as the default.
People cannot see the network, and cannot connect because they don't know the name. Refer to your router's instructions to change the SSID name and turn off SSID broadcasting. Use encryption. Almost all wireless routers do not have encryption enabled out of the box..
Here are some simple steps you can take to protect your wireless network and router: 1  Avoid using the default password. 2  It’s easy for a hacker to find out the manufacturer’s default password for your wireless router — and then use that password to access your wireless network.
Hide your network and change its default name. By default, your router it also broadcasts the name, or SSID, or your network to all nearby receivers. People may see the SSID and try to connect. Most routers allow the ability to hide, or not broadcast, the SSID.
1. Log in to the setup screen, then click the Wireless tab and look for the Wireless Network Name (SSID) box. Enter the new name of your network. 2. On the same screen, look for the Wireless SSID Broadcast setting, and choose Disable. Then, click Save Settings.
Secure your wireless network. If you use a wireless network in your home, take precautions to secure it against hackers. Encrypting wireless communications is the first step. 1  Choose a wireless router with an encryption feature and turn it on. 2  WPA encryption is considered stronger than WEP.
