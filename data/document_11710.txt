Salinity can also be measured with a hand held refractometer. A refractometer measures the change of direction or bending of the light as it passes from air to water. Light moves slower in water than air. The more salt in the water, the slower the light moves.
Salinity is the measure of all the salts dissolved in water. Salinity is usually measured in parts per thousand (ppt or). The average ocean salinity is 35ppt and the average river water salinity is 0.5ppt or less. This means that in every kilogram (1000 grams) of seawater, 35 grams are salt.
RSS Feeds. When we measure the salinity of water, we look at how much dissolved salt is in the water, or the concentration of salt in the water. Concentration is the amount (by weight) of salt in water and can be expressed in parts per million (ppm). Here are the classes of water:
1 Note: Salt refractometers are used to measure sodium chloride dissolved in water. 2  Seawater refractometers are used to measure the mixture of salts typically found in seawater or saltwater aquariums. 3  Using the wrong one may result in a reading approximately 5% off, which may be acceptable for non-laboratory purposes.
Ocean salinity is generally defined as the salt concentration (e.g., Sodium and Chlorure) in sea water. It is measured in unit of PSU (Practical Salinity Unit), which is a unit based on the properties of sea water conductivity. It is equivalent to per thousand or (o / 00) or to g/kg.
