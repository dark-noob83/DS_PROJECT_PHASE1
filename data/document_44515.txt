How Lasers Work. The word laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The type of laser we use in our products is an infrared, semiconductor, GaAs laser diode. The generated light energy has a wavelength of approximately 900 nanometers, with a beam divergence of 3 milliradians-equal to a beam width of roughly 0.3 m at 100 m or likewise, 3 ft at 1000 ft.
The Laser/Atom Connection. A laser is a device that controls the way that energized atoms release photons. Laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, which describes very succinctly how a laser works. Although there are many types of lasers, all have certain essential features.
A small pulse of laser light “tuned” to the excited electrons’ energy is directed through the glass slabs. This laser pulse stimulates the electrons to drop to their lower, or ground, energy states and emit a laser photon of exactly the same wavelength.
But in a laser, all the light rays have the same wavelength and they are coherent (absolutely in step). This is what makes laser light such a powerful concentration of energy. Before you can understand how a laser works, you need to know how an atom can give off light.
To understand how a laser works, it's helpful to know that the word is really an acronym for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Simply put, when certain electrons are stimulated, they give off a beam of light.
How it Works. The lasing medium will normally emit photons in specific spectral lines when excited by an energy source. The wavelength is determined by the different quantum levels, or energy states, of the material. Normally, most atoms in a medium are in the ground state.
