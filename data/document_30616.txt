Under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, it is illegal for anyone other than the original manufacturer to bring prescription drugs into the country.
North America's biggest producers are the U.S. and Mexico with Canada a distant third. According to Interpol, North America produces a third of the world's pot.
