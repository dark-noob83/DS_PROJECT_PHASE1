NEW YORK, NY — The average cost of a 30-second ad in the Tuesday-night edition of  American Idol  is $467,000, making it the most expensive program on television for advertisers, according to a new poll of advertising costs released today by industry authority Advertising Age.
Meanwhile, the average cost of a 30-second spot in the Wednesday edition of Idol plummeted from $502,900 last season to $340,825. Even less expensive is the results show: The average cost of a 30-second ad in Thursday's Idol is $296,002, down from $468,100 last season, according to the survey.
Last year, Sunday Night Football and American Idol were virtually neck and neck for top cost, but the average cost of a 30-second spot in Sunday Night Football in the 2012-2013 TV season is a budget-busting $545,142, up from $512,367 last season, according to Ad Age 's figures.
Ad Age's rough breakdown of commercial costs is fun to ponder — Idol ads cost $468,100 during the results show! — especially as it points to the value of shows not just in popularity but also in likelihood of being watched live.
