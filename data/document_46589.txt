There are various ways architects charge for their services, which include fixed fees (or lump-sum fees), hourly rates and percentage fees. Generally which one an architect chooses for your project will depend on how much help you will be seeking from them.
Architect fees are typically charged by the hour, as a percentage of construction costs, or by square footage. How an architect charges depends on the firm, the nature of the job, what part of the country you’re in, the economy, and your skill at negotiating.
Most architects who charge on a percentage basis will charge eight to 15 percent of the total cost of the project, so you can plan on spending $800 to $1,500 for every $10,000 worth of work you want done.

If you hire an architect on a hourly basis, they might charge you between $60 and $125 per hour for their services, though it can vary. Charging by the hour is beneficial to the architect as some homeowners can find themselves constantly making changes to the design.
