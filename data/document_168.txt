Oil chemistry and engine technology have improved to the point that most cars can go several thousand more miles before changing the oil, Mr. Reed said. A better average, he said, would be 7,500 between oil changes, and sometimes up to 10,000 miles or more. So before you go in for your oil change, dig out your owner’s manual and see what it says. And when the mechanic slaps on a sticker that gives the next change date in 3,000 miles, ask questions. And then, go get the car washed. That’s one thing that always seems to be needed.
The interval that is perfectly fine for one car could be way too long for another. So in reality, very few drivers will go 25,000 miles without an oil change, even if they spring for high-grade synthetic oil. And most of them shouldn't, although some can go 10,000 without a problem [source: CIWMB ].
Report Abuse. With synthetics, you can go as high as 10,000 miles, but that's the hypothetical range for synthetics. Some manufacturer manuals I remember said 7500 miles between oil changes. I change mine every 5000 miles because its easier to keep track every 5000 miles instead of 7500 miles. Synthetics last a lot longer than conventional, so 5000 is equivalent to 3000 of the conventional.
If you are using synthetic oil for your car, read the manual of your car. (80 dollars oil change). It is between 5.000 to 10.000 miles. Chris Tengler, on average, people keep a car for 2-3 years, then they trade it in for a new one. 
Driven by an outdated 3,000-mile oil change commandment, they are unnecessarily spending millions of dollars and spilling an ocean of contaminated waste oil. The majority of automakers today call for oil changes at either 7,500 or 10,000 miles, and the interval can go as high as 15,000 miles in some cars. 
Mobil 1 Extended Performance is recommended for up to 15,000-mile or one-year oil change intervals. However, if your vehicle manufacturer recommends an oil change interval beyond 15,000 miles and Mobil 1 meets the performance level specified, you can be assured that Mobil 1 will go the distance.

Regular oil changes (every 3000 to 7000 miles, or every 6 months if it's a vehicle that's not driven often) with the proper type of oil for your car will assure you get the maximum possible mileage and performance from your engine. If you don't put a lot of miles on your car you need to go by time rather than miles for oil changes. Blowby gasses in the crankcase condense to form all kinds of nasty acids that can literally eat up
Cost. An oil change for a gas powered car or truck will usually run between $20 and $30 depending on where you go. Chain lube stations may offer sales or specials, but individual mechanics often do a more thorough job for just a little more money. Diesel oil change cost, on the other hand, is somewhere between $50 and $70. If you use synthetics, it will be more expensive. This is because diesel fuel, including oil, is typically more expensive than petroleum. Again, it depends on where you go for the oil change.
