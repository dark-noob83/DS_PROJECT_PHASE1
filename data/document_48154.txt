The compound of articular processes of vertebrae called dugootrostchatym compound (articulatio zygapophysialis). The joint is flat, formed articular surfaces of the upper articular processes of one vertebra and articular surfaces of the lower articular processes of another-the overlying-vertebra. Joint capsule is attached to the edge of the articular surfaces.
Forming the anterior (forward) part of the vertebra, the body of each vertebra has two articular surfaces. These surfaces are the faces of the vertebrae which articulate, or join with, the other vertebrae. The top surface, which bears the weight of the spinal column above it, is called the superior articular surface.
1 These are synovial joints between the interior articular process of superior vertebrae and the superior articular process of inferior vertebrae. 2  These plane joints are known as zygapophyseal joints (facet joints) . 3  The flat surfaces of the articular facets are covered with hyaline cartilage.
Superior Facet. Sections. The superior facet, also called the superior articular process, is a pair of facet joints between pairs of vertebrae. A facet joint is what holds two vertebrae together and each vertebra contains two pairs, an upper-facing superior facet pair and a lower-facing inferior facet pair.
The superior facet, also called the superior articular process, is a pair of facet joints between pairs of vertebrae. A facet joint is what holds two vertebrae together and each vertebra contains two pairs, an upper-facing superior facet pair and a lower-facing inferior facet pair.
Articular processes: These processes form joints between successive vertebrae. The superior and inferior articular processes arise from the same junctions as the transverse processes (one superior and one inferior process on each side), and each process has an articular surface called a facet.
