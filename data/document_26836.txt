Save. Anatoliy Babiy/iStock/Getty Images. FaceTime is a video calling service Apple created for customers of its own devices. It launched alongside the iPhone 4 in 2010 for iPhone-to-iPhone video calling, but now anyone with iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, or Mac can FaceTime anyone else with one of these devices. While Apple has not released a FaceTime app for Android, there are alternative ways to video chat with someone on an Android phone. 
For Android to be able to use FaceTime, someone would have to figure out how that technology works and then create an Android version of it. If that were to happen, you can be sure that Apple would step in with legal threats to prevent it. Sorry to say it, Android fans, but the answer is no: You cannot use FaceTime on Android. But FaceTime is just one kind of video chat. There are other apps for Android that do the same thing.
While FaceTime is limited to iOS devices, Google Hangouts is available over a variety of different platforms and devices, meaning that you can use the exact same feature as FaceTime across multiple different devices. Currently, you can make video calls to devices including computers, iOS devices and Android devices. Unless Apple creates a Facetime app for Android, which I serious doubt if they will even consider it, this is the fact. Most people who are searching Facetime for Android, wants to do a video chat – Either between Android devices or between iOS and android device (like you).
There's a related question: Can you FaceTime from Android to iPhone? The simple answer is no. Since there's no FaceTime for Android, there's no way to use it to video chat with an iPhone (or iPod touch or Mac) user. However, if FaceTime in that question is used generically and means video chat more broadly, then the answer is yes. Sorry to say it, Android fans, but the answer is no: You cannot use FaceTime on Android. But FaceTime is just one kind of video chat. There are other apps for Android that do the same thing.
You don’t video chat someone, you FaceTime them. With an Android phone, though, you can’t. That’s what’s great about the open marketplace of ideas that is the Google Play store, though. If you need an Android alternative to FaceTime, you have not one, but several, to choose from. We took the leading candidates for a test drive to compare them with each other, taking into account price, reliability, restrictions, and features
Fring enables you to use your android phone and video-chat with a friend or relative using an iPhone. The good thing about this app is that you are also able to do this over 3G networks; hence you can get your video chatting on anywhere you have a decent coverage. 
Facetime is an iOS application. I'm not sure if there are Android apps that try to emulate it, and if there are I can only imagine how sketchy they might perform. Try using something like Skype which is platform-independent, or any number of other alternatives. Apple users only need to install the google hangout app to video chat with others-I.e android users, pc users, Mac users, Linux users, --- who ever else has the google hangouts app installed on a device can be contacted.
Tango. When Apple first showed off FaceTime there was a rush to be the Android equivalent. For a time it looked like Tango would be that app as HTC pre-installed Tango on their devices. Today Tango offers what you would expect: HD video and audio calls, text messaging, and group chat. Apple launched FaceTime back in 2010 with the iPhone 4 as a way for Apple users to connect on a more personal level. Video calling is not a new concept by any means, but the nice thing about FaceTime is it’s built right into the phone dialer. The problem is FaceTime currently only works between Apple devices
