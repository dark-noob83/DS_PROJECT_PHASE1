Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of tissue that has a single layer of cells arranged in a fashion that appears to be stratified, whereas transitional epithelial tissue is an elastic-like epithelial tissue that swells, contracts, and changes shape as necessary. Columnar, Cuboidal, Squamous Cell Shapes. Epithelial tissue has differently shaped bricks-or cells, that is. There are columnar cells, which means 'column-like cells'; cuboidal cells, which are cube-like cells; and squamous cells, which are flattened and scale-like cells.
Simple epithelium is one cell thick; that is, every cell is in direct contact with the underlying basement membrane. In general, it is found where absorption and filtration occur. The thinness of the epithelial barrier facilitates these processes. Epithelial tissues line the cavities and surfaces of blood vessels and organs throughout the body. There are three principal shapes of epithelial cells: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal.
1 Stratified signifies two or more layers of epithelial cells. 2  By convention, a stratified epithelium is described according to the shape of cells on its free surface. 3  Regardless of whether the surface cells are squamous, cuboidal, or columnar, the underlying cells are usually cuboidal. 1 Within the epithelium, the narrow spaces between cells are sealed off from the external environment by cell junctions near the free surface of the cells. 2  Compared to ordinary connective tissue, epithelial tissue has very little interstitial fluid. 3  Epithelial tissue is polarized.

The other three types are connective tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. Epithelial tissues line the cavities and surfaces of blood vessels and organs throughout the body. There are three principal shapes of epithelial cells: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal. These can be arranged in a single layer of cells as simple epithelium, either squamous, columnar or cuboidal, or in layers of two or more cells deep as stratified (layered), either squamous, columnar or cuboidal. All glands are made up of epithelial cells

Epithelial tissues cover organs. One example of a structure that contains epithelial tissue is the epidermis -- your skin. The epithelial tissue in your skin is hard at work even as you're reading this, absorbing necessary vitamins and nutrients, expelling waste and providing protection for your organs.
Ciliated epithelium contains special cells called goblet cells. The purpose of these cells is to create mucous. This mucous surrounds particles that shouldn't be in our body, and the cilia move them out. Without these cells and tissue, a lot of harmful bacteria would remain in our lungs, making us really sick. In this lesson, you'll learn about what ciliated epithelial tissue is and where it is located. You'll also discover why it is important to our health and see diagrams of this tissue.
Structure [edit]. The epithelium is part of the intestinal mucosa layer. In the small intestine this takes the form of villi but these are not present in the colon. In both parts of the mammalian intestine, the mucosa is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells that is renewed every 4â€“5 days.
Epithelial tissue is one of the four basic tissue types. Several features characterize epithelial tissue and distinguish it from connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. 1  Epithelial tissue covers surfaces with an uninterrupted layer of cells. 1 Within the epithelium, the narrow spaces between cells are sealed off from the external environment by cell junctions near the free surface of the cells. 2  Compared to ordinary connective tissue, epithelial tissue has very little interstitial fluid. 3  Epithelial tissue is polarized.
