Also, most pro bodybuilders compete in several stage shows every year for which they receive a base award (usually $1,000, I think) and the rest of the prize money depends on how they place (i.e, 1st place gets like $100,000+). More advanced natural bodybuilders with several good years under their belt can walk onstage at heavier weights, in the 175 to 195 lbs range. But the very best natural, average height bodybuilders can weigh over 200 lbs onstage, but this is very rare for any natural under 6 ft tall.

How much $$$ do bodybuilders get. Okay so i was watching a youtube channel where they showed these 2 bodybuilders being interviewed. Anyways they said thats all they do, and they live it 24 hours.

Competitions. Major competitions can have prize money for winners of between $250 (3rd in IFBB Valenti Gold Cup Pro Men’s Physique), $2,000 (25th place in Mr Olympia) and $250,000+ (1st place in Mr Olympia). So clearly the prize money is low except for the best of the best. Personal Training. $50,000 per year is average for a certified personal trainer, with some of the more business-minded trainers earning $100,000 to $200,000. The better your physique, the more customers you’ll get and the more you’ll be able to charge. People skills are a must.
