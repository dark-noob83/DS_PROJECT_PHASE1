Batteries turn chemical energy directly into electrical energy. Chemical energy in wood and fossil fuels turns into heat and light energy when it is burned. One of the many ways we can make electrical energy is through one-step conversions, such as mechanical to electrical.
In this process, the chemical energy is transformed into mechanical energy, which you use to move, and which we'll cover in more detail in a moment. It also transforms it into thermal energy, which is created through the metabolic processes in your body to generate heat.
Examples of Energy Transformations: 1. A toaster transforms electrical energy into thermal energy. 2. A blender transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy. 3. The sun transforms nuclear energy into ultraviolet, infrared, and gamma energy all forms of electromagnetic energy. 4. Our bodies convert chemical energy from food into mechanical and electrical energy to allow us to move. 5.
An energy transformation is the change of energy from one form to another. Energy transformations occur everywhere every second of the day. There are many different forms of energy such as electrical, thermal, nuclear, mechanical, electromagnetic, sound, and chemical.
For example, the chemical energy in a battery is converted into electrical energy. The electrical energy, which involves the motion of electrical charges or currents, can be used to power everyday devices like computers and flashlights. Mechanical energy can also be transformed into electrical energy. For example, a hydroelectric plant uses the mechanical energy of flowing water to generate electrical energy. Wind energy is another mechanical to electrical energy transformation.
A light bulb changes the chemical energy of the bulb into electromagnetic radiation, or light. Windmills harness the energy of the wind and convert it into mechanical energy in the movement of the turbine blades, which is then converted to electrical energy. Solar panels transform light to electricity.
