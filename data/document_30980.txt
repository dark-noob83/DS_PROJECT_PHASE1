Since the bullpup design has the trigger in front of the action, this means that the action sits close to the back of the buttstock and closer to the user's face. That means the overall length of the weapon is reduced.
The Steyr AUG is one of the most successful bullpup rifles. Bullpup is a firearm configuration in which the action (or mechanism) and magazine are located behind the trigger. This increases the barrel length relative to the overall weapon length, permitting shorter weapons for the same barrel length, saving weight and increasing maneuverability.
A Bullpup is simply a rifle where the action (i.e. the area of the receiver where the bolt, magazine, and barrel all meet) is located behind the firing grip instead of in front of it. In a traditional layout rifle, such as the AR-15, the action of the weapon is in front of the grip and trigger.
A bullpup is a firearm with its action behind its trigger group. This configuration permits a shorter overall weapon for a given barrel length. This maintains the advantages of a longer barrel in muzzle velocity and accuracy, while improving maneuverability and reducing weight.
