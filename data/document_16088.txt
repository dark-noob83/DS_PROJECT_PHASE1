Welcome to Steel Beam Calculator. Below is our free Steel Beam Calculator with a beam span length fixed at 3 feet which you can try out for free, our full version is available from $40 and allows users to design and check simply supported W Beams, S Beams and American Standard Channels for any length span.
A 10 m long beam with two supports is loaded with two equal and symmetrical loads F1 and F2, each 500 kg. The support forces F3 and F4 can be calculated. (500 kg) (9.81 m/s2) + (500 kg) (9.81 m/s2) = R1 + R2. R1 + R2 = 9810 (N). Note! Load due to the weight of a mass-m - is mg Newton's-where g = 9.81 m/s2.
Example-A beam with two not symmetrical loads. A 10 m long beam with two supports is loaded with two loads, 500 kg is located 1 m from the end (R1), and the other load of 1000 kg is located 6 m from the same end. The balance of forces can be expressed as. (500 kg) (9.81 m/s2) + (1000 kg) (9.81 m/s2) = R1 + R2.
Steel I-Beam Costs. You can find a steel I-beam from your local steel supplier. If you need just one length of I-beam you may be able to have them cut you a 6’ or 8’ length from a scrap piece they have left over from a large shipment. This will cost anywhere from $.90 to $1.25 per pound.
We removed two load bearing walls and installed steel support beams. We used W10x19 steel I-beams to span the 14'-6 in the living room and 10' in the kitchen. http://vincentabellcontracting.com. 1  Howto & Style. 2  Standard YouTube License.
What they were looking for: I need a 30x30 steel beam building for equipment storage.. Price paid: 10X10X12 I-beam building with 24 gauge roof and walls and 3 inches of insulation in the roof. It has a 10X10 steel roll-up door and one 38 inch entry door.
Standard American Beams, aka Junior Beam, S Beam, or I Beams have tapered flanges for increased strength of the flanges compared to the wide flange or H beams. 1  Specifications: ASTM A36 / A572 Gr. 2  50, the standard specification for steel structural shapes for use in general construction.
A steel I beam is a great structural alternative to lolly columns or other support methods. Steel is one of the strongest building materials known to man. Steel is mostly comprised of iron, 98%.
