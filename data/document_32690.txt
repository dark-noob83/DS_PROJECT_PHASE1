A pay grade is a unit in systems of monetary compensation for employment. It is commonly used in public service, both civil and military, but also for companies of the private sector. Pay grades facilitate the employment process by providing a fixed framework of salary ranges, as opposed to a free negotiation. Typically, pay grades encompass two dimensions: a vertical range where each level corresponds to the responsibility of, and requirements needed for a certain position; and a horizontal range within this scale to allow for monetary incentives rewarding the employee 's quality of performance or length of service.
Although a salary grade can feature a more detailed pay breakdown, the salary-grade system generally has three pay points -- minimum, middle and maximum. The minimum salary grade for a position indicates the lowest pay a new hire with limited experience could get. Salary Grade Purpose.

Salary grades at Harvard. Every staff position has a grade level.

Below is the active 2015 Military Pay Scale chart (1.0% raise) for the United States military (all services). Enlisted personnel are E grades ranging from E-1 to E-9. For those service branches recognizing a Warrant Officer rank, W grades range W-1 to W-5. Officers are scaled as O-1 to O-10
Members in pay grades O-1, O-2, and O-3 with more than four years of prior cumulative service in an enlisted or warrant officer grade are paid increased wages using the special pay grades of O-1E, O-2E, and O-3E, respectively.

Enlisted pay grades begin at E-1 and finish at E-9; warrant officer pay grades begin at W-1 and finish at W-5; and officer pay grades begin at O-1 and finish at O-10.
Sample Grade Structure A simple grade structure might look like this: Grade Salary Minimum Salary Midpoint Salary Maximum 1 $7,500 10,000 12,500 2 9,500 12,000 14,500 3 11,500 14,000 16,500 4 14,000 17,000 20,000 I've used round numbers here. • The salary midpoint of a grade is typically 20-30% higher than the preceding grades salary midpoint. • The maximum of a grade may be higher than the minimum of the next higher grade (but doesn't need to be).

It doesn't have to be mathematically pure. For example the mid-point of grade 9 may be 20% lower than the midpoint of grade 10, whereas the midpoint of grade 10 may only be 15% lower than the midpoint of grade 11. Often specific pay issues will cause specific changes in the grade structure. • The salary midpoint of a grade is typically 20-30% higher than the preceding grades salary midpoint. • The maximum of a grade may be higher than the minimum of the next higher grade (but doesn't need to be).
