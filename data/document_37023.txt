The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain, lying in front of the motor and premotor areas. This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior. To define the prefrontal cortex as the projection zone of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus builds on the work of Rose and Woolsey who showed that this nucleus projects to anterior and ventral parts of the brain in nonprimates. Rose and Woolsey however termed this projection zone orbitofrontal..
For the reptile scale, see Prefrontal scale. In mammalian brain anatomy, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the cerebral cortex which covers the front part of the frontal lobe. The PFC contains Brodmann areas 9, 10, 11, 12, 46, and 47. A third definition of the prefrontal cortex is the area of frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not lead to observable movements. For example, in 1890 David Ferrier used the term in this sense.

Noun. 1. prefrontal cortex-the anterior part of the frontal lobe. prefrontal lobe. cerebral cortex, cerebral mantle, cortex, pallium-the layer of unmyelinated neurons (the grey matter) forming the cortex of the cerebrum. lobe - (anatomy) a somewhat rounded subdivision of a bodily organ or part; ear lobe.
The Prefrontal Cortex is that part of the brain located behind our forehead that is responsible for the executive function, meaning that it acts like a conductor communicating, guiding, and coordinating the functions of the different parts of the brain. 
the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe of each of the brain's cerebral hemispheres. It acts in attention, planning, and memory and is separated into a dorsolateral region and an orbito-frontal region. PREFRONTAL CORTEX: The prefrontal cortex is commonly referred to as the frontal association area..
