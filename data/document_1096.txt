Al(OH) 3, for example, acts as an acid when it reacts with a base. Conversely, it acts as a base when it reacts with an acid. The Br nsted Definition of Acids and Bases. The Brnsted, or Brnsted-Lowry, model is based on a simple assumption: Acids donate H ions to another ion or molecule, which acts as a base. Arrhenius bases include ionic compounds that contain the OH-ion, such as NaOH, KOH, and Ca(OH) 2. This theory explains why acids have similar properties: The characteristic properties of acids result from the presence of the H + ion generated when an acid dissolves in water.
These electrically-conductive compounds were termed Arrhenius acids. By definition, Arrhenius acids are compounds that produce hydrogen ions (H+) in solution. Let's take a closer look at the chemical structure of an Arrhenius acid. Hydrobromic acid is an Arrhenius acid with the formula HBr. In the 1880s, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius was busy studying the electrical properties of chemicals when put in water. In his studies, he noticed that certain compounds produced hydrogen ions, often called protons, when they were put into aqueous (or water-based) solution.
The Arrhenius definition of an. acid is a substance that when dissolved in water increases the concentration of hydrogen ion, H (aq) . A base is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of hydroxide ion, OH (aq) . An acid is a substance which when added to water increases the concentration of [H ], therefore, an acid must have a [H M. A base must have a concentration of [OH M.
Arrhenius argued that bases are neutral compounds that either dissociate or ionize in water to give OH-ions and a positive ion. NaOH is an Arrhenius base because it dissociates in water to give the hydroxide (OH -) and sodium (Na +) ions. Arrhenius bases include ionic compounds that contain the OH-ion, such as NaOH, KOH, and Ca(OH) 2. This theory explains why acids have similar properties: The characteristic properties of acids result from the presence of the H + ion generated when an acid dissolves in water.

Arrhenius Acid Definition: An Arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the number of H + ions in the water. The H + ion is also associated with the water molecule in the form of a hydronium ion, H 3 O + and follows the reaction: 
Arrhenius Acid Definition: Hydronium breaks up to yield an H+ in solution. Arrhenius Base Definition: Hydroxide is an OH-dissolved in water. Bronsted-Lowry Acid Definition: Hydronium is an H+ donor regardless of solution. Bronsted-Lowry Base Definition: Hydroxide attacks and accepts the H+ from hydronium. Lewis Acid Definition: The H+ on Hydronium accepts the attacking electron pair to form a bond.
According to Arrhenius theory, an acid is a substance which has a hydrogen atom and can be given in the form of hydrogen ion in aqueous solution. Such substances are called as Arrhenius acids. For example, Ammonia is not a base according to the Arrhenius acid-base theory. Since there is no hydroxyl group present in the ammonia (NH 3) molecule, so, it should be basic. But ammonia shows basic nature. This can be explained by using the concept of
Arrhenius defined an acidA compound that increases the concentration of hydrogen ion (H) in aqueous solution. as a compound that increases the concentration of hydrogen ion (H) in aqueous solution. Many acids are simple compounds that release a hydrogen cation into solution when they dissolve.

Arrhenius Acid. An Arrhenius acid is a molecule that when dissolved in water will donate an H+ in solution. Simply put, a proton donor. The trick to recognizing an Arrhenius acid is to look for a molecule that starts with an H, and typically contains an oxygen or halogen. Bronsted-Lowry Acid Definition: Hydronium is an H+ donor regardless of solution. Bronsted-Lowry Base Definition: Hydroxide attacks and accepts the H+ from hydronium. Lewis Acid Definition: The H+ on Hydronium accepts the attacking electron pair to form a bond.
