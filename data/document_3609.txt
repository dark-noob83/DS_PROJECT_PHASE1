The most common reason for scar tissue in the back is from surgery; however, there are other causes that will cause scar tissue to form. Repetitive motion, injury, and surgery can cause scar tissue to form. Other causes for scar tissue can be sporting accidents or any other type of accident causing damage to the spine.
Scars are a natural part of the body's healing process. A scar results from the biologic process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues. Most wounds, except for very minor ones, result in some degree of scarring. Scars can result from accidents, diseases, skin conditions such as acne, or surgeries.
1 This type of scarring is often seen with acne scars or with wounds where skin or muscle is removed by an injury. 2  This type of scarring can also happen when the body produces so much scar tissue in one area that it prevents new cells from growing where the wound took place.
A hypertrophic scar is a red, raised scar that forms along a wound and can have the following characteristics for around two to five years: 1  it can restrict movement because scar tissue is not as flexible as the original skin. 2  it heals within the size of the original wound. 3  the healing tissue is thicker than usual.
Scar Tissue Causes. Scar tissue is the formation of fibrosis connective tissue that is created to act as a protective barrier. It replaces healthy tissues that have been damaged due to a number of reasons. Scar tissue generally forms in muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, and joints. It is also called an adhesion.
A scar is the body's natural way of healing and replacing lost or damaged skin. A scar is usually composed of fibrous tissue. Scars may be formed for many different reasons, including as a result of infections, surgery, injuries, or inflammation of tissue. Scars may appear anywhere on the body, and the composition of a scar may vary-appearing flat, lumpy, sunken, colored, painful, or itchy.
