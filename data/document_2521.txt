DTC 0309. Diagnostic Trouble Code 0309 points to a problem with the EVAP Canister Vent Control Valve. EVAP = EVAPorative emissions control system. This is the system which seeks to minimize air pollution which results from evaporation (as opposed to incomplete combustion) of gasoline.
The evaporative purge system consists of a container and valve. The charcoal container has a opening on its bottom side which enables air to enter the purge system. The charcoal traps fuel vapors, which are sucked into the intake manifold when the engine activates.
Canister Vent Valve. The canister vent valve closes the fuel tank vent to prevent outside air from entering the EVAP system during an evaporative system leak test. Symptoms of Wear or Failure.
When the engine is off, the purge valve is closed. When the engine is running and fully warmed up, the engine computer gradually opens the purge valve to allow some amount of fuel vapor to be moved from the charcoal canister to be burned in the engine.
A purge valve is the part of the vehicle Evaporative Emission Control (EVAP). system. The EVAP system prevents fuel vapors in the fuel tank from escaping into the atmosphere.
This purge valve doesn't seal properly and must be replaced. This car had a Check Engine light on the dash. We had it scanned and got the code P0446 - Evaporative Emission Control System Vent Control Circuit Malfunction. We tested the EVAP system and found that it had a slow leak.
