Moreover, at points immediately to the left of a maximum -- at a point C -- the slope of the tangent is positive: f ' (x right -- at a point D -- the slope is negative: f ' (x). In other words, at a maximum, f '(x) changes sign from + to − . At a minimum, f '(x) changes sign from − to + . At x = 1 there is a maximum of y = 17. At x = −2 there is a minimum of y = −10. c) y = 2 x 3 + 3 x 2 + 12 x − 4. Since f ' (x) = 0 has no real solutions, there are no extreme values. d) y = 3 x 4 − 4 x 3 − 12 x 2 + 2. At x = 0 there is a maximum of y = 2.
The minimum and maximum possible value is defined by the tolerance. To calculate the range of the resistor, simply add or remove the amount of the tolerance. For example, a 1 … 00Kohm resistor with 5% tolerance can range from 95Kohm through until 105Kohm. 
The following problems are maximum/minimum optimization problems. They illustrate one of the most important applications of the first derivative. Many students find these problems intimidating because they are word problems, and because there does not appear to be a pattern to these problems. 6. Verify that your result is a maximum or minimum value using the first or second derivative test for extrema. 1  PROBLEM 1: Find two nonnegative numbers whose sum is 9 and so that the product of one number and the square of the other number is a maximum.
Limitations of the Maximum and Minimum. The maximum and minimum are very sensitive to outliers. This is for the simple reason that if any value is added to a data set that is less than the minimum, then the minimum changes and it is this new value. In a similar way, if any value that exceeds the maximum is included in a data set, then the maximum will change.
Functions can have hills and valleys: places where they reach a minimum or maximum value. It may not be the minimum or maximum for the whole function, but locally it is. 
Answers. Best Answer: Minimum means least possible. Maximum means most possible. By definition, maximum can be more than or the same as minimum but NOT less. Minimum can be less than *or* the same as maximum. 
We call it a relative maximum because other values of the function may in fact be greater. We say that a function f (x) has a relative minimum value at x = b, if f (b) is less than any value immediately preceding or follwing. Again, other values of the function may in fact be less. At x = 1 there is a maximum of y = 17. At x = −2 there is a minimum of y = −10. c) y = 2 x 3 + 3 x 2 + 12 x − 4. Since f ' (x) = 0 has no real solutions, there are no extreme values. d) y = 3 x 4 − 4 x 3 − 12 x 2 + 2. At x = 0 there is a maximum of y = 2.
The function has a minimum value at x = a if f '(a) = 0 and f ''(a) = a positive number. The function has a maximum value at x = a if f '(a) = 0 and f ''(a) = a negative number. In the case of the maximum, the slope of the tangent is decreasing -- it is going from positive to negative. At x = 1 there is a maximum of y = 17. At x = −2 there is a minimum of y = −10. c) y = 2 x 3 + 3 x 2 + 12 x − 4. Since f ' (x) = 0 has no real solutions, there are no extreme values. d) y = 3 x 4 − 4 x 3 − 12 x 2 + 2. At x = 0 there is a maximum of y = 2.
Uses of the Maximum and Minimum. The maximum and minimum show up in the calculations for other summary statistics. Both of these two numbers are used to calculate the range, which is simply the difference of the maximum and minimum. They are also two of the numbers that make up the five number summary for a data set. This is for the simple reason that if any value is added to a data set that is less than the minimum, then the minimum changes and it is this new value. In a similar way, if any value that exceeds the maximum is included in a data set, then the maximum will change.
The Full-time Student Program is for full-time students employed in retail or service stores, agriculture, or colleges and universities. The employer that hires students can obtain a certificate from the Department of Labor which allows the student to be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. Other programs that allow for payment of less than the full federal minimum wage apply to workers with disabilities, full-time students, and student-learners employed pursuant to sub-minimum wage certificates.
