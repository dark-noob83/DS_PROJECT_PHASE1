You should get a fill-in every 2weeks it depends on how fast your nails grow. They will grow while the nails are on but acrylic makes your real nails paper thin. They should last very long just keep up with your fill-in's.
Hi there. Any form of nail enhancement can last at least 2-3 weeks if its applied correctly and taken care of correctly by the client!!! You may have done a fantastic job but if your client is heavy handed and doesnt care for her nails..... then they wont last. Its also very unlikely that her nails 'fell off'.

Getting acrylics done is easy but you have to take care of them regularly or you are inviting trouble to your nails. Acrylic nails usually last for 2 â€“ 3 weeks before you will need little filling and fixing job done. In some cases, girls easily manage up to 4 weeks before they go for the filling. The overall life of the acrylic nails varies from 2 to 3 months.
Best Answer: I have been wearing my acrylic nails for almost 5 years with only a short break to do some decorating. You can wear them indefinately, as your nails do not need to breathe, they do not have lungs & they are 'dead' keratin once they have come out from under the eponychium (cuticle area).
