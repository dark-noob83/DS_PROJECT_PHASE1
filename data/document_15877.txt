Wind is a form of solar energy. Winds are caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the earth's surface, and rotation of the earth. Wind flow patterns are modified by the earth's terrain, bodies of water, and vegetative cover.
Wind is caused by the difference in pressure from one point on the earth's surface to another. The air moving from the area of higher pressure to the area of lower pressure is called wind. The air does not move directly from the point of highest pressure to the point of lowest pressure.
Find out what makes the wind blow and the differences between small scale winds-like a sea breeze-and large scale winds blowing across the globe. To understand what makes the wind blow, we first need to understand what atmospheric pressure is. Pressure at the earth's surface is a measure of the 'weight' of air pressing down on it. The greater the mass of air above us, the higher the pressure we feel, and vice-versa.
Wind is air in motion. Wind forms when the sun heats one part of the atmosphere differently than another part. This causes expansion of warmer air, making less pressure where it is warm than where it is cooler. Air always moves from high pressure to lower pressure, and this movement of air is wind. During the day at a coast, the sun heats the air above the land more quickly than the air above water. The warm air over the land expands and rises. Cooler air from the ocean moves toward the land to take the place of the rising air, and makes a sea breeze that cools beachgoers in the summer.
It is produced by the uneven heating of the earths surface by the sun. Since the earths surface is made of various land and water formations, it absorbs the suns radiation unevenly. Two factors are necessary to specify wind: speed and direction.
