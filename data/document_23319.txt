The contamination of a building environment caused by bacteria, molds and their spores, pollen, viruses, and other biological materials (e.g., animal and human dander insect and arachnid excreta). It is often linked to poorly designed and maintained HVAC systems. 
Food contamination is when something makes the food inedible or can cause illness when consumed. Contamination can be   # Biological (bacteria, parasites, viruses, etc.) …  # Chemical (cleaners, sanitizers, additives, etc.)  # Physical (glass, metal, etc.)   Contamination is not necessarily obvious or visible.

Biological hazards, also known as biohazards, refer to biological substances that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, primarily that of humans. This can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can affect human health. 1 Category A, UN 2814- Infectious substance, affecting humans: An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs.
1. Bacteria: are microorganisms with a size of up to 5 µm and represent the most important group of pathogens when discussing microbiological contamination. According to the constitution of their cell wall, bacteria can. 2. Viruses: subcellular biological objects with a size of 20-200 nm. They exist with and without envelopes (shells mostly derived from host membranes covering the virus) and can cause serious infections (see Figure 2, HI-Virus).
Definition. Living organisms (such as bacteria, enzymes, fungi, viruses) or their products that can be hazardous to animal or human health if inhaled, swallowed, or otherwise absorbed into the body. http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biological-contaminants.html.

Definition. Microbiological contamination refers to the non-intended or accidental introduction of infectious material like bacteria, yeast, mould, fungi, virus, prions, protozoa or their toxins and by-products.[1,2]. 2. Viruses: subcellular biological objects with a size of 20-200 nm. They exist with and without envelopes (shells mostly derived from host membranes covering the virus) and can cause serious infections (see Figure 2, HI-Virus).
Biological pollution (bioinvasion impacts or biopollution) is a term that defines adverse effects of invasive alien species (IAS) on quality of aquatic and terrestrial environment. Biopollution may cause adverse effects at several levels of biological organization : 
All hazards are assessed and categorized into three groups: biological, chemical and physical hazards. A general definition of a hazard as related to food safety is conditions or contaminants that can cause illness or injury. Biological hazards include microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds and parasites. Some of these are pathogens or may produce toxins. A pathogenic microorganism causes disease and can vary in the degree of severity. Examples of biological hazards include Salmonella, E. coli and Clostridium botulinum.
