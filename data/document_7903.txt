Mixed seeding. Plant rye at the lowest locally recommended rate when seeding with a legume (361), and at low to medium rates with other grasses. In a Maryland study, a mix of 42 pounds of rye and 19 pounds of hairy vetch per acre was the optimum fall seeding rate before no-till corn on a silt loam soil (81). If planting with clovers, seed rye at a slightly higher rate, about 56 lb. per acre. For transplanting tomatoes into hilly, erosion-prone soil, Steve Groff fall-seeds a per-acre mix of 30 pounds rye, 25 pounds hairy vetch and 10 pounds crimson clover.
Compared to other cereal grains, rye grows faster in the fall and produces more dry matter the following spring--up to 10,000 pounds per acre, although 2 tons is more typical in the Northeast. When growing a winter rye and legume mixture, the rate of winter rye seeding should be reduced to no more than a bushel per acre to allow space for the legume to grow. A seeding rate of about 20 to 30 pounds of hairy vetch per acre is recommended.
The following example shows how to calculate seeding rate in pounds per acre of fall rye with a 93 per cent germination rate, 33 grams per 1,000 kernel weight and a seedbed emergence mortality rate of 3 per cent. Target plant population is 20 plants per square foot. Seeding Rate. Fall rye intended as a grain crop should be sown at 55 to 60 lb/acre (1 bu/acre). Fall rye planted for late fall or early spring pasture may be sown at a heavier rate of 55 to 110 lb/acre (1 - 2 bu/acre).
Rye can grow in low-fertility soils where other cereal grains may fail. Optimum soil pH is 5.0 ­ 7.0, but pH in the range of 4.5 ­ 8.0 is tolerated. Suggested seeding rates are 1 to 2 bushes per acre if drilled, 1.5 to 3 bushes per acre if broadcast and lightly tilled in. A bushel of rye is said to weigh 56 pounds. When growing a winter rye and legume mixture, the rate of winter rye seeding should be reduced to no more than a bushel per acre to allow space for the legume to grow. A seeding rate of about 20 to 30 pounds of hairy vetch per acre is recommended.
Seeding Recommendations • 56 – 112 lbs. (1 to 2 bu.) per acre depending on the use of the crop and if you plan to interseed another crop with it. Use higher rates for grain production and lower rates for cover crop. Plant one bushel of rye with 20 to 30 pounds of hairy vetch per acre. • Drill about 1 inch deep, depending on soil moisture and soil texture. Avoid seeding deeper than 1½ inches. A grain drill with press wheels is the best because it places the seed at a uniform depth and gives good soil-seed contact. • Approximately19,900 seeds per pound • 56 pounds per bushel • Winter Rye can yield 30 - 60 bushels/acre Management Considerations • Winter rye can be grown for grain production, forage, or as a cover crop to help control soil erosion, build soil organic matter, and for weed control.
In 1930 Minnesota grew 7.2 million acres of rye for grain, while in 1989 there were 32,000 Minnesota acres harvested and Wisconsin harvested rye from 6,000 acres. The average yield in 1920 was 17 bushels per acre, while in 1989 it was 34 bushels in the Upper Midwest. 
Generally, this is equivalent to approximately 1 bushel rye seed/acre for crop production. A bushel of rye is 56 lbs. If rye is intended to be used as a late fall forage or spring pasture, seeding rate can be increased to a range of 1 - 2 bushels/acre. A target of 20 - 24 plants per square foot is wanted. Do not seed deeper than 2 inches as rye is the most sensitive to depth of all small grain crops. Example1: The following example shows how to calculate seeding rate in pounds per acre of fall rye with a 93 per cent germination rate, 33 grams per 1,000 kernel weight and a seedbed emergence mortality rate of 3 per cent. Target plant population is 20 plants per square foot
Bennett figures the rye saves him $15 to $30 per acre in material costs and fieldwork, compared with conventional no-till systems for soybeans. Rye doesn’t hurt his bean yields, either. Usually at or above county average, his yields range from 45 to 63 bushels per acre, depending on rainfall, says Bennett. If planting with clovers, seed rye at a slightly higher rate, about 56 lb. per acre. For transplanting tomatoes into hilly, erosion-prone soil, Steve Groff fall-seeds a per-acre mix of 30 pounds rye, 25 pounds hairy vetch and 10 pounds crimson clover.
