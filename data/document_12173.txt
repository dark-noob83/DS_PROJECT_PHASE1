Stick to whole foods, eat enough protein and essential fatty acids, and then eat a carbohydrate intake that is commensurate with your activity levels. If you don’t do much of any exercise, 50-100 grams/day should be plenty. And yes, do not go that low on your calories. I was eating 1200 calories a day and doing cardio 6 days a week and weight training 3 days a week. I tried to up my calories intake to 1600 a day but I gained 4 pounds in about 3 weeks. I have to admit I really don’t know what to do and I don’t want to gain all my weight back.
But the best thing to do is drink water like your doing. And from now on eat the right amount of calories becasue iff you dont then its totally a bad choce. It slows dowwn your metabolism and makes your body feel deprived then it starts to eat away and extra stuff in your body. And then once you go back to eating normal calories you can gain weight
If you don't eat enough calories, you eventually die. You would lose weight. If it continued, the body would start breaking down stored fat, then protein (meaning the muscles) if this stage of starvation occurred. Surprisingly, you will gain weight if you do not eat enough of quality calories to sustain your body and its activities. That is because, biologically, our bodies are programm … ed to preserve fat if they perceive a shortage of food (starvation).
To begin with, your body will simply go to the stored energy and calories it has (stored in fat cells) in the body. Once this is happening, other things may begin to also happen if not enough calories still aren't coming in daily... * Reduction of fat. Surprisingly, you will gain weight if you do not eat enough of quality calories to sustain your body and its activities.

It may not seem like a big deal to consume a hundred or so fewer calories than you're supposed to each day, but that's a dangerous — and incorrect — assumption. It is absolutely 100 percent essential to eat enough calories! If you don't, it will destroy your metabolism. It's like telling your body that you're starving. If your body thinks it's starving, your metabolism will shut down. Not eating enough calories will also force the body to cannibalize muscle and hold on to fat. The body considers muscle to be expendable during periods of starvation, and it considers fat to be necessary to insulate your organs for survival
Best Answer: If you eat too little calories, and burn a decent amount your going to get a little bit light headed, your body may go into a famine stage where it is starving. so when you do eat, your body will hold on to all the food, thus slowing your metabolism. So that's not good. But I will explain what happens when you starve yourself (below 1200 calories for woman). When you starve yourself your body goes into starvation mode, which means everything you eat is stored as fat.
Second of all, if you continue to not eat calories higher than 1,200, your body will go into starvation mode so the next time you eat above 1,200+ calories, your body's going to store everything as fat. But I will explain what happens when you starve yourself (below 1200 calories for woman). When you starve yourself your body goes into starvation mode, which means everything you eat is stored as fat.
Your body needs glucose. Among other things, If you aren’t eating enough carbohydrates, it will break down protein (muscle being a possible source). Fat can also provide some glucose, but not enough to support high intensity activity. Whether “starvation mode” is a myth or not is beside the point.

If you don’t take in enough calories every day, you may not be as fast and as strong as you could be, and may even break down rather than build up your muscles. If you are a healthy weight (in other words you don’t need to gain or lose weight), here are some general guidelines to help you eat enough: 1  Don’t skip meals. 2  It is too hard to make up the lost food later. 3  Add a healthy snack between breakfast and lunch, lunch and dinner, and right before bed
