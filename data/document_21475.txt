Quick Answer. In email, CC stands for carbon copy, while BCC stand for blind carbon copy. Those email addresses listed under CC in an email get a copy of the email, and everyone on the list can see who they are. Those email addresses listed under BCC receive an email, but it is not visible to other recipients.
The Shortcomings of Cc: When you send a message to more than one address using the Cc: field, both the original recipient and all the recipients of the carbon copies see the To: and Cc: fields including all the addresses in them. This means that every recipient gets to know the email addresses of all the persons that received your message.
