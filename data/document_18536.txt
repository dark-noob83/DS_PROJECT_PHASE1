Kosher beef buyers are restricted to the forequarters of the animal. It is one of the staples of many Jewish households. We love our steak, burgers, sausages, pies and of course that great Sunday tradition, salt beef on rye. Since then, butchers have used castrated steers aged between 18-24 months. Most offal is now off the kosher menu, as it is considered too risky for human consumption. Liver and heart are still permitted although if you fancy beef heart you will probably have to make a special request.

Kosher food is food that meets Jewish dietary laws, or kashrut. The word kashrut comes from a Hebrew word for fit or proper.. Though many unfamiliar with the concept assume kosher food is healthy food, it actually refers to any food that has been prepared in adherence to Jewish law, or halacha.
