PREVALENCE. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in adults in the United States is approximately 1% (1). Women have a slightly higher prevalence versus men at 1.5% compared to 0.6% in men. Generally, these rates hold true in most populations, but there are some notable exceptions. 
Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are two of its most common types. Osteoarthritis affects an estimated 1.6 million Australians, and over 428,000 people are estimated to have rheumatoid arthritis. • The prevalence of osteoarthritis has fluctuated around 7.5% to 7.6% since 2001. A snapshot of arthritis in Australia 2010 3 Rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to affect over 428,000 Australians, a prevalence rate of 2.1%. Almost 63% of these are females. While the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis continues to rise with age among males, it peaks in females in ages 65–74 years (Table 1). The NHS time series reveal an increase in the prevalence of arthritis between 2001 and 2007–08
Epidemiology. RA is the most common inflammatory arthritis, with an estimated overall prevalence of 1%, which increases to at least 2% in the older population. Females with young-onset RA (RA onset prior to the age of 60) are two to four times as likely to be affected as males. This ratio decreases to 1.5 to 1 for females in late-onset RA (RA onset after the age of 60).
One of the most predominant symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis is aching in the joints. People often think their pain is due to overexertion or osteoarthritis, the type of arthritis common in old age. This achiness can also be misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome (fatigue is another symptom of RA). RA joint pain is not fleeting; it usually lasts longer than a week. Why women get RA and other forms of arthritis more than men is one of the tasks that Canada's Arthritis and Autoimmune Research Centre has set for itself.
More than 3.1 million Australians (15.2% of the total population) were estimated to be affected by arthritis in 2007–08. The disease is more common in females than in males. • The prevalence of arthritis increased from 13.6% to 15.3% between 2001 and 2004–05. However, almost no change in its prevalence was noted between 2004–05 and 2007–08.• Indigenous Australians have higher prevalence of arthritis than non-Indigenous Australians. A snapshot of arthritis in Australia 2010 3 Rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to affect over 428,000 Australians, a prevalence rate of 2.1%. Almost 63% of these are females. While the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis continues to rise with age among males, it peaks in females in ages 65–74 years (Table 1). The NHS time series reveal an increase in the prevalence of arthritis between 2001 and 2007–08
We also present results from some new analyses from the patient registers in Oslo to supplement existing literature in this area. We found that the prevalence of RA is higher in females than males, the incidence is 4-5 times higher below the age of 50, but above 60-70 years the female/male ratio is only about 2. Smoking is a consistent predictor of RA in males, but findings have been more inconsistent in females. We also found that female sex reduces the likelihood of achieving treatment response with methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs by 30-50%. More research is needed to fully describe the differences between males and females regarding epidemiological data.
Overall, arthritis affected 17.5% of females in Australia in 2007-08, compared with 12.9% of males. Osteoarthritis affected 9.7% of females and only 5.9% of males, while rheumatoid arthritis affected 2.6% of females and 1.6% of males. Similarly, 5.5% of females had osteoporosis in 2007-08, compared with only 1.2% of males (graph 2.5). Of those persons with arthritis, the two most prevalent forms were osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. These accounted for 51% (1.6 million) and 14% (428,500) of all cases respectively.
Many rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more frequent in females than males. The objective of this article was to examine the female versus male perspective regarding prevalence/incidence, etiological factors, disease severity/outcomes, access to therapy and therapeutic responses. We also found that female sex reduces the likelihood of achieving treatment response with methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs by 30-50%. More research is needed to fully describe the differences between males and females regarding epidemiological data.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common disease with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 1% with an annual incidence of about 3/10,000 adults. It is two to three times more common in women.1 Its prevalence varies between different countries.
