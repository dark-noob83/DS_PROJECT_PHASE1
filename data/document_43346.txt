Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed of sand-sized grains of mineral, rock or organic material. It also contains a cementing material that binds the sand grains together and may contain a matrix of silt-or clay-size particles that occupy the spaces between the sand grains. Sandstone is one of the most common types of sedimentary rock and is found in sedimentary basins throughout the world. It is often mined for use as a construction material or as a raw material used in manufacturing.
Sandstone is a naturally occurring block found 4-5 blocks below natural Sand deposits, but only in Desert Biomes and Beaches. Sandstone can also be crafted, by placing four blocks of Sand in a square, not requiring the 3x3 crafting grid.
