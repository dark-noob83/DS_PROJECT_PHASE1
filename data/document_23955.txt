In plate tectonics, divergent boundaries occur when plates pull  apart. On land, divergent boundaries form rifts or valleys. More  commonly, divergent boundaries in the ocea … n occur and cause  mid-oceanic ridges. Divergent boundaries can also form volcanoes  when the plates separate enough to allow molten lava to seep out,  harden, and eventually form islands. 7 people found this useful.
In the theory of plate tectonics, the earth's crust is broken into plates that move around relative to each other. As a result of this movement, three types of plate boundaries are formed: divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries. Plates also can pull apart from each other. This is known as a divergent boundary. A divergent boundary is a fault where the two plates are moving away from each other. Now, as plates pull apart, several things may occur. First of all, volcanic activity is common in these areas since mantle easily moves to the surface through the thin, fractured rock as it separat

ANS: Most volcanoes occur at either divergent plate boundaries at ocean ridges or rifts; at convergent plate boundaries at subduction zones; or at hot spots, which are not plate boundaries, but are areas where hot mantle plumes cause volcanic activity.PTS: 1 DIF: L2 OBJ: 10.8 16. lava plateau____ 8.

Identify plate boundaries as places where tectonic plates meet and interact; Differentiate between how plates move relative to each other at convergent, divergent, and transform boundaries; Identify landforms associated with each type of boundary, and explain how the movement of the plates result in those landforms.

Mountains and volcanoes are the most common landforms associated with the movement along plate boundaries. Earthquakes also happen at each type of plate boundary. Divergent boundaries occur most often at mid-ocean ridges. As the plates move away from each other a break, or rift, in Earth's crust is created. Magma from the mantle rises up to fill the gap, creating new crust. At an oceanic-continental convergent boundary, subduction of the more dense ocean plate occurs
