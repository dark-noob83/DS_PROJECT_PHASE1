agonist muscle prime mover (see agonist). antagonist muscle muscles or muscle groups which neutralize action of another muscle or muscle group (see antagonist; muscle contraction).
Noun. 1. antagonistic muscle - (physiology) a muscle that opposes the action of another; the biceps and triceps are antagonistic muscles. muscle, musculus-one of the contractile organs of the body. agonist-a muscle that contracts while another relaxes; when bending the elbow the biceps are the agonist. antagonist-a muscle that relaxes while another contracts; when bending the elbow the triceps are the antagonist. physiology-the branch of the biological sciences dealing with the functioning of organisms.
Muscle pairs. Antagonistic pairs of muscles create movement when one (the prime mover) contracts and the other (the antagonist) relaxes. Examples of antagonistic pairs working are: 1  the quadriceps and hamstrings in the leg. 2  the biceps and triceps in the arm.

Antagonistic Muscle. (physiology) a muscle that opposes the action of another; the biceps and triceps are antagonistic muscles .A muscle that acts as the opposing force in contraction or relaxing of a muscle. An example of this is the the contraction of the biceps, where the triceps would be the antagonistic muscles.
