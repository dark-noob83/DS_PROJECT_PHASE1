INTRODUCTION: Chlorophyll often hides the other pigments present in leaves. In Autumn, chlorophyll breaks down, allowing xanthophyll and carotene, and newly made anthocyanin, to show their colors. The mix of pigments in a leaf may be separated into bands of color by the technique of paper chromatography. 
Purpose. The purpose of the experiment is to determine the specific types of pigments found in a beat leaf and in a spinach leaf by using paper chromatography and two solvents: water soluble solvent and lipid soluble solvent. Hypothesis. Spinach will have mainly chlorophyll A and B because the leaf is completely green, compared to the beat leaf which consists of both a red and green shade showing that other pigments are present in this leaf.
The pigments in spinach are Chlorophyll (green), Xanthophyll (yellow), Carotenoids (orange), and Anthocyanins (red). The pigments in the green leaf[spinach] contain 2 yellow green[chlorophyll b], faint yellow[carotenes] an yellow[xanthophyll]. In the red leaf[Moses in the Cradle or Poinsetti … a] the colors and pigments where yellow green[chlorophyll b], faint yellow[carotenes] and red[anthocyanins]

And carotenes and xanthophylls are accessory pigments that make up the rest of the pigmentation. Carotene is the most soluble of the pigments and as a result will be carried the farthest by the solvent. The paper will display a spectrum of the pigments found in the spinach leaves. Using the formula Rf one can determine the relationship between the distance the solvent traveled to the distance the pigment traveled.
Chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the green pigment in most plants that is associated with photosynthesis. The pigment absorbs all colored light except for the green band, which it reflects to give spinach its characteristic leaf and stem color. Pigments are compounds in plants that give it color. They absorb certain spectra of light and reflect others. For example, chlorophyll reflects green light. Particularly intense reflection will augment the color of the plant.

Actually, chlorophyll is only one of many types of pigments present in the leaf and one of several that are involved in the process of photosynthesis. Once removed from the leaf, the photosynthetic pigments can be separated from one another and identified using a process called chromatography.
