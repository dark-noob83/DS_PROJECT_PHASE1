Description and significance. Francisella tularensis is a gram-negative bacteria (Gram-negative bacteria contain an outer membrane outside the peptidoglycan cell wall, unlike Gram-positive bacteria that have a thicker layer of cell wall and no outer membrane. Many of the Gram-negative bacteria are pathogenic), with pili on the surface.
Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative, non-spore forming bacterium, is the causal agent of tularemia (rabbit fever, deerfly fever). F. tularensis is endemic throughout North America and Eurasia and is one of the most infectious pathogenic bacteria known.
Francisella tularensis is incubated best at 35-37 oC. This microbe is found to be fastidious to cystine and cysteine. Francisella tularensis appear as small (0.2 by 0.2 Âµm), gram negative coccobacilli in a gram stain.
Tularemia is an acute, febrile, granulomatous, infectious zoonosis caused by Francisella tularensis, an aerobic, gram-negative, pleomorphic bacillus. F tularensis is one of the most infectious bacterial species known, as it can cause illness in humans with exposure to as few as 10-50 organisms.
Francisella tularensis is a common gram negative bacteria that is found throughout the United States, but is most commonly located in the central states (Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Oklahoma, Tennesee). This small microbe is the cause of a medical condition diagnosed as rabbit fever (Tularemia).
Tularemia is a rare but serious infection caused by the small, rod-shaped, nonmotile bacterium Francisella tularensis. The microbe has been found in over 100 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, arthropods, and even fish, and the disease occurs throughout North American and Eurasia.
Overview. Tularemia is a disease of animals and humans caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. Rabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible and often die in large numbers during outbreaks. Humans can become infected through several routes, including:
