3. Multiply the annual kilowatt-hours consumed by your refrigerator by your cost per kilowatt-hour. Based on the average consumption of 600 to 800 kilowatt-hours per year, consumers in California can expect to pay $98.40 to $131.20 per year to operate a refrigerator. Find the monthly operating cost by multiplying your daily cost by 30. At the California average electricity price, a 300-watt unit costs $11.70 per month, or $140.40 per year. Refrigerators with a lower wattage rating will require much less energy, and thus cost much less to operate.
Initial cost: $25 at a garage sale (or maybe you moved the old fridge from the kitchen and it was free.) Regardless of how cheap it was, it’s still costing you a lot. 5 years of electricity to operate it: $1,415. Total: $1,440. New fridge (Energy Star). Initial cost: $674. 5 years of electricity to operate it: $450. Total: $1,124. When shopping for a new fridge, keep in mind that top and bottom freezer models use 10 to 25 percent less electricity than side-by-side models (energystar.gov). The Energy Star website has a cool calculator that can help you do the math. Make sure you put in our local electric rate of $0.22 per kilowatt-hour. Here are the annual electricity cost calculations for a few refrigerators with freezers on top (19.0 to 21.4 cubic-feet):
In 30 days, that's 90 kWh. My electric bill costs me an average of 11¢ per kWh. So, running 24 hours a day, my mini fridge would cost me about $10 a month. But it's not running continuously. If it were on half of the time, and off half of the time, it would cost me $5 per month. More likely, with my usage, it's on ¼ of the time, and off ¾ of the time, so it costs me more like $2.50 per mont
An energy-efficient large freezer with more than 25 cubic feet will use about 956 kilowatt-hours per year, according to EnergyStar.gov. That equates to about $10 a month. When you reduce the size of your freezer, your costs go down. Standard freezer sizes run between 19 cubic feet and 22 cubic feet. Monthly costs for these units average about $67 per year or a little over $5 a month. A chest freezer sized below 16.5 cubic feet costs $53 per year, using a total of 404 kilowatt-hours per year, or 34 kilowatt-hours per month. When you divide $53 by 12, your monthly costs equate to a little more than $4 per month.
Look on the back of your freezer for the sticker or plate that shows the unit's annual wattage usage. To calculate how much it costs to run, take the annual wattage figure – using 1,235 kilowatt-hours for a pre-1980 chest unit – divide it by 12 to get the kilowatt-hours per month, or 103. A chest freezer sized below 16.5 cubic feet costs $53 per year, using a total of 404 kilowatt-hours per year, or 34 kilowatt-hours per month. When you divide $53 by 12, your monthly costs equate to a little more than $4 per month.
The numbers are convincing. For instance, if your fridge was made before 1980 and cools 19-21 cubic feet, you could save $1,005 over five years by upgrading. The calculator says your old clunker costs $246 a year to run, but an Energy Star qualified fridge costs just $45 a year to run. That’s $201 cheaper per year! If you are running a second freezer, you could unplug it and save $174 a year. (That’s for a 19-21 cubic foot freezer made before 1980.) Both calculations are using the average national price of $.11 per kilowatt hour.
The more kilowatt hours, the more it will cost to run. For each KWh of electricity you use in Alice Springs, it costs you 25.83 cents (as of 1 Jan 2013). A fridge that uses 500 KWh in a year will cost you approximately $140 to run for the full year, or about $35 per quarter. Replacing an old inefficient freezer with a new energy efficient model can result in big savings for you. Some older freezers can cost as much as $330 a year to run, while many new models cost less than $130 a year. The most relevant indicator of the running costs of your fridge or freezer is the kilowatt hour (KWh) value, which can be found on the energy rating label of newer models
