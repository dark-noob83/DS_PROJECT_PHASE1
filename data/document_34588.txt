The average acceleration is the total change in velocity divided by the total time. This can be found using the equation a = Δv ÷ Δt. For example, if the velocity of an object changes from 20 m/s to 50 m/s over the course of 5 seconds the average acceleration would be: a = (50 m/s - 20 m/s) ÷ 5s. a = 30 ms ÷ 5s. For example, if the velocity of an object changes from 40 m/s to 10 m/s over a time interval of 2 seconds the average acceleration would be: a = (10 m/s - 40 m/s) ÷ 2s. a = -30 ms ÷ 2s. a = -15 m/s 2. This could also be called a deceleration of 15 m/s 2.
In physics acceleration not only has a magnitude (which is the m/s 2 number we discussed above), but also has a direction. This makes acceleration a vector. Force and Acceleration. Newton's second law of motion states that the force on an object equals the mass times the acceleration. For example, if the velocity of an object changes from 40 m/s to 10 m/s over a time interval of 2 seconds the average acceleration would be: a = (10 m/s - 40 m/s) ÷ 2s. a = -30 ms ÷ 2s. a = -15 m/s 2. This could also be called a deceleration of 15 m/s 2.
In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. 
exists and is an alternate of. Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answer by Win Marks. Confidence votes 2.4K. The Increase in Gas and Air fed into the engine cause it to produce more energy. This in turn increases its RPM, and the driving wheels rotate faster...increasing the car's Velocity.
1 An object has an acceleration of 8 m/s/s. 2  If the net force acting upon the object is increased by a factor of 4 and the mass of the object is increased by a factor of 2, then the new acceleration would be 16 m/s/s. 3  A 2-kg object accelerates from rest to a final velocity of 6 m/s in 3 seconds. 1 If the net force acting upon the object is increased by a factor of 4 and the mass of the object is increased by a factor of 2, then the new acceleration would be 16 m/s/s. 2  A 2-kg object accelerates from rest to a final velocity of 6 m/s in 3 seconds. 3  The magnitude of the net force acting upon the object is 12 N.
Answer by Schnazola. Confidence votes 12.4K. Forces If an object's velocity changes -- if its speed increases or decreases or if its direction changes -- that means it has accelerated. For an object to accelerate, the sum of the forces acting upon it must be non-zero. So, in other words, force changes an object's velocity. When velocity changes, that means that the object either moves faster, or moves slower, or moves in a different direction. Any of these changes is called acceleration. A … force is necessary to cause it.
Newton's Second Law Newton's second law of motion states that a force, acting on an object, will change its velocity by changing either its speed or its direction or both. If your basketball goes rolling into the street and is hit by a bike, either the ball will change direction or its speed or both. 
This means the direction or vector of the acceleration is pointing in the opposite direction of the movement of the object. For example, if the velocity of an object changes from 40 m/s to 10 m/s over a time interval of 2 seconds the average acceleration would be: a = (10 m/s - 40 m/s) ÷ 2s. a = -30 ms ÷ 2s. a = -15 m/s 2. This could also be called a deceleration of 15 m/s 2.
Acceleration is a change in the speed of an object (contrary to popular belief-acceleration ban be an increase or decrease in speed). Velocity of an object only changes whe … n acted on by an external force like a push, friction or other force. Objects in motion stay in motion until acted on by an external force. When velocity changes, that means that the object either moves faster, or moves slower, or moves in a different direction. Any of these changes is called acceleration. A … force is necessary to cause it.
