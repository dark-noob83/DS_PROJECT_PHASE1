The complete blood count (CBC) is often used as a broad screening test to determine an individual's general health status. It can be used to: 1  Screen for a wide range of conditions and diseases. 2  Help diagnose various conditions, such as anemia, infection, inflammation, bleeding disorder or leukemia, to name just a few.
What is considered a normal ESR blood test result depends on a person's age and gender. For men under 50, the normal result is a result of less than 15 mm per hour. For women in the same age group, the normal result is considered to be less than 20 mm per hour. What is considered normal changes as a person ages.
Physicians use a blood test known as a Complete Blood Count, or CBC, to understand a patient's overall health and the health of blood cells. The test results show the counts of all types of blood cells, as well as how those cells are differentiated.
ERC stands for erythrocyte count (red blood cell count). It tells you the the number of RBCs that are present in blood. Low values are indicative of anemia. ERC is also closely related to hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels; if the ERC is low then Hbg and Hct will most likely be low. ERC is usually measured with the complete blood count test (CBC).
Normal range: 11% to 15%. With this test, we get an idea of the shape and size of red blood cells. In this case, “width” refers to a measurement of distribution, not the size of the cells. Liver disease, anemia, nutritional deficiencies, and a number of health conditions could cause high or low RDW results.
1 White blood cell (WBC) count is a count of the total number of white blood cells in a person's sample of blood. 2  White blood cell differential may or may not be included as part of the panel of tests. 3  It identifies and counts the number of the various types of white blood cells present.
