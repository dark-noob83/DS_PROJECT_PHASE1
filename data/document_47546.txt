It is important because HPV has the ability to establish a dormant (latent) infection. Most people who have an HPV infection do not know they are infected because many types of the virus remain latent and cause no symptoms. The FDA says people shouldnâ€™t be worried about a dormant infection. The CBCD says otherwise.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by a germ called Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine.
In a latent infection the viral genome is maintained intact in specific sensory neurons where it is genetically equivalent to that present in a viral particle, but the highly regulated productive cycle cascade of gene expression, so characteristic of herpesvirus infections, does not occur.
A person with a latent infection can still pass the virus on to others. A latent infection is a situation in which a virus is present in the body, but it remains dormant. Some infections are never fully flushed from the body and become latent. Herpes simplex, which often causes cold sores, is a type of latent infection. Fever is a potential warning sign of an
that due to reactivation of organisms present in a dormant focus, as occurs in tuberculosis, etc. exogenous infection. that caused by organisms not normally present in the body but which have gained entrance from the environment.
They are infected with M. tuberculosis, but do not have TB disease. The only sign of TB infection is a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test or TB blood test. Persons with latent TB infection are not infectious and cannot spread TB infection to others.
