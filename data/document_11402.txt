Save. The eating habits of animals fall in to three groups. Herbivores eat only plants. Zebras, buffaloes, gorillas and horses are examples of herbivores. Omnivores such as ravens, squirrels and human beings eat both plants and animals. Carnivores eat meat only. Carnivores sit at the top of the food chain and have adapted digestive tracts that can only process meat.
Bats (Chiroptera) are the only group of mammals that have wings. Although some other groups of mammals, such as flying lemurs, are able to glide using skin membranes, only bats are capable of true flight. There are 997 species of bats alive today. Bats include two basic groups, the megabats and microbats. Elephants (Proboscidea) include two groups, African elephants and Asian elephants. There are two species of African elephants, the forest elephant and the savanna elephant. There is only one species of Asian elephant.
It is not surprising that the most common habitat for these plants is in bogs and fens, where nutrient concentrations are low but water and sunshine seasonally abundant. As many as thirteen species of carnivorous plants have been found in a single bog (Folkerts, 1982). Most plants absorb nitrogen from the soil through their roots. But carnivorous plants absorb nitrogen from their animal prey through their leaves specially modified as traps. Traps work in a variety of ways. Pitfall traps of pitcher plants are leaves folded into deep, slippery pools filled with digestive enzymes.
This article explores mammal classification in order to better understand their diversity and common characteristics. Mammals are one of the six basic animal groups. Other basic animal groups include amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, and reptiles. Elephants (Proboscidea) include two groups, African elephants and Asian elephants. There are two species of African elephants, the forest elephant and the savanna elephant. There is only one species of Asian elephant.
The basic body type is a four-legged land-borne animal, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in the trees, or on two legs. The largest group of mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables feeding the fetus during gestation. The word  mammal  is modern, from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin mamma (teat, pap).
Mammals, taken as a whole, are a class, and this class is divided into, according to the most common current scheme, 29 living orders. One of the larger orders is the Carnivora, the group to which most carnivorous mammals belong. Now, in the ecological sense, a carnivore is really any animal that eats other animals. That includes two huge groups within the mammals, namely the bats and shrews. (Although not all bats eat insects-there are plenty of fruit bats and flower bats).
The marsupials constitute the crown group of the Metatheria, and include all living metatherians as well as many extinct ones; the placentals are the crown group of the Eutheria. Except for the five species of monotremes (egg-laying mammals), all modern mammals give birth to live young. Most mammals, including the six most species-rich orders, belong to the placental group. The word  mammal  is modern, from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, derived from the Latin mamma (teat, pap).
Armadillos, sloths, and anteaters (Xenarthra) are a group of placental mammals that includes anteaters, armadillos and sloths. Anteaters are native to South America and one species, the armadillo, inhabits the southern United States. There are about 29 species of anteaters and their relatives alive today. Elephants (Proboscidea) include two groups, African elephants and Asian elephants. There are two species of African elephants, the forest elephant and the savanna elephant. There is only one species of Asian elephant.
Taxonomy. Marine mammals are mammals that have adapted to life in the ocean. Marine mammals have all the characteristics of mammals, yet they are distinctive in their appearance and survival strategies. Learning to identify marine mammals is made easier by learning their scientific classification or taxonomy.
Birds. Many birds are herbivores or omnivores, but some species of birds, especially raptors like hawks, eagles, falcons and vultures, are carnivores. Raptors will kill prey like small animals and fish but also are scavengers and feed off the carcasses of larger animals too big to be their prey. Herbivores eat only plants. Zebras, buffaloes, gorillas and horses are examples of herbivores. Omnivores such as ravens, squirrels and human beings eat both plants and animals. Carnivores eat meat only. Carnivores sit at the top of the food chain and have adapted digestive tracts that can only process meat.
