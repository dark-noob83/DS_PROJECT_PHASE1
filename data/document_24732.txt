The normalized Nyquist frequency is π radians/sample, and the normalized sample-rate is 2π radians/sample. The following table shows examples of normalized frequencies for a 1 kHz signal, a sample rate = 44.1 kHz, and 3 different choices of normalized units. Sometimes, the unnormalized frequency is represented in units of radians/second (angular frequency), and denoted by When is normalized by the sample-rate (samples/sec), the resulting units are

Hertz to rad/s formula. The angular frequency or angular velocity ω in radian per second (rad/s) is equal to 2π times the frequency f in hertz (Hz): ω (rad/s) = 2π ×f (Hz)
The resultant normalized frequency has units of half-cycles/sample or equivalently cycles per 2 samples. Sometimes, the unnormalized frequency is represented in units of radians/second (angular frequency), and denoted by When is normalized by the sample-rate (samples/sec), the resulting units are radians/sample.
The normalized angular frequency is 2*pi*1/2 rad/sample = pi rad/sample. Thus the signal x[n] = cos[pi*n] = [1,-1,1,-1,...] . The sampled version of a given frequency such as a corner frequency 2*pi*fc rad/s would be 2*pi*fc/fs rad/sample. As a fraction of the Nyquist frequency pi, that's 2*fc/fs = fc/(fs/2) . 
The radian per second (symbol: rad·s−1 or rad/s) is the SI unit of rotational speed (angular velocity), commonly denoted by the Greek letter ω (omega). The radian per second is also the unit of angular frequency. Note that because the radian is a dimensionless unit, the radian per second is dimensionally equivalent to the hertz—both are defined as one s −1. This means that great care must be taken to avoid confusing angular frequency ω and frequency ν.
$$f|_{rad/samp} = f|_{cycles/sec} \frac{2\pi}{f_s}$$. where $f_s$ is the sample rate in Hz.

Rad/s to hertz formula. the frequency f in hertz (Hz) is equal to the angular frequency or angular velocity ω in radians per second (rad/s) divided by 2π: f (Hz) = ω (rad/s) / 2π.
