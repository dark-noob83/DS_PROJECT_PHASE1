Innate immune defenses. In response to viral infection, many organisms mount a remarkable defense known as the immune response. This response to viral infection consists of an innate, or nonspecific component, and an adaptive, or specific defense. The innate response is considered the first line of immune defense because it is active even before infection begins.
Virus infection in vertebrates results in two general types of immune response. The first is a rapid-onset innate response against the virus, which involves the synthesis of proteins called interferons and the stimulation of natural killer lymphocytes.

The Immune Response to Influenza Infection. When the influenza virus infects the cells of the respiratory tract, both innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated. The innate immune response develops very quickly and controls virus replication during the early stages of infection.
Adaptive immune defenses. The immune response to viral infection comprises innate and adaptive defenses. The innate response, which we have discussed previously, functions continuously in a normal host without exposure to any virus. Most viral infections are controlled by the innate immune system.
