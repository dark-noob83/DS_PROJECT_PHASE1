A. The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 17-22 gm/dL. 
1 Hemoglobin. 2  Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 3  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 4  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 5  Ferritin. 1 Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 2  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 3  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 4
Normal hemoglobin levels are different in women and in men. In non-pregnant women, normal hemoglobin ranges from 120 g/L to 160 g/L. In men, normal hemoglobin levels range from 140 g/L to 180 g/L. Canadian Blood Services tests each donor’s hemoglobin at the clinic and requires a minimum of 125 g/L for donatio
The normal level of hemoglobin in blood varies in male and female. In male it ranges from 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dL and in female it ranges from 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dL.Low level of Hemoglobin-There are many reasons for the reduction of hemoglobin blood. Haemoglobin is tested by taking a sample of blood and the normal levels are as follows:Male: 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dlFemale: 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dlChildren: 11 to 16 gm/dlPregnant women:11 to 12 gm/dlwhere gm/dl = grams/decilitre.
For people without diabetes, the normal range for the hemoglobin A1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes, and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes. 
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter. 
Hemoglobin Levels for Children. Children need optimal oxygenation for normal growth and development. According to the World Health Organization, a normal hemoglobin level for children age 6 months to 4 years is at or above 11 g/dL. A normal levels for children ages 5 to 12 years is at or above 11.5 g/dL. A normal level for adolescents ages 12 to 15 is at or above 12.0 g/dL. Any hemoglobin values below these cut-points can indicate anemia, a disorder characterized by a low red blood cell count, as well as low hemoglobin and hemocrit.
The normal range of hemoglobin (also haemoglobin)  varies in men, women, and children.    The normal range of hemoglobin in male is 13.5 to 18gm/dl (gram per  decilit … er).    For female it is 12 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter).    In a children 11 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter).    And for a pregnant woman 11 to 12g/dl (gram per deciliter) is the  normal range of hemoglobin. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. The normal range of hemoglobin in female is 12 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter). And for a pregnant woman 11 to 12g/dl (gram per deciliter) is the normal range of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin levels are often measured in grammes per decilitre (g/dl). 'Normal' levels are considered to be
