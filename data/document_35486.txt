Confidence votes 12.5K. democratic socialism isn't a political science concept-that is, there is not a specific governmental type (or subtype) of that name. Note that socialism (with a small s) refers to an economic model, not a political model, with Socialism referring to a complete political/economic system. Thus, democratic socialism actually describes a form of economic model, not a political/economic model, which is what I assume the question is looking for.

Under democratic socialism, the government usually is envisioned as being controlled by the citizens, with the primary goal of making decisions to benefit society as a whole. This democracy would be characterized by equality among the people as well.
