For example, if the business above produced 500,000 units of its product that year, its unit variable cost is (155,000 / 500,000) or $0.31. 1  The unit variable cost is simply the variable cost per unit produced. 2  It is the extra cost incurred by producing each additional unit. 1 This is because fixed costs are now being spread thinner across a larger production volume. 2  For example, if the business above spends $50,000 per year in rent, rent costs are allocated to each unit at $0.10 per unit.

(Total fixed costs + Total variable costs) / Total units produced. The cost per unit should decline as the number of units produced increases, primarily because the total fixed costs will be spread over a larger number of units (subject to the step costing issue noted above). Thus, the cost per unit is not constant. For example, ABC Company has total variable costs of $50,000 and total fixed costs of $30,000 in May, which it incurred while producing 10,000 widgets. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $50,000 variable costs) / 10,000 units = $8 cost per unit. In the following month, ABC produces 5,000 units at a variable cost of $25,000 and the same fixed cost of $30,000. The cost per unit is: 
Production volume 4,000 units/ 5,000 units Direct materials: $89.70 per unit / $89.70 per unit Direct Labor: $22.60 per unit / $22.60 per unit Manufacturing overhead: $70.50 per unit / $60.30 per unit The best estimate of the total variable manufacturing cost per unit is: Variable cost per unit = $336,050 ÷ 4,700 units = $71.50 unit Total cost = Total fixed cost + Total variable cost = $100,110 + $71.50 per unit × 4,900 units = $100,110 + $350,350 = $450,460.
