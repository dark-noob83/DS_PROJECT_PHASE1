Volcanoes only occur on the boundaries between tectonic plates, and this is the same for earthquakes. this is why there are many volcanoes and earthquakes in Indonesia and the … south east Asia region, but very few any where in Europe or Antarctica. So volcanoes don't occur within a tectonic plate.
Rift volcanoes occur where tectonic plates diverge, often on the ocean floor. These are generally less explosive. Hot spot volcanoes occur in the middle of plate boundaries where magma exits from weaknesses in the earth's surface. The Hawaiian Islands are an example of hot spot volcanoes. The most active area of volcanic activity occurs along the pacific plate boundary which is often referred to as the 'Pacific ring of fire'.
Volcanoes usually occur where there are collision of the tectonic plates. There are 52 tectonic plates which either pull (gap and crack) or push (volcano). Volcanoes are actually tectonic plates which have magmas beneath their outer surface.
Volcanoes normally form at or near divergent tectonic plate boundaries or convergent boundaries where subduction is occurring. An example of a divergent plate boundary with significant volcanism is the Mid-Atlantic-Ridge.
Volcanoes occur where they do because of the position of the crust over a plate boundary or a 'hot spot' in the Earth's mantle. Continental volcanoes form when subducted cru … st melts to magma against the mantle, then is forced upward under pressure through cracks in the rocks above.
Map showing Earth's plate boundaries. Active volcanoes generally occur close to the major tectonic plate boundaries. Many are located along the Earth's plate boundaries. Active volcanoes are rare in Australia because there are no plate boundaries on this continent. However, there are two active volcanoes located 4000 kilometres south west of Perth on the Australian territories, Heard Island and the nearby McDonald Islands.
