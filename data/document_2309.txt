You can figure price ranges in the $4.99 to $14.00 per GB of managed storage in the mid-tier to near high-end solutions. Complete solutions that handle disaster recovery and governmental regulation compliance can cost more. 
Ok, so here is plot of the price per month versus the data plan. From this plot we can see that the y-intercept is $65.33 and the slope is $5.42 per GB. You can also see that the jump in price from no data to 200 MB is crazy out of proportion. So, the $65.33 must be how much you pay for unlimited voice and text. Let me just look at two – AT&T U-Verse (since that is what I have) and Comcast cable modem. 1  AT&T U-Verse lists internet only plans from $20 to $50 per month. 2  Let me go with the $30 a month plan. 3  This means you would be paying $3 per GB for your data.
- AT&T sells 300 MB, 3 GB and 5 GB packages for individual and family plans. But it also offers “mobile share” plans with up to 50 GB of data spread across up to 10 devices. There is no unlimited option. - Sprint offers unlimited data for $30 a month or 1 GB for $20 a month per line. The cost of a line is $50 for one and less for more. - T-Mobile offers 500MB of data free and either 2 GB for $10/month or unlimited for $20/month for each line. Like Sprint, the cost of a line starts at $50 and is cheaper for more. 
A consumer can get a 4TB capacity drive for less than £100. That’s an incredible £0.025 per GB. But while raw drive prices are measured in pennies per gigabyte, the actual cost of storage for the enterprise is much higher, and more difficult to calculate. There is a saying in the storage industry that capacity is free and performance costs. This is true to an extent because, for example, in raw capacity terms, the price (per TB) of a 15,000rpm high-performance drive can be 20x to 30x more than a SATA 7,200rpm device.
Because Google Cloud Storage Nearline is intended for infrequently accessed data, you will incur the following costs for data access and early deletion: 1  Data retrieval incurs a cost of $0.01 per GB. 2  Data deleted in less than 30 days incurs a minimum 30 day charge. 1 Data deleted in less than 30 days incurs a minimum 30 day charge. 2  For example, if you store 1,000 GB of Nearline data on day 1 and then remove it on day 15, you are charged $5 ($0.01 * 1,000 GB * 15/30) for storage from day 1 to 15, and then $5 ($0.01 * 1,000 GB * 15/30) for 15 days of early deletion from day 16 to 30.
Zelda is going to get the biggest plan. Zelda uses a total of 10.309 GB for a cost of $119.99. This is $11.54 per GB. Since Zelda pays the same $10 for texting, but uses much more, she pays $27,000 per GB. Let me just look at two – AT&T U-Verse (since that is what I have) and Comcast cable modem. 1  AT&T U-Verse lists internet only plans from $20 to $50 per month. 2  Let me go with the $30 a month plan. 3  This means you would be paying $3 per GB for your data.
If you need more storage, you can upgrade to a larger storage plan. You can upgrade your iCloud storage from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or PC, and you can choose a total of 50 GB, 200 GB, or 1 TB. After you upgrade, we'll bill you monthly. 1 See the monthly pricing per country below.
However, if you transfer a 1GB backup on an hourly basis you will transfer up to 744 backups in a month, in this case your cost per GB of data transfer would be reduced to $0.12 USD, resulting in a total data transfer of 744 GB and a total cost of $89.28 USD. So for example, if your backup is 1GB and you choose to store 3 backups you will be storing 3GB per day, the resulting daily cost would be $0.06 USD, the maximum monthly cost (for a 31 day month) would therefore be $1.86 USD.
The 5 GB/month plan costs $59.99 per month. The 10 GB/month plan should not cost $199.99 per month. The 10 GB/month plan should cost no more than twice the cost of the 5 GB/month plan. The 10 GB/month plan, therefore, should cost no more than $119.98 per month. In addition, an 8.5 GB/month plan should be available. The 8.5 GB/month plan should cost $99.99 per month, in between the price of the 5 GB/month plan and the price that the 10 GB/month plan should cost.
