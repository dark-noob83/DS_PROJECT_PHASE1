1. Know the money limits on what you can deduct on your business's taxes. The IRS allows you to deduct up to $5,000 or your actual startup costs (whichever is less), and $5,000 in organizational costs in the first year, whichever amount is less.
You can see from these examples that if your startup costs are going to exceed $50,000, then your deductible is reduced, and completely wiped out if you exceed $55,000 in expenses. So it may not make sense to take the business startup deduction in the year you start your business.
If you are a sole proprietor, you can deduct accounting and tax preparation fees on Schedule C, to the extent that they are related to your business. Tax preparation costs for the personal portion of your return may be deductible on Schedule A if you itemize deductions.
How to Take the Deductions. The IRS allows you to deduct $5,000 in business startup costs and $5,000 in organizational costs, but only if your total startup costs are $50,000 or less. If your startup costs for either area exceed $50,000, the amount of your allowable deduction will be reduced by that dollar amount.
All of the basic expenses necessary to run a business are generally tax-deductible, including office rent, salaries, equipment and supplies, telephone and utility costs, legal and accounting services, professional dues, and subscriptions to business publications.
You pay $2,500 in professional fees. For tax purposes, your cost basis in the pool route is $25,000 ($22,500 + $2,500). If you began the business this year, legal fees to incorporate or to organize your business as a partnership may also be deductible.
If you started your business in 2011, had startup costs of $50,000 or less, and incurred startup and/or organizational expenses after October 22, 2004, you can deduct up to $5,000 in business startup costs on your 2011 tax return.
