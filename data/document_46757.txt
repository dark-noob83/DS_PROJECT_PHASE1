Another state high point is in the bag! Bernie and I drove across Pennsylvania (from New Jersey) to stand on the Pennsylvania High Point. Mount Davis is located in Somerset County in southwest Pennsylvania. I can give solid directions from the north: From Somerset, PA, travel south on State Road 219 to Meyersdale. In Meyersdale, turn right on SR 2004 (Broadway-there is a large sign for Mt. Davis at this spot). This is Mt. Davis Road. We stood on four state high points-a grand slam-in 25 hours! Along with Pennsylvania, we made it to the high points of Maryland, West Virginia and Delaware. The adjacent photo of Bernie taking in the scenery in at the observation tower on Mt. Davis.
