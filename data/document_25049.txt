The total cost of all medical procedures (excluding IVF meds) and the storage for the first year will be $5,500. This price includes egg retrieval, preparation of your eggs for cryopreservation, egg freezing and the storage of your eggs for the first year. There will be an additional $500 per year fee for storing eggs/sperm/embryos after the first year. There are two parts to freezing your eggs: preparing your eggs for freezing and storing them. The first charge is for preparing eggs for initial freezing and it is a one time fee of $500.
Let us briefly examine the fees related to freezing and storing your eggs/sperm/embryos. There are two parts to freezing your eggs: preparing your eggs for freezing and storing them. The first charge is for preparing eggs for initial freezing and it is a one time fee of $500. The second charge is for storing eggs/sperm/embryos and it is the recurring fee of $500 per year
The procedure to retrieve the eggs costs between $10,000 and $17,000 per cycle (and some women may undergo more than one cycle to get enough eggs). Other fees may include those for storage (up to $3,000 for five years) and thawing ($3,400 to $6,800), according to the study. In comparison, IVF with fresh eggs costs about $13,000 to $17,000 per cycle, according to the study. They found that 62 percent of women who freeze their eggs at age 35 and try to get pregnant at age 40 would successfully have a baby, with the average total cost of the procedures leading to the birth coming to $39,946.
Because the quality and number of eggs declines with age, egg freezing has been offered as a way for a woman to harvest eggs while still relatively young in order to preserve future fertility; or, as a possible solution for cancer patients who expect to become infertile as a result of treatment. 1 When the woman is ready to use the eggs in the future, the cost of thawing, fertilizing and transferring the resulting embryo to the uterus will run an additional $4,000 to $5,000 -- bringing the total cost possibly as high as $17,000. 2  However, as this experimental technology is refined, costs could change.
Despite the buzz about egg freezing, cost has always been a barrier for most women. Since the procedure allowing women to store their eggs until theyâ€™re ready to reproduce became available in the U.S. a decade ago, the price has hovered between $9,000 and $13,000. 
1 Medications used to stimulate the ovaries to produce excess eggs for harvesting usually cost, on average, $2,700. 2  Most clinics charge an egg storage fee of about $300 to $600 per year. 1 When the woman is ready to use the eggs in the future, the cost of thawing, fertilizing and transferring the resulting embryo to the uterus will run an additional $4,000 to $5,000 -- bringing the total cost possibly as high as $17,000. 2  However, as this experimental technology is refined, costs could change.
In general, it costs $10,000 to undergo an egg freezing cycle. This estimate includes all testing, monitoring, medications and egg freezing. Your eggs will be stored for the first year at no charge. Thereafter, storage will be $500 per year. The egg thaw, fertilization and embryo transfer procedure costs approximately $5,000 and is payable at the time of egg thaw. 
6. It's not cheap. The cost of medication and treatment for one cycle is roughly $10,000-12,000 and storing eggs will cost $800 per year. But freezing your eggs may save thousands of dollars in fertility treatment down the road, and it offers immediate peace of mind. 7.
1 The cost of harvesting and freezing eggs is about $7,000 to $12,000. 2  When the woman is ready to use the eggs in the future, the cost of thawing, fertilizing and transferring the resulting embryo to the uterus will run an additional $4,000 to $5,000 -- bringing the total cost possibly as high as $17,000. 1 When the woman is ready to use the eggs in the future, the cost of thawing, fertilizing and transferring the resulting embryo to the uterus will run an additional $4,000 to $5,000 -- bringing the total cost possibly as high as $17,000. 2  However, as this experimental technology is refined, costs could change.
