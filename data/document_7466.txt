Alcoholic Fermentation. Alcoholic Fermentation is a type of cellular Respiration which does not require oxygen (anaerobic respiration), and involves the breaking down of glucose to pyruvic acid and then finally ethanol. 
Anaerobic Respiration. Paul Andersen explains the process of anaerobic respiration. This process involves glycolysis and fermentation and allows organisms to survive without oxygen. Lactic acid fermentation is used in animals and bacteria and uses lactate as an electron acceptor. Alcoholic fermentation used ethyl alcohol
This part is known as glycolysis. In the second part, the 2 pyruvate molecules are converted into 2 carbon dioxide molecules and 2 molecules of ethanol, otherwise known as alcohol. This second part is called fermentation. The main purpose of alcohol fermentation is to produce ATP, the energy currency for cells, under anaerobic conditions. So from the yeast's perspective, the carbon dioxide and ethanol are waste products. That's the basic overview of alcohol fermentation. Now, let's examine each part of this process in greater detail. 
Alcohol fermentation is the formation of alcohol from sugar. Yeast, when under anaerobic conditions, convert glucose to pyruvic acid via the glycolysis pathways, then go one step farther, converting pyruvic acid into ethanol, a C-2 compound.ermentation is the process of deriving energy from the oxidation of organ ic compound s, such as carbohydrates, using an endogenous electron acceptor, which is usually an organ ic compound [1].
In the first part of this process, each glucose molecule is broken down into 2 pyruvate molecules. Pyruvate, or pyruvic acid, is an amino acid and will help form ethanol. In the process of breaking glucose down to form pyruvate, several molecules known as electron acceptors are involved.his part is known as glycolysis. In the second part, the 2 pyruvate molecules are converted into 2 carbon dioxide molecules and 2 molecules of ethanol, otherwise known as alcohol. This second part is called fermentation.
Concept 5 Review. In alcoholic fermentation, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis loses one carbon in the form of carbon dioxide to form acetaldehyde, which is reduced to ethyl alcohol by NADH. When acetaldehyde is reduced to ethyl alcohol, NADH becomes NAD + (is oxidized). This is the fermentation that commonly occurs in yeast.
Alcohol fermentation, also known as ethanol fermentation, is the anaerobic pathway carried out by yeasts in which simple sugars are converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The process of alcohol fermentation allows yeasts to break down sugar in the absence of oxygen and results in byproducts that humans benefit from.his part is known as glycolysis. In the second part, the 2 pyruvate molecules are converted into 2 carbon dioxide molecules and 2 molecules of ethanol, otherwise known as alcohol. This second part is called fermentation.

Fermentation. Definition. noun. An anaerobic (without oxygen) cellular process in which organic foods are converted into simpler compounds, and chemical energy (ATP) is produced. Supplement. Fermentation differs from cellular respiration in a way that it uses organic compounds such as carbohydrates as (endogenous) electron acceptors instead of molecular oxygen (which is an exogenous electron acceptor in cellular respiration).upplement.
