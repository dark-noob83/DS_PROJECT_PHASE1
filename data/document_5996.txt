The length of time it takes to recover from a hamstring strain or tear will depend on how severe the injury is. A minor muscle pull or strain (grade 1) may take a few days to heal, whereas it could take weeks or months to recover from a muscle tear (grade 2 or 3).
Hamstring Injury Grade 1. A grade 1 strain will take about a week of recovery time. A grade 1 strain hurts minimally, there is no pain walking, and motion isn't hindered. But it is imperative that you not play golf or exercise your leg.
How long does a hamstring injury take to heal? The average healing times are: (1) mild strain – 2 to 10 days, (2) moderate strain – 10 days to 6 weeks, (3) severe strain – 6 to 10 weeks. The complications listed above are more likely to occur in the case of repeated injuries.
A grade 2 hamstring strain will take two to three weeks of recovery for proper healing to occur. Do not allow yourself to put too much stress on the leg during this time because it will just increase the length of recovery time.
Definition. A hamstring injury occurs when you strain or pull one of your hamstring muscles — the group of three muscles that run along the back of your thigh. You may be more likely to get a hamstring injury if you play soccer, basketball, football, tennis or a similar sport that involves sprinting with sudden stops and starts.
However, how long it takes for a hamstring to heal will depend on the type of injury, overall health of the individual, and the type of treatment received.
Overall, it can take from a few to several weeks for a hamstring injury to heal but the patient can generally return to his training and activities afterwards.
Hamstring Injury Grade 3. A grade 3 hamstring strain will take three to five weeks for proper recovery. A person with a grade 3 strain may have trouble walking without assistance, i.e., crutches. Also there will heavy swelling in the area of the strain. Do not play golf or perform any activity during this recovery time.
