Crystals are subjectively quantified in urine as few, moderate and many. For crystals that are large, e.g. calcium carbonate and struvite, this assessment is made from low power (10x objective). For smaller crystals (e.g. amorphous, calcium oxalate dihydrate), the high power (40x objective) is used. Additional information on some specific crystals seen in urine are given below.
Crystals in urine are detected when bladder stones are formed in your body. Urolithiasis (bladder stones) is one of the causes for the presence of crystals in urine. Taking high protein diet can also cause crystals.
When crystals are found in the urine it is an indication or a symptom that something is wrong in the urinary system. The urinary system is made up of the kidney, bladder, ureters and urethra. Modification in the diet as well as urine concentration can be a cause of the crystals but there are other causes also.

Kidney stones are small, hard, sharp crystals that can lodge in the kidneys or the ureter, which is the tube that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder, and are potentially very painful. The most commonly occurring stones are made of calcium combined with either phosphate or oxalate.
1 Calcium stones. 2  Most kidney stones are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate. 3  Oxalate is a naturally occurring substance found in food. 4  Some fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and chocolate, have high oxalate levels.
If your daughter was dehydrated at the time of the test, this could have caused the calcium oxalate crystals – but if they are found again it’s worth paying a bit of attention,, because kids who have ongoing high levels of oxalate in the urine are more likely to develop kidney stones later on in life.
