How to Measure and Record Respiratory Rate. Respiration is the process that occurs when oxygen is inhaled into the lungs, converted into energy via a chemical reaction and expelled as carbon dioxide. Normal respiration is an automatic process and does not require conscious effort.
Begin the respiratory assessment by counting your patient s respiratory rate and simply observing his breathing pattern. Don t tell the patient you are counting his respirations, as that may alter
The respiratory rate is the number of breaths that a patient takes each minute. The rate should be taken when the patient is at rest, and it is assessed by counting the number of times the chest rises in one minute.
Observe the rise and fall of the victim's chest and count the number of respirations out loud for one full minute. One respiration consists of one complete rise and fall of the chest, or the inhalation and exhalation of air. The normal respiratory rate for a healthy adult at rest is 12-to-20 breaths per minute.
When someone breathes, they breathe in oxygen and then breathe out carbon dioxide. The breathing rate, or the number of times that a person breathes in and out in 1 minute, is often checked by health care professionals to determine the health of a person. The normal breathing rate is between 12 and 18 breaths per minute. Many factors affect a person's breathing.
Measuring respirations. The respiratory rate is the number of breaths that a patient takes each minute. The rate should be taken when the patient is at rest, and it is assessed by counting the number of times the chest rises in one minute. Common factors that influence respiration rate are as follows:
Step 1. Stand or sit facing the person whose pulse rate and respiration rate you are to measure. Step 2. Select a site to measure the pulse. The two chief options are on the person’s wrist, just below the thumb, or on the neck, on either side of the person’s windpipe.
