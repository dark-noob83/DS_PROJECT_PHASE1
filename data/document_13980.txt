Aldosterone is stimulated by an increase or decrease in what ions? 1. _________ 2. __________ b. What does aldosterone increase in the basolateral membrane? 3. ______ dehydration ______ overhydration (↑ or ↓) 5. Describe what moves out of the tubule and what the osmolartity would be in the following nephron segments: a. Proximal tubule ______ moves out ______ mOsm b. Descending limb ______ moves out ______ mOsm c. Ascending limb ______ moves out ______ mOsm d. Late distal tubule ______ moves out ______ mOsm. 6. a. By the medullary collecting duct, only _____% of the filtrate remains
There are several components of the collecting duct system, including the connecting tubules, cortical collecting ducts, and medullary collecting ducts. 1 For the tubules, this specific cell type is the connecting tubule cell. 2  For the collecting ducts, it is the principal cell. 3  The inner medullary collecting ducts contain an additional cell type, called the inner medullary collecting duct cell.
Functional differentiation of cell types of cortical collecting duct. O'Neil RG, Hayhurst RA. Interference-contrast and fluorescent microscopy were used to differentiate between the two cell types--principal cells (PC) and intercalated cells (IC)--of the isolated perfused cortical collecting duct of the rabbit. 
Notes. Read More. The collecting duct cells (CDCs) are highly water permeable and are a key component of the collecting duct, the last site where NaCl and water are reabsorbed in the kidney. In humans, the cortical collecting duct contains a high-resistance epithelium comprised of two cell types
Principal cells are the main Na+ reabsorbing cells and the site of action of aldosterone, K+-sparing diuretics, and spironolactone. Type A and B intercalated cells make up the second cell type in the collecting duct epithelium. Type A intercalated cells mediate acid secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption. The collecting duct cells (CDCs) are highly water permeable and are a key component of the collecting duct, the last site where NaCl and water are reabsorbed in the kidney. In humans, the cortical collecting duct contains a high-resistance epithelium comprised of two cell types
After the juxtaglomerular apparatus, the tubule becomes the distal tubule, which merges with the cortical collecting duct. The cortical collecting duct contains two functional types of cells: ___________________ cells—hormones regulate their permeability to water and solutes. ___________________ cells—secrete hydrogen ions for acid-base regulation. 13. The medullary collecting duct is composed of ___________________ cells. Their permeability to _________ and ____________ is hormonally regulated. Urinary System: Glomerular Filtration. 1.
The collecting duct system of the kidney consists of a series of tubules and ducts that connect the nephrons to the ureter. It participates in electrolyte and fluid balance through reabsorption and excretion, processes regulated by the hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone. 1 For the tubules, this specific cell type is the connecting tubule cell. 2  For the collecting ducts, it is the principal cell. 3  The inner medullary collecting ducts contain an additional cell type, called the inner medullary collecting duct cell.
