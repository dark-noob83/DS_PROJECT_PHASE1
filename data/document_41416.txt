During may you will find snow at the North and South pole. It will also snow in high lying areas such as some mountains. Many people forget that while in May that while the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing spring (which in some places means there is still snow), the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing winter. As a result it can still snow in Northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. And it will also snow in the Andes, other parts of South America, the Himalayas and other parts of Asia including China.
In December, for instance, one in four years totals 11 inches or more of snow. Another 25 percent of years receive less than 3.9 inches for the month. Similarly in January, fresh snowfall in the heaviest years amounts to over 8.6 inches, while the lightest years get less than 3.2 inches.
Report Abuse. There is PLENTY of snow in May and I've seen it snow 7 in June (tho' it was a slushy mess). You'll have to hike to the top of the slopes 'cause the chairs will be closed. Also, the old snow's texture will be either grapple or wet and heavy. Some slopes stay open until the first week of June but it's rare.
