Diagnostic imaging is a form of medical imaging that is performed with the intention of diagnosing disease, in contrast with medical imaging conducted to monitor the progress of a disease, or to guide a medical procedure.
As a medical specialty, radiology can refer to two sub-fields, diagnostic radiology and therapeutic radiology. Diagnostic radiology is concerned with the use of various imaging modalities to aid in the diagnosis of disease. Diagnostic radiology can be further divided into multiple sub-specialty areas.
In any form of medical care, diagnostic radiology plays an integral part in the diagnosis of disease or injury. The exams often use radiation, at levels that have been determined to be safe, to create detailed anatomical images.
Diagnostic imaging refers to a variety of non-invasive methods for identifying and monitoring diseases or injuries via the generation of images representing internal anatomic structures and organs of the patient's body.
Diagnostic radiology is the foundation for all other imaging tests. New digital imaging equipment is much faster and combined with our Emagion technology, allows physicians secure, direct online access to patient images and radiology reports.
Radiology is a branch of medicine that uses imaging technology to diagnose and treat disease. Radiology may be divided into two different areas, diagnostic radiology and interventional radiology. The field of therapeutic radiation, which uses more powerful x-rays to treat cancer, is now called radiation oncology. Doctors who specialize in radiology are called radiologists.
