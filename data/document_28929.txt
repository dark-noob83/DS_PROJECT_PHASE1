Walking shoes. There is no practical way to stay at Turtle Bay and do any kind of off resort activity without your own vehicle. And, it's a very looooooong walk from the hotel to the highway, and even then, the resort is situatated near almost nothing but produce stands. Back on topic, another poster mentioned using a shuttle service to Turtle Bay. I'm only aware of the shuttles that service HNL-Waikiki. If anyone has a recomendation for a HNL-Turtle Bay shuttle, I'd be very appreciative too. Thanks in advance for any info.
