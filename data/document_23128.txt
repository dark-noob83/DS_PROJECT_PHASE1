For example, doctors in Massachusetts must keep medical records for at least 7 years from the date of the last patient encounter. If the patient is a minor, the doctor must keep the medical record for 7 years or until the patient reaches the age of 9, whichever is longer. Massachusetts hospitals must keep medical records at least 30 years after the discharge or final treatment of the patient. Can it ever take longer? Generally, yes. If your medical records are kept off site, your hospital can take up to 60 days to respond to your request. If your hospital cannot respond in 30 days (or 60 days if your records are kept off site), they can get one 30-day extension.
