This measurement is called an arterial blood oxygen. A normal arterial blood oxygen level typically falls between 75 and 100 mmHg. Your blood carbon dioxide level and pH -- a measure of acidity or alkalinity -- are usually measured along with the arterial blood oxygen level.
Normal Oxygen Saturation Levels. The percentage of oxygen saturation in the blood is referred to as 'sats'. For example, if the test results say that the value of your sats are 95%, this means that 95% of the hemoglobin present in your blood is oxygenated.
Newly oxygenated red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. A pulse oximeter uses light to measure the oxygen saturation level, the percentage of hemoglobin in your red blood cells carrying oxygen. Normal oxygen saturation levels fall between 95 and 99 percent.
Though the pulse oximeter actually measures the saturation of oxygen in your blood, the results are often used as an estimate of blood oxygen levels. Normal pulse oximeter readings range from 95 to 100 percent, under most circumstances. Values under 90 percent are considered low. 1  Causes.
A range of 94-99% is normal for healthy adults breathing room air which contains 21% oxygen. Anyone who is not achieving the critical blood oxygen saturation level of 90% (SpO 2) or of 55-60mmHg (SaO 2), may require additional oxygen.
Healthy people have a normal range of oxygen saturation from 95% â€“ 100%, although levels down to 90% are common and not usually cause for alarm. During exercise, the increased oxygen consumption may reduce blood saturation, but the increased breathing rate and blood flow compensate for this.
Normal Ranges. Oxygen saturation level in healthy patients is considered normal between 97 percent and 99 percent. Patients who have normal hemoglobin levels can have a saturation level of 95. When the amount of oxygen in the blood is reduced, a condition known as hypoxemia results, and treatment is then required.
