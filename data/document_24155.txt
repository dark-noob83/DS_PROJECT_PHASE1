The teres minor is a slim, narrow muscle within the rotator cuff, located in the shoulder. It is involved in the external rotation of the shoulder joint. The other muscles composing the rotator cuff are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis. It connects the scapula to the humerus, along with the teres major and infraspinatus muscles, which lie on either side and overlap the teres minor. Along with the infraspinatus, the muscle keeps the head of the humerus in place where it joins with the scapula.
There are two teres muscles. The other one is the teres major muscle, a thick, flattened muscle that brings the arm toward the body and assists in extending it when the arm is in a flexed position. The teres major muscle also aids in rotating the arm but its function is just the opposite of the teres minor and other ... Click to read more below. The teres minor muscle rotates the arm laterally and assists in bringing it toward the body. As it draws the upper arm bone (humerus) up, it strengthens the shoulder joint
