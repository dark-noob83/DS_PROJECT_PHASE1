Figuring Out How Much You'll Pay. The cost of a rehab program depends on a number of factors, such as what kind of treatment you choose, where it's located and how long you stay. Inpatient can range from $2,000 - $25,000 for a 30-day program. Outpatient can range from free to $10,000. Detox can range from $300-$800 a day. Keep in mind that the cost of treatment will likely outweigh the cost of an addiction in the long run.
