Bond energy is a term used in chemistry to describe the amount of energy required to separate the chemical bonds between atoms.
Bond Energy. For any particular chemical bond, say the covalent bond between hydrogen and oxygen, the amount of energy it takes to break that bond is exactly the same as the amount of energy released when the bond is formed. This value is called the bond energy.
1 The bond energy of H-H bonds is 103 kcal. 2  The bond energy of the O=O bonds is 116 kcal. 3  The decomposition of 2 molecules of water requires breaking 4 H-O bonds and thus the input of 440 kcal. 4  The formation of 2 moles of hydrogen yields 206 kcal (2 x 103). 5  The formation of 1 mole of oxygen yield
BOND ENTHALPY (BOND ENERGY) This page introduces bond enthalpies (bond energies) and looks at some simple calculations involving them. One of the most confusing things about this is the way the words are used.
Bond Enthalpy (Bond Energy). The Bond Enthalpy is the energy required to break a chemical bond. It is usually expressed in units of kJ mol-1, measured at 298 K. The exact bond enthalpy of a particular chemical bond depends upon the molecular environment in which the bond exists.

Bond EnergiesThe bond energy is the amount of energy (enthalpy) required to break or form a bond in 1mole of gaseous molecules, which is expressed as kJ/mol.Enthalpy (enthalpien, Greek word, to warm) also known as “heat content” is athermodynamic quantity that is nothing but the heat at constant pressure.
When chemical reactions take place, chemical bonds are broken in the reactants and new chemical bonds are formed in the products. It is as a result of these processes that a reaction is overall exothermic (energy is given out to the surroundigs) or overall endothermic (energy is absorbed from the surroundings).
