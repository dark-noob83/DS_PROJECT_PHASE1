Calculate the standard deviation of the stock's price. First, divide the number of days until the stock price forecast by 365, and then find the square root of that number. Then, multiply the square root with the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price. The result is the change in price. Using this graph, the implied volatility shows how far the stock price could change over one standard deviation, which usually equals 68 percent. For example, a $10 stock with a 20 percent implied volatility has a 68 percent chance to be priced between $8 and $12 one year from now. Step 2.
