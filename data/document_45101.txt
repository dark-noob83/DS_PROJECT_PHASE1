Comes in different colors, a cotton/modal blend, minimal support. In my previous post I talked about bralettes, and what they were. Today, I’ll provide a little bit more information. A bralette is a bra without wires or molded cups, think on par to a sports bra, but without the intensity to hold you in. They have thin or lacy straps like a regular bra, and provide a reasonable amount of support for small to average busted women.
Bralette bra provides little to no support because of the lack of underwire and cups. Although some styles may feature some very light cup support. Unfortunately, for those of us with a bit more cleavage, this style isn’t going to offer you much in terms of comfort, support or overall look.
A bralette is a flirty layer slip made of very thin fabric that ultimately serves the purpose of a bra. Bralettes are a bit longer than actual bras and cover a bit of the ribcage to give your torso a more narrow appeal. Majority I’ve seen are made of all lace and extremely girly.
What I don't appreciate with this bra is the fact that you can see it through T-shirts, even darker ones! The lace texture is defying the purpose of the skin (nude) color of the bralette: it wasn't supposed to be noticeable through summer clothes.
