The Challenger Deep, in the southern end of the Mariana Trench (sometimes called the Marianas Trench), is the deepest spot in the ocean. Its depth is difficult to measure from the surface, but modern estimates vary by less than 1,000 feet (305 meters).
The Mariana Trench is located in the western Pacific Ocean. It was discovered to be 10,924 meters deep in 1951 by researchers aboard the British survey ship Challenger. Trieste was the first vehicle to explore the trench with a crew of two people. Map by Geology.com and MapResources.

Answer: The ocean's deepest area is the Mariana Trench (also called the Marianas Trench), which is about 11 km (almost 7 miles, or almost 36,000 feet) deep. The trench is 1,554 miles long and 44 miles wide, and is like the Grand Canyon of the ocean, although it is 120 times larger.
