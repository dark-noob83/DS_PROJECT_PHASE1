A child may receive Social Security benefits based on a parent’s retirement or disability. Most states allow a credit to the parent’s child support obligation for the amount of the benefits. The Social Security benefits to the child act as a substitute for part or the entire child support award.
Whether or not your disability payments can be garnished depends on which type of disability benefits you receive and whether or not your child support payments are current. SSI (Supplemental Security Income) disability payments are made to people who have a very low income.
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program serves as an income source of last resort for elderly or disabled individuals, including blind or disabled children. In determining the benefit amount for a child, the program excludes one-third of child support payments from countable income.
If you are the parent getting SSI, you should tell the court that your only income is SSI and you are unable to pay child support. You should get a statement from the Social Security Administration that you receive SSI, and give this statement to the court. If you have already been ordered to pay child support and then you began receiving SSI, you can ask the court to change your child support order. SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY (SSD).
SSI is a program administered by the Social Security Administration that provides monthly cash payments to low-income elderly or disabled individuals, including blind or disabled children. In addition, to be eligible for SSI the individual must have very few assets. For children on SSI, the Social Security Administration reduces the child’s SSI benefit by two-thirds of the amount that is paid in child support.
While you will still have to pay child support, you can request that your child support payments be modified. You will have to petition the court to lower the amount of the child support you are responsible for based on your new monthly income.
