The average for top quality land increased $4 per acre. For average and poor quality land, the average increased by $3 per acre (Table 2, click here to view). The average estimated cash rent was $202 per acre on top quality land, $161 per acre on average quality land, and $124 per acre on poor quality land. This was an increase in rental rates of 2.0% for top quality land, 1.9% for average quality land, and 2.5% for poor quality land
A cropland cash rental rate can be computed by multiplying the average CSR2 by a rental rate per CSR2 point. For example, assume a typical rental rate per CSR2 index point of $3 for your county. A tract of land with a CSR2 of 80 would have a rental rate of $240 ($3 × 80 CSR2 = $240) per acre. A cash rental rate can be based on a farm’s average yields (e.g., 5-year or 10-year average). For example, assume the average rental rates in your county are $1.25 per bushel for corn and $4.40 per bushel for soybeans, based on the latest survey information. If your farm has an average corn yield of 160 bu.
The Illinois Society reported a 2013 midpoint cash rent of $285 per acre for farmland with expected yield between 150 and 170 bushel per acre. In the calculations above, lower productivity farmland with a 160 bushel per acre corn yield has $211 per acre of operator and land return (see Table 1). Soybeans are expected to yield 56 bushels per acre, resulting in $602 of gross revenue at a $10.75 soybean price. Subtracting $350 of non-land costs from $602 gross revenue gives $252 of operator and land return for soybeans.
For example, average cash rent is $324 per acre in Sangamon County, $326 in Macon County, $313 in Logan County. These averages are only slightly below the $333 per acre operator and land return for high productivity farmland. Soybeans are expected to yield 56 bushels per acre, resulting in $602 of gross revenue at a $10.75 soybean price. Subtracting $350 of non-land costs from $602 gross revenue gives $252 of operator and land return for soybeans.
The highest average per acre cash rent is $225 per acre for top quality land in the West Central region. With a range in per acre rents of $147 to $225, this region has the highest cash rents across all land qualities. Cash rents are the lowest in the Southeast, $86 to $151 per acre. For average and poor quality land, the average increased by $3 per acre (Table 2, click here to view). The average estimated cash rent was $202 per acre on top quality land, $161 per acre on average quality land, and $124 per acre on poor quality land.
A survey of 2006 cash rent and land values in Iowa indicates variability exists in the expected-yield formula, as cash rental rates in Iowa ranged from 93 cents to $1.10 per bushel for corn and between $3.20 and $3.60 per bushel for soybeans. But, $200- to $300-per-acre cash rent price levels are likely justified when taking corn and soybean per-acre income into account, economists say. Farmers struck up a conversation about cash rental rates in a recent Agriculture Online Farm Business discussion group
160 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $205 per acre, 180 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $259 per acre, and. 200 bu expected corn yield has an average cash rent of $313 per acre. The second factor is how fast cash rents on a farm have gone up in recent years. Between 2006 through 2013, average cash rents increased in Illinois by an average of 7.7% per year. The cash rent then increased to $300 per acre in 2013. Keeping the $300 cash rent in 2015 could be justified because the landowner did not get as much return in 2006 through 2012, even though the farmer likely will face a loss.
If the cash rent is $290 per acre, the cash rent would have to decrease by $64 per acre to the projected $225 per acre operator and land return for the farmer to have $0 return. Cash rents would have to decrease more than $64 for the farmer to have a positive projected return. The cash rent then increased to $300 per acre in 2013. Keeping the $300 cash rent in 2015 could be justified because the landowner did not get as much return in 2006 through 2012, even though the farmer likely will face a loss.
Take an operator and land return of $350 per acre and a cash rent of $300 per acre. In this case, the farmer receives $50 per acre ($350 operator and land return - $300 cash rent). When cash rents exceed operator and land returns, the farmer faces losses. Soybeans are expected to yield 56 bushels per acre, resulting in $602 of gross revenue at a $10.75 soybean price. Subtracting $350 of non-land costs from $602 gross revenue gives $252 of operator and land return for soybeans.
