As temperature increases, a greater fraction of the molecules have enough energy to escape the molecular attractions of the liquid. For liquids the vapor pressure as a function of temperature has an exponential behavior as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Plot of vapor pressure vs. temperature of a sample. This week in lab you will fit a set of vapor pressure vs. temperature data to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to determine the heat of vaporization of an unknown liquid, shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. The linear relationship between ln(P) vs 1/T comes from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
The exponential behavior of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, P(T), is given by the exponential function: (1). A in the expression is an experimental constant that can be related to the normal boiling point, (HVap is the heat of vaporization of the liquid and R is the gas constant, R = 8.314 J/(K mol). This week in lab you will fit a set of vapor pressure vs. temperature data to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to determine the heat of vaporization of an unknown liquid, shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. The linear relationship between ln(P) vs 1/T comes from the Clausius-Clapyeron equation.
Answers. Best Answer: The vapor pressure of nitrogen at several different temperatures is shown below. Use the data to find A) heat of vaporization & B) normal boiling point. When the vapor pressure = atmospheric pressure, the liquid boils! The vapor pressure of nitrogen at several different temperatures is shown below. Use the data to find A) heat of vaporization & B) normal boiling point. Temperature (K), Pressure (torr).
Introduction: The quantity of vapor above a liquid in a closed system increases with the temperature of the system. The quantity of vapor can be measured as the vapor pressure of the system. This relationship is pictorially shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Pictorial representation of the increased quantity of gas above a liquid as the system is heated. This week in lab you will fit a set of vapor pressure vs. temperature data to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to determine the heat of vaporization of an unknown liquid, shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. The linear relationship between ln(P) vs 1/T comes from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
The vapor pressure of nitrogen has been measured in the liquid range below the normal bOl~tng pOl.nt and .can be represented b:y log P .(mm) = 6.49594- 255.821 j(T - 6.600). The normal bOIling pOl.nt calculated from thIs equatIOn IS 77.364° K.

(1.) Observe and measure the change in the vapor pressure as a function of temperature. (2.) Analyze the experimental data to determine the normal boiling point and the heat of vaporization using the Clausius-Clapyeron equation. This week in lab you will fit a set of vapor pressure vs. temperature data to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to determine the heat of vaporization of an unknown liquid, shown in Figure 4. Figure 4.

Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist. For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium. The axes correspond to the pressure and temperature. The phase diagram shows, in pressure–temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas.
When the solution is in chemical equilibrium, the total vapor pressure of the solution is: P solution = (P 1) pure X 1 +(P 2) pure X 2 ……. Where (P i) pure is the vapor pressure of the pure component and X i is the mole fraction of the component in solution.
