A little more lemon helps the ham to absorb more of the pineapple juice but it is not necessary. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees. This depends on the ham, but this should take about 40 minutes. Place pineapple rings on the ham during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

2 1/2 hours. Here's how: Preheat the oven to 325, place the ham on a rack in a baking dish with a little water in the bottom.

For a 5-1/2- to 6-quart slow cooker, choose a boneless ham that is 5 to 5-1/2 pounds, brush it with a glaze, and cook it, covered, for 8 to 9 hours on low-heat setting. Step 2: Baking the ham. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert an oven-safe thermometer into the center of the ham (it should not touch the bone of a bone-in ham). Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until ham registers desired temperature (140°F for cooked ham).
10 minutes. Cooking time. On a typical 8 pound ham, approximately 15 to 20 minutes per pound total at 225°F if you use the foil wrap, but you need a thermometer to tell, not a clock. If the ham is thicker or thinner (and that is usually related to weight), that time can vary.
