Therefore we cannot use the electrical neutrality rule for these compounds. Most molecular compounds are made from nonmetals. Sometimes these compounds have generic or common names (e.g., H2O is water) and they also have systematic names (e.g., H2O, dihydrogen monoxide). The common name must be memorized. The systematic name is more complicated but it has the advantage that the formula of the compound can be deduced from the name. Systematic naming of these compounds follow the rules: 1  The elements, except for H, are are written in order of increasing group number (e.g., NO not ON). 2  The number of atoms of a given type is designated by a prefix such as di- , tri-, tetra-etc.
2 7 Ionic and Molecular Compounds • An ionic compound consists of oppositely charged cations and anions. Usually the cation is a metal and the anion is a nonmetal or a group of nonmetals. (ie, NaCl) • A molecular compound consists of two or more different nonmetals. It exists as a discrete unit of atoms. 
1 CHEM 100 F07 1 Chapter 5 - Molecules and Compounds How do we represent molecules? –In pictures–In formula–In name •Ionic compounds•Molecular compounds On the course website, you will find a list of ions that Iwould like you to know the names/formula of-startworking on them! I have also posted the list fromCHEM 131, if you want to get a jump on that list! Fe 2 O 3 We know that the oxide ion has a -2 charge, and overall the moleculemust be neutral. With this information, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3(-2) = 0x = +3 So, the name of the compound is iron (III) oxide.
The adduct with diethyl ether, boron trifluoride diethyl etherate or just boron trifluoride etherate (BF 3 · O(Et) 2) is a conveniently handled liquid and consequently is a widely encountered as a laboratory source of BF 3. It is stable as a solution in ether, but not stoichiometrically. 
Sodium fluoride /ˌsoʊdiəm ˈflʊəraɪd/ is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula NaF. A colorless solid, it is a source of the fluoride ion in diverse applications. Sodium fluoride is less expensive and less hygroscopic than the related salt potassium fluoride. In medical imaging, fluorine-18 -labelled sodium fluoride (USP, sodium fluoride F18) is one of the oldest tracers used in positron emission tomography (PET), having been in use since the 1960s.

What is the median of 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 5? The answer is 2.5 In order to find out the median of a group of numbers you must count how many of numbers there are, add one, divide by two to find n, and the nth number in … the group is the median. In this case, there are 8 numbers. 8 + 1 = 9. 9/2 is 4.5 So the 4.5th number in the group is the median.
