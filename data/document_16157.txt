Metallic & Non-Metallic Mineral Resources. 12 pages on this wiki. Metallic mineral deposits can contain materials such as, lead, zinc, iron, gold, silver, and even indium. Non-metallic mineral deposits can contain minerals such as silicon, phosphorus, or sulfur. Iron of course would be made into something as stated before, but sulfur is actually quite useful. Sulfur is used in matches, but is most popular for it’s for its use as a hardening component to rubber. Non-metallic mineral resources are usually found deeper in the ground than metallic mineral resources.
Mineral resources can be divided into two major categories-Metallic and Nonmetallic. Metallic resources are things like Gold, Silver, Tin, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Iron, Nickel, Chromium, and Aluminum. Nonmetallic resources are things like sand, gravel, gypsum, halite, Uranium, dimension stone. A mineral resource is a volume of rock enriched in one or more useful materials. In this sense a mineral refers to a useful material, a definition that is different from the way we defined a mineral back in Chapter 5

A GIS-based data compilation of nonmetallic minerals is available through direct download, or can be viewed through the Washington Interactive Geologic Map. One of the main functions of the Division in the early half of the 20th century was to inventory Washington mineral resources and report production. Because of this, we have published a lot of information about minerals over the years.
Data sources Data sources. Production data can be found in Eurostat's production statistics database (PRODCOM) which provides comparable data at the national and the European level. PRODCOM reports the products which are sold on the market. Data on quantities extracted from the natural environment, rather than quantities sold on the market, can be found in economy wide material flow accounts (EW-MFA). EW-MFA is based mainly on internal business accounts of mining compani
Mining of coal and metallic minerals in Washington began in the mid to late 1800s. Coal production in Washington hit a high in 2003 with an estimated total production of 6,232,000 short tons, yet production ceased in 2006. One of the main functions of the Division in the early half of the 20th century was to inventory Washington mineral resources and report production. Because of this, we have published a lot of information about minerals over the years.

Non-metallic mineral resources are usually found deeper in the ground than metallic mineral resources.
So the most major difference between metallic and non-metallic mineral resources is the fact that metallic mineral resources are pliable. If you compare iron and sulfur you may find a different use for both of them. Iron of course would be made into something as stated before, but sulfur is actually quite useful. Sulfur is used in matches, but is most popular for it’s for its use as a hardening component to rubber. Non-metallic mineral resources are usually found deeper in the ground than metallic mineral resources.
Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS). MRDS is a collection of reports describing metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources throughout the world. Included are deposit name, location, commodity, deposit description, geologic characteristics, production, reserves, resources, and references. It subsumes the original MRDS and MAS/MILS.
