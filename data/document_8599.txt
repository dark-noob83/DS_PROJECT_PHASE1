The cost of funds is one of the most important input costs for a financial institution, since a lower cost will generate better returns when the funds are deployed in the form of short-term and long-term loans to borrowers. Banks then make money by charging interest on loans that is higher than the initial cost of funds amount. There are many different kinds of loans that banks issue, and consumer lending comprises the largest amount of lending in the United States.
The total cost of mutual fund ownership lowers the annual rate of return from a potential 7 percent to 2.48 percent, which results in only $437,000 at retirement. The seemingly small fees ultimately cost the investor $508,000 over 30 years. Symbiosis between the advisor and the fund company is not too dissimilar from soft-dollar arrangements. If an investor uses a low-cost advisor, the ultimate investment would amount to $420,000, benefiting his advisor to the tune of $17,000.
Transaction costs. A 2007 study by Edelen, Evans and Kadlec found U.S. stock mutual funds have an average transaction cost of 1.44 percent per year, which is not included in the expense ratio. These fees are not found in most prospectuses and can be difficult to determine. Symbiosis between the advisor and the fund company is not too dissimilar from soft-dollar arrangements. If an investor uses a low-cost advisor, the ultimate investment would amount to $420,000, benefiting his advisor to the tune of $17,000.
The cost of funds represents the percentage of the interest-bearing deposits that the bank must pay out in interest. For Fictional Funds, the cost of funds would be the annualized interest expense of $20 million, divided by the average of interest-bearing deposits, which is $100 million. The cost of funds would be $20M/$100M, or 20 percent. The cost of funds is the interest rate that banks and other financial institutions pay to use their customer's money. Banks must calculate their costs of funds as part of their accounting procedures.
The expense ratio is composed of the following: • The cost of hiring the fund manager(s) - Also known as the management fee, this cost is between 0.5% and 1% of assets on average. While it sounds small, this fee ensures that mutual fund managers remain in the country's top echelon of earners. • Front-end loads-These are the most simple type of load: you pay the fee when you purchase the fund. If you invest $1,000 in a mutual fund with a 5% front-end load, $50 will pay for the sales charge, and $950 will be invested in the fund.

For example, the average mutual fund expense ratio in 2013 was 1.25 percent according to Morningstar, which may not seem like much. However, that expense alone will trim a retiree’s nest egg from about $945,000 to $757,000, or nearly $190,000 (assuming a $10,000 investment compounded 7 percent annually for 30 years).

If an investor uses a low-cost advisor, the ultimate investment would amount to $420,000, benefiting his advisor to the tune of $17,000.
