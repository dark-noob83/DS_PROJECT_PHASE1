Dimethyl ether (Methoxymethane) 3D Download 3D Dimethyl ether, or more formally, methoxymethane, is a colorless gas at room temperature, having a boiling point of -42.1 C. It is fairly water soluble, with 328 grams of the gas dissolving in 100 mL of water.
From Wikipedia. Triphenylmethanol (also known as triphenylcarbinol, TrOH) is an organic compound. It is a white crystalline solid that is insoluble in water and petroleum ether, but well soluble in ethanol, diethyl ether, and benzene. In strongly acidic solutions, it produces an intensely yellow color, due to the formation of a stable trityl carbocation. Many derivatives of triphenylmethanol are important dyes.
Diethyl ether, also known as ethoxyethane, ethyl ether, sulfuric ether, or simply ether, is an organic compound in the ether class with the formula (C 2H 5) 2O. It is a colorless, highly volatile flammable liquid. Diethyl ether is a common laboratory solvent. It has limited solubility in water (6.05 g/100 ml at 25 °C) and dissolves 1.5 g/100 ml water at 25 °C. This, coupled with its high volatility, makes it ideal for use as the non-polar solvent in liquid-liquid extraction
Solubility Solubility is the property of a substance, which describes the ability of the substance to form mixtures with other substances, usually liquids, which are chemically and physically homogeneous. In most cases, the solubility of a substance in another substance increases with an increase in temperature. If electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, are added to the. aqueous solution, the solubility of the organic substance is lowered. This is called salting out and can assist in the extraction of organic compounds, which are partially soluble in water.
Download 3D. Diethyl ether, or ethoxyethane, or just plain ether, is a colorless liquid at room temperature, having a boiling point of 34.6 C. Unlike dimethyl ether and ethyl methyl ether, it is only slightly soluble in water, with 6.9 grams of diethyl ether dissolving in 100 mL of water. Dimethyl ether, or more formally, methoxymethane, is a colorless gas at room temperature, having a boiling point of -42.1 C. It is fairly water soluble, with 328 grams of the gas
The figure 3 above shows the Grignard reagent and water reaction. The metal hydroxide (alkoxide) formed in the above reaction is appears as insoluble white solid (HO-MgBr or RO-MgBr) in the diethyl ether solvent. The bromobenzene is reacted with magnesium metal to form phenylmagnesium bromide which is known as Grignard reagent. The chemical reaction between magnesium and bromobenzene is shows in below: The formation of Grignard reagent is solvated by diethyl ether which protects the reagent from attacked by water molecules.
Discussion: The purpose of this experiment is to synthesis triphenylmethanol by using Grignard reagent. In order to synthesis triphenylmethanol, Grignard reagent is playing an important role because Grignard reagent is the key reagent in this experiment. The bromobenzene is reacted with magnesium metal to form phenylmagnesium bromide which is known as Grignard reagent. The chemical reaction between magnesium and bromobenzene is shows in below: The formation of Grignard reagent is solvated by diethyl ether which protects the reagent from attacked by water molecules.
The preparation of triphenylmethanol from methyl benzoate or benzophenone and phenylmagnesium bromide is a common laboratory experiment for illustrating the Grignard reaction. An alternative starting material is diethyl carbonate. In strongly acidic solutions, it produces an intensely yellow color, due to the formation of a stable trityl carbocation. Many derivatives of triphenylmethanol are important dyes.
