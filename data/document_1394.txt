The Active Directory protocols are specified in [LDAP] , [MS-ADTS] , [MS-SRPL] , [MS-DRSR] , [MS-SNTP] , [MS-LSAD] , [MS-LSAT] , [MS-DSSP] , [MS-SAMR] , [MS-SAMS] , [MS-WSDS] , [WXFR] , [WSENUM] , [MS-WSTIM] , [MS-ADDM] , [MS-WSPELD] and [MS-ADCAP] .

This document provides an overview of the Active Directory Protocols Overview Protocol Family. It is intended for use in conjunction with the Microsoft Protocol Technical Documents, publicly available standard specifications, network programming art, and Microsoft Windows distributed systems concepts
The LDAP protocol is the Active Directory core protocol, which means that LDAP is the only wire protocol that is supported by Active Directory. LDAP is the preferred and most common way of interacting with Active Directory. Note. Windows 2000 Active Directory does not implement the X.500 protocols (which include Directory Access Protocol [DAP], Directory System Protocol [DSP], Directory Information Shadowing Protocol [DISP], and Directory Operational Binding Management Protocol [DOP]).
The protocols that are used by Active Directory searches — and their relationship to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-layered network protocol model — are shown in the following figure. To understand how Active Directory searches work, it is important to understand the LDAP standard. Active Directory structure is based on LDAP v3 requirements, which are defined in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFCs, as summarized in RFC 3377.
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks and is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. For example, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a long-standing directory technology, underpins Active Directory. Also X.500 directories and the Organizational Unit preceded the Active Directory concept that makes use of those methods.
The diagram of the Active Directory architecture (Figure 2.3) illustrates four avenues of entry to Active Directory: LDAP/ADSI, REPL (replication), SAM, and MAPI. Each of these access routes uses a different set of protocols and APIs that enable communication with the directory service. Table 2.1 shows the APIs that Active Directory supports and that can be used by developers to integrate with Active Directory or use resources in Active Directory. Note. Windows 2000 Active Directory does not implement the X.500 protocols (which include Directory Access Protocol [DAP], Directory System Protocol [DSP], Directory Information Shadowing Protocol [DISP], and Directory Operational Binding Management Protocol [DOP]).
LDAP was used initially as a front end to X.500 directories. LDAPv3 is an industry standard that can be used with any directory service, such as Active Directory, that implements the LDAP protocol. Active Directory supports LDAPv2 (RFC 1777) and LDAPv3 (RFC 2251). Note. Windows 2000 Active Directory does not implement the X.500 protocols (which include Directory Access Protocol [DAP], Directory System Protocol [DSP], Directory Information Shadowing Protocol [DISP], and Directory Operational Binding Management Protocol [DOP]).
Active Directory makes use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of Kerberos, and DNS. For example, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a long-standing directory technology, underpins Active Directory. Also X.500 directories and the Organizational Unit preceded the Active Directory concept that makes use of those methods.
LDAP is a protocol specification for directory data. Active Directory is Microsoft's Implementation of an LDAP based directory server. AD also has custom extensions ontop of the LDAP v3 spec such as account lockout, password expiration, etc. And this implementation is called Active Directory. So in a short summary, Active Directory is a directory services implemented by Microsoft, and it supports Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).
