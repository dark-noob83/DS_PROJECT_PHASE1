A runner who is 27 to 31 and can run a mile in 6:39 or better is in the top 1 percent for the age group. Runners who can finish a 1-mile run in 8:56 are in the top 50
A runner who is 17 to 21 and in good health runs a mile in about 6:30 if he is in the top 1 percent of that age group, according to standards set by the U.S. Army Physical Fitness Guide. Runners should shoot for a time of approximately 8:18 if they want to be in the 50 percent bracket for the age group.
In the basic training that the army provides, recruits are required to run a mile within 9 minutes. Going by this standard, it is safe to say that 10 minutes is a good estimate of the average time, since recruits in the army are physically much stronger and agile.
No conclusive evidence exists on “average” 1-mile run times, because there is no scientifically agreed-upon average runner. Opinion varies widely, but most anecdotal evidence places the average between seven and 10 minutes per mile for a non-competitive, in-shape runner.
Josh Clark from Cool Running says a man who is in shape who typically runs 15 to 30 miles per week can expect to post a 10K time of about 48 minutes, while a woman will run the same distance in 58 minutes. Related Reading: The Average Time for Jogging a Half Marathon for Women.
A ten-minute mile pace is a realistic goal if you are a beginning runner and you've been training for a while. If you can run a mile in ten minutes, then you may be able to complete your 10K at an 11:30 mile pace. At this pace, you should be able to complete your 10K in about an hour and 11 minutes.
Your mile rate is more of an average; for example, if you run 3 miles in 24 minutes, the rate is eight minutes per mile. Keeping up a steady pace over extended lengths might have more payoffs for you than achieving a brisk mile and then being unable to complete additional miles.
55 minutes is better. '       ANSWER:   Let's say that the average person will probably run a s … peed of 6 mph, or one mile every 10 minutes. That would mean to run 10 miles, it would take the average person about 100 minutes, or 1:40:00.   if you can get under 1:20:00, that's a fairly good time. Running a 10-mile in under an hour means you are incredibly fast and good at sustaining a speed of at least 10 mph on average.
