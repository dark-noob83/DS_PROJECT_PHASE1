Every year that an inmate spends in prison costs $22,000. An individual sentenced to five years for a $300 theft costs the public more than $100,000. The cost of a life term averages $1.5 million. States are spending more money on prisons than education. Over the course of the last 20 years, the amount of money spent on prisons was increased by 570% while that spent on elementary and secondary education was increased by only 33%.
State prison systems spend more than $30 billion annually, and the Bureau of Prisons budgeted $5 billion for just 182,000 federal inmates this year. That translates into plenty of work for companies looking to crack the prison market.
The extra costs accounted for less than 5 percent of total prison costs in 16 states, 5 to 9.9 percent of total prison costs in nine states, and 10 to 19.9 percent of total prison costs in nine states (Arkansas, California, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, and West Virginia).
According to a December 2009 report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the total number of inmates in 2008 was 2,424,279 if you include federal/state prisons, local jails, juvenile facilities, jails in Indian Country, military facilities and ICE facilities.
One in every 31 adults, or 7.3 million Americans, is in prison, on parole or probation, at a cost to the states of $47 billion in 2008, according to a new study. Criminal correction spending is outpacing budget growth in education, transportation and public assistance, based on state and federal data.
States spent $29.5 billion on prisons in fiscal 2001 State prison expenditures totaled $29.5billion in fiscal year 2001. Adjusted forinflation, this was approximately $5.5billion more than was spent in FY 1996.California reported the largest prison expenditure, $4.2 billion, and NorthDakota the smallest, $26.8 million.
Posted by Randall A Reinwasser on Thursday, June 23, 2011 Under: Why Government Doesn't Work. This is hard to believe, U.S. Courts report that in 2010 it cost $28,284 to keep someone imprisoned in a federal prison for a full year. As you probably know, thanks in large part to idiotic drug laws, the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world...
