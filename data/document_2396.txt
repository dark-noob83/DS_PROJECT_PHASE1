Reference List. Here is a reference with the expected lifespan of popular aquarium fish. These figures are simply an average. Keep in mind that with good care fish can live much longer. Likewise, fish that are not kept in the proper habitat, and are not cared for properly, will have a shorter lifespan.
Bettas on average live little more than two years, while Goldfish live for decades. Short Lifespans. Killifish are among the aquarium fish with the shortest lifespan. They generally only live a year or two. Bettas are not far behind, averaging only about 2 years. There have been documented cases of Bettas living 5 years or more, but that is not the norm.
Freshwater. Many freshwater fish average about 1 to 3 years of life. Some of the more popular species with this short life span include fantail guppies, swordtail platy, mollies, rainbow fish, hatchet fish, corydoras catfish, some cichlids, rasboras and tiger barbs. There are also several fish that live around 3 to 5 years, with proper care and feeding.
The average lifespan of a goldfish is about 10-15 months with improper care. Many die before that because of poor care such as overfeeding, having too small of a fish tank, not having a good enough filter, forgetting to feed them, ETC. The oldest recorded goldfish lived to be 44 years old but died in 2003.
