The quokka, a small member of the kangaroo family, is found in a limited number of areas of Western Australia. One of their largest populations is on Rottnest island, a small, protected island off Perth, Western Australia. The quokka can also be found in the coastal plain around the Swan River, near Perth and Gingin. It is also found on Bald Island, and at Harvey and Collie in the Stirling Ranges.
Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal. Quokkas can be found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, in particular on Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany. A small mainland colony exists in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with Gilbert's potoroo.
