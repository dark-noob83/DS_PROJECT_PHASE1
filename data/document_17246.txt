Spanning-Tree Protocol Summary. The Spanning-Tree Protocol prevents loops in a redundant network. Spanning-Tree Protocol assigns a root bridge, root ports for nonroot bridges, and designated port segments. In a converged network, ports are either in forwarding or blocking state.
A designated port is the ports that goes from the root bridge switch to the edge of the network, so there is always a path from the root bridge to the other end. In contrast to root ports, which goes to the root bridge, instead of away from it. All ports that isn't root ports or designated ports are blocked.
Spanning Tree Designated Port Selection is almost same as Spanning Tree Root Port selection. After selecting the Spanning Tree Root Ports (best port to reach the Root Bridge), Spanning Tree Protocol will make the other end of the Root Port connecting to the next Switch as Designated Port.
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a Layer 2 protocol that runs on bridges and switches. The specification for STP is IEEE 802.1D. The main purpose of STP is to ensure that you do not create loops when you have redundant paths in your network. Loops are deadly to a network.
For that segment, Designated Port will be in Spanning Tree Forwarding State and Spanning Tree Non-Designated port will be in Spanning Tree Blocking State. Root Port is the port on any Non-Root Bridge which is the best port to reach the Root Switch (Root Bridge) . Hence, there is no Root Port in Root Bridge. All the ports in a Root Switch (Root Bridge) are Spanning Tree Designated Ports and will be in Spanning Tree Forwarding State. Following are the different steps for selecting the Spanning Tree Designated Port.
