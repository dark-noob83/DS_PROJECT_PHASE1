The whooping cough incubation period is the time between becoming infected with the bacteria that cause this illness (Bordetella pertussis) and developing symptoms. The incubation period is commonly 7 to 10 days, but it can range from 4 to 21 days and, in rare cases, may be as long as 42 days. Whooping Cough Disease.
The period between the time of infection and when symptoms of whooping cough appear is called the incubation period. The whooping cough incubation period is commonly 7 to 10 days, with a general range of 4 to 21 days; rarely, the incubation period may be as long as 42 days. Once whooping cough symptoms begin, there are generally three stages of the illness.
