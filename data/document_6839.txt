Copper Lugs. Copper Lugs, also known as copper cable lugs, are made of pure copper, cable lugs provide the best performing electrical connection between your power sources and your power cable. Copper provides the highest electrical performance to price than any other metal.
Copper Cable Lugs. Copper cable lugs are used to terminate the ends of battery cable and welding cable so they can be connected to other electrical equipment such as starters, fuse blocks, distribution blocks, etc. Made from pure copper, cable lugs are highly conductive and can handle very high currents.

Lugs. Lugs are the electrical connectors that terminate the electrical circuit. Lugs are made of copper, aluminum, or bronze. They are made for the smallest wire size, 26 gauge to the largest 2000 MCM. Lugs can be mechanical or set screw; compression or crimp, solder or weld; or clamp type. T&B, Burndy, Penn Union, Panduit, and 3M are some different manufacturers of lugs.
Copper lugs can be either crimped using a cable lug crimper or hammer style crimper, or they can be soldered using solder slugs or other electrical solder. Our copper lugs are flared at the ends to make insertion of the cable easier, and are made in the USA from 99.9% pure copper.
