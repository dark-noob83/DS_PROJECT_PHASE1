Internal Lime-Plastering Tim Ratcliffe The promotion of modern gypsum-based plasters has led to the almost complete demise of lime plastering, and of many of the traditional skills associated with the craft. 
Lime plastering is commonly used as a plastering method for historical and listed building. This is due to the long lasting nature and porous properties of lime which allows the walls to breathe. Lime has been used as a material to plaster walls for many centuries, and it is an essential building material. Lime is an essential building material that will allow water to evaporate from the building instead of it being trapped in the building that can have a negative impact on the building itself.
Okay, so internal rendering as opposed to external rendering simply means that you are covering brick or stone of walls that will be inside a property as opposed to walls that have to deal with the outside elements (think rain, wind, sunlight and possibly fire). If you would like to do your internal rendering in a way that saves you money and does as little damage to the environment as possible, you have two real options. Your first serious option is to use lime render and plaster which is obtained from heating and calcing limestone.

The lime mortar principally used for internal plastering is that calcined from chalk, oyster shells or other nearly pure limestone, and is known as fat, pure, chalk or rich lime. Hydraulic limes are also used by the plasterer, but chiefly for external work. Plasterwork refers to construction or ornamentation done with plaster, such as a layer of plaster on an interior or exterior wall structure, or plaster decorative moldings on ceilings or walls. This is also sometimes called pargeting
