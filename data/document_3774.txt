A normal GFR or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is similar in both men and women. For adults it is between 100-130 ml/min/1.73m2. For children a GFR at 110 ml/min/1.73m2 is normal â€¦ . GFR's are used to assess kidney damage or kidney disease. Normal GFR (glomerular filtration rate of the kidney) should be above 60.
The average glomerular filtration rate range is approximately 75 to 115 ml/minute in the case of women, and 85 to 125 ml/minute in the case of men. This rate decreases as a person gets older.
GFR-glomerular filtration rate is the best test to measure your level of kidney function and determine your stage of kidney disease. Your doctor can calculate it from the results of your blood creatinine test, your age, body size and gender.
GFR is a test that helps measure the level at which an individual's kidney is functioning. It is calculated on the basis of factors such as age, gender, race, and blood creatinine. Normal GFR values are between 90 to 120 ml/min. A GRF below 60 ml/min could mean that some kidney damage has occurred.
A normal GFR or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is similar in both men and women. For adults it is between 100-130 ml/min/1.73m2. For children a GFR at 110 ml/min/1.73m2 is normal. GFR's are used to assess kidney damage or kidney disease. Normal GFR (glomerular filtration rate of the kidney) should be above 60.
If your glomerular filtration rate levels go below 60 mL/min for three consecutive months, it could be that you are suffering from chronic kidney disease. In case the GRF result is below 15 mL/min, then it could be an indication of kidney failure.
The normal glomerular filtration rate could range anything from 90 to 140 mL/min. The normal glomerular filtration rate value ranges might vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. It is important to check with your health care provide about what your particular test results mean.
