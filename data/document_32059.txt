Morning sickness refers to the nauseous feeling you may have during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is a result of the increased hormones in your body. Morning sickness can be accompanied with vomiting. Many doctors think morning sickness is a good sign because it means the placenta is developing well.
With morning sickness, some women are sick (vomit) and some have a feeling of sickness (nausea) without being sick. The term morning sickness is misleading. It can affect you at any time of the day or night, and some women feel sick all day long. It's thought hormonal changes in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy are probably one of the causes of morning sickness. Symptoms should ease as your pregnancy progresses.
Once you have a confirmed pregnancy, the morning sickness usually starts around the first 4 to 6 weeks of pregnancy and it tends to get worse over the next month or so after it begins. However, for some women, the queasiness begins as early as two weeks after conception.
Morning sickness usually starts around week six of your pregnancy. But because every pregnancy is different, this can vary from woman to woman. If you have morning sickness, you may feel queasy when you wake up. But although it is called morning sickness, nausea can strike at any time of the day or night.
If your morning sickness is severe, you may feel very sick and be vomiting often. The most severe form of morning sickness is hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which means excessive vomiting during pregnancy. If you cannot eat or drink without being sick, and are vomiting several times a day, you may have HG.

When to Expect Morning Sickness. For most women, morning sickness starts about the sixth week of pregnancy, which is about three weeks after conception, assuming you have a normal menstrual cycle. It can start as early as the fourth week, which is right around when you might get your period.
