A particular atom will have the same number of protons and electrons and most atoms have at least as many neutrons as protons. An element is a substance that is made entirely from one type of atom. For example, the element hydrogen is made from atoms containing just one proton and one electron.
An element is a pure substance that is made from a single type of atom. Elements are the building blocks for all the rest of the matter in the world. Examples of elements include iron, oxygen, hydrogen, gold, and helium. Atomic Number. An important number in an element is the atomic number.
Image: Neon sign. Our world is made of elements and combinations of elements called compounds. An element is a pure substance made of atoms that are all of the same type. At present, 116 elements are known, and only about 90 of these occur naturally.
Elements in their standard state also have the same number of electrons as protons. Forms of an Element. Even though elements are all made from the same type of atoms, they can still come in different forms. Depending on their temperature they can be solid, liquid, or gas.
