1 Edmunds provides do-it-yourself instructions for replacing brake pads, calling it an easier-than-expected DIY project that requires standard tools and takes about an hour, for a savings of about $250 in labor costs on most cars. Auto Shop: Toyota Dealer. Thought it was on the high end, but I trust them and it was the first time I needed the breaks replaced in 95,000 miles. bought parts at advance auto parts 36$ for ceramic pads; 60$ pair of rotors, paid my mechanic 40$. took him less than an hour to change both.
The caliper presses the brake pad against the brake rotor, causing friction that slows down the car. During normal usage of the brakes, brake pads wear out and become thinner. If the thickness of brake pads is less than 3mm, it is time to change the pads. Depending on where you drive (city driving tends to wear pads out quicker) brake pads usually last between 30,000-35,000 miles. Some vehicles (eg. BMW’s) are equipped with a low-pad-warning system. In these vehicles, you will also need to replace the brake sensors as part of the brake pad service. 
A caliper is part of the disc brake system. When you press the brake pedal, the brake fluid flows from the master cylinder to the calipers. Brake fluid then applies pressure on the piston inside the caliper, pushing the brake pads against the rotors to slow/stop your car. A car can have either 2 or 4 calipers. If the car has rotors on all four tires, then it will have four calipers. If the car has two rotors and two drums, then it will come with two calipers in front. The calipers can become contaminated, rusty, and start to leak brake fluid. Brake calipers absorb a lot of heat generated from the braking system

Some have disc brakes in the front and drum brakes in the rear. Your disc brake pads handle up to 75% of your vehicle's braking needs. Braking power may be severely reduced if brake pads are worn thin.

If found to be at or below the manufacturer's minimum thickness specification, they will require replacement. These measurements should always be noted on your repair order. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads.
