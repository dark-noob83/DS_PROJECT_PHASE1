Multiply all those 3 dimensions together, then divide that number by 231 to get gallons. Or divide that number by 61 to get liters. Example: length = 30 inches width = 12 inches height (from base to the waterline) = 18 inches 30 * 12 * 18 = 6480 6480 / 231 = 28 gallons. 
Support and Share the First Tank Guide: Use this simple form to convert the dimensions of your aquarium (in inches or centimeters) to a close approximation of its volume (in both U.S. gallons and liters) quickly and easily. If your tank is not rectangular, such as a bowfront (sometimes called eurostyle) or hexagonal tank, you can use the average of the questionable dimension to calculate your volume.
There are 231 cubic inches in 1 gallon. To calculate the volume of a container in gallons when you have the volume in cubic inches, divide the number of cubic inches by 231. 1  Example: The volume of a tank is 3042 cubic inches. 2  Find the volume in gallons. Calculate gallons from cubic meters. There are 264.17 gallons for every 1 cubic meter. If you have the volume of a container in cubic meters, you can calculate the volume of that container by multiplying the volume in cubic meters by 264.17. 1  Example: The volume of a pool is 8.12
For example, an aquarium that is 12 inches in height by 24 inches in length by 12 inches in width has a volume of 3,456 cubic inches. Divide the cubic inches of your fish tank or aquarium by 231. There are 231 cubic inches of water in one gallon of water. The result is the capacity of your tank in gallons. For example, 3,456 cubic inches divided by 231 equals 14.9 gallons.
Find the width, height and length of your fish tank or aquarium. Use a tape measure to find accurate measurements in inches. Use the height of the water in the aquarium for your height measurement -- find the distance between the water line and the bottom of the tank. There are 231 cubic inches of water in one gallon of water. The result is the capacity of your tank in gallons. For example, 3,456 cubic inches divided by 231 equals 14.9 gallons.
All you need is to measure your fish tank's length (from side to side), height (from top to bottom of the tank), and depth (from front to back) and you can figure out how much water your aquarium holds! If your tank is not rectangular, such as a bowfront (sometimes called eurostyle) or hexagonal tank, you can use the average of the questionable dimension to calculate your volume.
This method for estimating how many fish a tank can support is superior to the traditional a how many fish per gallon or per litre rule of thumb, such as one inch of fish per gallon or one centimeter of fish per litre. 
Rectangular Tanks. Use a tape measure to measure the length of the tank. Measure the width and depth of the tank as well. Multiply the length, width and depth measurements in order to find the cubic volume. Divide the cubic volume in inches by 231, as a gallon is equal to 231 cubic inches. 
If you have a 10-gallon aquarium. Calculate 20% of 10-gallons = 0.20 x 10-gallons = 2 gallons. Multiply the 2 gallons times 16 (cups/gallon), to get 2 x 16 = 32 cups. Use a clean measuring cup to remove 32 cups of water from your aquarium. In the future, drain the water in the aquarium down to the mark and replace it with fresh tap water. You know your pond holds 50-gallon of water. Calculate 20% of 50-gallons = 0.20 x 50-gallons = 10-gallons. Use a clean bucket with a mark at one gallon to remove 10-gallons from your pond. Put a clean stick in a certain spot in your pond and carefully mark the stick at the water line
