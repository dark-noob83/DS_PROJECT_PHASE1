Overview. Thrombocytopenia, or a low blood platelet count, is encountered in 7-8% of all pregnancies. Women are more commonly diagnosed with platelet disorders during pregnancy since screening is done as part of the initial clinic evaluation with automated blood counts. Average platelet count in pregnancy is decreased (213,000/μL vs 250,000/μL). Change in platelet count is due to hemodilution, increased platelet consumption, and increased platelet aggregation driven by increased levels of thomboxane A 2.
The normal number of platelets is between 150 and 400 million per millilitre (ml) of blood. Most pregnant women have normal numbers of platelets, but about eight per cent of pregnant women have a slight drop in their platelet count. Your count is below normal if you have between 100 and 150 million platelets per ml of blood. Your platelet count will look something like Plat. 160x10.9/L, which means you have a platelet count of 160, which is in the normal range. If your platelet count is low, the blood test should be done again. This will keep track of whether or not your count is dropping.
Platelets are cells in your blood. They help your blood to clot when it needs to. The normal number of platelets is between 150 and 400 million per millilitre of blood. Most pregnant women have normal numbers of platelets but about eight per cent have a slight drop in their platelet count. Your count is below normal if you have between 100 and 150 million platelets per millilitre of blood. Gestational thrombocytopenia usually happens in the third trimester. It won't cause you or your baby any problems.
A normal platelet count in a healthy individual is between 150,000 and 450,000 per μl (microlitre) of blood (150–450 × 10 9 /L). Ninety-five percent of healthy people will have platelet counts within this range. Some will have statistically abnormal platelet counts while having no demonstrable abnormality. Low doses of betamethasone (12 mg I.M. in two consecutive days) showed no effect on platelets parameters in pregnant women affected by threatened preterm delivery and with normal platelet count (13).
1 A count of 150 to 400 million platelets per milliliter of blood is considered normal. 95% of people have a normal platelet count. 2  While most women have a normal platelet count while expecting, about 8% of women may suffer from low platelet count during their pregnancy period. 1 While most women have a normal platelet count while expecting, about 8% of women may suffer from low platelet count during their pregnancy period. 2  The platelet count comes back to normal on its own within two to three months after birth. 3  A low platelet count between 100 to 150 million should not be a big cause of worry
In normal pregnancies, 7.6% of women present with mild thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, and 65% of them will not be associated with any pathology. Any pregnant patient with a platelet count of less than 100,000/μL should undergo further clinical and laboratory assessment. Average platelet count in pregnancy is decreased (213,000/μL vs 250,000/μL). Change in platelet count is due to hemodilution, increased platelet consumption, and increased platelet aggregation driven by increased levels of thomboxane A 2.
Autoimmune disorders such as HIV, lymphomas or leukemias can attack the platelets causing a low platelet count. The normal range of platelets in non pregnant women is 150,000-400,000/ μ L. Pregnant women with a platelet count less than 100,000/μ L must consider further medical assessment. Certain conditions that may be checked to study the cause of low platelet count during pregnancy are: 1  Family history of bleeding. 1 Blood Platelets in Pregnancy Platelets which are cells in the blood help the blood to clot when required. 2  The normal 3  ... Low Platelets During Labor Platelets are naturally occurring elements in the blood serum. 4  These non-nucleated cells ...
While the platelet counts of most women remain in the normal range (150,000/µL - 350,000/µL), some will be below this range. If we document that platelet counts are lower in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women, we will consider this to be the new normal range of platelet counts during pregnancy. Some, but not all, reports on platelet counts during pregnancy describe lower than normal platelet counts as pregnancy progresses, with approximately 5% of women having platelet counts less than 150,000/µL (the lower limit of the normal platelet counts in health subjects) at the time of delivery.
