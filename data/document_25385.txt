Some Possible Effects of Blood Clots Include: Also in this section: When you get a cut or wound, your body forms blood clots, a thickened mass of blood tissue, to help stop the bleeding. Proteins in your blood called fibrins work with small blood cell fragments called platelets, to form the clot.
Platelets are not cells in the strict sense. About 1/4 the diameter of a lymphocyte, they are cytoplasmic fragments of extraordinarily large cells (up to 60 um in diameter) called megakaryocytes. In blood smears, each platelet exhibits a blue-staining outer region and an inner area containing granules that stain purple.
Platelets, also called thrombocytes. They interact with clotting proteins in the blood, and the blood vessel wall in order to form a protective clot over wounds and prevent b â€¦ lood from spilling out.
Blood Clotting. When blood vessels are cut or damaged, the loss of blood from the system must be stopped before shock and possible death occur. This is accomplished by solidification of the blood, a process called coagulation or clotting. 1  a plug of platelets enmeshed in a. 2  network of insoluble fibrin molecules.
1) Cell fragments that prevent fluid loss by initiating a chain of reactions that result in blood clotting are called. a) leukocytes. b) thrombocytes. c) phagocytic cells. d) erythrocytes.
2. Formation of a Platelet Plug. Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are small cellular fragments that lack a nucleus and are derived from megakaryocytes. When a blood vessel is damaged, the blood is exposed to collagen fibers in the basement membrane of the vessel (shown in green below).
