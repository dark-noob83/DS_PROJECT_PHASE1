The per capita daily water consumption of your family is. = 0.455 cu m / (4 x 40 + 5 x 81) x 121. Therefore, water was consumed by 4 members in the first 61 days of the billing period and by 3 persons in the remaining (121 - 61) = 60 days. The per capita daily water consumption of your family is. = 0.455 cu m / (4 x 61 + 3 x 60
