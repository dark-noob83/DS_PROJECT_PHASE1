Plant morphology or phytomorphology is the study of the physical form and external structure of plants. This is usually considered distinct from plant anatomy, which is the study of the internal structure of plants, especially at the microscopic level. Plant morphology is useful in the visual identification
Plant morphology represents a study of the development, form, and structure of plants, and, by implication, an attempt to interpret these on the basis of similarity of plan and origin.. There are four major areas of investigation in plant morphology, and each overlaps with another field of the biological sciences.
Morphology, Plant. (also phytomorphology), the study of the structure and form development of plants in their individual and evolutionary-historical development. It is one of the most important branches of botany.
Inflorescences emerging from protective coverings. Plant morphology or phytomorphology is the study of the physical form and external structure of plants. This is usually considered distinct from plant anatomy, which is the study of the internal structure of plants, especially at the microscopic level. Plant morphology is useful in the identification
Introduction [edit]. Plant morphology is the study of the external structure or form of plants. You have already covered important aspects of plant morphology in the previous chapters on plant organs (leaves, stems, roots), flowers, and fruits. Those chapters emphasized both plant anatomy (the internal structure) and plant morphology (the external form) of specific parts or organs.
