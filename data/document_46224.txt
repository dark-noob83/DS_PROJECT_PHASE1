The hormonal theory of sexuality holds that, just as exposure to certain hormones plays a role in fetal sex differentiation, such exposure also influences the sexual orientation that emerges later in the adult. Recent studies, however, have provided evidence in support of prenatal androgen exposure influencing childhood sex-typed behavior. Fetal hormones may be seen as either the primary influence upon adult sexual orientation or as a co-factor interacting with genes and/or environmental and social conditions. However, Garcia-Falgueras and Dick Swaab disagree that social conditions influence sexual orientation to a large degree
The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). Regulation of hormone synthesis of gonadal, adrenal, and thyroid hormones is often dependent on complex sets of direct influence and feedback interactions involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), -gonadal (HPG), and-thyroid (HPT) axes.
Actions of Hormones on Target Cells Hormones influence their target cells by binding to specific receptors. The hormone-receptor interaction initiates the process of transforming the chemicalmessage into a cell response. Page 2. Goals/ What You Need to KnowGoals To learn about hormone receptors. (Page 3.) Receptors for water-soluble hormones are found on the _____________ of target cells, while receptors for lipid-soluble hormones are found in the ________ or ________ of cells.5. (Page 3.) Target cells tend to ______ _______ the number of theirreceptors when there are sustained high levels of hormone present.
1 True False. 2  Some glands have endocrine and non-endocrine regions, which function differently. 3  True False. 4  Growth hormone is a protein that stimulates the growth of bones, muscles, and other organs by promoting protein synthesis. 5  This hormone is produced by the pituitary gland. 1 Some glands have endocrine and non-endocrine regions, which function differently. 2  True False. 3  Growth hormone is a protein that stimulates the growth of bones, muscles, and other organs by promoting protein synthesis. 4

Please review your answers below. 1  The endocrine system acts through neurotransmitters called hormones that influence growth, development, and metabolic activities. 2  True False. 3  Endocrine glands have ducts that carry their secretory product to a surface. 1 Some glands have endocrine and non-endocrine regions, which function differently. 2  True False. 3  Growth hormone is a protein that stimulates the growth of bones, muscles, and other organs by promoting protein synthesis. 4  This hormone is produced by the pituitary gland
Hormones. are secreted from the glands of the endocrine system, they are specific in that each hormone causes a response in a specific target organ or group of cells, rather than on the body as a whole. Exocrine hormones are secreted via a duct into the blood and usually effect a distant organ or tissue. The Endocrine system regulates the activities of the body by secreting complex chemical substances (hormones) into the blood stream. These secretions come from a variety of glands which control various organs of the body. The key functions are: 1  To regulate the metabolic functio
Dunn is an associate of the Center for Investigative Reporting. Hormones are chemical messengers that travel throughout the body coordinating complex processes like growth, metabolism, and fertility. They can influence the function of the immune system, and even alter behavior. Before birth, they guide development of the brain and reproductive system. Hormones are the reason why your arms are the same length, why you can turn food into fuel, and why you changed from head to toe at puberty. These glands make up what is known as the endocrine system (endocrine means secreting internally). Chemicals that interfere with the function of hormones are therefore known as endocrine disruptors. The testes and ovaries, or gonads, are perhaps the most familiar endocrine glands.
