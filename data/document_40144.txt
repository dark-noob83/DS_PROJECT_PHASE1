If you consume 50 percent of your energy intake from carbs and 20 percent from protein, aim to eat 30 percent of your calories from fat, which is equivalent to 40 grams when following a 1,200-calorie weight loss diet and 53 grams of fat when consuming 1,600 calories per day. Protein needs range from 10 to 35 percent of your daily calorie intake, according to the Institute of Medicine. Protein contains 4 calories per gram.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of c
Percent of Calories. According to the Institute of Medicine, children and adults should consume 45 to 65 percent of their calorie intake as carbohydrates, and at least 130 grams of carbs per day. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs
The Institute of Medicine recommends you consume between 45 and 65 percent of your total daily calories from carbohydrates, 10 to 35 percent from protein and 20 to 35 percent of your daily calorie intake from fats. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, protein and carbohydrates each provide 4 calories per gram while fat provides 9 calories per gram. For example, if you’ve consumed 60 g of protein in a day, you’ve consume 240 calories from protein.
Protein. Protein, which contains 4 calories per gram, should comprise 10 to 35 percent of your total daily calories. For a typical 2,000-calorie diet, this means that 200 to 700 calories, or 50 to 175 grams, should come from protein. Carbohydrates. The amount of carbohydrates you should consume is based on your calories. According to the USDA's Dietary Reference Intakes, carbohydrates should comprise 45 to 60 percent of your calories. If you consume 2,000 calories per day, 900 to 1,300 of them should come from c
You need protein for your muscles, bones, and the rest of your body. Exactly how much you need changes with age: 1  Babies need about 10 grams a day. 2  School-age kids need 19-34 grams a day. 3  Teenage boys need up to 52 grams a day. 4  Teenage girls need 46 grams a day. 5  Adult men need about 56 grams a day. 
Consuming 20 percent of your total calories from protein equates to 400 calories a day based on a 2,000 calorie diet. As a general rule, between 10 percent and 15 percent of your total calories should come from protein. So, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, at least 200 should come from protein, or about 50 grams. You should try to eat around one gram of protein per one kilogram of body weight, or around 0.4 grams per pound. An easier way to figure this out in your head is to take your weight, divide it in half, and subtract 10. Consuming 60 percent of your total calories from carbohydrates equates to 1,200 calories a day based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Below is an easy-to-understand explanation of how carbohydrates impact the human body and the degree to which we need them (or not) in our diet.
1 Adults should get 45 percent to 65 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 20 percent to 35 percent from fat, and 10 to 35 percent from protein. 2  Acceptable ranges for children are similar to those for adults, except that infants and younger children need a slightly higher proportion of fat (25 -40 percent). 1 The recommended intake for total fiber for adults 50 years and younger is set at 38 grams for men and 25 grams for women, while for men and women over 50 it is 30 and 21 grams per day, respectively, due to decreased food consumption.
For example, if you’ve consumed 240 protein calories and 2,000 total calories in a day, your percentage of calories from protein is 12 percent, which is within the Institute of Medicine’s recommended range of 10 to 35 percent. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, protein and carbohydrates each provide 4 calories per gram while fat provides 9 calories per gram. For example, if you’ve consumed 60 g of protein in a day, you’ve consume 240 calories from protein.
