In Canada, the Constitution, as well as federal, provincial and territorial laws, protect our human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Some provincial and territorial laws protect a broader range of rights and freedoms. But like any legislation, these laws can be repealed or changed, so their protection can be limited. It was only with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that human rights in Canada were protected in the written Constitution.
Legal rights. 1  The Charter also protects the basic human rights to life, liberty and physical and psychological safety (or “security of the person”). 2  No one can be deprived of these rights except through fair legal procedures and based on clear, fair laws.
Laws that protect human rights. In Canada, human rights are protected by federal, provincial and territorial laws. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982 is part of Canada’s Constitution. The Charter protects every Canadian’s right to be treated equally under the law.
Canadian Bill of Rights. The 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights was the country’s first federal law to protect human rights and fundamental freedom. Considered groundbreaking at the time, it was eventually superseded by the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
