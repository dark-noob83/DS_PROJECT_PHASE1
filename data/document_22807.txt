The cost calculation above assumes that you take a fixed-rate mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of 95%, and pay mortgage insurance for 10 years. Change the assumptions and you change the cost. For example: *On 85% and 90% loans, the cost is 13.4% and 12.5%, respectively.
Payments. Most borrowers now pay the PMI premium as part of the monthly mortgage payment. The PMI rate is figured as a percentage, usually around 1 to 2 percent, of the outstanding principal amount of the loan, divided into twelve monthly payments.
For example, for a loan in which the borrower has made a 10-percent down payment, the loan-to-value ration is 90 percent the PMI may be about .75 percent of the initial mortgage amount; a loan with an 85-percent loan-to-value may charge around .50 percent.
Private mortgage insurance fees vary, depending on the size of the down payment and your credit score, from around 0.3 percent to about 1.5 percent of the original loan amount per year.
PMI rates vary, but may range between 0.3% and 1.2% of the loan amount on an annual basis. Your rate will depend on several factors, including: 1  Size of your down payment. 2  PMI will cost less if you have a larger down payment (and vice versa). 3  Your credit score.
Private mortgage insurance, also abbreviated as “PMI”, is a type of mortgage insurance used with conventional loans. Similar to other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI protects the lender if you stop making payments on your home loan. PMI can be arranged by the lender and provided by private insurance companies.
A rough way to estimate the monthly PMI cost for 30-year conventional loans is to divide the loan amount by 900, 1300, 1900, or 3200 for loans with down payments of 3%, 5%, 10%, or 15% respectively. For example, let's say you buy a $200,000 home and put 5% down.
