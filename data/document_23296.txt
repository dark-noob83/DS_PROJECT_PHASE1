Requirements for a Valid Trust. A trust is created when a property interest is held by one person (the trustee) for the benefit of a different person (the beneficiary). The person creating the trust is called the settlor. The creation, administration, and modification of a trust are all regulated by state law.

States may vary as to the specific requirements and deadlines for the creation of a valid trust. However, they will usually look for the following in determining whether a trust is considered to be valid: 1  Intent to create a trust-this must be provable from the face of the creating documents themselves.
1 Valid trust purpose-the trust must have a specific purpose and may not further illegal activity. 2  Trust property-the trust must convey some form of property. 3  Future interests in property are acceptable, but they must be in existence at the time of creation. 4  Property based on speculation is not acceptable.
If the main purpose of the trust is charitable and the non-charitable purpose is incidental, then the gift is valid. This approach is illustrated by Jenkinsâ€™s 44 judgment in Re Coxen. 45 He says that where the amount applicable for non-charitable purposes cannot be quantified, the gift as a whole fails for uncertainty.
