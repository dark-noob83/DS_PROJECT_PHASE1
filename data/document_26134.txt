Understand how rain works and why it so important to life here on Earth with our fun rain facts for kids. Rain falls from clouds in the sky in the form of water droplets, this is called precipitation. Water can also fall from the sky in the form of hail, sleet or snow. Rain is an important part of the water cycle. Learn how it works with our page explaining the water cycle for kids.
New! Water cycle for kids poster. Precipitation is water released from clouds in the form of rain, freezing rain, sleet, snow, or hail. It is the primary connection in the water cycle that provides for the delivery of atmospheric water to the Earth. Most precipitation falls as rain.
Ethanol precipitation is a commonly used technique for concentrating and de-salting nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) preparations in aqueous solution. The basic procedure is that salt and ethanol are added to the aqueous solution, which forces the precipitation of nucleic acid nucleic acids out of solution.
Why does it rain? Warm air turns the water from rivers, lakes, and oceans into water vapor that rises into the air. That water vapor forms clouds, which contain small drops of water or ice crystals (depending on how high the cloud is and how cold it is).
