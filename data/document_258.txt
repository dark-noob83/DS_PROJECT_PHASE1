I demonstrate in this video how to repair a Sanyo by swap out the Analog power board on a 42 inch. This IC chip gets overheated often from too high of volume and blows an IC chip on the Analog Power Board. TV Model: Sanyo DP42841. Special thanks to norcal715 (info) and Ronald Jenkees.

show more When it does this, you can't turn it back on with the remote. You have to press the power button off and then on again and then press a channel button up or down (on the tv itself, not the remote) and then it will turn on for a few seconds and go off again. We have repeated this process up to 10 times in a row..
PE. My Monitor turns off after a few minutes though the power settings say that it should turn off after 60 minutes of no activity. Before then the screen saver should activate after 10 minutes of no activity. But in my case the screen saver never activates and my monitor just fades to black. penciline wrote in message. news:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***...

1) Turn the TV off and back on. If the TV will not respond to the remote or the power button, or if that does not fix the issue, unplug the TV. For a Projection TV or Projector, leave it off for 3 minutes. For other TVs leave it off for 1 minute. Plug the TV it back in and turn it on. 55 in Sony TV turns off and on by itself. â€Ž12-12-2012 02:44 AM edited {1}. My 55 in Sony TV turns off and on by itself. I turn the TV on and a few minutes later it will turn itself off. A green light begins flashing (it flashes about 30 times) and then the TV turns back on.
Then it turns on and off repeatly again. Then I turned it off using the remote control. Its off for few minutes, I turned it back on, its became normal again but also only last for 10 minutes or more. I tried it few times, the TV still turned on and off repeatly after 10 minutes. I gave up and turned it off. Then I unplugged my surge protector for few minutes and plugged in another outlet from the wall. 
Main Symptom of this fault: The TV appears to be working ok, but the picture goes off after a few seconds. Sound is still working and the TV responds to remote control as normal. The usual time that the screen stays on for is about 2 seconds, then it goes off.
