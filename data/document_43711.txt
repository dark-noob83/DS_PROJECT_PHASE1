Average male is somewhere around 85 pounds give or take 10 and female is 65 give or take 5-10 pounds. Some pups have all their height by about 9 months old, others continue to grow until 18 months old. There is no set in stone rule as to how a Doberman puppy will grow.
Doberman Height. Females reach their final height when they are a year old, while the males continue to grow for one more year. The correct height for a full-grown male is 27 1/2 inches at the withers, and for a female, 25 1/2 inches. The wither is the highest point of shoulder.
Report Abuse. Doberman's continue to grow until about 1 1/2 to 2 years old. I have a large male that was 27.5 at 12 months. He is now 29 at 1 year 5 months. It will be different for all, but mine was not even close to his full height at 8 months. I am getting scared though.
Doberman pinschers frequently attain their adult heights when they're around a year in age, although some exceptions do occur. Like female Doberman pinschers, many males of the breed stop gaining height once they're between 7 and 12 months old.
