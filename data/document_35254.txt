These guidelines also report that most women need 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day, while most men require 2,000 to 3,000 calories each day to maintain healthy body weightsâ€”specific needs are based on age and activity level. For example, someone following a 2,000-calorie diet should aim for 28 grams of fiber each day. The TLC diet calls for you to consume 10 to 25 grams of soluble fiber each day to reduce your LDL cholesterol. Soluble fiber is found in psyllium seeds, legumes, fruits, some vegetables, barley and oats. Nuts and seeds are also rich in soluble fiber
Adequate intake levels for total fiber are 21 grams per day for women ages 50 and older, 25 grams for women younger than age 50, 30 grams for men ages 50 and older and 38 grams of fiber each day for men younger than age 50.

A: The amount you need is tied to the number of calories you eat in a day. For healthy adults, the USDA recommends 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories consumed. So a person eating 2,000 calories a day should aim to get 28 grams of fiber daily. 
The average adult only eats 15 grams of fiber per day. Women need 25 grams of fiber per day, and men need 38 grams per day, according to the Institute of Medicine. Eating more plant foods -- vegetables, beans, fruit, whole grains, and nuts -- is the best way and is one of the major recommendations from the U.S. government's 2010 Dietary Guidelines
Total Fiber Needs. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine assembled an adequate intake, or AI, for total fiber. Adult men should get 30 to 38 grams of fiber each day, while adult women need 21 to 25 grams. During pregnancy and while nursing, however, you should get 28 to 29 grams of total fiber daily. This basic recommendation may be too much or too little, depending on your diet
Recommended intake. Average dietary fiber intake among children is much lower than the recommendations noted below. For children ages 3 to 5 years of age, the average fiber intake is about 11 grams per day. For children 6 to 11 years the average fiber intake is about 13 grams per day. That is 50% less than what they need! Kids do not get the needed amounts of fruit, vegetables and whole grains, which leads to poor fiber
