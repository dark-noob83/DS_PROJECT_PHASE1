Calcium uses in general. 1  Calcium may be used as a reducing agent in the process of metal extraction. 2  Calcium is also used in the production of some metals, as an allying agent. 3  Calcium carbonate is used to make cement and mortar and also in the glass industry.
Calcium hydroxide is used in some dental procedures. Calcium hydroxide, informally referred to as slaked lime, is a compound created through the mixture of calcium oxide with water. The resultant substance is a white powder or crystal compound with strong alkaline properties.
Absolute Astronomy states that calcium hydroxide is used as the active alkaline ingredient in some hair relaxer products. Hair relaxers are creams or liquids that are designed to straighten curly hair when applied, and many of these products contain lye, a powerful caustic.
calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH) 2, colorless crystal or white powder. It is prepared by reacting calcium oxide (lime) with water, a process called slaking, and is also known as hydrated lime or slaked lime. When heated above 580Â°C it dehydrates, forming the oxide.
Controlling pH by the use of lime. In sugar refining, for example, lime is used to make the solution alkaline, causing impurities in the sugar to separate out for removal. Carbon dioxide (also from limestone) is then used to remove the lime by reforming calcium carbonate (limestone) which precipitates out.
USES Calcium Carbonate is mostly used in the construction industry as a building material such as limestone, marble or chalk it can also be used as an ingredient of cement. Calcium carbonate in the form of chalk is used as filler in the paper industry. It is used as a cheap way to make bright opaque paper.
