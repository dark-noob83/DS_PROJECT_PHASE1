The town was founded only on 23 January 1967 with an aim to relieve the housing pressure in London. It is the administrative centre of the Borough of Milton Keynes and has a unitary authority but is a part of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire. The town itself took the name after the village of Milton Keynes which was first mentioned in the 11th century as Middeltone. The modern name of the village was first recorded in the 15th century. The history of the designated area, however, does not begin in the Middle Ages.

From its establishment in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created by far the largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build a new city of 250,000 people. The designated area was 21,870 acres (8,850 ha), somewhat smaller than the 27,000 acres (11,000 ha) in the Draft Order (due to the exclusion of the Calverton Wealds). The name Milton Keynes was also unveiled at this time, taken from the existing village of Milton Keynes on the site.
