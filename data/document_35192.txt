Haemoglobin is tested by taking a sample of blood and the normal levels are as follows:Male: 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dlFemale: 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dlChildren: 11 to 16 gm/dlPregnant women:11 to 12 gm/dlwhere gm/dl = grams/decilitre.
A low hemoglobin count is generally defined as less than 13.5 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter (135 grams per liter) of blood for men and less than 12 grams per deciliter (120 grams per liter) for women. In children, the definition varies with age and sex.
The normal level of hemoglobin in blood varies in male and female. In male it ranges from 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dL and in female it ranges from 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dL.Low level of Hemoglobin-There are many reasons for the reduction of hemoglobin blood.
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15
Normal hemoglobin levels are different in women and in men. In non-pregnant women, normal hemoglobin ranges from 120 g/L to 160 g/L. In men, normal hemoglobin levels range from 140 g/L to 180 g/L. Canadian Blood Services tests each donorâ€™s hemoglobin at the clinic and requires a minimum of 125 g/L for donation.
Low hemoglobin means that a person's hemoglobin level when measured, is below the lowest limits of normal for their age and sex (see above normal range of values). For example, a 19 year old male would have low hemoglobin if the detected blood value was below 13.6 g/dl.
Hemoglobin Levels for Children. Children need optimal oxygenation for normal growth and development. According to the World Health Organization, a normal hemoglobin level for children age 6 months to 4 years is at or above 11 g/dL. A normal levels for children ages 5 to 12 years is at or above 11.5 g/dL. A normal level for adolescents ages 12 to 15 is at or above 12.0 g/dL.
The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person.
