RE: Is cornstarch soluble in water? I&#39;m doing using solubility as a way to narrow down the identities of powders in a science competition. Supposedly, according to the flowchart I have, cornstarh is insoluble, but I haven&#39;t found anything to back that up. Submit. · just now. Report Abuse. Cornstarch is not soluble in water. To use it, it is usually stirred into water, but you have a cloudy suspension. Oobleck is an unusual water cornstarch mixture that displays solid and liquid characteristics. Hot water will cause the corn starch to swell and thicken.
Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol. It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight. Starch becomes soluble in water when heated. The granules swell and burst, the semi-crystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule, forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixture's viscosity.
Answers. Best Answer: ... The starch in corn contains approx[imately] 27% amylose and 73% amylopectin, with these two polymers so associated in the crystal lattice that they are practically insol[uble] in cold water or alcohol. .... Merck Index, 12th Ed. 
Because starch is a natural polymer made up of many beta-glucose subunits. Whereas most disaccharrides and trisaccharides are soluble in water, longer sugar chains such as starch are much less soluble, especially in cold water. Most Monosaccharrides, disaccharrides and trisaccharides are soluble in water, longer chain sugars such as starch are much less soluble, especially in cold water, and better soluble in hot water.

Sugar is a highly polar molecule, with potential to form hydrogen bonds everywhere, and it feels much more at home in the highly polar solvent water (which also has lots of possibilities for strong hydrogen bonding networks) than in the moderately polar solvent ethanol (which has less hydrogen bonding power). 
Starch granules are insoluble in cold water. When starch is heated in water, granules absorb water and swell. The ab-sorption of water by amorphous regions within the gran-ules destabilizes their crystalline structure, resulting in the loss of birefringence, which is one definition of gelatiniza-tion (9−11). 
0. starch is insoluble in water because it is in complex structure compared to glucose and it is a polysaccharide which is a complex carbohydrate and glucose is a monosaccharide which is the simplest carbohydrate. Hope this answer is helpful to you..... Posted by M.sindhusha (student) on 27/6/13.
