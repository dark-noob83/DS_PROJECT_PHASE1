Under the outer layer another layer of connective tissue around each whole muscle is called the. ___epimysium__. The ___perimysium___surrounds individual bundles of fibers called ___fascicles____. within each muscle. Each muscle cell (fiber) is covered by a connective tissue layer called __endomysium____.
3. Sometimes tendons are broad sheets of connective tissue called aponeuroses. 4. The layer of connective tissue around each whole muscle is the epimysium; the perimysium surrounds individual bundles (fascicles) within each muscle; and each muscle cell (fiber) is covered by a connective tissue layer called endomysium. C. Skeletal Muscle Fibers (p. 179; Figs. 8.2-8.4). 1.
Each compartment contains a bundle of muscle fibers. Each bundle of muscle fiber is called a fasciculus and is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. Within the fasciculus, each individual muscle cell, called a muscle fiber, is surrounded by connective tissue called the endomysium.
