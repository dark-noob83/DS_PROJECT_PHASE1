Another understanding of the concept of omnibenevolence focuses upon a more literal reading of the word: a perfect and complete desire for goodness. Under this explanation of omnibenevolence, God always desires what is good, but that doesnt necessarily mean that God ever actually tries to actualize the good.

Question: What does it mean that God is omnibenevolent?. Answer: The word omnibenevolent comes from the Latin word omni, meaning all, and the word benevolent, meaning good or charitable. When we say that God is omnibenevolent, we are saying that God is absolutely good and that no action or motive or thought or feeling or anything else about Him is not purely good. Philosophically speaking, God s omnibenevolence is a complicated issue. The problem of evil is a complex one. However, we do know that, for God to be God, He must be omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient.
