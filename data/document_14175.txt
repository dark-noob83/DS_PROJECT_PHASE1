Uranus orbits the sun every 84 years at an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km) and spins on its own axis every 17 hours compared to 24 hours on Earth. Uranus has the coldest atmospheric temperature of any planet in the solar system, around -224C (-371F). 
Neptune's minimal temperature is -220 degrees Celsius and the maximum temperature is -230 degrees Celsius. 
However, the distance to Neptune from the sun is enormous--on average, the planet is 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the heat-giving star. As a result, the pole tipped toward the sun reaches higher temperatures than the rest of the planet for a quarter of a Neptunian year, or for about 40 Earth-years. Unlike the terrestrial planets, Neptune and the other gas giants still hold much of the atmosphere they had at their formation. Temperature and pressure shift at different heights. The average temperature at the top of the cloud tops is minus 346 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 210 degrees Celsius).
According to scientists, the surface of Neptune is one of the coldest places in the Solar System. At its surface, where the clouds of the planet touch space, the temperature of Neptune can dip down to 55 Kelvin. That’s -218 degrees Celsius. Neptune and its Great Dark Spot. Image credit: NASA/JPL. The average temperature of Neptune is 73 K (-200 Celsius). But one strange anomaly is the planet’s south pole, which is 10 degrees warmer than the rest of planet. This “hot spot” occurs because Neptune’s south pole is currently exposed to the Sun
At this point, the temperature of Neptune can reach as low as 55° Kelvin (or 50° above absolute zero) although the mean temperature of the planet is 73° K (-200° Celsius). However, temperatures at the South Pole are -10° C warmer than the rest of the planet because it is currently titled towards the Sun. Now that Pluto has been demoted from a planet to a dwarf planet, Neptune is now the most distant planet in the solar system. It is 2.8 million miles from the Sun or 30 times the distance of the Earth to the Sun.
+ Browse version of image. In the paper, Orton and his colleagues report that the temperature at Neptune's south pole is hotter than anywhere else on the planet by about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit). The average temperature on Neptune is about minus 200 degrees Celsius (minus 392 degrees Fahrenheit). Neptune, the farthest known planet of our solar system, is located about 30 times farther away from the sun than Earth is. Only about one thousandth of the sunlight received by our planet reaches Neptune. 
The seventh planet from the sun, Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any of the planets in the solar system, even though it is not the most distant. Despite the fact that its equator faces away from the sun, the temperature distribution on Uranus is much like other planets, with a warmer equator and cooler poles. 
Neptune orbits around the sun every 165 years at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion km). It spins on its own axis every 16 hours compared to 24 hours on Earth. Due to its far distance from the sun Neptune has an extremely cold outer atmosphere with temperatures averaging around -220C (-364F). Temperatures at its center rise to around 5000C (9000F). Neptune has 13 known satellites, the largest being Triton (picture right) which has a diameter of around 1,681 miles (2,705 km)
Neptune is the planet that is the furthest away from the sun. It is about 4.5 billion kilometers from the sun, which is more than three times as distant as Saturn. It is also one of the coldest planets in the solar system. Neptune s temperature can be as low as 55 Kelvin (-218 degrees Celsius). The average temperature of Neptune is about 73 Kelvin (-200 Celsius). However, at the South Pole of Neptune the temperature is about -10 degrees Celsius warmer than the rest of the planet. The South Pole is warmer due to its exposure to the sun. 
1 Neptune is the furthest planet from the sun and the fourth largest. 2  It has a diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528 km) which is four times larger than Earth. 3  Neptune is 30 times further away from the sun than Earth is. 4  The dwarf planet Pluto moves inside Neptune's orbit every 248 years, for periods of 20 years. Due to its far distance from the sun Neptune has an extremely cold outer atmosphere with temperatures averaging around -220C (-364F). Temperatures at its center rise to around 5000C (9000F).
