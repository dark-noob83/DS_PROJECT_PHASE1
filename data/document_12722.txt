Unijunction transistor: Although a unijunction transistor is not a thyristor, this device can trigger larger thyristors with a pulse at base B1. A unijunction transistor is composed of a bar of N-type silicon having a P-type connection in the middle.
SCR can be triggered without a positive voltage at the gate. The SCR is usually connected with the anode to the positive rail and cathode to the negative rail. If the applied voltage to the anode increases, the capacitive coupling in the device induces charge into the gate and SCR triggers.
Acute renal failure occurs in 5 percent of hospitalized patients. Etiologically, this common condition can be categorized as prerenal, intrinsic or postrenal. Most patients have pre-renal acute renal failure or acute tubular necrosis (a type of intrinsic acute renal failure that is usually caused by ischemia or toxins).
The SCR start conduction when it is forward biased. For this purpose the cathode is kept at negative and anode at positive voltage. When the forward bias voltage is applied to the SCR, the junction J1 and J3 become forward biased while the junction J2 become reverse biased.
The SCR is a four layered device with alternating N and P type materials.The SCR consist of four layer of semiconductor which forms PNPN or NPNP structure. Silicon is used as the intrinsic semiconductor, to which the proper dopants are added. It has three terminals called anode, cathode and gate.

The parietal cell antibody test is not a frequently ordered test because it is not as specific as the intrinsic factor antibody test.
A parietal cell antibody test may be used along with or following an intrinsic factor antibody test to help determine the cause of a vitamin B12 deficiency and to help confirm a diagnosis of pernicious anemia.
