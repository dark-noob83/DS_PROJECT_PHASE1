The Largest Man-Made Lake of the Ancient Khmer Civilization. A “baray” is a water reservoir built by the ancient Khmer people. The West Baray is the largest example of such a reservoir, and the only example that still holds water. Visitors to the baray are stunned by its enormity and natural appearance.
The largest are the East Baray and West Baray in the Angkor area, each rectangular in shape, oriented east-west and measuring roughly five by one and a half miles. Historians are divided on the meaning and functions of barays.
A baray is an artificial body of water which is a common element of the architectural style of the Khmer Empire of Southeast Asia.
West Baray is the largest man-made body of water at Angkor. Visitors can hire a boat to take them to the island in the middle where West Mebon temple once stood. Today, only traces of it remain. But the island is a pleasant spot for a picnic or just walking around when water level is low.
