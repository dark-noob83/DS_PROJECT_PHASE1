The integumentary system is responsible for protecting the body, its organs, muscles, and bones. It helps to regulate body temperature, controls water loss, and has receptors that respond to touch. The skin has 2 basic layers: * The outer layer of skin is the epidermis * The inner layer is called the dermis.

A layer of skin composed of a thin layer lying under the epidermis, the stratum papillare, and the stratum reticulare; it contains blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves and nerve endings, glands, and, except for glabrous skin, hair follicles.
Dermis. The dermis, the skin's next layer, is a thick layer of fibrous and elastic tissue (made mostly of collagen, elastin, and fibrillin) that gives the skin its flexibility and strength. The dermis contains nerve endings, sweat glands and oil (sebaceous) glands, hair follicles, and blood vessels.
