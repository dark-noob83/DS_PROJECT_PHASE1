Roast the tenderloin at 450 F for 10 to 15 minutes to aid browning, then reduce the oven to 325 F. Roast the tenderloin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part shows an internal temperature of 140 F. Remove the tenderloin from your oven and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Let it rest for 10 minutes before carving, which gives its internal temperature time to rise to 145 F, the temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for food safety.
1 For an even juicer meal, remove the pork tenderloin from the heat once the internal temperature measures between 145 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit (63 to 68 degrees Celsius), and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
1 Roast for 30 minutes. 2  Turn the pork over and roast for another 25 minutes. 3  The pork tenderloin is ready when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 4  Remove the pork from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
1 Place the tenderloin in a roasting pan. 2  Place the pan in the oven and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 3  Allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
With a pork tenderloin: Season the meat, sear all sides in a very hot pan, and then finish in the oven at 350째F (175째C) degrees until the internal temp. hits 145째F (63째C). Then let it sit for 10 minutes, and cut 'er up. If you need it done faster, a higher oven temp will accomplish this, but may compromise quality.
1 Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices. 2  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist. 3  After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees.
Broil the tenderloin for 10 to 12 minutes, or 8 to 10 minutes for medallions, turning once midway through that time. An instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into the thickest part of the tenderloin should read 140 F, or 145 F if they're medallions.
