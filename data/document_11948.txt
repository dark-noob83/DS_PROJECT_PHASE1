Asteroid Belt. About 2-4 AU (186-370 million miles) away from the Sun, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is a region called the Asteroid Belt. This region is a ring of tens of thousands of relatively small rocky objects called Asteroids. Asteroids can vary greatly in size.
Minor planets, also called asteroids, are rocky objects in orbit around the sun. Most orbit in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, moving in the same direction as the planets. They range in size from the dwarf planet Eris, which has a diameter of about 2300 km, down to the size of pebbles. Sixteen have a diameter of 240 km or greater.

Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. The dwarf planet Ceres is the largest of the bodies in the Belt. â€¦ However, there is also a larger area past the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt, which likewise contains many thousands of asteroids.
Asteroids are essentially chunks of rock that measure in size from a few feet to several miles in diameter. (Small asteroids are called meteoroids.) The largest asteroid, Ceres, is about 590 miles (950 kilometers) wide. Like most asteroids, it lies in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
Asteroids are small, metallic or rocky in composition, and have no atmosphere. Most asteroids orbit the sun within a broad belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter: the asteroid belt. Millions of asteroids are under 0.6 mile (1 kilometer) in diameter, but there are many that are larger. The biggest, Ceres, is 590 miles (950 kilometers) in diameter.
