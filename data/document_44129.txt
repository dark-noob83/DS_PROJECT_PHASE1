1 This tendon is located on the back portion of the foot just above the heel. 2  It is the site where the calf muscle attaches to the heel of the foot (the calcaneus bone). 3  This tendon is vital for pushing off with the foot. 4  The Achilles helps you stand on your tiptoes and push off when starting a foot race.
When the muscle contracts it pulls on the tendon, which moves the bone. Tendons are extremely tough and are seldom torn, even when an injury is severe enough to break a bone or tear a muscle. One of the most prominent tendons is the achilles tendon. Frequently injured tendons. From Copstead, 1995.
Achilles tendon, calcaneal tendon the powerful tendon at the back of the heel, attaching the triceps surae muscle to the calcaneus. tendon of conus, tendon of infundibulum a collagenous band connecting the posterior surface of the pulmonary annulus and the muscular infundibulum with the root of the aorta.
A tendon is a flexible band of fibrous tissue that connects muscles to bones. Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon. Tendons transmit the pull of the muscle to the bone to cause movement. They are found throughout the body, including the hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet.
The cord-like structure of the tendon is not the only conformation a tendon can take. The muscles of the skull are held together by tendons with the same basic building blocks (collagen), but they take a different shape. Go ahead and feel your head until you locate a dense tendon cord like the Achilles.
Tendon repair is surgery done to treat a torn or otherwise damaged tendon. Tendons are the soft, band-like tissues that connect muscles to bone. When the muscles contract, the tendons pull the bones and cause them to move. When tendon damage occurs, movement may be seriously limited in the area of the damage. The damaged area may feel numb, weak, or painful.
