After more than 70 years of dreams, with many different plans for bridging the Straits of Mackinac, ground breaking to build the Mackinac Bridge took place in St. Ignace on May 7, 1954 and Mackinaw City on May 8.
Bonds ($99,800,000) for the project were issued in early 1954. The proceeds to the Authority amounted to $96,400,033.33. The cost to design the project was $3,500,000 (Steinman Company). The cost to construct the bridge was $70, 268,500. Two primary contractors were hired to build the bridge: American Bridge for superstructure - $44,532,900; and Merritt-Chapman and Scott of New York for the foundations - $25,735,600. The remainder of the proceeds from the bond sale was used to service the bond debt both during and after construction.
Constructing the Mackinac Bridge actually went on into 1958 and took 48 months, 3,500 workers, 895,000 blueprints & structural drawings, 71,300 tons of structural steel, 931,000 tons of concrete, 42,000 miles of cable wire, 4,851,700 steel rivets, 1,016,600 steel bolts and 99,800,000 dollars.

The Mackinac Bridge is five miles long and crosses the Straits of Mackinac, connecting the upper and lower peninsulas of Michigan. It is the longest suspension bridge in North America. The building of the Mackinac Bridge began in May 1954 and opened to traffic November 1, 1957.
Crane and barrage used in the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corporation's $25,735,600 contract to build all of the bridge's foundations resulted in the assembly of the largest bridge construction fleet ever assembled up to that time.
