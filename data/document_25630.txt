The innovative Pelcotec™ SFG12 finder grid substrate is a flat, conductive silicon substrate with a die size of 12.5 x 12.5mm. It is covered with a 1 x 1mm raster giving a total of 12x12=144 fields. Each field has a unique label using an alphanumeric pattern.
Glass substrate is a sheet glass which makes flat panel displays (FPD), such as liquid crystal televisions (LCD), plasma televisions (PDP), and laptops displays. The ingredients differ from the sheet glass used for windowpanes. Ingredients also differ between liquid crystal and plasma displays.
LCD Glass Substrates. “LCD glass substrate” is a generic term for the special glass used for thin-film transistor (TFT) LCDs which form the display area of products including LCD televisions, personal computers and mobile phones. An LCD panel consists of various components stacked in a number of layers.
2. Deck / Substrate. A roof deck is a roofing material layer installed on top of the rafters and right under the insulating layers of underlayment. The primary function of a deck is to act as a unifying structural diaphragm by tying all the components of a roof together.
The Ultra-Flat SiO 2 substrates consist of a 200nm thermally grown amorphous SiO 2 film on an ultra-flat silicon wafer. SiO 2 is one of the most characterized materials and is widely used in semiconductor manufacturing, thin film research and as substrate for growing cells.
Roofing underlayment is a special barrier that is installed between the deck/substrate and the surface material, such as roofing shingles, tile, etc. Underlayment is installed in an overlapping sequence from the bottom of the roof, going up.
