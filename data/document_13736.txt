CONSTRUCTION OPTIONS. Corelite. P&Hs own corelite material combines a foam core with a tough outer layer to save weight and increase the stiffness of the hull creating lightweight, durable kayak that offers you the very best in plastic sea kayak construction. It offers superb impact resistance and can be easily repaired if damaged. The deck is also glass fibre with added reinforcement around the cockpit (for deep water rescues) and footrest mountings. It offers superb resistance to impact, abrasion, puncture and tearing.
Failure to adhere to these general guidelines could result in cracking of the shelf and possible loss of ware or glass work. Manufacturer’s Guidelines for Use – Large Corelite shelves 1) Posting: Posts are an effective way to create multiple layers for decking. Glass and tile ware do not typically have a tremendous mass, which means you will not exceed the strength of the shelf. 3) Heating and Cooling Rates All glass kilns have a broad range of heating ramps and many will heat up at rates well beyond what is suggested for glass or refractory. We would not suggest heating at a rate any greater than 200 F per hour, particularly if the surface coverage is low.
It also provides a secure method (via SSL, TLS, FTPS, HTTPS, or SFTP) to upload / download files to and from FTP servers. Features like SFTP (SSH), SSL, TLS, FTPS, IDN, browser integration, site to site transfers, FTP transfer resume, drag and drop support, file viewing & editing, firewall support, custom commands, FTP URL parsing, command line transfers, filters, and much, much more!

CoreLite Kiln Shelves for Glass Corelite Kiln Shelves are extruded hollow refractory materials that are double sided diamond wet ground for extreme flatness. They are available in a variety of sizes including rounds, half rounds, rectangles and large ovals for glass kilns. 3) Heating and Cooling Rates All glass kilns have a broad range of heating ramps and many will heat up at rates well beyond what is suggested for glass or refractory. We would not suggest heating at a rate any greater than 200 F per hour, particularly if the surface coverage is low.
You can post CoreLite shelves if you like, but test to see if any advantages are derived from laying the shelf flat on the bottom of the kiln. 2) Surface Coverage: Do not use a large oval CoreLite shelf if your singular or combined glassware covers less than 1/2 of the total surface area. 3) Heating and Cooling Rates All glass kilns have a broad range of heating ramps and many will heat up at rates well beyond what is suggested for glass or refractory. We would not suggest heating at a rate any greater than 200 F per hour, particularly if the surface coverage is low.
Corelite is a environmentally stabilized, Polymer sheet with layers of contrasting colors ideal for engraving. Accelerated color weather tests performed by independent labs and several R&D departments show that Corelite retains its color better and longer, thanks to the stringent standards of environmental protection built into every sheet.
Full Definition of CORRELATE. 1. : either of two things so related that one directly implies or is complementary to the other (as husband and wife). 2. — correlate adjective.

Engraving made easy. Corelite is a environmentally stabilized, Polymer sheet with layers of contrasting colors ideal for engraving. Corelite is a superior homogeneous polymer sheet, made with a unique state-of-the-art, continuous process. Manufactured to the highest standards in the industry, Corelite will not delaminate like wood or wood-laminate products. With a cap that is approximately 10% of the overall gauge thickness, engraving is made easier and quicker. Accelerated color weather tests performed by independent labs and several R&D departments show that Corelite retains its color better and longer, thanks to the stringent standards of environmental protection built into every sheet.
