Remove pork from bag, and place in a large roasting pan, skin side up. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature. Season again with salt and pepper, and pour wine in pan. Roast for 45 minutes, reduce heat to 350, and continue roasting until thickest part of pork registers 145 degrees on a meat thermometer, about 3 hours.
Cooking Directions. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Place pork on a rack in large shallow roasting pan. Roast for about 4 -5 hours (about 15 minutes per pound.) until internal temperature on a thermometer reads 145 degrees F. Remove roast from oven and cover with foil; let rest about 10 minutes. Serves 10-13, with leftovers.
Coat pork with remaining crumbs. Roast pork on a rack in a roasting pan in middle of oven 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 325째F and roast until an instant-read thermometer diagonally inserted at least 2 inches into meat registers 155째F, 1 to 1 1/4 hours more. Let pork stand, loosely covered, 10 minutes.
A 2.7kg leg requires a cooking time of 30-35 minutes per 500g. You are looking at 5 hours cooking time plus the time it takes for your oven to get up to temperature and the resting time. Add your vegetables when you remove the meat to rest and boost the heat to 180C again.
Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day in the refrigerator, covered and turning it once or twice. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Uncover the pork and allow the meat to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Roast the pork for 30 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. and continue to roast until the meat is falling apart and an instant-read thermometer reaches 160 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the pork.
