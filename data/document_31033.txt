Mount Everest is called the world's highest mountain because it has the highest elevation above sea level . We could also say that it has the highest altitude. The peak of Mount Everest is 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above sea level. No other mountain on Earth has a higher altitude. However, some mountains might be considered taller (with taller being the total vertical distance between their base and their summit).
The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207 m (13,802 ft) above sea level) is the world 's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about 10,203 m (33,474 ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor. 
(Everest). The TALLEST mountain on earth, measured from base to summit is the volcanic peak of Mauna Kea, one of five volcanic masses making up the Big Islandof Hawaii. It is about 9,000 m (30,000 ft) tall, however only 4,245 m (13,796 ft) of that is above sea level.. 9,000 m. (Mauna Kea). Mauna Kea, or White Mountaina volcano of the Big Island of Hawaii, is the tallest mountain on earth. It measure about 10,200 meters from base to summit. Chimborazo is a volcano in the Andes of Ecuador. It measures about 6,310 meter
The summit of Mount Everest is higher above sea level than the summit of any other mountain, but Mauna Kea is the tallest when measured from base to summit. Mount Everest. When measuring mountain summits by their height above sea level, Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. Standing at 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) it reigns over the eight-thousanders club, a list that consists of the 14 mountains on Earth that are at least 8,000 meters tall.
OK, when measured from sea level Mount Everest(29,035 ft; 8,849 m.) is the tallest and extends farthest into the atmosphere than any other peak in the world. However, the mountain peak that is closest to the moon and stars, is Mount Chimborazo (20,565 ft; 6,268 m.) in Ecuador. The mountain with the highest base-to-summit vertical rise above sea level (just over 18,000 feet, or 5,486 meters), is Mount McKinley (Denali) in Alaska (20,320 ft; 6,193 m.).
Standing 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level, its peak is the highest point in the U.S. state of Hawaii. However, much of the mountain is below sea level; when measured from its oceanic base, the total height difference is 10,200 m (33,500 ft). McKinley’s base-to-peak height is only little more than half that of the 10,200 metres (33,500 ft).
Although Mount Everest, at 29,035 ft (8,850m) tall, is often called the tallest mountain; Mauna Kea, an inactive volcano on the island of Hawaii, is actually taller. Only 13,796 feet of Mauna Kea stands above sea level, however, if you measure it from its base, which is below sea level, it is 33,465 feet. Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain on Earth. Measured from top to its base below sea level, Mauna Kea beats Everest by 4,436 ft. (over 3/4 of a mile).
No, it’s not the Mount Everest, but the Mount McKinley (or Denali) in Alaska ! McKinley has a summit elevation of 20,320 feet (6,194 m) above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America. Measured from base to peak, it is the world’s tallest mountain ON LAND. McKinley sits atop a plain with elevations from 300 metres (1,000 ft) to 900 metres (3,000 ft), for a base-to-peak height of 5,300 to 5,900 metres (17,000 to 19,000 ft). However, much of the mountain is below sea level; when measured from its oceanic base, the total height difference is 10,200 m (33,500 ft). McKinley’s base-to-peak height is only little more than half that of the 10,200 metres
Usually these are volcanic mountains. The tallest mountain when measured from its base is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, at over 33,000 feet (10,058 m.)-- however its base is many miles below the ocean surface, and only 13,796 feet (4,205 m.) of that is above sea level! The mountain with the highest base-to-summit vertical rise above sea level (just over 18,000 feet, or 5,486 meters), is Mount McKinley (Denali) in Alaska (20,320 ft; 6,193 m.).
Tallest Mountain: The base of Mauna Kea is about 6000 meters below sea level and the summit is about 4000 meters above sea level. The distance between the foot of the mountain and the summit is about 10,000 meters. This makes Mauna Kea the tallest mountain in the world. The peak of Mount Everest is 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above sea level. No other mountain on Earth has a higher altitude. However, some mountains might be considered taller (with taller being the total vertical distance between their base and their summit).
