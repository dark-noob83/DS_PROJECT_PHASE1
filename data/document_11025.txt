Cost. Ignoring any maintenance costs, asphalt is generally much cheaper to install than concrete. On average, the cost per square foot for asphalt will run between $2.50 to $4.00. Fluctuations in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in asphalt prices but the price will remain around this range. Concrete, on the other hand, can run between $4.00 to $6.00 per square foot for basic installation and can cost more depending on different finishes and detail. Itâ€™s not unheard of to have a stained concrete driveway with a smooth finish cost over $15.00 per square foot.
A typical two-car driveway is 16 feet wide and 38 feet long without curves or slope, for a total surface area of 610 square feet. It will typically cost $3.26 per square foot to be professionally supplied and paved with asphalt. The DIY Material Cost is around $2.29 per square foot.
As a very loose guideline, in most areas, asphalt installation will range from about $2.50 to $4.00 per square foot, while concrete typically ranges from about $4.00 to about $6.00 per square foot but can rise to more than $15.00 per square foot when special finishes and detailing are used.
Asphalt installation ranges from $2 to $5 per square foot. This cost includes excavation of the area, sub-base layer installation, and 1 to 1 1/2 of an asphalt top-layer. Asphalt pricing can vary based on existing crude oil prices, but is generally in the $2 to $5 range.
