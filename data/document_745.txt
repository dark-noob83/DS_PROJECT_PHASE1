Amphibians have smooth, slimy skin that is covered with mucus secretions. This keeps their skin moist and allows oxygen to pass into their bodies. Amphibians cannot drink water with their mouths. Water is absorbed through their skin.
Almost all amphibians have thin, moist skin that helps them breathe. No other group of animals has this special skin. Most amphibians undergo a unique change from larvae to adults, called metamorphosis.
Frogs and toads have a 'lycra' type skin that protects them from from injury and disease. It comes in wonderful variations of colour and patterns. Frog skin is water permiable, this means it can let water in and out. Frogs don't often drink with their mouths, they absorb water through their skin.
Misconceptions. Many people confuse reptiles, particularly snakes, with amphibians. Reptiles have scales, and amphibians do not. Salamanders, which are amphibians, are often erroneously referred to as lizards. Because amphibians have moist skin, most people assume all amphibians live in wet areas.
Amphibian Skin. Amphibians are cold-blooded animals that are generally considered the most primitive terrestrial members of the phylum Chordata.
Frogs and salamanders are amphibians. Amphibians are animals that live part of their lives in water and part on land. They usually have soft, moist skin that is protected by a slippery layer of mucus. They also tend to live in moist places or near water to keep their bodies from drying out.
Amphibians include frogs, toads (actually a family of frogs), and salamanders. Amphibians are vertebrates, so they have a bony skeleton. Most amphibians live part of their lives underwater and part on land. Amphibians reproduce by laying eggs that do not have a soft skin, not a hard shell.
