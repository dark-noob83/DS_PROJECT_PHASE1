Full Definition of EFFICIENCY. 1. : the quality or degree of being efficient. 2. a: efficient operation b (1) : effective operation as measured by a comparison of production with cost (as in energy, time, and money) (2) : the ratio of the useful energy delivered by a dynamic system to the energy supplied to it. 3.
A level of performance that describes a process that uses the lowest amount of inputs to create the greatest amount of outputs. Efficiency relates to the use of all inputs in producing any given output, including personal time and energy. Next Up.
BREAKING DOWN 'Efficiency'. Efficiency is an important attribute because all inputs are scarce. Time, money and raw materials are limited, so it makes sense to try to conserve them while maintaining an acceptable level of output or a general production level.
Person A interprets the sign as the true definition of energy efficiency. To Person A, the elevator is not being used. He is still getting to where he wants to go and using less energy in doing so. Person B considers the fact that she is not getting to where she is going with the same ease.

DEFINITION of 'Economic Efficiency'. A broad term that implies an economic state in which every resource is optimally allocated to serve each person in the best way while minimizing waste and inefficiency. When an economy is economically efficient, any changes made to assist one person would harm another.
