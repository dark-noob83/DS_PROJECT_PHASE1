The UN said displacement in Somalia was worse than in Iraq More people have been displaced in Somalia in the past two months than anywhere else in the world, the United Nations has said. 'Charged for shade' Ms Bunker said displacements in Somali had topped those in Iraq, Darfur and Sri Lanka.

In 1990 there were refugee camps in four of Somalia's sixteen regions, or administrative districts. The number of persons in these camps ranged from under 3,000 to more than 70,000, but most held 35,000 to 45,000 refugees. According to a government document, the camps in Gedo held a total of more than 450,000 persons, in Hiiraan more than 375,000, in Woqooyi Galbeed well over 400,000, and in Shabeellaha Hoose nearly 70,000. The burden of the refugee influx on Somalia was heavy.
It grew out of resistance to the Siad Barre regime during the 1980s. By 1988â€“90, the Somali Armed Forces began engaging various armed rebel groups, including the Somali Salvation Democratic Front in the northeast, the Somali National Movement in the northwest, and the United Somali Congress in the south. The Federal Government of Somalia was later established in August 2012, constituting the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war.
Nearly 960,000 of the total were ethnic Somalis. Somalia hosted 600,000 refugees, of whom nearly 80 percent were ethnic Somalis from Harerge, Ogaden, Bale, and Borena regions. The remaining 20 percent were Oromo, the largest ethnic group in the Horn of Africa, from Harerge, Bale, and Borena regions. According to a government document, the camps in Gedo held a total of more than 450,000 persons, in Hiiraan more than 375,000, in Woqooyi Galbeed well over 400,000, and in Shabeellaha Hoose nearly 70,000. The burden of the refugee influx on Somalia was heavy.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was established by the UN General Assembly on December 14, 1950, and began work in Geneva, Switzerland, a fortnight later on January 1, 1951. 
Most refugees were ethnic Somalis, but there were also many Oromo, an ethnic group that resided primarily in Ethiopia. The Somali government appealed for help to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in September 1979, but UNHCR did not initiate requests for international aid until March 1980. In its first public appeal to the UN, the Somali government estimated 310,000 in the camps in September 1979. According to a government document, the camps in Gedo held a total of more than 450,000 persons, in Hiiraan more than 375,000, in Woqooyi Galbeed well over 400,000, and in Shabeellaha Hoose nearly 70,000. The burden of the refugee influx on Somalia was heavy.
While Somali refugees in Ethiopia have been listed by the EU as a common resettlement priority for 2013, Somali refugees in Kenya have not. Most Somali refugees are resettled to the US, Canada and Australia. In Europe, particularly, Norway, Sweden and the UK have received Somali refugees. Source: ICMC Europe, Welcome to Europe! A comprehensive guide to resettlement, 2013. Kenya and Ethiopia currently host 492,046 and 240,086 Somali refugees, respectively.
