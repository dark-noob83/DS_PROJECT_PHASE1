Hey reader2. I had my Prolia in my Rheumy's office pre filled syringe and sub-q injection, Medicare and my AARP supplement picked up the cost. But you could call Amgen and see if they have financial aid for Prolia. I am not aware of it, but it is a free 800 number: 8007726436

Cost could be seen as an obstacle for patients considering Prolia as a treatment option. While generic Fosamax costs roughly $100 to $200 per year and brand-name bisphosphonates slightly less than $1,000 per year, Prolia will cost about $1,650 per year plus the cost associated with an office visit. Prolia is also more expensive than Reclast, which costs $1,100 for a yearly dose. But Siris notes that Prolia will be covered under Medicare Part B, so the cost will likely be covered by the healthcare system rather than by many patients receiving this treatment.

Healthcare providers involved in the fight against osteoporosis now have one more weapon in their arsenal, as the FDA recently approved the sale of Prolia (denosumab), a twice-yearly injection indicated for postmenopausal women.
Prolia™ may be a good option for patients who have had side effects or concerns about side effects from bisphosphonates. The cost of Prolia™ is approximately $900 per dose; this includes the cost of the drug and the injection. 
June 2, 2010 -- The FDA has approved twice-a-year Prolia (denosumab) injections to treat osteoporosis in patients at high risk of fracture.

It's wholesale cost is $825 per injection or $1,650 per year. The drug will be available as early as next week
Hi bjosmith...I have no idea what your insurance would cover on these meds, but the retail cost of Prolia was $825.00 per injection & Forteo is up to $1,300.00 a month. Hope knowing this might help in some way.
