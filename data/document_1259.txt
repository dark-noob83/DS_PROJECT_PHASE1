The ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) is the ligament that holds the femur and the tibia together from the front of the knee. It is most commonly torn on the back leg but can be torn on any leg. If your dog tore his ACL suddenly, it most likely happened during play or excited activity. The most common symptom of a torn ACL is sudden lameness in the injured leg. Your dog will not want to put pressure on the leg at all, causing obvious limping and reluctance to participate in activities that your dog used to enjoy.
Dog Torn ACL Symptoms. Acute injuries occur due to sudden accidents and trauma to the dog’s leg. The dog torn ACL symptoms for an acute injury are usually more severe than those exhibited by dogs that have chronic injuries. In the chronic condition, the dog’s injury builds up slowly due to overuse and stress on the ligament. There is no specific breed that is more prone to developing a dog torn ACL. This injury could happen to any dog, at any age. However large dogs, that are more athletic, usually experience more number of injuries. Even young athletic dogs that receive a lot of exercise and dog training may develop a torn ACL.
The other easily recognized symptom is a swollen knee, which will appear large but will cause your dog pain to the touch. In small dogs, a luxating patella may lead to a torn ACL. These symptoms include sudden pain in your dog as his knee becomes popped out of joint. This is often short-lived as your dog will pop the knee back in place and often appear fine after a few hours. The most common symptom of a torn ACL is sudden lameness in the injured leg. Your dog will not want to put pressure on the leg at all, causing obvious limping and reluctance to participate in activities that your dog used to enjoy.
A tear or rupture leads to joint swelling, pain and instability in the knee joint. If left untreated it will cause lameness in the affected rear leg and, ultimately, chronic irreversible degenerative joint changes. Damage to the ACL is a major cause of progressive osteoarthritis in the knee joint of dogs. Nearly all dogs with tearing or damage to their cruciate ligament will have swelling that is felt on the front part of their knee. Symptoms may include: 1  Lameness or weakness in one or both hind legs. 2  Limping or reluctance to use one or both hind legs. 3  Limping worsens with exercise and improves with rest.
Damage to the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) is the most common cause of canine hind limb lameness and is a major cause of degenerative joint disease in the stifle (knee) joint of companion dogs. The cranial cruciate ligament is critical to stabilizing a dog’s stifle, which is the equivalent of the human knee. The outward signs of cruciate damage depend upon the severity of the injury, which can range from a partial tear to a complete rupture of the affected ligament. Without surgical correction and appropriate post-operative management, the effects of CCL injuries can progress and become permanent.
Dog torn ACL is a common condition owing to the many injuries that dogs experience. Whether it is a large or a small breed dog, any of them could experience this injury. A lot of people feel that dog torn ACL is common among those dogs that receive very little exercise. There is no specific breed that is more prone to developing a dog torn ACL. This injury could happen to any dog, at any age. However large dogs, that are more athletic, usually experience more number of injuries. Even young athletic dogs that receive a lot of exercise and dog training may develop a torn ACL.
Symptoms. Symptoms of a severe and sudden (acute) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury include: 1  Feeling or hearing a pop in the knee at the time of injury. 2  Sudden instability in the knee. 3  Pain on the outside and back of the knee. 4  Knee swelling within the first few hours of the injury. 5  Limited knee movement because of swelling and/or pain. Other health problems can cause symptoms like those of an ACL injury. They include a bone break or injuries to the knee cushions (menisci) or to other ligaments in the knee.

In this article. If your dog goes lame in one of his hind legs, he may have torn or ruptured his cranial cruciate ligament, or CCL – similar to the ACL in humans. This ligament connects the back of the femur (the bone above the knee) with the front of the tibia (the bone below the knee). CCL injuries in dogs are one of the most commonly seen orthopedic problems. Depending on the severity of the CCL injury, a dog’s symptoms might range from having a hint of lameness to being unable to bear weight on the injured leg. A dog with an CCL injury may also have swelling on the inside of the knee.
There are many different causes for a torn ACL injury. A torn cruciate ligament is the most common cause of a torn ACL ligament. A common injury among athletes, the cruciate ligament injuries may also occur in dogs. There is no specific breed that is more prone to developing a dog torn ACL. This injury could happen to any dog, at any age. However large dogs, that are more athletic, usually experience more number of injuries. Even young athletic dogs that receive a lot of exercise and dog training may develop a torn ACL.
Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the most common orthopedic injuries veterinarians see in dogs. The ligament is also known as the Cranial Cruciate Ligament (CCL) in animals. It connects the bone above the knee (the femur) with the bone below the knee (the tibia). Nearly all dogs with tearing or damage to their cruciate ligament will have swelling that is felt on the front part of their knee. Symptoms may include: 1  Lameness or weakness in one or both hind legs. 2  Limping or reluctance to use one or both hind legs. 3  Limping worsens with exercise and improves with rest.
