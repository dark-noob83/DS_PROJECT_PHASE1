The system includes lamellae, osteocytes, lacunae, canaliculi and a haversian canal. Lamellae are the thin layers that compile and eventually form bone. They contain collagen fibers that are arranged in a parallel array. Lamellae also contain a small amount of proteoglycans in addition to collagen.
A haversian canal is a central canal within the haversian system — a network of canals inside compact bone.
Haversian canals (sometimes canals of Havers, named after British physician Clopton Havers) are a series of microscopic tubes in the outermost region of bone called cortical bone that allow blood vessels and nerves to travel through them. Each haversian canal generally contains one or two capillaries and nerve fibres.
