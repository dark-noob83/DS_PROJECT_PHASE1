CBD-177. Originally published May 1976. Tower silos, tall, bullet-shaped farm structures, are used to store forage crops for feeding cattle. The first tower silos, constructed about 40 years ago, were small, predominantly wooden structures although a few were made of concrete.
The strength parameter Î± can be obtained from a. Anisotropic damage modeling of concrete subjected to freeze-thaw process Ashkan Saboori International Journal of Civil and Structural Engineering Volume 5 Issue 1 2014 47monotonic biaxial strength test. To obtain parameters B and C, uniaxial and biaxial strength tests after a set number of CFT are required.
In order to study the light guiding property of translucent concrete, six units of translucent concrete is fabricated with different POF volume ratios of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and 6%, and the diameters of POF is 1mm. The transmittance is measured by the Optical Power Meter and its wavelength range is 400-1100nm.

Each lamina is an anisotropic layer with properties varyingas a function of fiber angle. Loading along the fibers (longitudinal) is modeled as Isostrain while loadingperpendicular to the fibers (transverse) is modeled as Isostress; these two directions generally represent theextremes in material behavior.
