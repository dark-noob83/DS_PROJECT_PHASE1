In 2004 the holding company activated Republic Airline in reaction to a pilots' suit against American Airlines. American had awarded the flying of 44-seat regional jets to Chautauqua Airlines, then the main operating subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings.
Republic Airways Holdings, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, is an airline holding company that owns Republic Airlines and Shuttle America. Our business strategy was developed by our experienced team of senior airline executives.
Republic does not fly any aircraft. All the Embraer 170's are flow by Shuttle America as of a few weeks ago. Its is Republic that flies the ERJ-170s for USEx. The shuttle america sub. of Republic only flies Saab 340s out of IAD. Incorrect..... Shuttle America is now flying the Embraer 170's.
Since they're headquartered here in Indy, and I know that they're Republic Airlines, and they have the RPA identifier I am constantly catching myself starting to call them Republic every time I key up to say something to one of them, then I stop myself in midsentence and change it to Brickyard.
Republic Airlines is an Indianapolis, Indiana based carrier that flies routes as American Eagle, US Airways Express, and United Express. The airline takes its call sign from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the Indy 500 race.
Republic Airlines does in fact operate the 170 for US Airways using the callsign Brickyard.. Republic Airways Holdings is the holding company for Republic Airlines, Shuttle America, and Chautauqua Airlines. Shuttle America does operate the 170, but only for United and Delta.
To repair the situation, Republic Airways Holdings activated Republic Airline, and upon Part 121 certification in 2005 allowing Republic Airlines to operate commercial service. Republic Airways Holdings then transferred the offending 70-seat regional jets from Chautauqua to Republic Airlines.
