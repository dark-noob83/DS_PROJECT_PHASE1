Nominal is the theoretical value, as compared with the actual value. Your .750 diameter shaft will likely never be exactly .750... perhaps a bit more, perhaps less, but seldom exactly on nominal. Nominal is what the engineer uses during the first phase of a design.
nominal diameter. A designation used to specify the size of a pipe, bolt, rivet, reinforcing steel bar, or rod, not necessarily equal to the exact diameter.
DEFINITION of 'Nominal'. An unadjusted rate, value or change in value. This type of measure often reflects the current situation, such as the current price of a car, and doesn't make adjustments to reflect factors such as seasonality or inflation, which provide a more accurate measure in real terms.
DN = Diameter Nominal. The term Diameter Nominal refers to the internal diameter of a pipe. Together with the nominal pressure rating and the materials class, all dimensions of a piping line, e. g. flange dimensions, are defined by indicating the nominal diameter. Steel is often not specified, but assumed as material.
1 Answer. 0. The nominal diameter (DN), also known as nominal bore, refers to the internal diameter of a cylindrical body, e.g. the internal diameter at the flange of a desiccator. In such cases the stated size is only an approximate figure and the actual internal diameter is normally bigger.
Diameter nominal (DN) is used in the metric unit system. It indicates standard pipe size when followed by the specific size designation number without a millimeter symbol. For example, DN 80 is the equivalent designation of NPS 3. Below a table with equivalents for NPS and DN pipe sizes.
