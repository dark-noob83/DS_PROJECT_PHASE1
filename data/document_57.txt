In terms of price and taste, there is a premium price to be paid on most capsule systems, and we consider the flavour of coffee produced from an ESE pod to be far better. Coffee pods are freshly roasted coffee, ground perfect, tampered to the correct pressure and then encapsulated in a paper. Pods are made to a standard size of 44mm with 6.8g - 7.5g of coffee per pod, as well as the 62mm coffee pod with 8g of coffee used in the Phillips Senseo coffee maker.
That's it. Water is forced through the pod to make coffee, and you usually just use each pod once. These simple pods that are not machine-specific can be used with the Senseo machines as well as Melitta, Bunn and one of the Krups models. These are the ones that are actually labeled as pods. There are other makes of coffee machines that are designed to use their own specific format of coffee for their machines. Each kind has it's own name (Nespresso uses capsules, Keurig uses K-cups, Tassimo uses T-discs) but many people just group them all together as coffee pods along with the Senseo types.
