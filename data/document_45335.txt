Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, are a class of drugs that works by blocking the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine from binding to receptors. There are three known types of beta receptors, known as beta 1 (β 1), beta 2 (β 2) and beta 3 (β 3).

Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, are medications that reduce your blood pressure. Beta blockers work by blocking the effects of the hormone epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. When you take beta blockers, the heart beats more slowly and with less force, thereby reducing
Introduction. Beta-blockers, also known as beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, are medications used to treat conditions such as angina, heart failure and high blood pressure. They decrease the activity of the heart by blocking the action of hormones like adrenaline.
A. A. A. Beta-blockers are drugs used to treat high blood pressure. They block the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart. This reduces the work of the heart so that it requires less blood and oxygen. As a result, the heart doesn't have to work as hard, which in turn lowers
