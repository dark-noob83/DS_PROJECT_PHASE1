In particle physics, a kaon /ˈkeɪ.ɒn/ , also called a K meson and denoted K, is any of a group of four mesons distinguished by a quantum number called strangeness. It is clear from the quark model assignments that the kaons form two doublets of isospin; that is, they belong to the fundamental representation of SU(2) called the 2. One doublet of strangeness +1 contains the K+ and the K0.
A K + made of one up quark (u) and one strange antiquark (s with a line over it). Kaons are a specific type of meson (mesons are particles made of one quark and one antiquark). What makes kaons unique is that they are made of one up quark or down quark, and one strange quark. (One of the two quarks that make of a kaon must be an antiquark, and the other must be normal matter. The K + is made of one up quark, and one strange antiquark. Since antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart (and since normal strange quarks have a charge of -1/3), 2/3 + 1/3 = a +1 charge, or simply a + charge.
The &#960+ is considered to be made up of an up and an anti-down quark. The neutral pion is considered to be a combination Pions interact with nuclei and transform a neutron to a proton or vice versa: The pions &#960+ and &#960- have spin zero and negative intrinsic parity (Rohlf Sec 17-2).

There are two versions of this particle with the same mass but different decay lifetimes! One is called K-zero-short The other is called K-zero-long. These two particles are considered to be combinations of down-antistrange and antidown-strange quarks. These particles decay into pions by The quark mixing which leads to these combinations involves the exchange of two W bosons. One is called K-zero-short. The other is called K-zero-long. The quark mixing which leads to these combinations involves the exchange of two W bosons. The neutral kaons are important historically for their part in advancing our understanding of quark processes.
The neutral pion π0 is a combination of an up quark with an anti-up quark or a down quark with an anti-down quark. The two combinations have identical quantum numbers, and hence they are only found in superpositions. The lowest-energy superposition of these is the π0, which is its own antiparticle. Together, the pions form a triplet of isospin. Each pion has isospin (I = 1) and third-component isospin equal to its charge (I z = +1, 0 or −1). The π± mesons have a mass of 7002139600000000000♠139.6 MeV/c2 and a mean lifetime of 6992260000000000000♠2.6×10−8 s. They decay due to the weak interaction. The primary decay mode of a pion, with probability 0.999877, is a purely leptonic decay into an anti-muon and a muon neutrino :
&#960+e-&#957e. 1* The neutral Kaons K 0 s and K 0 L represent symmetric and antisymmetric mixtures of the quark combinations down-antistrange and antidown-strange. The charged kaons are mesons which have a quark composition of up-antistrange for the positive kaon and antiup-strange for the negative kaon. One is called K-zero-short. The other is called K-zero-long. The quark mixing which leads to these combinations involves the exchange of two W bosons. The neutral kaons are important historically for their part in advancing our understanding of quark processes.
In the quark model they are understood to be bound states of a strange quark (or antiquark) and an up or down antiquark (or quark). Kaons have proved to be a copious source of information on the nature of fundamental interactions since their discovery in cosmic rays in 1947. It is clear from the quark model assignments that the kaons form two doublets of isospin; that is, they belong to the fundamental representation of SU(2) called the 2. One doublet of strangeness +1 contains the K+ and the K0.
1 K+ (antiparticle of above) positively charged (containing an up quark and a strange antiquark) must (by CPT invariance) have mass and lifetime equal to that of K− . 2  The mass difference is 6985512696475839999♠0.032±0.090 MeV, consistent with zero. 3  The difference in lifetime is 6991110000000000000♠(0.11±0.09)×10−8 s. It is clear from the quark model assignments that the kaons form two doublets of isospin; that is, they belong to the fundamental representation of SU(2) called the 2. One doublet of strangeness +1 contains the K+ and the K0.
Weak interactions: The strange antiquark (s) of the kaon transmutes into an up antiquark (u) by the emission of a W+ boson; the W+ boson subsequently decays into a down antiquark (d) and an up quark (u). It is clear from the quark model assignments that the kaons form two doublets of isospin; that is, they belong to the fundamental representation of SU(2) called the 2.
