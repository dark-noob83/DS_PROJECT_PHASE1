III Oculomotor nerve. Fibers run from the mid-brain to the eye. Supplies motor fibers to four of the six muscles that direct the eyeball, to the eyelid, and to the internal eye muscles controlling lens shape and pupil size.
The Trigeminal Nerve. Section of the trigeminal nerve will eliminate somatosensory sensation from the face and the eye blink reflex (e.g., with section of the left trigeminal nerve, light touch of the left cornea will not produce an eye blink in the left or right eye).
cranial nerve VI function. abducens nerve, a somatic motor nerve that innervates of one the six muscles responsible for moving the eyeball. the abducens muscle contracts the lateral rectus muscle and causes abduction of the eye.
Eye movements are controlled by muscles innervated by cranial nerves III, IV and VI. In this chapter, the testing of these cranial nerves will be discussed. The most common symptom of damage to these nerves is double vision.
cranial nerve V function. trigeminal nerve, has both sensory and motor components. it is the main sensory nerve to the head, relaying sensation of touch, pain, and temperature. - alpha motor neurons innervate and control muscles required for mastication.
The iris, visible through the clear cornea as the colored disc inside of the eye, is a thin diaphragm composed mostly of connective tissue and smooth muscle fibers. It is situated between the cornea and the crystalline lens. The. texture, and patterns of each person s iris are as unique as a fingerprint.
adjust the size of the pupil and the shape of the lens of the eye. extend to the upper eye-lid and the extrinsic muscles that turn the eyeball in different directions, (incl. the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles). 4.
