According to the survey, the average cost to prepare an itemized Form 1040 with a Schedule A (for itemized deductions) and a state tax return is $246. The average rate for a return without itemized deductions is lower: $143.
I just ran across a bit of interesting information on the cost of tax preparation from the National Society of Accountants. According to their biennial survey, the average tax prep fee for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A plus a state tax return is $229. For a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions, the average price drops to $129. Update: Be sure to check out this recent post from GetRichSlowly with tons of additional data on tax preparation costs for 2012.
Our fees are generally form-based. For example, if your tax return includes Form 1040, Schedule A, and Oregon Form 40, we would charge a fixed price for each these forms. For the 2015 filing season our fee for Form 1040 is $195, Schedule A is $56 and Oregon 40 is $45 for a total preparation fee of $296.
The survey also reported the average fees for preparing other Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax forms, including: 1  $152 for a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions. 2  $261 for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A. 3  $218 for a Form 1040 Schedule C (business).
Fees for non-itemized returns are also low â€“ the average cost to prepare a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions is only $152. Fee information was collected in a survey of tax preparers conducted by NSA.
The overall average across the U.S., however, is that taxpayers using a professional to prepare and file their 2013 tax return can expect to pay an average of $261 for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and one state tax return, according to the survey.
The National Association of Tax Professionals in their 2014 study found that average tax preparation fees ranged from $142 for a Form 1040 personal tax return to $566 for a Form 1120 corporate tax return.
