Neurons & the Nervous System. The human nervous system consists of billions of nerve cells (or neurons)plus supporting (neuroglial) cells. Neurons are able to respond to stimuli (such as touch, sound, light, and so on), conduct impulses, and communicate with each other (and with other types of cells like muscle cells). The nucleus of a neuron is located in the cell body. Extending out from the cell body are processes called dendrites and axons.
Motor Units. Nerve cells called motor neurons control the skeletal muscles. Each motor neuron controls several muscle cells in a group known as a motor unit. When a motor neuron receives a signal from the brain, it stimulates all of the muscles cells in its motor unit at the same time.
Neuromuscular Junction Skeletal muscle cells contract as a result of impulses from motor neurons. The place where a motor neuron stimulates a muscle cell is called a neuromuscular junction. In order for skeletal muscle cells to contract each cell must be stimulated by a process of a motor neuron.
The Neuron. The neuron, a nerve cell, is the functional unit of the nervous system that carries the impulse (the message) to the appropriate part of the nervous system or interprets the impulse and allows a response. There are three types of neurons and each has different functions.
Skeletal muscles are stimulated by nerve impulses which relay, beginning with sensory neurons at the site of excitation and ending with the motor neuron appropriate to the muscle being used.
