Arepas is one the most typical foods in Venezuela. Arepas are made of corn flour and they are like bread in other countries. You can eat them anytime, everywhere and with whatever you want. Arepas are typically stuffed with different kinds of fillings like in a sandwich.
Although arepas can be found in Colombia, Panama, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and the Canary Islands, Quiero Arepas® makes traditional Venezuelan style arepas with varied influences. Guasacaca sauce is one of the most popular choices to season your arepa and comes standard on many of Quiero Arepas® menu items.
Arepas are griddle-fried corncakes made from a special kind of precooked corn flour called masarepa. Arepas are enjoyed in Colombia and Venezuela, although Venezuelan arepas tend to be thicker and are often stuffed with meat and other things to make different kinds of arepa sandwiches, such as the famous reina pepiada. Arepas are excellent with any meal, but are especially good for breakfast.

Arepa styles in Venezuela vary by region.
Cook. The way we make traditional Venezuelan arepas in our house. Every Venezuelan family has their own way of making it. You can skip the griddle/oven steps if you have a Tostiarepa (think panini press for arepas) but since my husband thinks it's sacrilegious, we do it this way.
