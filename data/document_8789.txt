Exclusions. The entire $50,000 you give isn't vulnerable to taxation. The IRS allows exclusions, a dollar limit you can give away tax-free.

If you have $124,000 of reportable income and you give me and my wife $12,000 each you still have $124,000 of reportable income.

You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax. But if you give your daughter $10,000 in December and wait to hand over the other $10,000 until January 1, both gifts are tax-free

If you do, the gift would go toward reducing your lifetime gift exclusion of $5.34 million, which the IRS raised for 2014 from $5.25 million this year. Once a person’s lifetime exclusion is exceeded, a gift tax of up to 40 percent will apply to you or your heirs.
