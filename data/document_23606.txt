Whats needed to be competitive since it appears that most of the positions are private sector jobs. Thanks I just landed a Contract Investigator Position with OPM about 3 months ago. I am an Independent Contractor for a company that is contracted with OPM. I do this as a side gig, second job. I am a State Criminal Investigator full time. It is a sweet RETIREMENT job. There is talk that OPM is hiring approximately 200-400 new employees over the next 1-2 years with most of those positions being investigator positions. I know D.C. is shorthanded and would expect a large number of these positions to be in that area.
