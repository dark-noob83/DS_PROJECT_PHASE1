Weekly average sea surface temperature for the World Ocean during the first week of February 2011, during a period of La Nina. niña The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
Sea surface temperature—the average temperature of water at the surface of the global ocean—is a key indicator of the ocean's staus. Because the ocean is constantly interacting with the atmosphere, changes in sea surface temperature can have profound effects on other aspects of Earth's climate. From 2011-2012, as a weak La Nina niña transitioned to more neutral, conditions average sea surface temperature for the global ocean warmed by about.0 1º. celsius
Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface. Sea surface temperatures influence weather, including hurricanes, as well as plant and animal life in the ocean. Like Earth's land surface, sea surface temperatures are warmer near the equator and colder near the poles. Warm ocean waters help form clouds and affect weather patterns. The sea's surface temperature also affects life in the ocean by influencing where and when tiny ocean plants (called phytoplankton) will grow. For all of these reasons scientists monitor the sea's surface temperature.
From 1970-1999, global sea surface temperature rose at an average rate of 0.06 to 0.11º Celsius per decade. The rate decreased from 2000-2012 due to a prevalence of La Nina-niña like. conditions From 2011-2012, as a weak La Nina niña transitioned to more neutral, conditions average sea surface temperature for the global ocean warmed by about.0 1º. celsius
Sea surface temperature increased over the 20th century and continues to rise. From 1901 through 2012, temperatures rose at an average rate of 0.13°F per decade. Sea surface temperatures have been higher during the past three decades than at any other time since reliable observations began in 1880. The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
1 * Sea temperatures range from 16°C/61°F to 23°C/74°F. * 2  Average number of sunshine days ranges from 95 hours per month during the winter in the Black Sea Coast Region to 375 hours per month in the Aegean, Mediterranean and Central Anatolia Regions. 1 * Average low temperature is 15°C/59°F. * 2  Average high temperature is 24°C/75°F. * 3  Average rainfall is 412 mm/16 inches per year. * 4  Sea temperatures range from 19°C/66°F to 24°C/75°F. * 5  Average number of sunshine hours ranges from 7 to 11 hours per day.
Sea surface temperature in 2012 compared to the 1981-2010 average, based on data from NOAA National Climatic Data Center. The dark red and blue areas reveal areas of the global ocean that were up to 7º Fahrenheit warmer or cooler than average. From 2011-2012, as a weak La Nina niña transitioned to more neutral, conditions average sea surface temperature for the global ocean warmed by about.0 1º. celsius
This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures. The 10 warmest years in the 134-year record all have occurred since 2000, with the exception of 1998. The year 2014 ranks as the warmest on record. (Source: NASA/GISS). 0.68 °C. 
Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface. The average sea surface temperatures over a long period of time are called a sea surface temperature climatology.. An area's climatology acts a baseline for deciding whether and how much the climate is changing. To make a climatology data set, you average measurements collected over a long period of time. 
Sea surface temperature (SST) is the water temperature close to the ocean 's surface. The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between 1 millimetre (0.04 in) and 20 metres (70 ft) below the sea surface. Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore. The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per 10 metres (33 ft), which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June.
