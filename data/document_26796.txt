RE: How much do commercial real estate brokers/agents make per year? working for a big firm they say many agents make six figures plus in a few years, is this accurate?

Answer There's a huge variation in income among Real Estate agents, because earnings are based entirely on how much you sell. Some agents who advertise heavily earn well above $100,000 year after year, while some full-time agents earn as little as $12,500 per year. The median annual earnings of salaried real estate agents in the U.S., according to the Department of Labor was $30,930 in 2002. This is including commissions. Median annual earnings of salaried real estate brokers, including commission, was $50,330 in 2002
