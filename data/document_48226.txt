If you decide to delete lots of your images with Canon’s erase options, you can protect any image to prevent accidental deletion. Note: This also protects the image in Canon’s image-editing software. This option, however, doesn't protect the image when you format the card.

Well almost. Your EOS 6D is a Wi-Fi device. When you enable Wi-Fi with your EOS 6D, you can connect to an existing Wi-Fi network, transfer images to another EOS 6D, control your camera wirelessly with the EOS Utility, upload images to Canon Gateway, and more. To enable wireless on your EOS 6D: Press the Menu button.
