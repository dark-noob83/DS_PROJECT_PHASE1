E-Liquids are made in the United States using only USP Kosher ingredients. Bootleg Vapors follows something called Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) by the FDA which affects manufacturing, packaging, and labeling procedure. A lot of people like to make their own e-liquid, like would-be bartenders mixing drinks in the belief they can replicate or even surpass the efforts of local mixologists. Sometimes they can, and if you think you are among their number, Bootleg Vapors sells DIY supplies.
I have to say, my first impression is that Bootleg Vapor's Beetle e-juice is light, refreshing and very pleasant. It's definitely sweet and fruity. Don't let the product's photo fool you, I don't think there is any lemon or lime flavoring in this juice. Taking a peek at the product description it appears that Beetle Juice is a raspberry, mango, pineapple and strawberry blend. The pineapple is the predominate flavor in my opinion. But then again, it seems to change depending upon which part of my tongue it hits first. Sometimes the berries predominate.
Beetle Juice doesn't seem to produce the same amount of vapor as some of Bootleg's other juices. And I am not getting much in the way of a throat hit but that is to be expected as I ordered the zero mg version.

I am making in exception in this case. I have a baggie full of Bootleg Vapor 420 juice. It was their 420 line which attracted me to their site in the first place. I was curious about 420 e-liquids. I wanted to know if they really taste like the real thing. I think all of Bootleg's 420 e-liquids have a little tobacco in them, but in this case it is the predominant flavor. Think of Raspberry Kush as tobacco laced with marijuana with a raspberry twist. Raspberry Kush is a cannabis strain that has a raspberry and cream-like aroma.

By Alexandra D’Ambrosio. The name for Bootleg Vapors is derived from the history of Nascar. Since the team is comprised of car racing fans, their choice of title seemed only natural. Moreover, prices are so low at Bootleg Vapors you might wonder if their stock really did fall off the back of a truck. A lot of people like to make their own e-liquid, like would-be bartenders mixing drinks in the belief they can replicate or even surpass the efforts of local mixologists.
