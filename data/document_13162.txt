Peanuts and tree nuts can cause allergic reactions, which are sometimes severe. A severe reaction to nuts is called anaphylaxis and can be life-threatening. Symptoms often start quickly, within an hour of coming into contact with a nut, and sometimes within minutes. The body's immune system normally fights infection, but when a person is allergic to tree nuts or peanuts, the immune system overreacts to proteins in these foods. Every time the person eats or, in some cases, handles or breathes in a peanut or tree nut, the body thinks the proteins are harmful invaders. The immune system responds by kicking into high gear to fend off the 'invader'. This causes an allergic reaction and symptoms can include: 1  Trouble breathing. 2  Vomiting. 3  Diarrhoea.
