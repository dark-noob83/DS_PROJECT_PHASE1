It takes 20 sec. for a person to drown. Depending on what kind of victim you are. It takes 20 to 60 sec. for a active victim to become submerged. Hear are the kinds of victims and their breathing arm and leg action, body position, and locomotion.
How long do you think it takes a person to drown? A couple of minutes? What if you can hold your breath -- longer? The answer might surprise you... Swimming in weirs or fast flowing water can be deadly. Don't get sucked in -- RETHINK IT!
Assuming a normally fit person, otherwise conscious and uninjured, who is drowning in warm (21C/70F) water, I would estimate 2-3 minutes before full loss of consciousness, and 5-10 minutes before brain damage, and 15 minutes before irrecoverable death.
The person should pass out in 6 - 20 seconds. Depending on the person, irreversable brain damage will begin somewhere around 4 to 6 minutes. At 7 minutes, the brain will be dead but the drowning person missed it all as they passed out at 6 - 20 seconds. It still scares me to death ... well, not to death, but a lot.
The average person can last three minutes without air before they die. However I'm not sure how long it takes somebody to become unconscious. However if the drowning person is an athlete, swimmer or has developed larger that average lungs then it will take longer. The women's world record holder for free diving can hold her breath for six minutes without passing out.
