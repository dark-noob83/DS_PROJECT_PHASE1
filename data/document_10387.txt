Hematocrit (Hct) Levels. This is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood. Normal range for hematocrit is different between the sexes and is approximately 45% to 52% for men and 37% to 48% for women. This is usually measured by spinning down a sample of blood in a test tube, which causes the red blood cells to pack at the bottom of the tube.
Hematocrit is a blood test that measures the percentage of the volume of whole blood that is made up of red blood cells. This measurement depends on the number of red blood cells and the size
Normal values for the hematocrit test vary according to age, sex, pregnancy, altitude where people live, and even vary slightly between various testing methods. The following are reported ranges of normal hematocrit levels: 1  Newborns: 55%-68%. 2  One (1) week of age: 47%-65%. 3  One (1) month of age: 37%-49%.
The hematocrit is the proportion, by volume, of the blood that consists of red blood cells. The hematocrit (hct) is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.
The normal ranges for hematocrit are depend on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 55% to 68%. 2  One (1) week of age: 47% to 65%. 3  One (1) month of age: 37% to 49%. 4  Three (3) months of age: 30% to 36%. 5  One (1) year of age: 29% to 41%. 6  Ten (10) years of age: 36% to 40%.
