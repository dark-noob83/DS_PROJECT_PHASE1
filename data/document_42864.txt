Submitted by sheba74911. Turkey can be stored in the freezer (unopened and uninterrupted) for up to 2-3 years and still be safe to cook. However, for the best quality, we recommend using the frozen turkey within 7 months of storage. Answered by Butterball-Turkey-Talk-Line-Expert.
If you’re defrosting the turkey in the fridge, you can safely keep it refrigerated for an additional one or two days after it’s fully thawed, says the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
As a general rule, you can keep your Frozen Butterball Turkey in the freezer in its original packaging for up to 2 years and it should still be of good quality. Turkeys kept in commercial freezers, like those at grocery stores, may be kept even longer.
Chemical changes-such as rancidity-can also occur over time in the freezer, making the meat inedible. So the turkey could keep well for longer than 6 months or even a year, but there is no point to hanging onto it that long. Alternatively, look on the plastic bag the turkey came in and it will tell you.
