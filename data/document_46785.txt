well corals are animals however corals make a calcium carbonate skeleton that looks similar to a rock and have a symbiotic relationship with plant like cells called zooxanthellae hard corals are often called the reef builders because their skeletons provide support for other corals and other organisms soft corals do not build calcium carbonate skeletons instead they have spines that support them they are not considered reef builders
coral polyps are tiny soft bodied organisms related to sea anemones and jellyfish at their base is a hard protective limestone skeleton called a calicle which forms the structure of coral reefs reefs begin when a polyp attaches itself to a rock on the sea floor then divides or buds into thousands of clones 
corals are invertebrate animals belonging to a large group of colourful and fascinating animals called cnidaria other animals in this group that you may have seen in rock pools or on the beach include jelly fish and sea anemones there are around 800 known species of hard coral also known as the reef building corals soft corals which include seas fans sea feathers and sea whips don t have the rock like calcareous skeleton like the others instead they grow wood like cores for support and fleshy rinds for protection
but there are two types of corals soft corals and hard corals sea plumes are soft corals brain corals are hard corals soft corals called soft corals because they do not have hard rigid permanent skeletons this group is made up of the gorgonians and the black corals gorgonian colonies are attached to a hard surface by a single anchor at the base of a stem this stem is like a tree trunk
when corals are mentioned most people immediately think about clear warm tropical seas and fish filled reefs in fact the stony shallow water corals the kind that build reefs are only one type of coral there are also soft corals and deep water corals that live in dark cold waters almost all corals are colonial organisms this means that they are composed of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of individual animals called polyps barnes r d 1987 lalli and parsons 1995 each polyp has a stomach that opens at only one end this opening called the mouth is surrounded by a circle of tentacle

background there are hundreds of coral species found in the world s oceans there are two types of corals hard or stony corals and soft corals such as sea fans and gorgonians only hard corals build reefs while the majority of coral reefs are found in tropical and sub tropical water within the latitudes of 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south there are also deep water corals in colder regions
coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients most coral reefs are built from stony corals which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups the polyps belong to a group of animals known as cnidaria which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish
