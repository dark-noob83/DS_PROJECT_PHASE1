Your muscles require more energy when they are active during exercise. Muscles in your body metabolise glucose (sugar) in your bloodstream, breaking it down and taking it in to generate a high energy molecule known as ATP, which is essential for a cells functioning.

The primary responsibility of the increased blood flow is to supply the working muscles with oxygen and nutrients such as sugar and fats to create energy. Your body utilizes oxygen to help extract energy from carbohydrates and fat. When oxygen is present in enough quantities, you don't produce as much lactic acid.
The Skeletal Muscle System. Skeletal muscles are the muscles found in your legs and arms and throughout the body. The skeletal system is different from the smooth muscle system in organs like your liver and the cardiac muscle in your heart because the skeletal muscles contract voluntarily.
Oxygen is supplied to the muscles via red blood cells. Red blood cells carry hemoglobin which oxygen bonds with as the hemoglobin rich blood cells pass through the blood vessels of the lungs. The now oxygen rich blood cells carry that oxygen to the cells that are demanding it, in this case skeletal muscle cells.
The increase in skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise probably results from a coordinated increase in rates of glucose delivery (higher capillary perfusion), surface membrane transport, and intracellular substrate flux through glycolysis.
