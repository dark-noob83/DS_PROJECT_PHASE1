Several university and economic studies have used 2010 census data of median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers age 25-64. The data, released in 2011, found that non-high school graduates made $25,705; high school graduates, $35,035; and college graduates with a bachelor’s degree, $55,864. Multiplying those weekly figures by 52, and the annual earnings for a high school dropout were $24,492, compared with $33,904 for a high school graduate and $55,432 for a college graduate. The BLS data, last modified in May, is for people age 25 and over, and earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers.
The report titled The Big Payoff: Educational Attainment and Synthetic Estimates of Work-Life Earnings (.pdf) reveals that over an adult's working life, high school graduates can expect, on average, to earn $1.2 million; those with a bachelor's degree, $2.1 million; and people with a master's degree, $2.5 million. By Robert Longley. 1  In 1999, average annual earnings ranged from $18,900 for high school dropouts to $25,900 for high school graduates, $45,400 for college graduates and $99,300 for the holders of professional degrees (medical doctors, dentists, veterinarians and lawyers).
A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money.. A lot of money, indeed. Multiplying those weekly figures by 52, and the annual earnings for a high school dropout were $24,492, compared with $33,904 for a high school graduate and $55,432 for a college graduate. The BLS data, last modified in May, is for people age 25 and over, and earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers.
Findings indicate that workers with a college degree earn significantly more than those without. Since the mid-1980s, education has played a large part in potential wages, with bachelor's degree holders taking home an average of 66% more than those with only a high school diploma do. In general, 4-year college graduates took home higher median salaries than those with a high school education. However, the type of college degree and gender of the degree holder also impacted earnings, as shown in the table below:
People with a bachelor’s degree make 84% more over a lifetime than high school graduates. In 1999, the premium was 75%, according to a study released Friday. Granted, the report comes from a university -- specifically, Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce. But the data is striking, especially amid the backdrop of increasing concerns about soaring school expenses. -- On average, a doctoral degree-holder will earn $3.3 million over a lifetime, compared to $2.3 million for a college graduate and $1.3 million for those with a high school diploma. -- People with less education in high-paying occupations can out-earn their counterparts with advanced degrees
Better yet, college graduates can go on to earn advanced degrees, which return even bigger payoffs. The average holder of a bachelor's degree earns about $51,000 a year, Baum calculates. But those who've gone on to earn MBAs, law degrees, or other professional degrees earn about $100,000 a year.

That $1 million number has driven me crazy! says Sandy Baum, a Skidmore economist who studied the value of a college degree for the College Board last year. Baum's research showed that college graduates earn, on average, about $20,000 a year more than those who finished their educations at high school. Add that up over a 40-year working life and the total differential is about $800,000, she figures. The average holder of a bachelor's degree earns about $51,000 a year, Baum calculates. But those who've gone on to earn MBAs, law degrees, or other professional degrees earn about $100,000 a year.
At present, the average starting salary for MBA graduates can be as high as $110,000 to $130,000 per year for those graduating from top ranked institutions, while MBA graduates from other schools can earn in the range of $75,000 to $90,000 per year. According to the salary website Payscale.com, MBA graduates can expect to earn an average of $50,000 in their first year of employment after graduating.
