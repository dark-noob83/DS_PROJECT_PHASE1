The main difference between flux cored arc welding and MIG welding is the way the electrode is shielded from the air. Flux cored arc welding just like the name implies, has a hollow wire with flux in the center, similar to the candy called “pixy sticks”. Just as the name states, a “Flux Core”.
FCAW wire feeder. Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW or FCA) is a semi-automatic or automatic arc welding process. FCAW requires a continuously-fed consumable tubular electrode containing a flux and a constant-voltage or, less commonly, a constant-current welding power supply.
Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) is frequently referred to as flux cored welding. Flux cored welding is a commonly used high deposition rate welding process that adds the benefits of flux to the welding simplicity of MIG welding. As in MIG welding wire is continuously fed from a spool.
Flux core arc welding was introduced in the 1950’s. Technically the introduction of this process was not new. It was just a new type of an electrode that can be used on a MIG welding machine. Flux cored arc welding is a process similar to MIG welding.
Flux-Cored Arc Welding was introduced in the 1950s. It is a process that is very closely related to Metal Inert Gas Welding. Both processes use similar equipment and continuous wire feeds, and both MIGW and FCAW use the same type of power supply.
Flux Cored Welding. Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FCAW) utilizes a continuously-fed tubular electrode, electrical power to melt the electrode, and may or may not use shielding gas from an externally supplied source when depositing material in the weld joint.
The flux-cored welding wire, or electrode, is a hollow tube filled with a mixture of deoxidizers, fluxing agents, metal powders, and ferro-alloys. The closure seam, which appears as a fine line, is the only visible difference between flux-cored wires and solid cold-drawn wire.
