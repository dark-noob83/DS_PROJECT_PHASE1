These layers are known as the D, E, and F layers. The location of these layers vary by day and night and is shown in the figure above. The lower most region of the ionosphere extending from about 50 km to 90 km is the D-region, which principally absorbs radio waves. Above the D layer is the E-region extending from 90 km to 150 km. The peak in the E region during day time is seen near 110 km. Above the E region is the F region consisting of two parts: the lower F1 region between 150 km and 180 km and the F2 region from 180 km and above.

The temperature of the ionosphere ranges from about 200K, or -73 ºC (-99.4 ºF) to 500K, or 227 ºC (440.6 ºF). So basically at the bottom it is 200K. At the top it is 500K. K is in Kelvin.
The temperature of the ionosphere can vary depending on altitude. It can range anywhere from 200 degrees Kelvin to 500 degrees Kelvin. The ionosphere is surprisingly thin compared to the rest of the  atmosphere. It lies about 75 to 1,000 kilometers above the earth.
The F layer or region, also known as the Appleton-Barnett layer, extends from about 150 km (93 mi) to more than 500 km (310 mi) above the surface of Earth. It is the densest point of the ionosphere, which implies signals penetrating this layer will escape into space. The atmosphere of Titan includes an ionosphere that ranges from about 1,100 km (680 mi) to 1,300 km (810 mi) in altitude and contains carbon compounds.
The lowest part of the Earth's atmosphere, the troposphere extends from the surface to about 10 km (6.2 mi). Above 10 km (6.2 mi) is the stratosphere, followed by the mesosphere. In the stratosphere incoming solar radiation creates the ozone layer. The atmosphere of Titan includes an ionosphere that ranges from about 1,100 km (680 mi) to 1,300 km (810 mi) in altitude and contains carbon compounds.
The temperature of the ionosphere ranges from -99.4oF to 440.6oF. 
The ionosphere is a shell of electrons and electrically charged atoms and molecules that surrounds the Earth, stretching from a height of about 50 km (31 mi) to more than 1,000 km (620 mi). The atmosphere of Titan includes an ionosphere that ranges from about 1,100 km (680 mi) to 1,300 km (810 mi) in altitude and contains carbon compounds.
The Ionosphere. Exosphere. The Exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere. It extends from the thermopause-the transition boundary which separates the exosphere from the thermosphere below-to 6,200 miles (10,000 km) above the earth. Stratosphere. The Stratosphere extends from the tropopause up to 31 miles above the Earth's surface. This layer holds 19 percent of the atmosphere's gases but very little water vapor. Temperature increases with height as radiation is increasingly absorbed by oxygen molecules leading to the formation of Ozone.
The Earth's thermosphere also includes the region of the atmosphere called the ionosphere. The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is filled with charged particles. The high temperatures in the thermosphere can cause molecules to ionize. This is why an ionosphere and thermosphere can overlap. Ozone in the Stratosphere. About 90% of the ozone in the Earth's atmosphere is found in the region called the stratosphere. This is the atmospheric layer between 16 and 48 kilometers (10 and 30 miles) above the Earth's surface.
The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 km above the Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere. Beyond the ionosphere extending out to perhaps 10,000 km is the exosphere or outer thermosphere, which gradually merges into space. Ionosphere. The ionosphere is a layer of ionized air in the atmosphere extending from almost 80 km above the Earth's surface altitudes of 600 km and more. Technically, the ionosphere is not another atmospheric layer.
