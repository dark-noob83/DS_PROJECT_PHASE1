Cambrian Period. The Cambrian Period is the first period of the Paleozoic Era spanning from approximately 540 to 500 million years ago. It was named in 1835 by the geologist Adam Sedqwick, after the region of Cambria in Southern Wales and England, where rocks of this age were first found.
The Cambrian period, part of the Paleozoic era, produced the most intense burst of evolution ever known. The Cambrian Explosion saw an incredible diversity of life emerge, including many major animal groups alive today.
The Cambrian Period (543 to 505 million years ago) is the first time period of the Paleozoic Era. It is preceded by the Precambrian. The Cambrian Period opened in the aftermath of a mass extinction. During the last 100 million years of the Precambrian, a unique fauna had developed.

This period lasted about 53 million years and marked a dramatic burst of evolutionary changes in life on Earth, known as the Cambrian Explosion..
The Cambrian Period. The Cambrian Period marks an important point in the history of life on Earth; it is the time when most of the major groups of animals first appear in the fossil record. This event is sometimes called the Cambrian Explosion, because of the relatively short time over which this diversity of forms appears.
