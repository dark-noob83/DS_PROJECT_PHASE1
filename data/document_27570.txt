Ear tubes often restore hearing. While the tubes are in place, they often prevent buildup of pressure and fluid in the middle ear. And they can reduce pain. Tubes may keep ear infections from recurring while the tubes are in place.
We went to a specialist and he say no need to look into tubes, yet. She hasnt had an ear infection since she was 10 months old, 7 months now without one. I wouldnt jump the gun yet but would most certainly take her to an ear nose and throat pediatric specialist and get their opinion.
Doctors consider surgery to insert tubes: 1  If a child has had fluid behind the eardrum in both ears for more than 3 months and has significant hearing loss in both ears. 2  If a child has repeat ear infections.
depends on the doctor. both my kids have had tubes. 1 at age 3 and 1 at 13m. the youngest hadn't even had ear infections. just fluid in the ears that wouldn't clear. and I dont remember now how many the 1st had before she got her tubes. but it was over like a 6m period. 3 in 3 months could be that one or 2 just didn't clear up completely.
I was just curious how many ear infections your child had before he/she got tubes. My son had chronic ear infections as an infant and finally got tubes which helped him start making sounds. We waited until ear infection number six with him and I feel like we waited too long.
Best Answer: My little man is 8.5 months old and we're getting them put in. He has had ear infections back and forth now since November. He has been on antiobiotics 4 different times and his pedi said that they typically think about tubes if they see 5-6 within a year.
