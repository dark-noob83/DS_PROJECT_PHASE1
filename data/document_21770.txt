[PureInsight.org] At an early age, Hans Holbein the Younger (1487-1543 A.D.) began to study painting with his father, Hans Holbein the Elder, a recognized artist in the Flemish tradition who was a skilled portraitist.
Hans Holbein was a painter, draftsman, and designer who came from a family of artists. He trained in his father's studio in Augsburg before moving to Basel, Switzerland. In Basel, Holbein worked on house decorations, portraits, and woodcuts.
Hans Holbein the Younger was born in Augsburg into a family of artists. His father Hans Holbein the Elder (c. 1465-1524) was an artist, as was his uncle Sigismund Holbein (active 1501-died 1540) and his older brother Ambrosius (probably 1494-1519?).

The date of Hans Holbein the Younger's birth is not documented, but can be deduced from a silverpoint drawing of Hans and Ambrosius by their father which is dated 1511 and gives Hans' age as 14 and his brother's as 17, as well as a miniature portrait dated 1543 and giving the artist's age as 45.
