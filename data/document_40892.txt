Best Answer: 1 centimeter = 0.01 meters Since these numbers are squared, you have to do this conversion twice. 17.16cm^2 * (.01m/1cm) * (.01m/1cm) = .001716m^2 = 1.716E-3 m^2 21.4cm^2 * (.0001m^2/1cm^2) = .00214m^2 = 2.14E-3 m^2 7.08E1cm^2 = 70.8cm^2 * (.0001m^2/1cm^2) = .00708 m^2 = 7.08E-3m^2.

The area of a rectangle that is 1 1/3 centimeters in length and 1 1/2 centimeters in width equals 1 1/3 times 1 1/2. Convert 1 1/3 and 1 1/2 into improper fractions, which are fractions greater than 1 -- 1 1/3 becomes 4/3 and 1 1/2 becomes 3/2. Multiply 4/3 by 3/2, which equals 12/6. 
1 Sq. Millimeter = 0.01 Sq. Centimeter. Square centimeters and square millimeters metric area units conversion factors are below. To find out how many square millimeters in sq. centimeters, multiply by the right factor or simply use the converter below. 1 Sq. Centimeter = 100 Sq. Millimeters. Sq. centimeter (centimetre) and square millimeter (millimetre) are metric system area measurement units. The abbreviations are cm 2  and mm 2 
Use the following calculator to convert between square millimeters and square centimeters. If you need to convert square millimeters to other units, please try our universal Area Unit Converter. 
The answer is 0.01. We assume you are converting between square centimetre and square millimetre. You can view more details on each measurement unit: cm squared or mm squared. The SI derived unit for area is the square meter. 1 square meter is equal to 10000 cm squared, or 1000000 mm squared. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results.

To convert millimeters to inches you divide the number of millimeters by 25.4 Example: 8 mm / 25.4 = 0.31496 inches You could also use the calculator shown below in Re â€¦ lated Links to help convert such values. Millimeters are a measure of length, but meters squared are a measure of area, so you can't convert one to the other.
The answer is 100. We assume you are converting between square millimetre and square centimetre. You can view more details on each measurement unit: mm squared or cm squared. The SI derived unit for area is the square meter. 1 square meter is equal to 1000000 mm squared, or 10000 cm squared. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results. Use this page to learn how to convert between square millimeters and square centimeters.
Go to Metric Menu. In solving metric units that involve a square, I believe it is helpful to visualize the square unit to be converted as a square. By this, I mean to visualize something like 1.00 m 2 like this: where each side is 1.00 meter in length. To compute the area, we would multiply side by side. Below, when the conversion of a square unit is carried out, each of the two sides will first be converted and then, multiplied together. Example #1: Convert 1.00 m 2 to cm 2. Solution: In order to solve this problem, you must see that there are TWO sides to the 1.00 m 2 area and that EACH SIDE must be converted to cm. 1) Consider that 1.00 m 2 as a square that is 1.00 m on each side. 
How do you convert millimeters squared to centimeters squared? first you move the decimal one space to the left since cenimeters is one unit above millimeters and that's your only step. Millimeters are a measure of length, but meters squared are a measure of area, so you can't convert one to the other.
