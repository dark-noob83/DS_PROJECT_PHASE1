Speaker John A. Boehner has had ample reason to give Senator Ted Cruz of Texas the stink eye, shall we say.
4693904. Speaker of the House John Boehner stunned audience members Wednesday evening at a Colorado fundraiser by referring to Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz as a “jackass,” two people in attendance tell The Daily Caller.
According to attendees of a Colorado fundraiser, Speaker of the House John Boehner recently called fellow Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz a “jackass.”. Two separate witnesses tell The Daily Caller’s Alex Pappas that Boehner made the comments during a fundraiser for Republican Congressman Scott Tipton.
Asked about him last fall, Mr. Boehner said they had not talked to Mr. Cruz since he was elected to the Senate in 2012. Last week, however, at a closed fund-raiser — in Texas, no less — it seemed to some of the 40 people in attendance that Mr. Boehner made his feelings about Mr. Cruz quite clear.
