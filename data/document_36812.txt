Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: According to CNN Money, civil makes $44,999 a year for starting salary, while mechanical makes about $50,672 a year for starting salary. The source lists the top degrees in term of starting salary, and how much each has. There are engineers that are multi-millionaires and engineers that are making $70,000.00 a year. It all depends on basic principles. Think outside of the box, invent the box, control the box, market the box and then sell the box. If you stick to this you will have boxes of money. Good Luck!!!!
Answer. Salaries for engineers depend on what type of engineer they are, what kind of company they work for, how many years of experience they have. Many engineers with bachelors degrees start out making over $50,000 a year. Some engineers just starting out earn more than $70,000 a year! EngineerGirl Essay Contest.
