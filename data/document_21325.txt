How Much Does It Cost? The average yearly premium cost for U.S. homeowners insurance in 2008 (as of 2010, the latest year for which data is available) was $791, according the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, but premiums vary widely and depend on multiple factors. 1 While policies start in the range of $100,000 coverage, experts recommend having at least $300,000 worth of coverage according to the Insurance Information Institute. 2  For extra protection, a few hundred dollars more in premium may buy you an extra $1 million or more through umbrella coverage.
Yes No. Homeowners insurance rates continue to rise at a steady rate throughout the United States, up over 50% in the last 10 years alone. And if you're in the market for a policy you might be looking to get an idea of what parts of the country are most and least expensive
Remember that flood insurance and earthquake damage are not covered by a standard homeowners policy. If you buy a house in a flood-prone area, you'll have to pay for a flood insurance policy that costs an average of $400 a year. For example, if you run a business out of your home, be sure to discuss coverage for that business. Most homeowners policies cover business equipment in the home, but only up to $2,500 and they offer no business liability insurance.

For most homeowners, the annual costs for a homeowners insurance policy can be estimated by dividing the value of the home by 1,000, then multiplying the result by $3.50. One factor in the cost of homeowners insurance is what circumstances are covered under a particular policy. Some examples of typical disasters and incidents that are covered under a basic homeowners insurance policy are fire, vandalism and wind, says the Federal Reserve Board.
