Chemical symbols. Each element is given its own chemical symbol, like O for oxygen and Cl for chlorine. Chemical symbols are usually one or two letters long, but sometimes three letters are used. Every chemical symbol starts with a capital letter, with the second or third letters written in lower case. For example, Mg is the correct symbol for magnesium, but mg, mG and MG are wrong.
List of chemical symbols. Most chemical elements are represented symbolically by two letters, generally the first two in their name. In some cases, the first letter together with some other letter from their name was used, particularly when their first two letters had already been allocated to another element.
