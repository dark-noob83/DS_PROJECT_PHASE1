With an average salary of $85,930 in 2013, mechanical engineers are filling their coffers at a higher rate than a number of other technology jobs. Computer programmers, by comparison, make $80,930. The gap is wider for computer support specialists, who earn an average annual salary of $64,160. Still, some technology jobs, like information security analysts ($91,210) and IT managers ($132,570), earn more than mechanical engineers.
A Mechanical Engineer earns an average salary of $66,437 per year. Most people move on to other jobs if they have more than 20 years' experience in this career. Experience has a moderate effect on income for this job. 
In the 2012 Engineering Income and Salary Survey, conducted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), we look at the state of salaries and the job market in the field of engineering. 
According to salary surveys conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), mechanical engineering graduates with a master's degree earned an average starting salary of $66,158 in 2009 and $69,954 in 2010. As of 2012, NACE reported that mechanical engineers with a master's degree started at an average of $75,700 -- significantly more than the average starting salary of $61,300 reported by mechanical engineers with a bachelor's degree.
For example the median expected annual pay for a typical Mechanical Engineer I in the United States is $63,483 so 50% of the people who perform the job of Mechanical Engineer I in the United States are expected to make less than $63,483.
