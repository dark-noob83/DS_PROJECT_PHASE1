The Permian period, which ended in the largest mass extinction the Earth has ever known, began about 299 million years ago. The emerging supercontinent of Pangaea presented severe extremes of climate and environment due to its vast size. The south was cold and arid, with much of the region frozen under ice caps.
The Permian period lasted from 299 to 251 million years ago* and was the last period of the Paleozoic Era. The distinction between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic is made at the end of the Permian in recognition of the largest mass extinction recorded in the history of life on Earth.
About 250 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period, something killed some 90 percent of the planet's species. Less than 5 percent of the animal species in the seas survived. On land less than a third of the large animal species made it. Nearly all the trees died.
The Permian Period was the final period of the Paleozoic Era. Lasting from 299 million to 251 million years ago, it followed the Carboniferous Period and preceded the Triassic Period.
Introduction to the Permian: 1  The Permian time period lasted 48 million years. 2  It lasted from about 299 m.y.a. to 251 m.y.a., taking up almost 1.06% of geologic time. 3  The Permian time period consisted of 3 epochs-. 4  Lopingian epoch. 5  Guadalupian epoch. 6  Cisuralian epoch. 7  This period was also the end to the Paleozoic Era.
The Permian, however, represented the last gasp for much early prehistoric life. The period, and the Paleozoic era, came to a calamitous close 251 million years ago, marking a biological dividing line that few animals crossed.
