Nutrition Basics. Most of the 60 calories in a serving of honeydew come from its 14 grams of natural sugar. This sugar provides your cells with fuel to get through the day. A serving of honeydew also contains 1.4 grams of beneficial dietary fiber. Honeydew is low in protein and fat, and one serving provides less than a gram of each. Many fruits supply a good dose of potassium and a 1-cup serving of honeydew will provide you with up to 8 percent of what you need each day. The water-potassium ratio on honeydew may also help prevent an increase in blood pressure.

One tablespoon of honey has 64 calories, and one tablespoon of sugar has 46 calories. (Or has 22 calories in one teaspoon of honey versus 16 calories in one teaspoon of table sugar.) While the amount of calorie in honey is more, we actually use less of it since it is sweeter than table sugar. Honey contains the same basic sugar units as table sugar -- glucose and fructose. However, granulated table sugar, or sucrose, has glucose and fructose hooked together, whereas in honey, fructose and glucose remain in individual units.
