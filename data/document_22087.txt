Grass does not produce much net oxygen because of the type of carbon it produces. When grass dies, its carbon products---sugars and starches---use up oxygen and release carbon dioxide when it decays.
Best Answer: Plants, including grass, use carbon dioxide, as the source of carbon for production of their food through process called photosynthesis. During this process, the light energy is converted into chemical energy. In this form, the energy can be stored. Just like a battery.
Oxygen and Turfgrass. Our air is cleansed by plants through the process of photosynthesis. Green plants take in carbon dioxide and water and use the energy from sunlight in photosynthesis, which produces carbohydrates for the plant to live off of and releases the true breath of life ... pure oxygen.
Photosynthesis occurs in every type of plant. The amount of oxygen produced varies depending on how much green the plant has. One of the best oxygen producers does not even live on land. Function Plants and certain bacteria produce oxygen with sunlight through photosynthesis.
The amount of oxygen produced is dependent on the amount of chlorophyll involved in the photosynthesis process. Although there is also the consideration of how much oxygen does the tree consume as well. (Plants do both, consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide, and consuming carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.
Function. Plants and certain bacteria produce oxygen with sunlight through photosynthesis. Plants absorb light through the pigment chlorophyll, which then sends that energy into the storage parts in the plant. Carbon dioxide, readily available in our atmosphere, is taken in through small openings called stomata.
Grass produces the oxygen we breath through a complex process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in every type of plant. The amount of oxygen produced varies depending on how much green the plant has. One of the best oxygen producers does not even live on land.
