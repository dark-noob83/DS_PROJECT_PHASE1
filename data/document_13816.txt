The piriformis is a long muscle that originates on the anterior surface of the lateral process of the sacrum and gluteal surface of the ilium at the margin of the greater sciatic notch. It inserts on the superior border of the greater trochanter. Like the gemellus muscles, the piriformis rotates the hip laterally.
The pain from an inflamed trochanteric bursa, usually localized just posterior to the greater trochanter, is usually elicited by manually resisting abduction and lateral rotation of the thigh while the person is lying on the unaffected side.

Semimembranosus: The most medial of the three hamstring muscles, this muscle originates on the ischial tuberosity and inserts on the medial condyle of the tibia. It functions with the semitendinosus to extend the thigh and flex and medially rotate the leg. It’s innervated by the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve.
Superior and Inferior Gemellus. The superior gemellus and inferior gemellus are long, thin muscles that originate on the ischium and insert on the medial surface of the greater trochanter. Both muscles, in addition to helping rotate the hip joint laterally, help to abduct the flexed thigh.
Vastus Lateralis-Originates at Intertrochanteric line & lateral lip-Linea Aspera spanning a long line of origin between the greater trochanter and the lateral supra condylar line of the femur.
It originates on the shaft of the femur. Pectineus: This muscle originates on the superior ramus of the pubis portion of the hip bone and inserts on the pectineal line of the femur. It’s innervated by the femoral nerve and adducts and flexes the thigh.
