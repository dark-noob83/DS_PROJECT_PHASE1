$1,000. Accounts Receivable. $1,000. As with the percentage-of-sales approach, the percentage-of-receivables approach only impacts the income statement when the allowance of doubtful accounts is adjusted (i.e., uncollectible balance is estimated).
Patient accounts receivable of $7,400,000 is shown as net of $1,300,000 allowance for bad debts: What percentage of gross accounts receivable is the allowance for bad debts? If the allowance for bad debts is raised to $1,500,000, where does the extra $200,000 go? Property, plant, and equipment of $19,300,000 is shown as net, meaning net of the reserve for depreciation.
The .014 is the average percentage of uncollectible accounts receivable during year 1 through year 3. On the other hand, since that data suggest uncollectible accounts are increasing, from 1.25% in year 1 to 1.55% in year 3, the company could estimate its uncollectible accounts receivable to be $255 ($15,000 x .017).
This approach takes into consideration the balance in allowance for doubtful accounts. Percentage-of-receivables approach is different from percentage-of-sales approach in that it uses gross accounts receivable balance to estimate
