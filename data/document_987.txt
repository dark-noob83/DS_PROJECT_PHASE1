Most chemotherapy patients experience myelosuppression as a side effect. Patients on chemotherapy will often be given regular blood tests to check their health. Myelosuppression is a reduction in the activity of bone marrow, resulting in decreased numbers of red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells.
To that end, sometimes myelosuppression is treated in a prophylactic manner—meaning before it begins, sometimes by using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) which can sometimes reduce the severity of the distress on the bone marrow from cancer treatment.
Myelosuppression occurs when the bone marrow makes too few blood cells to replace the spent blood cells. Myelosuppression is not a painful condition, but it is a serious one, can it can lead to fatigue, excessive bleeding, or an increased vulnerability to certain infections.
Simply defined, myelosuppression is defined as the bone marrow making too few blood cells to replace the blood cells that have worn out. It doesn't hurt—a person with myelosuppression does not feel any specific pain from this condition.
A decrease in red blood cells is the most common type of myelosuppression experienced by chemotherapy patients. This type of bone marrow suppression is referred to as anemia. Lowered production of white blood cells is also fairly common among cancer patients.
Myelosuppression as a Side Effect of Chemotherapy. Myelosuppression, sometimes called bone marrow suppression, is a common side effect of chemotherapy that is characterized by a decrease in blood cell production. Three different kinds of blood cells are produced in the body's bone marrow – red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
To that end, sometimes myelosuppression is treated in a prophylactic manner—meaning before it begins. This can be achieved by using the likes of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) which can sometimes reduce the severity of the distress on the bone marrow from cancer treatment.
