IPMI is an acronym for a protocol: the Intelligent Platform Management Interface. It helps manage what is sometimes known as Out-of-Band or Lights-Out communication and is typically implemented by a chip or small set of chips on the motherboard of modern servers.
IPMI stands for Intelligent Platform Management Interface. It's a powerful protocol that is supported by many late model server hardware from major manufacturers like Dell, HP, Oracle and Lenovo.
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a specification for the equipment that monitors the physical environment and behavior of a computer hardware server.
DCMI (Data Center Management Interface) is a similar standard based on IPMI but designed to be more suitable for Data Center management: it uses the interfaces defined in IPMI, but minimizes the number of optional interfaces and includes power capping control, among other differences.
Abbreviated as IPMI, the Intelligent Platform Management Interface is a remote hardware health monitoring and management system that defines interfaces for use in monitoring the physical health of servers, such as temperature, voltage, fans, power supplies and chassis.
IPMI. The intelligent platform management interface (IPMI) specification is a standard that defines a set of common interfaces to a computer system. System administrators can use IPMI to monitor system health and manage the system. IPMI 2.0 defines both a host-based and network-based interface.
Intelligent Platform Management Interface - (IPMI) has been around since 1998 when the specification was launched. The standard; led by Intel and has since been adopted by numerous system vendors including Supermicro.
