GPS (Global Positioning System) Satellites orbit the earth and transmit signals. GPS receivers take the signal information and use it to calculate the user’s exact geographic location. Most mobile phones and smartphones have GPS receivers. Camcorders and digital cameras also use them for GPS tagging.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a network of about 30 satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 20,000 km. 
The reason is that GPS does not make adjustments, like UTC does, to track with solar time. However, a GPS receiver does make a clock adjustment so the user is on UTC time.) The third component of the GPS system is the user equipment, commonly called GPS receivers. exists and is an alternate of. Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answer by David Simpson. Confidence votes 43.6K. GPS tagging is attaching a small transmitter to either a person or object, which sends a signal to the GPS satellite network, enabling it to be traced. Some examples are vehicle anti-theft systems and personal emergency locator beacon
Others may have the GPS chip and camera but do not have internal software needed to embed the GPS information within the picture. A few digital cameras also have built-on or built-in GPS that allow for automatic geotagging. Devices use GPS, A-GPS or both. A-GPS can be faster getting an initial fix if within range of a cell phone tower, and may work better inside buildings.
Global Positioning System, GPS (noun). a navigational system involving satellites and computers that can determine the latitude and longitude of a receiver on Earth by computing the time difference for signals from different satellites to reach the receiver. see more on Definitions.net ».
GPS stands for Global Positioning System and is a satellite-based radio navigation system. While common use of the term GPS began relatively recently, the system dates back to … the 1960s when it was first developed and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). exists and is an alternate of.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defense. GPS was originally intended for military applications, but in the 1980s, the government made the system available for civilian use. 
And most recently, it's what allows you to tag your digital photos with precise geographic information. GPS photo tagging, also known as geotagging, is the process of embedding a digital photo with latitude, longitude and even altitude data. GPS photo tagging can cut down on the amount of work it takes to tag images on the Internet. If you upload a geotagged photo to Flickr, the Web site automatically loads your photo onto its interactive world map.
Geotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information from a device. For instance, someone can find images taken near a given location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates into a suitable image search engine. Geotagging-enabled information services can also potentially be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources. A few digital cameras also have built-on or built-in GPS that allow for automatic geotagging. Devices use GPS, A-GPS or both. A-GPS can be faster getting an initial fix if within range of a cell phone tower, and may work better inside buildings.
