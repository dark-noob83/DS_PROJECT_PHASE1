Acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline. Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions. The Arrhenius definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H +), or more accurately, hydronium ions (H 3 O +), when dissolved in water. The Broensted-Brønsted lowry definition is an: expansion an acid is a substance which can act as a proton. donor
Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and tartaric acid (a solid used in baking). The Arrhenius definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H +), or more accurately, hydronium ions (H 3 O +), when dissolved in water. The Broensted-Brønsted lowry definition is an: expansion an acid is a substance which can act as a proton. donor
2. a substance that yields hydrogen ions in solution and from which hydrogen may be displaced by a metal to form a salt. For the various acids, see under the specific name, such as acetic acid. All acids react with bases to form salts and water (neutralization). Other properties of acids include a sour taste and the ability to cause certain dyes to undergo a color change. The most common organic acids are carboxylic acids, containing the carboxyl group (-COOH); examples are acetic acid, citric acid, amino acids, and fatty acids. Their salts and esters end in-ate, e.g., ethyl acetate. Other organic acids are phenols and sulfonic acids.
Chemistry: Acids, Bases & Salts apid Theory you need to know! eview The reaction of an acid with a base to produce only salt and water is called a neutralization reaction. Acids Acids are sour in taste. If hydronium ions are found in a solution, the solution is acidic in nature. The reaction of an acid with a base to produce only salt and water is called a neutralization reaction. Acids. Acids are sour in taste. If hydronium ions are found in a solution, the solution is acidic in nature. Hydronium ions are the only positively-charged ions (cations) formed when an acid dissolves in water.
Acids are chemical compounds that can react with metals and other substances to eat them away or damage them. You can usually identify an acid by its pH value, such characteristics as taste or feel, and its chemical formula. One common place acids are found is in soft drinks. An acid is a solution with a pH less than 7.0. Litmus paper is often used to give a rough estimate of the pH. When the paper turns red, the material is acidic, and when the paper turns blue, it contains a base. Gardeners use the pH scale to determine how acidic or alkaline their soil is.
An acid (from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour) is a chemical substance whose aqueous solutions are characterized by a sour taste, the ability to turn blue litmus red, and the ability to react with bases and certain metals (like calcium) to form salts. Aqueous solutions of acids have a pH of less than 7. The Arrhenius definition defines acids as substances which increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H +), or more accurately, hydronium ions (H 3 O +), when dissolved in water.

Sulfuric acid is classified as a strong acid, ionizing almost completely in water. Sulfuric acid is the most abundant product of the chemical industry. It is used in the refining of metals and in the manufacture of a wide variety of substances. It is used for the pickling of steel to retard corrosion, in the refinement of petroleum, and in the manufacture of fertilizers.
(see also the uses of Sulfuric Acid). Acids are used both in school and in the chemical industry (see some examples of the chemical reactions of acids). Other uses of acids are listed below. 1) Steel used in construction is treated with acid before being painted.
