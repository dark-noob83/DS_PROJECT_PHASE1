Newborn body temperature is between 97 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 36.1 to 37.8 degrees Celsius. Keeping your newborn between 97.7 to 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 36.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius is optimal. Keeping your newborn’s body temperature normal is important.
This measurement, also known as axillary temperature, tends to be about half a degree to a degree below oral temperature. Therefore, normal axillary temperature would range between 97.6 degrees and 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit (36.4-36.7 degrees Celsius). Other Measurement Sites. Rectal temperature is thought to be most accurate when determining actual body temperature for children. Normal range runs between 97 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 36.0-37.7 degrees Celsius.
The equivalent to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is 37 degrees Celsius. This is the average normal human body temperature, which is slightly lower in adults. The range is 36.8 degr … ees plus or minus 0.7 degrees. Normal temperature range will vary, sometimes considerably, for individuals. 
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day.
Temperature / Fever. Normal axillary (under the arm) temperature ranges from 97.5 to 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 to 37.4 degrees Celsius)*. Taking a rectal temperature. Normal rectal temperature is 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit or less (37.9 degrees Celsius or less)*. 
Ear temperature (or tympanic temperature) also is very accurate in children and adults. 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) is the normal temperature for this method. Measuring body temperature orally is perhaps the most traditional means of measurement. Although 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is the standard norm, healthy range can vary between 98.2 and 98.8 degrees (36.7-37.1 degrees Celsius). Other Measurement Sites. Rectal temperature is thought to be most accurate when determining actual body temperature for children. Normal range runs between 97 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 36.0-37.7 degrees Celsius.
The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. This is the accepted standard temperature for the normal core body temperature. Axillary temperatures are an external measurement taken in the armpit or between two folds of skin on the body. This is the longest and most inaccurate way of measuring body temperature, the normal temperature falls at 97.6 °F or 36.4 °C.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period.
Normal body temperature is typically said to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees celsius. Slight variations are also normal, and the reading can change based on the locat … ion where the temperature was taken (mouth, armpit, etc.). 1 person found this useful. 
Generally, the correlation of temperature results are as follows: 1  The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) low
