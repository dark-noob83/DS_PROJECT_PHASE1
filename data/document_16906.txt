I call them ‘energy’ bites because of all the good ingredients that can help to power you through your day. Almonds and cashews provide good fats and fiber to keep you fueled and your heart healthy. Dates, responsible for the naturally sweet component to the recipe, also add fiber and potassium to your diet.
Recipe Directions for Homemade Energy Bites. 1  Mix all ingredients together. 2  Roll into balls. 3  To freeze: Place balls on a cookie sheet and freeze for one to two hours. 4  Remove from cookie sheet and place in an airtight ziptop freezer bag (or other airtight container).
To make the no bake energy bites, just stir all of those ingredients together until combined. (Or if you get tired of using a spoon, just use your hands. I do!). Once the mixture is combined, pop it in the fridge for 10-20 minutes so that it will harden slightly.
Bursting with flavor is what comes to mind to describe these energy bites. Small but mighty, they are packed with flavor in every bite. These healthy snacks are easy to make and great for grab-and-go situations. You get all the taste of key lime pie without all the work put into making a pie, and without the calories.
