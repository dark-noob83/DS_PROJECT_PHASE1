Time Frame. You can incubate and hatch duck eggs yourself or you can allow a broody duck (or even a broody hen) to lay on them to incubate and hatch the eggs. Mallard duck eggs hatch after about 27 days of incubation. Muscovy duck eggs take 35 days to hatch.
Pekin duck eggs and most other duck eggs hatch after 28 days of incubation. If the eggs are old or if the incubator is not warm enough, incubation may take longer. If the incubator is too warm, incubation happens more quickly. However, several hours of too high or too low of a temperature can be dangerous for the egg.
Most hens will start laying between 5-7 months of age. They will lay best at 1 to 2 years of age. All pullets (female chicken under 1 year of age) lay small eggs at first and after a while will lay larger eggs. Younger hens will lay 1 egg every 3-4 days. A hen 30 weeks old can lay 2 eggs every 3 days. Some have been known to lay an egg a day.
How Long Does Hatching Take. Hatching can take place over several days. For chickens, run the incubator for 24 days (3 days more than normal hatch time).
On average, a mallard hen (female) lays one egg per day for about nine days. She will incubate the eggs for about 26-28 days before they hatch. Once hatched, it will be about 50 days before the ducklings can fly.
In 24 to 28 days for wild mallard ducks (28 to 32 days for muscovies), all the eggs in the nest will hatch within a twenty-four to 48 hour period.
