Effects of processing techniques on the forensic DNA analysis of human skeletal remains. Arismendi JL, Baker LE, Matteson KJ. Department of Anthropology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA. Human remains processed by forensic anthropologists may potentially be used for genetic analysis. Therefore, the condition of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in processed remains may become an issue for future analysis. Processing techniques employed by anthropologists are highly variable and scanning electron microscopy reveals significant alterations to the bone surface depending upon the technique used. This study assessed how five processing procedures used by major forensic anthropology laboratories around the country affects the amounts of DNA extracted from human rib bones and the subsequent DNA analysis.
These analyses can show that biological materials from a specific individual was found at a crime scene, can help inform how a victim may have died, and can even bring identity to unknown human remains found in advanced stages of decomposition. The Technical Working Group on Biological Evidence Preservation has released The Biological Evidence Preservation Handbook: Best Practices for Evidence Handlers. The Handbook addresses packaging and storage, tracking and chain of custody, and disposition of biological evidence.
Forensic biology is used to determine what types of biological stains, such as blood or semen, are left at a crime scene and to link those stains to individuals through DNA analysis. 1  DNA Analysis. 2  Serology. 3  Biology Screening. 4  Pathology/Forensic Anthropology.

DNA can be used to understand the evolution of modern humans, trace migrations of people, identify individuals, and determine the origins of domestic plants and animals. DNA analysis, as one scholar put it, is the greatest archaeological excavation of all time.. 
DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid contains the genetic make-up or properties of all living things. It contains information or codes necessary for cellular activity, like in the formation of proteins and RNA or ribonucleic acid. The parts of the DNA that contains genetic code are called genes. A DNA molecule usually has two strands that are connected and entwined forming a helix. In most living organisms, DNA is stored mostly on the nucleus of the cell.
Molecular anthropology has been extremely useful in establishing the evolutionary tree of humans and other primates, including closely related species like chimps and gorillas. Mitochondrial DNA offers another advantage over autosomal DNA. There are generally 2 to 4 copies of each chromosome in each cell (1 to 2 from each parent chromosome). For mtDNA there can be dozens to hundreds in each cell.
Such damage to the bone indicates differences may exist in quality and quantity of DNA extracted. This study assessed how five processing procedures used by major forensic anthropology laboratories around the country affects the amounts of DNA extracted from human rib bones and the subsequent DNA analysis.
Since DNA contains genetic code, much of it is studied and analyzed for a variety of reasons. Generally, DNA testing may be used in identification or classification of family trees and it may also be used in various sciences for study in diseases and crimes. In cases where a particular child has no identified father, DNA testing is a big help in tracing the real person who fathered the said child. The parts of the DNA that contains genetic code are called genes. A DNA molecule usually has two strands that are connected and entwined forming a helix. In most living organisms, DNA is stored mostly on the nucleus of the cell.
More people have access now to DNA testing as this became affordable for many people. Much of it is used in tracing family history and medical diagnostics. But aside from these applications, analysis of DNA is also used in the fields of anthropology, paleontology, and archeology. The parts of the DNA that contains genetic code are called genes. A DNA molecule usually has two strands that are connected and entwined forming a helix. In most living organisms, DNA is stored mostly on the nucleus of the cell.
(July 2010). Molecular anthropology is a field of anthropology in which molecular analysis is used to determine evolutionary links between ancient and modern human populations, as well as between contemporary species. Mitochondrial DNA offers another advantage over autosomal DNA. There are generally 2 to 4 copies of each chromosome in each cell (1 to 2 from each parent chromosome). For mtDNA there can be dozens to hundreds in each cell.
