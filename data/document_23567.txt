2. PULSE The pulse rate of an adult horse at rest averages 30-40 beats per minute (bpm). A pulse rate of 50 or higher in an adult horse at rest may mean the horse is in physical distress. The average pulse rates for young horses are as follows: Foals (70-120 bpm), Yearlings (45-60 bpm), 2yr. olds (40-50 bpm). A high fever doesn't always indicate a severe condition, but it is a good idea to take your horse's temperature often and if you his temperature is over 102 F, you should call your veterinarian. How To Take a Horse's Temperature: The most accurate way to take a horse's temperature is rectally.
This measures the rate and strength of your horse's heartbeat. Normally, a resting horse has a pulse of 38 to 40 beats per minute. When exercising, a horse's maximum heart rate can exceed 180 beats per minute. However, in resting horses, a heart rate over 80 can be a sign of a serious problem. If a calm horse has a pulse that is consistently over 60, it can also be a problem. Things that can increase the horse's heart rate include exercise, fear, pain, stress, and excitement. Normally, a horse's temperature will be between 99.8 F and 101.3 F. Keep in mind that the weather can affect temperature. In warm weather or during exercise, stress, or excitement, a horse's temperature will naturally rise.
To take the horse's temperature, stand on its left side, facing its rear, and set your hip so it is resting against the horse's leg. Grab the tail with your left hand, about six inches from the root. Hold the thermometer in you right hand. Slowly but firmly raise the tail up and to the side, and insert the thermometer. The normal temperature for a horse is 37.0 to 38 degrees C. The Victorian Department of Primary Industries state that if your horse has temperature of 39 degrees C then you must stay at home and call a vet.

It’s essential that every horse owner know his or her horse’s normal, healthy resting temperature, heart rate, respiration (breathing) rate, and other vital signs and have trained the horse to allow handling for assessment of vital signs. Newborn Foals up to 2 days of age (resting values):*. 1  Temperature: 99.5-102.1°F (37.5-38.9°C). 2  Pulse: 80-100 beats per minute. 3  Respiration (breathing rate): 20-40 breaths per minute.
Temperature. Normal temperature for a resting adult horse is 37.5°C to 38.5°C or 99.5°F to 101.4°F. This is the internal body temperature of the horse so it needs to be taken inside the rectum by inserting a special thermometer into the anus. A resting adult horse should have a heartbeat range from 28 to 48 beats per minute. More than 60 beats per minute in an adult resting horse is abnormal and anything over 80 is really bad. Care should be taken as foals have a quicker heart rate of 70 to 90 beats per minute. Horses doing strenuous exercise can reach 200 beats per minute but this is rare and extreme
A normal resting horse has a heart rate of 38-40 beats per minute, foals (70-120 bpm), yearlings (45-60 bpm) and 2 year olds (40-50 bpm). Maximum heart rates can exceed 180 beats per minute, but a rate above 80 should be considered serious in most non-exercising horses. This is why it’s important to take your horse’s temperature many times and in many different situations so you will know what the norm is. Respiratory colds and infected cuts usually generate temperatures in the 39-40°C range.
It's essential that every horse owner know his or her horse's normal resting temperature, heart and respiration rates, and other vital signs, as well what healthy hooves, legs, and body condition look like. E-mail Address Sign In.
