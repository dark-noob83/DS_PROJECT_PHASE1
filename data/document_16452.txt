Cinnamon is a spice that comes from the bark of a tree native to Southern Asia.

Cinnamon bark can be used to make a spicy, fragrant tea to treat several conditions.

True cinnamon is the bark of a tree native to Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), the most prevalent species names of which are Cinnamomum verum (true cinnamon) and C. zeylanicum (Ceylon cinnamon), of which C. seylanicum is a variant spelling. In Europe, the word cinnamon is limited to this species.
Canela is just cinnamon, I think that is what Mexican cinnamon is called. If it calls for 2 sticks you can buy them at most grocery stores. If you have ground cinnamon, maybe that can be used. Not sure what you have to do with it in your recipe. Why is says American I do not know.
