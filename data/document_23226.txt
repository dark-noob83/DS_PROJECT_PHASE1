A STAR Test & Repair station is the only type of smog check center which can inspect, repair and certify any and all vehicles. These stations are participants of the State's Consumer Assistance Program and are inspected by the State of California monthly.
1 STAR smog stations will be able to issue a certificate of compliance to a vehicle passing a smog check when a motorist is referred by the DMV to such a station for vehicle registration renewal. 2  A non star station may not issue a certificate to the motorist's vehicle.
When the STAR Program begins on January 1, 2013, Smog Check stations planning to test vehicles can be licensed as either a Test-Only station or a Test-and-Repair station. Gold Shield stations will cease to exist. Both Test-Only and Test-and-Repair stations may apply for STAR certification.
