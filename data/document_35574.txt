Average Cost of Cataract Surgery. The average cost of Cataract surgery in a Medicare outpatient setting is generally around $2,500.00/eye for the surgeon, the out patient facility, and the anesthesia provider. Medicare would pay 80% or $2,000.00/eye and you would pay the remaining $500.00 out of pocket. If you are using the standard lens without any upgrades like astigmatism management/laser cataract surgery or ORA (intraoperative aberrometry), etc. the usually cataract surgery would be about $500 per eye out of pocket after Medicare (if you have already met your Medicare deductible) or $1,000 for both.
(In 2010 the average was about $3,279, in 2011 it was $2,699, in 2012 it was $3,429 and in 2013 it was $3,230.). If you want a high-tech, presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens for your cataract procedure, then costs would increase to an average of about $4,591 per eye (vs. $4,461 in 2010, $4,337 in 2011, $4,269 in 2012 and $4,350 in 2013). 
If you choose a premium intraocular lens for your cataract surgery that is not covered by Medicare (such as a presbyopia-correcting IOL), you must pay the added cost of this premium IOL to your eye surgeon as well. In most cases, Medicare pays 80 percent of the approved cost of cataract surgery and you are responsible for the remaining 20 percent (the Medicare copayment), after meeting your annual deductible payment.
In the aspect of eye care, Medicare does not tend to disburse money for routine eye care, but for it covers some special eye care services, which includes surgery eyes, cataracts or glaucoma or any other chronic situation of the eye. Medicare will pay for surgery eyes, is when you are suffering from diabetes. Having cataracts in your eyes is another situation that Medicare will cover all the benefits for surgery eyes.

Geography, surgical experience, technology (e.g., which lasers), insurance benefits, and healthcare savings all influence your real cost of laser eye surgery.
If you’re a Medicare beneficiary hoping to improve your vision with laser eye surgery, Medicare doesn’t cover this procedure. Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, doesn’t cover routine eye or vision care. Medicare Part A and Part B do cover the costs of certain medical eye conditions if they require hospitalization or emergency care. Original Medicare also covers eye doctor visits and treatments to improve or cure some chronic eye conditions. Two examples are glaucoma and cataracts, but this is not an all-inclusive list, and of course your Medicare-participating doctor must consider the treatment medically necessary.
