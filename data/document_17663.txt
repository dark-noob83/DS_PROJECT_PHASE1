Kilowatt-hours are what show up on your electricity bill, describing how much electricity you have used. One kilowatt (kW) equals 1,000 watts, and one kilowatt-hour (kWh) is one hour of using electricity at a rate of 1,000 watts. New, energy-efficient refrigerators use about 300-400 kilowatt-hours per year. The typical American home uses about 7,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year [1]. 
The heat content of natural gas is solely dependent on the composition of the gas, and is independent of temperature and pressure. One therm is equal to about 105.5 megajoules, 25,200 kilocalories or 29.3 kilowatt-hours. One therm can also be provided by about 96.7 cubic feet (2.74 m 3) of natural gas. The therm sometimes has been confused with the thermie (see below). The names of both units come from the Greek word for heat. Since natural gas meters measure volume and not energy content, a therm factor is used by (Natural) gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent, and thus calculate the actual energy use. The therm factor is usually in the units therms/CCF.
Measurements of natural gas show that 20 cubic feet are consumed in a 50-second period. Determine the unit electrical power cost associated with this generator set. 1. ∗ ∗ 2. ∗ ∗ ⁄ 3. ∗ ∗ ∗√ ∗ ∗ ∗√ 4. ⁄ Determine the power generated by the generator in kilowatt hours per hour (kwh / hour). 
Most modern gas meters measure gas in cubic metres (m 3). The energy contained in gas is measured in kilowatt-hours (abbreviated to kWh) and for natural gas is 11.2 kWh per cubic metre. Older gas meters measure gas in hundreds of cubic feet - 100 cubic feet equal 2.83 cubic metres. So the energy contained in gas measured by an older gas meter is 31.7 kWh per 100 cubic feet. The CO. generated by burning natural gas is 0.185 kg / kWh [DEFRA, 18] 
For the sake of comparison, one average cubic foot of natural gas about 1,000 BTU's of heat energy.The chart below shows how much heat energy is released in various quantities of natural gas. HEAT ENERGY PER UNIT OF MEASURE FOR NATURAL GAS UNIT OF MEASURE APPROX. The energy content of natural gas differs in various locations thoughout the country. For the sake of comparison, one average cubic foot of natural gas about 1,000 BTU's of heat energy.The chart below shows how much heat energy is released in various quantities of natural gas.
1 A gigajoule of natural gas is about 25.5 cubic metres at standard conditions. 2  One gigajoule of natural gas is approximately equivalent to 27 litres of fuel oil, 39 litres of propane, 26 litres of gasoline or 277 kilowatt hours of electricity. Relating gas volume consumption to heat and temperature, approximately 4.2 joules is equal to the heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at standard pressure 101.325 kPa and standard temperature (15 degrees Celsius).
The metric standard for energy content is joules (J). Relating gas volume consumption to heat and temperature, approximately 4.2 joules is equal to the heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at standard pressure 101.325 kPa and standard temperature (15 degrees Celsius).
The amount of energy represented by one gigajoule is equivalent to about 30 litres of gasoline, 39 litres of propane, 278 kilowatt-hours of electricity or 45.5 kilograms of coal. The average home in Alberta uses about 120 gigajoules of natural gas per year. Examples of average energy consumption for standard household appliances include: 1  40 gigajoules a year to heat a 40-gallon hot water tank for a family of four. 2  4.3 gigajoules for a gas dryer processing 400 loads of laundry a year.
1 One gigajoule (GJ) equals one billion joules (J). 2  A gigajoule of natural gas is about 25.5 cubic metres at standard conditions. 3  One gigajoule of natural gas is approximately equivalent to 27 litres of fuel oil, 39 litres of propane, 26 litres of gasoline or 277 kilowatt hours of electricity. Relating gas volume consumption to heat and temperature, approximately 4.2 joules is equal to the heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius at standard pressure 101.325 kPa and standard temperature (15 degrees Celsius).
