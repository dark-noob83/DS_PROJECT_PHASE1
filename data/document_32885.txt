Chronic respiratory diseases are a group of chronic diseases affecting the airways and the other structures of the lungs. Common chronic respiratory diseases are listed in Table 2, as they appear in ICD-10. Common symptoms of the respiratory tract are also listed in ICD-10 (Table 3).
In humans the anatomical features of the respiratory system include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide are passively exchanged, by diffusion, between the gaseous external environment and the blood. This exchange process occurs in the alveolar region of the lungs. The respiratory system can be subdivided into an upper respiratory tract and a lower respiratory tract based on anatomical features. The upper respiratory tract includes the nasal passages, pharynx and the larynx, while the lower respiratory tract is comprised of the trachea, the primary bronchi and lungs.
Asthma. A chronic lung disease that causes inflammation and narrowing in the airways, asthma is a must-include in a list of respiratory diseases. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing (characterized by a whistling sound while breathing), tightness in the chest, shortness of breath, and coughing.
Some of the many diseases that can affect the respiratory system include: 1  Laryngitis-Swelling and irritation of the larynx. 2  Bronchitis-An infection in your bronchial tubes. 3  Tonsillitis-Inflammation of the tonsils. 4  Pneumonia-An infection deep in your lungs.
The respiratory system is composed of the trachea (windpipe), a set of lungs and its blood vessels and bronchioles (smaller airways). Sometimes, an infection can invade the respiratory system. In some cases, an anatomical problem is to blame for respiratory difficulties.
