Both Mania and Hypomania are two of the most common associations to Bi-polar disorder in teenagers. Bipolar conditions are accentuated by periods of depression (lows) followed by manic behavior (highs) and can fluctuate in severity on a case by case basis. The manic behavior cycle can typically be recognized by any number of symptoms.
Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder that likely stems from a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors. The mood episodes associated with it involve clinical depression or mania (extreme elation and high energy) with periods of normal mood and energy in between episodes.
A manic episode is not a disorder in and of itself, but rather is a part of a type of bipolar disorder.
ANSWER: Definition of manic behavior: The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines mania as, The excitement manifested by mental and physical hyperactivity, disorganization of behavior, and elevation of mood; specifically: the manic phase of manic-depressive mental disorder.
Mania, however, is most commonly associated with bipolar disorder, a serious mental illness in which episodes of mania may alternate unpredictably with episodes of depression or periods of euthymia.
Although manic behavior is generally associated with bipolar disorder, periods of mania may occur without being followed by a period of deep depression. Some patients with bipolar may have more problems with the manic episodes than with depression, with some patients rarely having a depressive episode at all.
Bipolar disorder was formerly called manic depression. It is a form of major affective disorder, or mood disorder, defined by manic or hypomanic episodes (changes from one's normal mood accompanied by high energy states).
