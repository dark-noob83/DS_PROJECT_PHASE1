1 Leave the prime rib out at room temperature for 2 hours. 2  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. 3  When the oven is hot, put the roast in and cook for 20 minutes to sear the outside of the roast. 4  After 20 minutes turn the oven down to 325 degrees F. and roast until the desired internal temperature is reached (see guide below). 1 Rub the entire surface of the cold roast with butter, and coat evenly with the kosher salt and black pepper. 2  Leave the prime rib out at room temperature for 2 hours. 3  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. 4
30 minutes before the end of the cooking time remove the prime rib roast from the oven and check the internal temperature. For the roast to be rare the internal temperature should be 120°F to 125°F but remove from the oven when it is 115°F to 120°F and allow to stand for 20 minutes. 1 Cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. 2  Remove every 30 minutes and turn the roast in the marinade. 3  Remove from the refrigerator and allow the prime rib to set out for approximately two hours before cooking. 4  Allow it to reach room temperature before placing in the oven.
Sear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast. Previously Frozen: If your prime rib roast is frozen, let it thaw completely in the refrigerator. Remove the roast from the refrigerator about 2 to 4 hours before cooking to let it come to room temperature. Depending on the size of your roast, the time to come to room temperature may vary.
1 Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 2  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5 
4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°)
4. Cooking prime rib to a temperature of 135-140 degrees (medium-rare) for maximum flavor and tenderness will give you a tender juicy roast or 140-150 degrees (medium) but no more, anything more will begin to dry out the roast. In method A because a temperature of 250 degrees is used the temperature will only rise about 2-4 degrees during resting time. The second method is a non-risky way to cook a prime rib roast, it will give you a tender, juicy roast that won’t embarrass you. 1.

Preheat oven to 450°F. Place the roast (ribs down) on the rack in a roasting pan. Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450°F), and then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325° F) for the rest of the cooking time. About 1/2 hour before the estimated end of the roasting time, begin checking the internal temperature (use a good instant-read digital meat thermometer.
