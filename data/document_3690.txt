Sounts good to me. I pay about $150 for a 125 cu ft (wshielding gas, but same tank). Normally a X cf O2 cylinder gests mated to a similar capacity C2H2 cylinder. The tank will be physically smaller since the C2H2 is dissolved in acetone. Usually it's a pain in the butt to get an owned cylinder bigger then 125.
According t â€¦ o www.doityourself.com a yard of concrete will cost about $75.00 so a cubic foot will cost you $75/27, which would be about $2.78 per cubic foot. 1 foot of concrete is a very small volume so you will probably be charged for a minimum quantity which will be more that the cost of 1 foot.
1 On average, the price for a swap out of about 60 cubic foot acetylene owner-cylinder is about $70, while you should be prepared to spend about $35 for a 40 cubic foot exchange of an owner tank. 2  The cost is going to depend on where you get the refill and the size of the tank.
I bought the oxy cylinders for $200 even and the exhange charge is around 25 bucks. I currently own 2- 145 cf acetylene cylinders that i bought for $200 even as well.They cost around 40 bucks to exchange. Also to note that these cylinders i have are not on any lease contract.I own them forever.

1 When acetylene must be pressurized and then stored for use in oxy-acetylene metal cutting and welding operations, special storage cylinders are used. 2  These tanks are available in multiple sizes. 3  The cost of a new tank depends upon the size of the tank. 4  For instance, a new, 40 cubic foot tank retails for about $75.
