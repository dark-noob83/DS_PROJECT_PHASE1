This will kill any harmful bacteria and viruses and make it safe to eat. The NHS says that it's safe to eat cold cured meats, such as pepperoni, Parma ham and salami, in pregnancy, as the risk of listeria bacteria is low. However, it's possible to get listeriosis or toxoplasmosis from eating cold cured meats.
Expert Answers. No, it is not safe to eat uncooked pepperoni if you are pregnant. Raw food contains harmful bacteria called as listeria. The listeria bacteria can cause listeriosis in pregnant women which can lead to brain infection and even death. Never eat raw food. 1  Login to post comment.
Pizzas are safe to eat in pregnancy, as long they are cooked thoroughly and are piping hot. However, be cautious about pizzas topped with soft, mould-ripened cheeses, such as brie and camembert, and soft blue-veined cheeses, such as danish blue. These cheeses contain more listeria bacteria than other cheeses.
Other common ingredients on pizzas that could be a problem during pregnancy are cured meats, such as pepperoni, prosciutto and salami. If you eat them uncooked, cured meats can give you listeriosis. You can also get toxoplasmosis, which isn't a serious illness for you but it can be dangerous for your baby.
While pizza is usually safe to eat while you are pregnant, the pepperoni might cause discomfort, health problems and weight gain. Don't despair, however, because you can take certain steps to make your favorite pizza healthier and safer for you and your unborn baby.
