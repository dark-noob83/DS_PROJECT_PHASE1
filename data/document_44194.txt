IVIG is given as a plasma protein replacement therapy (IgG) for immune deficient patients who have decreased or abolished antibody production capabilities. In these immune deficient patients, IVIG is administered to maintain adequate antibody levels to prevent infections and confers a passive immunity. IVIG's effects last between 2 weeks and 3 months. It is mainly used as treatment in four major disease categories: 1  Primary Immune deficiencies such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and hypogammaglobulinemia.
Side effects of IVIG treatment may include headache. IVIG therapy is done by administering medication directly into the bloodstream to help treat autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and certain kinds of infections. IVIG could lead to anaphylaxis in rare cases
IVIG is used to treat various autoimmune, infectious, and idiopathic diseases. IVIG is an approved treatment for graft versus host disease and ITP. It is accepted for use in persons with Kawasaki disease, Guillain-Barre barré, syndrome and/polymyositis. dermatomyositis A prime use of IVIG is in the treatment of hematological diseases. The first description of the treatment of individuals with ITP with IVIG was by Imbach et al in 1981. They noted that dose administration of IVIG promoted a rapid recovery for children with ITP.
IVIG or gammablobulin, also called immune globulin, is a plasma treatment used for specific conditions such as immune deficiencies, autoimmune conditions, inflammation and infections. IVIG is used to treat a number of immunodeficiency and autoimmune conditions as well as blood disorders because it contains a critical component called immunoglobulin-G (IgG).
IVIG is a plasma protein replacement therapy (IgG) for immune deficient patients who have decreased or suppressed antibody production capabilities. IVIG is mainly used as treatment in three major categories; immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and acute infections. It is important to know that the immunoglobulin given via IVIG therapy only partly replaces what the body should be making on its own. It does not help the patient’s immune system make more. In the case of patients with autoimmune disease, IVIG is administered at a high dose in an attempt to decrease the severity of the autoimmune disease. Most antibodies, whether produced by the patient’s own immune system or given in the form of immunoglobulin, are used up by the body.
Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a plasma product used in the treatment of certain conditions related to the immune system. IVIG therapy is done by administering medication directly into the bloodstream to help treat autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and certain kinds of infections. IVIG could lead to anaphylaxis in rare cases
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a blood product administered intravenously. It contains the pooled, polyvalent, IgG antibodies extracted from the plasma of over one thousand blood donors. IVIG's effects last between 2 weeks and 3 months. It is mainly used as treatment in four major disease categories: 1  Primary Immune deficiencies such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and hypogammaglobulinemia.
