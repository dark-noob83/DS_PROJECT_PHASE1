Since there IS a need for more precise directions, the circle of a compass face is split into 360 marks called degrees. For rough directions, go ahead and use North or NorthWest. But, for finding your way or locating destinations in the wild, use degrees as you'll see in a bit. Heading and Bearing are pretty much the same thing. The image above is a heading of about 250 degrees. Using your compass, take a few bearings. Move your body until the direction-of-travel arrow points at the following items and then turn the dial until RED is in the Shed. Then, read the bearing at the Index Pointer: 1  You computer screen: ____________ degrees
The 32-point compass is... interesting, to say the least. By Denelson83 (Own work) [GFDL or CC-BY-SA-3.0], via Wikimedia Commons. Your challenge is to take a degree measure, and convert it into a direction on the 32-point compass. Each direction is 11.25 (360 / 32) degrees farther than the previous. For example, N (north) is 0 degrees, NbE (north by east) is 11.25 degrees, NNE (north-northeast) is 22.5 degrees, etc
With this style of compass, readings such as North 20 degrees East are used. That means 20 degrees towards East from North. A bearing of South 70 degrees West would be the same as 250 degrees on a normal 360 degree compass (180 degrees for South plus 70 degrees). A bearing of South 15 degrees East would be the same as 165 degrees (180 degrees minus 15 degrees). Mils :
The points of the compass are points on a compass, specifically on the compass rose, marking divisions of the four cardinal directions: North, South, East, West. The number of points may be only the 4 cardinal points, or the 8 principal points adding the intercardinal (or ordinal) directions northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). In meteorological usage further intermediate points are added to give the sixteen points of a wind compass
See Compass Reading for more info. Degrees : A compass divided into 360 degrees is the most common unit of measurement. Each degree is divided into 60 minutes, each minute into 60 seconds. A handheld compass is not able to measure down to a minute, let alone a second, but those units are used for precise locations using latitude and longitude. A bearing of South 70 degrees West would be the same as 250 degrees on a normal 360 degree compass (180 degrees for South plus 70 degrees). A bearing of South 15 degrees East would be the same as 165 degrees (180 degrees minus 15 degrees). Mils :
There are 360 degrees on the compass with North at 0 degrees, South at 180 degrees, East at 90 degrees and West at 270 degrees. Best Answer: good' ol cat 38 is right that there are 32 points; and Capt Bill is right that each point is 360/32 = 11.25 degrees and much as I hate wikipdia, here's a good link to all 32 points that expands on cat's answer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_...

West and north? If it is 90 degrees between north and east how many degrees is it from north to south? Therefore, what would the corresponding degrees be for each of the directions? Once students have north (0 degrees) east (90 degrees) south (180 degrees) and west (270 degrees) ask to fill in other degree measures. Magnetic North – The direction of the earth’s magnetic pole, to which the north-seeking pole of a magnetic compass needle points. This does not correspond to the geographic north. Compass Rose – A circle marked in degrees from 0 to 360 and printed on maps and charts for use in navigation.
