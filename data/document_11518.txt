I was just stung by a bee yesterday and needed a trip to the ER. I went to Walmart to get my Epipen with my prescription and was shocked at the cost of $363 for a 2 pack. And that was after insurance. I didn't find out about the coupon from the manufacturer, but that is only for $100. So, the information in this article is very much correct and not outdated at all. I went to fill my prescription two months ago; we have good insurance...my jaw dropped when the Kroger pharmacist said it would be $264 - after insurance paid $200 and after the up to $100 copay coupon. So the street price is (or was at the time) $564 for the Epipen 2-pk. Other area pharmacies had similar prices.
