Roast the pork for 10 minutes: Set the pork in the pan. (It's fine if your pork tenderloin is a little long for the pan; just bend it to fit as we did here.) Return the pan to the oven. Roast for 10 minutes. Flip the pork, reduce the heat, and roast another 10 to 15 minutes: Flip the pork to the other side. Reduce the oven temperature to 400°F and continue roasting another 10 to 15 minutes. The pork is done when its internal temperature registers 140°F to 145°F in the thickest part of the meat (20 to 25 minutes total). Rest for 10 minutes before serving: Transfer the pork to a cutting board, tent with foil, and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing
Keep your oven temperature high (we go for a 425 degree oven). Then, only roast the pork for 10 to 15 minutes. That’s really all you need. We cook our pork until an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 and 65 degrees C). That will mean that the pork will be juicy and slightly pink in the middle.
It is not the time in the oven but the internal temperature of the roast that will determine if it is cooked properly. According to the USDA and Minnesota Pork Board, “Pork is best when cooked to medium doneness – 160 degrees F. on a meat thermometer. WIth a roast, you generally want to cook to an internal temperature, not a time. But, when you lay it out butterflied, it’s thinner and more of the meat is exposed to heat, so if you were to cook it at 350 degrees at a 1/2 hour/lb. a 6 lb roast would end up ruinously overdone.
1 Then, place pork tenderloins on top of apples and onions and slide into the oven. 2  Roast 10 to 15 minutes or until an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 and 65 degrees C). 3  Transfer pork to a large plate and cover with aluminum foil. Then, only roast the pork for 10 to 15 minutes. That’s really all you need. We cook our pork until an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 and 65 degrees C). That will mean that the pork will be juicy and slightly pink in the middle.
1 Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices. 2  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist. 3  After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees. 1 Preheat oven to 500 degrees. 2  Remove tenderloin from refrigerator. 3  Season meat as desired. 4  Place seasoned meat in an uncovered roasting pan on a shelf in the bottom 1/3 of your oven. 5  Bake EXACTLY 5 1/2 minutes PER POUND. 6  Adjust +/- according to your oven's accuracy and heat retention. 7  NOTE:.
With a pork tenderloin: Season the meat, sear all sides in a very hot pan, and then finish in the oven at 350°F (175°C) degrees until the internal temp. hits 145°F (63°C). Then let it sit for 10 minutes, and cut 'er up. If you need it done faster, a higher oven temp will accomplish this, but may compromise quality. 
Keep your oven temperature high (we go for a 425 degree oven). Then, only roast the pork for 10 to 15 minutes. That’s really all you need. We cook our pork until an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 and 65 degrees C).
For roasts, including tenderloin, you can remove the pork from the oven when the internal temperature reaches 155°F/68°C, then cover loosely with aluminum foil – the temperature will rise to the recommended 160°F/71°C after 10-15 minutes as the roast sits. 
Let the tenderloin cool before serving. Pan-roasting pork tenderloin Preheat your oven to 425ºF and coat an ovenproof skillet with oil. Sear the tenderloin over medium-high heat until it’s brown on all sides. Roast the tenderloin for 15 to 20 minutes until the internal temperature reads 145ºF. Let it cool before serving. Stuffed pork tenderloin To butterfly the tenderloin, trim the silver skin with a thin sharp knife.
The National Pork Board recommends cooking pork chops, roasts, and tenderloin to an internal temperature between 145° F. (medium rare) and 160° F. (medium), followed by a 3 minute rest. Since large cuts increase approximately 10° F. while resting, remove them from the heat at 150° F. followed by a 10 minute rest.
