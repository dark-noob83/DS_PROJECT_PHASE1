Method 1 of 2: Planting Crepe Myrtle. 1. Plant the crepe myrtle during a dormant season. Early spring is generally considered best, but you can also plant the tree during fall or winter, as long as you live in a region where the winters are mild and the ground does not freeze.
Fertility. Unlike some plants, crape myrtle is well adapted to growing in low-quality soils, and they generally don't need much fertilizer. For older trees growing in extremely poor soil, the United States National Arboretum recommends a light application of a 5-10-5 fertilizer in springtime.
Step 4. Transport the ground cover myrtle plants to the new growing location immediately. Place each ground cover myrtle into a prepared hole and fill soil in around the roots to finish planting each plant.
Soil pH. Crape myrtle prefers acidic soil, with an ideal pH between 5.0 and 6.5. If necessary, you can raise the pH of your soil by incorporating ground agricultural limestone, or lower it by adding sulfur. This is best done before you plant the trees.
Step 1. Prepare a new growing area for the ground cover myrtle. Cultivate the soil down to a depth of 4 to 6 inches with the garden spade. Add 2 inches of compost to the top of the soil and work the compost in well with the garden spade. Rake the soil surface smooth.
