People use reiki to decrease pain, ease muscle tension, speed healing, and improve sleep. Reiki is sometimes used to help people who suffer from pain or discomfort from cancer or other diseases. But reiki is not used as a treatment for cancer or any other disease. Some people who have undergone chemotherapy treatment said they felt better and had less nausea after undergoing a reiki session.
REIKI HEALING. Reiki is a form of spiritual practice proposed for the treatment of physical, emotional, mental and spiritual diseases. Reiki was developed in early 20th century Japan to receive the ability of 'healing without energy depletion'.
There are many wonderful benefits of Reiki. Reiki is a very simple process, but usually produces quite profound effects. The main purpose of reiki practise is not only to heal diseases, but also to promote a positive mind and healthy body so that people can experience joy in life. However, reiki does not promise a miraculous cure from disease.
Reiki means universal life energy and is an ancient healing method that manipulates energy flow in the body. Reiki practitioners believe there is an energy force in and around the body. They believe that there is a flow of energy between the reiki practitioner and the receiver of the treatment.
In addition to being an alternative menopause treatment, reiki healing therapy is also used to both treat and prevent a variety of conditions, illnesses and diseases, such as: 1  stress. 2  arthritis. 3  endometriosis. 4  fibromyalgia. 5  chronic fatigue syndrome.
It is an entirely natural question to ask, but to ask it is also to misunderstand the nature of Reiki and of disease and healing. Explained very simply â€“ Reiki does not cure diseases, it cures people. To expect Reiki to cure a disease is to expect Reiki to conform to the limited understanding and knowledge of disease that we have.
