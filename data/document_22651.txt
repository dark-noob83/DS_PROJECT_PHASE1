Botany: A giant in the rainforests, the kapok tree can reach up to 200 feet in height, sometimes growing as much as 13 feet per year. Due to its extreme height, the kapok, or ceiba tree, towers over the other rainforest vegetation. The trunk can expand to nine or 10 feet in diameter. 
The tallest trees, the emergent layer, can be over 200ft (60m) tall. The canopy layer is about 30-40m (100-130 ft). The understorey layer is about 15-30m and the shrub layer is about 8m tall. The tallest living tree stands at 367 feet, 6 in.or five stories higher than the Statue of Liberty. It is a Mendocino Tree, a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) found at Mon … tgomery State Reserve near Ukiah, California, USA. It is estimated to be over 1000 years old.
So much fun! The Science Bit. This method of measuring the height of a tree is only an estimate, but uses trigonometry. If you look at the top of a tree at a 45 degree angle then the height of the tree (h) is the same as the distance that you are from the tree. 
Redwoods. These tallest of trees reach heights of more than 350 feet (107 meters). The tallest tree in the world is named Hyperion, which reaches 379.7 feet (115.7 meters). Redwoods can achieve a diameter of 24 feet (7 meters), and 1.6 million pounds (725,700 kg). These giants can live to be 2,000 years old and have graced the planet for more than 240 million years. Giant sequoias can grow to be about 30 feet (9 meters) in diameter and more than 250 feet (76 meters) tall. The biggest of these behemoths is General Sherman, a giant sequoia in Sequoia National Park.
1 Multiply the length of the tree’s shadow by your height. 2  If you are 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, and the tree's shadow is 100 feet (30.48 meters) long, multiple them together: 5 x 100 = 500 (or for the meter measurements, 1.5 x 30.48 = 45.72). If your friend is 6 feet (180 cm) tall, the tree is 6 x 3.5 = 21 feet tall (180 cm x 3.5 = 630 cm). 1  Note: If you do have a tape measure with you when you're near the tree, you do not need to do any calculations.
View full size image. The tallest tree in the world, a California redwood, stands 379 feet (116 m) tall, or slightly taller than a football field is long. Redwoods of the past that have since been cut down probably stood even taller, and may even have reached the theoretical maximum height for trees. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, the biologists wrote in a 2004 article in the journal Nature. This limit lies at or just above 400 feet.
In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands 115.6 m (379 ft) high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world
It all depends on the rain forest you are asking about. The tallest trees, the emergent layer, can be over 200ft (60m) tall. The canopy layer is about 30-40m (100-130 ft). T … he understorey layer is about 15-30m and the shrub layer is about 8m tall.
The tallest tree in the world is a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) growing in Northern California that has been named Hyperion. In September 2012, it was measured at 379.65 ft (115.72m) tall. There are 7 other coastal redwoods known to be over 370 feet (112 meters) in height, and 222 specimens over 350 feet.
