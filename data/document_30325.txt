~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~. Static Encephalopathy, as defined by Easter Seals: Permanent or unchanging brain damage. The effects on development depend on the part of the brain involved and on the severity of the damage. Static Encephalopathy may involve the frontal lobe, which affects judgment and impulse control, and the corpus callosum, the membrane between the left brain and right brain which affects the ability to process information. There are many links on the internet with more information about FAS and FAE.

Encephalopathy can present a very broad spectrum of symptoms that range from mild, such as some memory loss or subtle personality changes, to severe, such as dementia, seizures, coma, or death. 
Posted on May 29, 2011 by PediatricNeurobehavioralDiagnostics. Encephalopathy is a fancy word for a condition of the brain impacting how it works. In many cases, it is a type of brain injury. Developmental encephalopathy, sometimes referred to as complex developmental encephalopathy, means that the child was born with the condition. Encephalopathies are not typically degenerative, that is, they don’t usually worsen
The leading cause of developmental disabilities characterized by Static Encephalopathy is consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Static Encephalopathy is present in persons diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE). FAS and FAE are terms used to describe disabilities suffered by persons who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Tens of thousands of children are born each year with FAS or FAE. Static Encephalopathy may involve the frontal lobe, which affects judgment and impulse control, and the corpus callosum, the membrane between the left brain and right brain which affects the ability to process information. There are many links on the internet with more information about FAS and FAE.
Often, static encephalopathy contributes to developmental problems such as cerebral palsy, autism, PDD-NOS, attention deficit disorder (ADD), mental retardation, problems with vision and or hearing, and other types of conditions. Some of the common symptoms include but are not limited to: 1  Emotional immaturity. Learning delays are a result of damage to multiple parts of the brain that control learning. An individual with this type of condition could be a slow learner or have a learning disability depending on the extent of the damage.
Often the severity and type of symptoms are related to the severity and cause of the brain disease or damage. For example, alcohol-induced liver damage (alcoholic cirrhosis) can result in involuntary hand tremors (asterixis), while severe anoxia (lack of oxygen) may result in coma with no movement. Other serious symptoms that may occur include: 1  lethargy, 2  dementia, 3  seizures, 4  tremors, 5  muscle twitching and myalgia, 6  Cheyne-Stokes respirations (an altered breathing pattern seen with brain damage and coma), and. 7  coma.
How is static encephalopathy treated? Brain damage associated with static encephalopathy is permanent; consequently, there is no cure. The symptoms related to static encephalopathy can range from mild to severe, not always visually apparent, can be misdiagnosed and may go unrecognized.
Encephalopathy /ɛnˌsɛfəˈlɒpəθi/ means disorder or disease of the brain. In modern usage, encephalopathy does not refer to a single disease, but rather to a syndrome of overall brain dysfunction; this syndrome can have many different organic and inorganic causes. Treating the underlying cause of the disorder may improve or reverse symptoms. However, in some cases, the encephalopathy may cause permanent structural changes and irreversible damage to the brain. These permanent deficits can be considered a form of stable dementia.
Encephalopathy is a general term describing a disease that affects the function or structure of your brain. There are many types of encephalopathy and brain disease. Some types are permanent and some are temporary. 
Static encephalopathy is a brain condition that restricts the developmental process of an individual, most evident in speech. Learning delays are a result of damage to multiple parts of the brain that control learning. An individual with this type of condition could be a slow learner or have a learning disability depending on the extent of the damage.
