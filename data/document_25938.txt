The main difference between members of the plant kingdom and  members of the animal kingdom is the ability to produce food.  Plants can manufacture their own food while anim … als cannot.
L iving organisms are subdivided into 5 major kingdoms, including the Monera, the Protista (Protoctista), the Fungi, the Plantae, and the Animalia. Each kingdom is further subdivided into separate phyla or divisions. Generally animals are subdivided into phyla, while plants are subdivided into
All the kingdoms of eukaryotes, including Protista (Protoctista), Fungi, Plantae and Animalia, are placed in the domain Eukarya. The large molecular differences between the majority of prokaryotes in the kingdom Monera and the archaebacteria warrants a separation based on categories above the level of kingdom.
Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes. The six kingdoms of living things are divided into two major groups, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes. There are two prokaryote kingdoms and four eukaryote kingdoms. There are huge fundamental differences between the ways these two groups go about living. Here is just the briefest of distinctions.

Making the world better, one answer at a time. The major difference between the protist and the animal kingdom is protists are unicellular protozoans and unicellular & multicellular, but animals are multicellular animals. For example, you could say protists are heterotrophs or autotrophs, and animals are only heterotrophs.
The main difference is that the plant kingdom has cell walls, and the animal kingdom doesn't. Plants use photosynthesis to create energy from sunlight, while animals use metab … olism to create energy from food.
