BlackEnergy is the same malware that was used by a Russian cyberespioange group dubbed Sandworm to target organizations like the NATO alliance, energy firms and telecommunication companies. In an attack campaign exposed recently the group exploited a zero-day Windows vulnerability. “Multiple companies working with ICS-CERT have identified the malware on Internet-connected human-machine interfaces (HMIs),” the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a security advisory Tuesday.
However, this type of activity has not been noted and the malware remained on the compromised HMIs. ICS-CERT found no evidence that BlackEnergy tried to influence in any way the control processes on the victimized systems. Malware does not function at full capacity. According to the US ICS-CERT (Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team), the threat actors behind this BlackEnergy campaign targeted the HMI products of GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC.
Experts at ICS-CERT say that the BlackEnergy malware that has been seen infecting human-machine interface systems may be exploiting a recently patched vulnerability in the Siemens SIMATIC WinCC software in order to compromise some systems. The ICS-CERT originally issued an alert about the attacks by the venerable BlackEnergy malware in October, and at the time the group warned that the malware was targeting three specific HMI products: GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC.
A new type of Russian malware could have a disastrous impact on the US power grid. The malware, called BlackEnergy, is believed to be created by Russian hackers. What’s more disturbing, however, are allegations that BlackEnergy’s creators may have ties to the Russian government itself. 
An ongoing malicious campaign has compromised multiple industrial control systems (ICS) in the US by using a version of BlackEnergy toolkit on Internet-facing human-machine interfaces (HMI) from different vendors. Malware does not function at full capacity. According to the US ICS-CERT (Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team), the threat actors behind this BlackEnergy campaign targeted the HMI products of GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC.
ICS-CERT has not identified cases where the BlackEnergy malware was used to damage, modify or disrupt the processes controlled by the compromised HMIs and it’s not clear if attackers used those HMIs to gain deeper access into the industrial control systems. “Multiple companies working with ICS-CERT have identified the malware on Internet-connected human-machine interfaces (HMIs),” the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a security advisory Tuesday.
Malicious software that researchers think has been used by hackers to attack critical infrastructure systems, such as trains and power plants in Ukraine and Poland, has been found in similar American systems, the U.S. government says. 
Tweet. New research is shining a light on the ongoing evolution of the BlackEnergy malware, which has been spotted recently targeting government institutions in the Ukraine. Security researchers at ESET and F-Secure each have dived into the malware's evolution. BlackEnergy was first identified several years ago. In the case of BlackEnergy 3, the malware will only attempt to infect a system if the current user is a member of the local administration group. If not, it will re-launch itself as Administrator on Vista. This will trigger a User Account Control (UAC) prompt.
Ongoing cyber espionage campaign based on BlackEnergy malware hit targets in Poland, Ukraine and Belgium. BlackEnergy malware is still in the wild representing a serious threat, a new ‘Lite’ version of the malware has been detected by experts at ESET security firm. The term ‘LITE’ used to identify the new BlackEnergy variant, indicates that the malware is cheaper and with limited functionalities respect original strain. The e xperts noticed that the current version omits a kernel mode driver and doesn’t include the rootkit functionality used as an evasion techniqu e in the past.
