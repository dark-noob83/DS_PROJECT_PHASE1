For this reason, an initial dose of 25 mg, rather than 50 mg, is recommended to minimize cardiac safety concerns. Dosage may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 50 mg based on individual safety and tolerability considerations.
After oral administration of mirabegron in healthy volunteers, mirabegron is absorbed to reach maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) at approximately 3.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability increases from 29% at a dose of 25 mg to 35% at a dose of 50 mg.
Maximum mean increases from baseline in heart rate for the 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg dose groups compared to placebo were 6.7 beats per minutes (bpm), 11 bpm, and 17 bpm, respectively. In the clinical efficacy and safety studies, the change from baseline in mean pulse rate for MYRBETRIQ® 50 mg was approximately 1 bpm.
In a study of 352 healthy subjects assessing the effect of multiple daily doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg of MYRBETRIQ® for 10 days on the QTc interval, the maximum mean increase in supine SBP/DBP at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg was approximately 4.0/1.6 mm Hg greater than placebo.
Dosing Information. The recommended starting dose of MYRBETRIQ ® is 25 mg once daily with or without food. MYRBETRIQ ® 25 mg is effective within 8 weeks. Based on individual patient efficacy and tolerability the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)] . MYRBETRIQ ® should be taken with water, swallowed whole and should not be chewed, divided, or crushed.
The standard initial Myrbetriq dosage for treating symptoms of an overactive bladder is 25 mg once a day. This dose normally begins working within eight weeks. If this initial amount does not adequately control your symptoms, your healthcare provider may increase it to 50
The recommended starting dose of MYRBETRIQ® is 25 mg once daily with or without food. MYRBETRIQ® 25 mg is effective within 8 weeks. Based on individual patient efficacy and tolerability the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies ].
In another study in 96 healthy subjects to assess the impact of age on pharmacokinetics of multiple daily doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg of MYRBETRIQ® for 10 days, SBP also increased in a dose-dependent manner.
