In 2011, hospital stays cost a cumulative $387.3 billion, which averages out to about $10,000 per stay, according to a new statistical brief from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. 
They found: 1  The incremental costs incurred by patients on their last full day of hospital stay were $420 per day on average, or just 2.4 percent of the $17,734 average total cost. 2  End-of-stay costs represented only a slightly higher percentage of total costs when the length of stay was as short as four days. 1 The remaining 58 percent was hospital overhead. 2  The first day of admission cost $1,246 on average, while the cost of discharging a patient averaged $304. 3  Approximately 40 percent of the costs were incurred during the first 3 days.
Findings. Hospital costs by age, 2010. In 2010, the average cost per hospital stay was $9,700 and the aggregate cost for all hospital stays totaled $375.9 billion. Figures 1 and 2 show the distribution of aggregate hospital costs and stays by age and the average hospital cost per stay by age, respectively. Adults ages 45–64 and 65–84 had the highest average cost per. stay ($12,100 and $12,300, respectively).
Hospital and Surgery Costs. Total health care spending in America was approximately $2.7 trillion in 2011. A little over 31 percent of that amount, or $814 billion, was spent on hospital services. Hospital costs averaged $3,949 per day, and costs per stay averaged $15,734. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the total number of inpatient surgeries performed in 2009 was 48 million. In 2011, Medicare spent about $549 billion for benefit expenses; 24 percent of that amount — approximately $158 billion — was spent on inpatient hospital services. Approximately 36 million patients per year are admitted to U.S. hospitals, and Medicare pays 90 percent of the costs for almost 42 percent of them.

The figure above shows the rate of hospital stays and the average cost per stay for the twenty conditions with the highest total inpatient costs in 2009. Conditions are ordered by the aggregate costs of inpatient stays. Hospital stays for septicemia cost a total of $15.4 billion and occurred at a rate of 27 stays per 10,000 population. The average cost per stay was $18,500, about twice as much as the average cost for all stays. There were 135 hospital stays for liveborn (newborn infants) for every 10,000 population. These stays were responsible for $11.6 billion in hospital costs; each stay cost an average of $2,800. Stays for mood disorders cost a total of $4.3 billion; there were 28 of these stays per 10,000 population.
In 2012, mean hospital costs per stay for surgical stays ($21,200) were 2.5 times the mean costs for medical stays ($8,500) and approximately five times the mean costs for maternal and neonatal stays ($4,300). 5 ■ Medicare-covered stays had high mean hospital costs but slow growth between 2008 and 2012. Mean hospital costs in 2012 were highest for hospital stays billed to Medicare: $12,200 compared with $8,100 for Medicaid-covered stays, $8,800 for stays for uninsured patients, and $9,700 for privately insured stays.
Hospital stays can put a strain on your personal finances. The average cost of a one-day stay in the hospital is over $1,700.*. This valuable coverage provides fixed payments when you’re hospitalized to help cover out-of-pocket costs. Accidents and illnesses can happen-and sometimes result in an inpatient hospital stay. 
Charges are lower overseas, despite longer stays. The cost of the average American hospital stay nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010 while average stay length declined. The decade was a period of low inflation, but some sectors of the economy didn’t get the memo. 
■ Aggregate inflation-adjusted costs for hospital stays grew 3.8 percent annually between 1997 and 2010, with 2.9 percent attributed to an increase in the intensity of services (cost per stay) and 1.0 percent attributed to growth in the population. Figures 1 and 2 show the distribution of aggregate hospital costs and stays by age and the average hospital cost per stay by age, respectively. Adults ages 45–64 and 65–84 had the highest average cost per. stay ($12,100 and $12,300, respectively).
