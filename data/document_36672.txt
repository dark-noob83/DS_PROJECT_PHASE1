The question is difficult to answer for any population. Autism is not classified as a medical condition and it is not completely debilitating. The condition is not life threatening but some circumstances may potentially have a bearing on longevity.
Autism is not a life threatening disease and it is not a disease to start with on its own. It is a mental condition that causes hindrances in the regular growth of a child and not a physical condition that takes lives. So the myth that autistic children do not live long is a ‘myth’ and it is not true. They have and can lead the same normal life and have a life expectancy any normal person would have. Autism is a development disorder and people with this condition learn and do things differently than the others.
The average number of years an autistic person is expected to live is about 78 years old. Autism is not a life threatening disease and it is not a disease to start with on its own.
