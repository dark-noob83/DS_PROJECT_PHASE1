Anatomy of Sciatica. The sciatic nerve runs from the lower back, down through the hips and buttocks, and along the back of the leg into the foot. It actually originates from the L4 through S3 spinal nerves. It innervates the deep muscles of the buttocks and hips. Sciatica is a name given to pain caused by pressure placed on the sciatic nerve. When a nerve is placed under pressure it sends out pain signals. It may radiate down the length of the nerve or be focused in a specific area. The muscles innervated by the nerve may or may not be directly affected.
Piriformis syndrome usually starts with pain, tingling, or numbness in the buttocks. Pain can be severe and extend down the length of the sciatic nerve (called sciatica). The pain is due to the piriformis muscle compressing the sciatic nerve, such as while sitting on a car seat or running. A. Piriformis syndrome is an uncommon neuromuscular disorder that is caused when the piriformis muscle compresses the sciatic nerve. The piriformis muscle is a flat, band-like muscle located in the buttocks near the top of the hip joint.
The piriformis is a muscle found deep in the buttocks. The sciatic nerve runs very close to this muscle and tension in the muscle can cause compression of the sciatic nerve resulting in buttock pain which radiates and down the leg. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between sciatic pain caused by a disc problem, or piriformis syndrome. Symptoms usually but not always start with acute low back pain radiating down into the buttocks, back of the thigh and lower into the legs. Sciatic pain may be a sharp pain accompanied by tingling, pins and needles or numbness.
This is a large nerve that runs from the lower back down the back of each leg. When something injures or puts pressure on the sciatic nerve, it can cause pain in the lower back that spreads to the hip, buttocks, and leg. Up to 90% of people recover from sciatica without surgery. It connects the lower spine to the upper thighbone and runs directly over the sciatic nerve. If this muscle goes into spasm, it can put pressure on the sciatic nerve, triggering symptoms of sciatica. Piriformis syndrome is more common in women.
The sciatic nerve runs right through the belly of the piriformis muscle and if the piriformis muscle contracts from being overused, the sciatic nerve now becomes strangled, producing pain, tingling and numbness.

Pain caused by a compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve by a problem in the lower back is called sciatica. Common causes of sciatica include the following lower back and hip conditions: spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and piriformis syndrome. The sciatic nerve (/saɪˈaetɪk/ ; saɪˈætɪk also called ischiadic, nerve ischiatic) nerve is a large nerve in humans and other. Animals it begins in the lower back and runs through the buttock and down the lower. limb
The piriformis muscle can also irritate the nearby sciatic nerve and cause pain, numbness and tingling along the back of the leg and into the foot (similar to sciatic pain). 1  See What You Need to Know About Sciatica.

The piriformis is a muscle found deep inside the buttocks. It connects the lower spine to the upper thighbone and runs directly over the sciatic nerve. If this muscle goes into spasm, it can put pressure on the sciatic nerve, triggering symptoms of sciatica. Piriformis syndrome is more common in women.
Sciatica in the buttocks is one of the most common and severe symptoms reported by lower body radiculopathy patients. The buttocks are key components of the postural muscles and are instrumental in facilitating many of the common everyday movements we take for granted, such as standing upright and walking. True sciatica is defined as a set of neurological symptoms occurring in the lower body, caused by a spinal source, such as a herniated disc, osteoarthritic condition or abnormal spinal curvature concern.
