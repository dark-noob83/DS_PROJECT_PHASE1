Conversely, all higher center frequencies for 1/2-octave bands can be defined from each other using the formula 121 2 ctr ctr fnn + = f. Then for each center frequency, the 1/4-octave low (high) frequency for each 1/2-octave band are (respectively) given by the formulae low 2 14 ffnn = and high 2 14 fnn = f. If we set/define the 13 th half-octave band’s center frequency to be 13 1000 f ctr ≡ Hz, then all lower center frequencies for 1/2-octave bands can be defined from each other using the formula 121 2 ctr ctr ffnn − = .
1/3-Octave Bands: The audio spectrum from ~ 20 Hz to ~ 20 KHz can be divided up into ~ 31 1/3-octave bands. If we set/define the 19 th 1/3-octave band’s center frequency to be 19 1000 f ctr ≡ Hz, then all lower center frequencies for 1/3-octave bands can be defined from each other using the formula 13 ff nn −1 = 2. If we set/define the 13 th half-octave band’s center frequency to be 13 1000 f ctr ≡ Hz, then all lower center frequencies for 1/2-octave bands can be defined from each other using the formula 121 2 ctr ctr ffnn − = .
In acoustical measurements, Sound Pressure Level is often measured in octave bands, and the centre frequencies of these bands are defined by ISO - 31.5 Hz, 63 Hz, 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, 16 kHz to divide the audio spectrum into 10 equal parts. 
1 A frequency band in which the ratio of the upper frequency limit to the lower frequency limit is. 2  to one third of an octave. 3  The 1000 Hz one-third octave band, for instance, comprises frequencies ranging from about 891 Hz to 1122 Hz. 1 to one third of an octave. 2  The 1000 Hz one-third octave band, for instance, comprises frequencies ranging from about 891 Hz to 1122 Hz. 3  Also called one-third octave frequency band, or third octave band.

Conversely, all higher center frequencies for octave bands can be defined from each other using the formula 1 2 ctr ctr fnn + = f. Then for each center frequency, the half-octave low (high) frequency for each octave band are (respectively) given by the formulae low 2 12 ffnn = and high 2 12 fnn = f. If we set/define the 13 th half-octave band’s center frequency to be 13 1000 f ctr ≡ Hz, then all lower center frequencies for 1/2-octave bands can be defined from each other using the formula 121 2 ctr ctr ffnn − = .
A one-third octave band is defined as a frequency band whose upper band-edge frequency (f2) is the lower band frequency (f1) times the cube root of two. Analyzing a source on a frequency by frequency basis is possible but time consuming. The whole frequency range is divided into set of frequencies called bands. Each band covers a specific range of frequencies. For this reason, a scale of octave bands and one-third octave bands has been developed
This may be an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) or information in 1/12 octaves. An octave band is a frequency band where the highest frequency is twice the lowest frequency. For example, an octave filter with a centre frequency of 1kHz has a lower frequency of 707Hz and an upper frequency of 1.414kHz. Any frequencies below and above these limits are rejected. A third octave has a width of 1/3 of that of an octave band. 
Octave and one-third octave frequency bands. An octave refers to the interval between one frequency and its double or its half. There is one octave band between frequencies 1 000 Hz and 2 000 Hz. There is another one octave band between 1 000 Hz and 500 Hz. This frequency representation is linked to the perception of sound by a human ear and it allows a compression of the amount of information. An important part of the information is however lost when converting results from narrow frequency bands to octave or
