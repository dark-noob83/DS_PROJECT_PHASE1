The integrated phage DNA is called a prophage, and the bacterium is now a lysogen. Phage that do this are lysogenic. Induction of the lysogen will result in excision of the prophage and multiplication to produce many progeny, i.e. it enters a lytic phase in which the bacteria are broken open and destroyed.
In the other population of cells, the injected phage chromosome turns OFF all the phage genes except one. The single phage chromosome called the prophage now becomes a part of the host chromosome. The bacterium carrying the dormant phage chromosome is called the lysogen.
In the Lysogenic cycle – chromosome Viral DNA is inserted into the host chromosome by recombination. – Viral DNA is duplicated along with the host chromosome during each cell division. – The inserted phage DNA is called a prophage. – Most prophage genes are inactive. – Environmental signals can cause a switch to the lytic cycle, causing the viral DNA to be excised from the bacterial chromosome and leading to the death of the host cell.
15. A bacterium carrying a dormant phage inserted in the chromosome is called a __________. 16. Bacteriophage T4 blocks transcription of host genes using an enzyme that transfers an ______ from NAD onto the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase. 17. __________ is an unusual base found in the DNA of T-even phages. 18.
prophage. the latent stage of a bacteriophage in a lysogenic bacterium, in which the viral genome becomes inserted into a specific portion of the host chromosome and is duplicated into each cell generation.
