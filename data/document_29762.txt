What we can do is help you find your car s paint code numbers. These paint color codes are linked to manufacturer-specified colors, so if you know your car s manufacturer and paint codes, then you can get exactly the color you want. Automotive paint codes are usually printed on your car s VIN plate or label.
VIN (Vehicle Identification Number). The vehicle identification number (VIN) uniquely identifies your vehicle. It is very long and consists of numbers and letters. For example, WAULC78E91A128656 is an example of a VIN from an Audi. This number is on your registration, your vehicle title and also on the vehicle itself. The VIN will be visible through the windshield on the drivers side of your vehicle. It is often stamped in other places such as the drivers door jamb.
VIN (Vehicle Identification Number). We ask for the VIN to help us match your paint. However, the VIN does not give us your color code! It only gives us any paint formula variance in an existing color code. Make sure you have found the color code on your vehicle.
The VIN, or vehicle identification number of your car will not tell you what paint codes you need to match for your car. The VIN is a 17 digit number that has various sections.
The quickest way to get the right car paint code is to use the unique VIN number for your car. This VIN is the Vehicle Identification Number. Once you have found out the VIN of your car, you can order the correct auto paint without having to look far for matching color tones or paint types.
