The timing belt sells for around $89. The labor time guide calls for 4.2 hours to complete the job. Most local shops will also recommend that you replace the water pump at the same time, seeing as the belt runs the water pump, and while you're in there you should replace it as a preventative measure. My position is that the dealer either does the replacement of the timing belt and water pump, and I will buy the car at the cost they offered ($300 off their list price) OR they take more money off the price of the car since I will have to have the timing belt work done.

The 2.7 is a great motor and it will not hurt for you to wait on the replacement for now. Ive seen 2.7's go a long ways on the original belt, but better safe than sorry. 1  Share
