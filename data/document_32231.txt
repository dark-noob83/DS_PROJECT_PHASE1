Simple carbohydrates, like refined sugar, white bread and soda, cause your insulin levels to spike, which leads to what Dr. Perricone describes as a burst of inflammation throughout the body.. Inflammation produces enzymes that break down collagen and elastin, resulting in sagging skin and wrinkles.
3. Dairy products. Dairy can cause inflammation because your body recognizes it as a foreign invader and fights it with an inflammatory response. Thatâ€™s because the human body does not process the high levels of protein (casein) or sugar (lactose) in dairy products well. 4. Red meat. Eating red meat produces a chemical called Neu5gc.
How Inflammation Develops. People with type 2 diabetes don't produce enough insulin or their bodies can't use the insulin adequately. Insulin is a hormone that is made by cells in the pancreas. It controls the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin may also have an impact on tissue in the body.
One of the reasons inflammation occurs is from a rapid rise in blood sugar, which causes biochemical changes in the cell. Staying away from sugar and high-glycemic (simple) carbohydrates, which the body rapidly converts to sugar, is one of the best ways to decrease inflammation. C-reactive protein (CPR) is a key factor of
1. Sugars. Pro-inflammatory Agent: Excessive sugar intake causes tooth decay and has been linked to increased risks of obesity, inflammation and chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Recently, it has also finally been proven that sugar, as well as dairy, are the causes of acne.
Eating foods that you are allergic to destabilizes your insulin and causes poor blood sugar levels, which leads to greater inflammation. A high level of insulin increases cortisol, your stress hormone, which causes your body to hold on to fat rather than allowing you to burn it for energy.
