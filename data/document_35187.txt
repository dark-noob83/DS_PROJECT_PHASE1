For example, if the rentable square footage is 1,130 and the price is $1 per square foot, your monthly lease amount is $1,130. If the usable space is 1,000 square feet, the cost per square foot of the space that you are leasing is $1.13.
Letâ€™s say the office space you are renting is physically 500 square feet (the usable square feet) is priced at $1.25 per square foot. Your usable square foot rent would be $625 per month (500 SF x $1.25). However, your portion of the common area adds another 100 square feet. Your rent will actually be calculated based on 600 square feet, not the 500 you will actually occupy.

Make The Calculation. Divide the monthly rent amount by the size of your space. If your gross rent is $3,000 per month and your rentable square footage is 300 square feet, the lease costs $10 per square foot. If your net rent is $2,500 and your expenses are $500, then your total rent is $3,000. On a space with 273 usable square feet and rentable square feet of 300, then the cost per rentable square feet is also $3,000 divided by 300, or
Divide the monthly rent amount by the size of your space. If your gross rent is $3,000 per month and your rentable square footage is 300 square feet, the lease costs $10 per square foot.
