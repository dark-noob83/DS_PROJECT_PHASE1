When we are talking about how many feet are in one acre 1, of course, we mean square feet 2, because acres and square feet are units of area and a foot is a length unit. Everybody can imagine an area of a square foot, but it is not so easy to visualize an acre. A good example comes from sport
Step 3. Determine the number of acres you wish to calculate into square feet. Let's use our example number of 37.5 acres. Multiply the number of acres you wish to calculate into square feet by 43,560---the number of square feet in an acre. In our example, we would multiply 37.5 times 43,560 for a result of 1,633,500. Divide the total number of square feet by 1.000002 if you want to be extremely precise. 
The answer is 43560. We assume you are converting between square foot and acre. You can view more details on each measurement unit: square feet or acre. The SI derived unit for area is the square meter. 1 square meter is equal to 10.7639104167 square feet, or 0.000247105381467 acre. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results.
An acre is a measure of land area in Imperial units or U.S. customary units. It is equal to 43 560 square feet, 4840 square yards, or 160 square rods.

The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is defined as the area of 1 chain (22 yards) by 1 furlong (220 yards), which is exactly equal to 1⁄640 of a square mile, approximately 4,046.856 m 2, or about 40% of a hectare. One acre equals 0.0015625 square miles, 4,840 square yards, 43,560 square feet or about 4,047 square metres (0.405 hectares) (see below).
Now that we know a bit about acres and square feet, we can move to conversion of these units and find out how many square feet there are in an acre. One US customary acre is equivalent to 43 560 square feet, 4840 square yards, or about 4047 square meters. There are also some other types of acres, used in various countries: Irish acre (7843 yd), Roman acre (1260 m), Cheshire acre (10240 yd), etc.
There are 43,560 square feet in one acre.   An acre is a unit of area. 640 acres equal a square mile. Hence, it is 1/640 of a square mile. Since a square mile contains 2 … 7,878,400 square feet, an acre is 27,878,400 divided by 640, which is 43,560 square feet. Remember: an acre can be converted to SQUARE feet, not plain (linear) feet. Square feet and feet are not the same units. A foot is unit of distance.
There are 43,560 square feet in a acre; this is 4,840 square yards. You can find a conversion calculator at http://www.unitconversion.org/area/acres-to-square-foots-conversion.html Originally, the size of an acre was approximately the amount of land an ox could plow in a day.
