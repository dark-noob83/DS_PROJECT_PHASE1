If you make an early withdrawal from a Roth IRA that is not a qualified distribution, the IRS slaps you with a 10 percent additional tax penalty. You will need to record non-qualified, early distributions on your tax return, and you are responsible for paying income tax on those amounts, plus the 10 percent penalty. The upside of a Roth, however, is that when you tap the account at retirement--age 59 1/2--distributions are tax-free. Roth IRAs also offer a wider array of early withdrawal options, relative to traditional IRAs, but special rules apply.
In the simplest terms, not accounting for compounding, fees, dividends, and other factors, your earnings are $272.50. That means your account total is $5,272.50. Under Roth IRA rules (check IRS Publication 590 for more information), you can withdraw up to $5,000 without paying taxes on it, and without paying a penalty. Once you dip into your earnings – that $272.50 – the story changes. You can withdraw what you have contributed at anytime, and for any reason. 
In 2012, you withdraw $8,000 from your Roth. The first $5,000 is free from tax and penalty because it’s a return of your contributions. The next $3,000 is assumed to come from the taxable portion of your converted amount. Example: During 2011, you contribute $5,000 to a Roth IRA. You also convert $20,000 from a traditional IRA into your Roth IRA. Of that $20,000, $13,000 was taxable upon the conversion, and $7,000 was not because it came from nondeductible IRA
Penalty-Free Withdrawals. At any time, you may withdraw contributions from your Roth IRA both tax-and penalty-free. If you use the withdrawal to purchase your first home, the money is penalty-free. This applies to a maximum of $10,000, and the money must be used within 120 days. Also penalty-free are withdrawals made to pay for qualified educational expenses.
There is no penalty for withdrawing Roth IRA contributions, only earnings. A withdrawal is considered early if made before the contributor reaches age 59.5. Penalties are not to be confused with ordinary income tax applied to non-qualified distributions. If you use the withdrawal to purchase your first home, the money is penalty-free. This applies to a maximum of $10,000, and the money must be used within 120 days. Also penalty-free are withdrawals made to pay for qualified educational expenses.
Penalties on Earnings from Contributions. Unless an exception applies, most distributions from a Roth IRA before the owner reaches age 59 1/2 will be subject to an early withdrawal penalty of 10% on the amount of the distribution. 1 She'll also pay a 10% penalty, but only on the $2,000 taxable distribution. 2  The other $2,000 is tax-and penalty-free since it came from prior non-deductible contributions to the IRA. 3  She can convert the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and then take the $4,000 distribution. 4  This is a bad choice for Karin.
To withdraw earnings without paying taxes or penalties, you must follow the rules.The first requirement is that the withdrawal must be taken five years or more after the account is open. The IRS counts the five years from the first day of the tax year in which you make your first Roth contribution. In other words, if you open the account on Nov. 1, 2012, the IRS actually starts the clock at the beginning of the tax year, that is, Jan. 1, 2012 (and when the IRS gives you a gift like that, you take it).
In 2001, before he is age 59 1/2, Paul withdraws $10,000 from the Roth IRA. Paul will have no tax to pay on this withdrawal because he paid income taxes on the full $20,000 he converted in 1998; however, he WILL have to pay a 10% penalty (or $1,000) unless one of the IRA early withdrawal exceptions apply. 1 She'll also pay a 10% penalty, but only on the $2,000 taxable distribution. 2  The other $2,000 is tax-and penalty-free since it came from prior non-deductible contributions to the IRA. 3  She can convert the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and then take the $4,000 distribution. 4  This is a bad choice for Karin.
However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties on earnings in your Roth IRA. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA you've had less than five years.

This means you can take out your retirement money without penalty, and because Roth earnings are tax-free, you'll have no IRS bill, either. If, however, you opened your Roth IRA less than five years ago, the withdrawal is an early distribution. As with a traditional IRA early withdrawal, a Roth holder can use the first-home exception to avoid the 10 percent penalty but might owe tax on earnings that are withdrawn.
