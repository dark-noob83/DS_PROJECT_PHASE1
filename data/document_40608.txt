The Normans were people who lived in Normandy in Northern France. They were originally Vikings from Scandinavia. (The name Normandy comes from the French normand, meaning Norsemen and Normans).
ORIGIN OF NORMANS AND NAME. The Normans, as a race, originated in the Scandinavian peninsula, composed of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. At first these bold and adventurous sea rovers were known as Northman or Norsemen. Between the eighth and ninth centuries they invaded Europe and even came to North American before the time of Columbus, it is said.
The Normans that invaded England in 1066 came from Normandy in Northern France.
The Vikings who stayed in France became known as the Normans (Northmen). The first great Norman leader was Rollo the Ganger. After a fierce battle in 911 between the French and the Normans, a peace-settlement was agreed.
The Normans spoke French but were not French. They were actually from Scandinavia. Their name actually comes from Norse Men or North Men. In familiar terms, they were Vikings (though that term gets used way to often) that settled on the coast of France.
The Normans were actually Vikings who had invaded and settled in the Normandy region of France for a few centuries. Richard Fitzgilbert de Clare known as Strongbow was a Norman Lord who came from England to Ireland at the urging of Diarmaid Mac Murchadha. Diarmaid was the King of Leinster who had fled to Britain.
