Green anoles aren’t hard to mate, and females lay fertile eggs, but the babies can be very difficult to keep alive until old enough to take care of themselves. Photo Credit: Tom Adams. Relatively few breeders succeed in breeding green anole lizards. First, change your cage. A 20-gallon-long tank will house several anoles, but it really won’t give the male the proper sites to set up a territory. You want a taller terrarium — one double the height of the 20 gallon long.
Green anole lizard eggs hatch in four to six weeks when incubated at 80 to 85 degrees with about 80 percent humidity. The babies are tiny versions of their parents, though they usually are brownish in color and have relatively large heads and short tails. First, change your cage. A 20-gallon-long tank will house several anoles, but it really won’t give the male the proper sites to set up a territory. You want a taller terrarium — one double the height of the 20 gallon long.
Q. I’m trying to breed my green anole lizards, and I want to know how I should go about doing this. I have one male and three female green anoles in a 20-gallon-long tank, and I am thinking of getting more. Please give me some advice about how I should encourage them to breed. First, change your cage. A 20-gallon-long tank will house several anoles, but it really won’t give the male the proper sites to set up a territory.

Part 1 of 4: Preparing to Breed. 1. Get a male and female leopard gecko. The males have hemipenal bulges below the vent whereas females do not. Males and females both have a V-shaped row of scales above the vent but only the male's scales here are hollow and produce wax. This wax is for scent marking their territory. It is sometimes normal when first introducing a male and female for there to be a little squabbling but this usually stops within the first week. 1  For a pair you will need at least a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long tank.
Lizards can be ready to mate when they are a year old for most of the small and medium species. For the larger ones it may be two or three years of age. There are a few species of Lizards that take part in asexual reproduction. This means that they don’t need to find a mate in order for them to be able to produce offspring. They have the ability to create the young on their own
Before setting up a pair of bearded dragons for breeding, it is essential that the habitat is correct for the species. There should be a temperature gradient of 77 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit with a focal basking spot of 105 degrees. I have a 1½-year-old female beardie in a 55-gallon tank, and we decided that we want to mate her, so we purchased a male of the same size. They seem to be doing OK together – no aggression or anything.
1 Have your veterinarian check your bearded dragons’ ages, lengths, and weights. 2  For optimal breeding, the male should be at least 18 months old and the female should be at least 24 months old. 3  They should both be at least 18 inches in length from snout to tail. 1 For optimal breeding, the male should be at least 18 months old and the female should be at least 24 months old. 2  They should both be at least 18 inches in length from snout to tail. 3  The female should weigh at least 350 grams.
When it comes to reproduction for the Lizard it often depends on their location and the specific species. For example some of them lay eggs and others give birth to live young because the eggs develop inside the mother. For the larger ones it may be two or three years of age. There are a few species of Lizards that take part in asexual reproduction. This means that they don’t need to find a mate in order for them to be able to produce offspring.
In some Central and South American countries, people eat lizard eggs. Most female lizards lay eggs. But the females of some species give birth to live young. Among lizards that do lay eggs, most eggs require several weeks or even a few months to hatch. The eggs of a panther chameleon may need 240 or more days to develop before hatching.

When the male lizard is close enough to the female lizard he will then take hold of her by biting her on the neck. He will then be able to hook onto her with his hemipenes. These are like hooks that connect to the female. After this he will ejaculate his sperm through his penis and hemipenes and into the female lizard.
