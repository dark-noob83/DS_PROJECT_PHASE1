Liking things on Facebook is a great way to show your support for your favorite shows, products, and causes, but it sure can clutter up your Newsfeed. If you’re drowning in updates and want to simplify your Facebook life, maybe it’s time to unlike a few of your more outdated Pages. Follow this guide to learn how.
To resize a hidden ticker, click and hold the horizontal bar above chat, and move it down. Note: Ticker only shows up when there's a certain amount of activity from the people or Pages you're connected with. If you'd like to see more activity, you can:
Now you will notice this post: If I comment on this post, it will not go into the Ticker of all my friends. It will only show up in the Ticker of my friends who are also friends of Benjamin’s because that is who he allowed the post to be shared with.
If you wanted your friend’s comments and Likes to not show up in your Ticker (maybe the Like too much or are an over-commenter) you can uncheck that activity as the message suggests like this: But doing this for others has no affect on hackers.
I highly discourage that because some things are only showing up in the Ticker and not in the News Feed. Many Page posts are not being seen in the News Feed even if you like the page. Which is a bit frustrating and I will have more tips on how to combat that problem in the future. Hope that helps clear up some of the mystery around the Facebook Ticker.
This only affects the news feed, not the ticker. And you'd have to do it for each type of activity from each friend individually. When you get the ticker, you'll see the difference: it announces every comment and like that any of your friends posts, neither of which show up in the news feed.
If you don't see ticker, you may have hidden it. To show a hidden ticker: 1  If the chat sidebar is closed, click Chat at the bottom right to open it. 2  Click at the bottom of the sidebar. 3  Select Show Ticker.
