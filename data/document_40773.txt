However, for the most part, millipedes are scavengers. They eat dead leaves and bits of decaying wood. If water becomes scarce, millipedes will sometimes eat leaves and roots of living plants for the moisture they contain. Although they do not bite, some millipedes defend themselves another way. They produce an unpleasant-smelling liquid from glands on their sides.
Some cite the fact that secretions from the millipede repel other insects as a reason why they are beneficial. While millipedes do not bite, the sight of them can still be unnerving, especially when they appear in large numbers. They have the ability to crawl up walls and enter homes through small openings.
Contrary to popular belief, millipedes do not bite. They are safe and harmless insects that some people actually keep as pets. Millipedes’ main diet consists of plant material that has decomposed. They tend to reside in damp, dark places—beneath flower pots, boards, stones, or wherever there is excess moisture. Millipedes may enter buildings in large groups just after a rainfall or during times of cooler temperatures.
Individuals may live for several years. Millipedes are attracted to dark, cool, moist environments that are rich in organic matter such as compost piles, heavily mulched shrub or flower beds, rotting logs, or the soil under logs and stones. They usually go unnoticed because they live in these relatively hidden habitats.
