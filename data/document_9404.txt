Types of Roundworms. There are a number of different species of roundworms but the most common ones to infect humans include: 1  Ascaris lumbricoides (most common roundworm infections in humans). 2  Hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus). 3  Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis).
Some of the most common types of Roundworms include Pinworms or Threadworms, Hookworms, Ascaris (a word that literally means ‘intestinal worm’) and Heartworms. Roundworms have hollow bodies and openings at either end and generally grow between 2-5 inches long.
Roundworms live in salt water, fresh water and the soil. Eating contaminated foods or getting worms from contaminated pets is the most usual way to get roundworms (a category of worms). Hookworms and pinworms are often the most common types of roundworms found in humans.
Roundworms are parasitic worms (helminths) that belong to the phylum Nematoda. In other words, roundworms is the common name for one type of parasitic worm known as nematodes. These worms are elongated, have a large body cavity and an intestinal system. Most roundworms that parasitize humans live in the gut.
Pinworms are the most common type of roundworm infection in the U.S. These infections most frequently affect children but adult family members can be easily infected as well. Itching around the anus -- where these tiny worms lay their eggs -- is the only major symptom. Pinworm infections are easy to diagnose and treat.
