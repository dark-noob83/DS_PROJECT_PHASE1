Reverse mortgages are usually more expensive than other home loans. The cost will depend on the type of loan you choose, how much money you take out upfront, and the lender that you choose. With a reverse mortgage, you’ll be charged in two ways: upfront and over time. Upfront costs include lender fees, upfront mortgage insurance, and real estate closing costs. Your upfront mortgage insurance charge is based on the size of your loan, and how much you choose to take out in the first year.
