If your mortgage lender requires you to pay for mortgage insurance as a condition of your home loan, you may be able to deduct those payments on your income taxes. The IRS refers to payments that qualify for the deduction as qualified mortgage insurance premiums..
This part explains what you can deduct as home mortgage interest. It includes discussions on points, mortgage insurance premiums, and how to report deductible interest on your tax return. Generally, home mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan secured by your home (main home or a second home).
Deductible Amount. The agency that receives your mortgage insurance premiums must report to you the payments you made on IRS Form 1098 if they total at least $600 for the year.
The deduction for qualified mortgage insurance premiums phases out quickly if your adjusted gross income is more than $100,000. You must reduce your deduction by 10 percent for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income over $100,000. If your adjusted gross income is over $109,000, you cannot claim the deduction at all.
FHA Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premiums. The FHA's current upfront mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP) is 1.75 percent of your loan size. For example, if you use an FHA-backed mortgage for a purchase mortgage and your loan size is $300,000, then your Upfront MIP will be 1.75 percent of $300,000, or $5,250. Upfront MIP is not paid as cash.
Mortgage insurance premiums may be tax deductible. To qualify, the insurance policy must be for home acquisition debt on a first or second home. Home acquisition debt are loans whose proceeds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve your residence.
