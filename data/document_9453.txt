Fahrenheit temperature scale is a scale based on 32 for the freezing point of water and 212 for the boiling point of water, the interval between the two being divided into 180 parts. Celsius temperature scale also called centigrade temperature scale, is the scale based on 0 for the freezing point of water and 100 for the boiling point of water.
Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale is 1/180 of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point of water. Absolute zero is defined as -459.67°F. A temperature difference of 1°F is the equivalent of a temperature difference 0.556°C. 
In this scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. To convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius use this formula: Fahrenheit Temperature = (Celsius Temperature)x(9/5) + 32. There are also temperature scales in which zero is absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature. (People have gotten close to absolute zero, but have never reached it. According to theory, we never will.) Absolute zero is at -273.15 Celsius, or -459.67 Fahrenheit. The Kelvin temperature scale uses the same size degree as Celsius, but has its zero set to absolute zero. To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, add 273.15 to the Celsius reading. The Rankine temperature scale uses the same size degree as Fahrenheit, but has its zero set to absolute zero. To convert from Fahrenheit to Rankine, add 459.67 to the Fahrenheit reading. To convert from Kelvin to Rankine, multiply the Kelvin temperature by 9/5
On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water are 100 degrees apart. A temperature interval of 1 °F is equal to an interval of 5⁄9 degrees Celsius. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect at −40° (−40 °F and −40 °C represent the same temperature). Absolute zero is −273.15 °C or −459.67 °F. The Rankine temperature scale uses degree intervals of the same size as those of the Fahrenheit scale, except that absolute zero is 0 R—the same way that the Kelvin temperature scale matches the Celsius scale, except that absolute zero is 0 K. Fahrenheit (symbol °F) is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736), after whom the scale is named. There exist several accounts of how he originally defined his scale.
Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale is 1/180 of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point of water. Absolute zero is defined as -459.67°F. A temperature difference of 1°F is the equivalent of a temperature difference 0.556°C. Origin: 
Absolute zero. In 1848, Kelvin used this as a basis for an absolute temperature scale. He defined absolute as the temperature at which molecules would stop moving, or infinite cold.. From absolute zero, he used the same unit as Celsius to determine the increments. Absolute zero cannot technically be achieved.
The freezing point is taken as 32°F and the boiling point as 212°F. The scale was established by the German-Dutch physicist Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit in 1724. William John Macquorn Rankine used it as the basis of his absolute temperature scale, now called the Rankine temperature scale, in 1859.

The Kelvin (K) is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. The temperature 0 K is commonly referred to as absolute zero.. On the widely used Celsius temperature scale, water freezes at 0 °C and boils at about 100 °C. One Celsius degree is an interval of 1 K, and zero degrees Celsius if 273.15 K. An interval of one Celsius degree corresponds to an interval of 1.8 Fahrenheit degrees on the Fahrenheit temperature scale.
1 At high temperatures, degrees Celsius and Kelvins become equal as the difference of 273.15 between them gets lost in the noise. - 2 40° Celsius and -40° Fahrenheit are equal. 3  Zero Kelvins is absolute zero. 4  Body temperature. 5  Boiling point of water. 6  Freezing point of water.
