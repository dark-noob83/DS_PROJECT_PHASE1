The computer supplies a voltage bias on the O2 sensor signal wire of about 0.450 volts, and the O2 sensor will either pull down this voltage (when the exhaust is lean) or pull it up (when the exhaust is rich). The O2 sensor is one of the most vital sensors used on the engine. It is responsible for helping the computer make adjustments to the fuel mixture (air/fuel ratio, or AFR) delivered to
Circuit Description. The PCM supplies a bias voltage (approximately 450 mV) on the Heated Oxygen Sensor (HO2S) signal high and low circuits. When you turn the ignition to the ON position, battery voltage is supplied to the HO2S heater. When you start the engine the PCM monitors the HO2S voltage. When the HO2S voltage goes above or below the bias range threshold, the PCM determines how much time it took. If the PCM detects that the process took too much time for the HO2S to enter into normal operating range, a DTC sets.
Linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) is a specific type of PCM where the quantization levels are linearly uniform. This is in contrast to PCM encodings where quantization levels vary as a function of amplitude (as with the A-law algorithm or the μ-law algorithm). 
The sensor creates its own signal to send to the PCM. The PCM does not send a voltage, and yes alldata is the carbon copy of GM manuals so it is correct. Test for the hertz reading from the sensor not the PCM. If that is good then either grounds on the engine are bad or the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) is bad.
Confidence votes 115. DC Bias voltage is what one would apply to an AC signal to make all parts of the signal have the same polarity. One application of DC bias is in amplification. The audio signal from a microphone or detector is an AC signal, with both positive and negative polarities at different times. bias voltage is the voltage which make circuit conductive or you can say that when we apply voltage through bais in transistor it make current flowing in emitter and collector … and make whole circuit conductive.

The signal output of an ICP® sensor is a low impedance voltage signal proportional to the dynamic measurement such as force, pressure, or vibration. This voltage signal is carried on a DC bias voltage. Using Bias Voltage as a Diagnostic Tool. Piezoelectric sensors are dynamic measuring equipment. They use piezoelectric sensing elements to convert or transduce the mechanical phenomena to an electrical signal. The mechanical parameter may be
Phase-change memory (also known as PCM, PCME, PRAM, PCRAM, Ovonic Unified Memory, Chalcogenide RAM and C-RAM) is a type of non-volatile random-access memory. PRAMs exploit the unique behaviour of chalcogenide glass. This burst of voltage is provided by a charge pump, which takes some time to build up power. General write times for common Flash devices are on the order of 0.1ms (for a block of data), about 10,000 times the typical 10 ns read time, for SRAM for example (for a byte).
9) O2 sensors tend to fail on rich bias. In other words, they tend to shift their cycling to the upper side or rich side of the voltage scale. 10) Contrary to what many people think, an O2 sensor WILL NOT cycle by itself. The O2 sensor cycle is a direct result of the ECM response to the changes in the mixture. An O2 sensor stuck at a fixed bias voltage is an indication of an open O2 circuit or lack of O2 sensor (dedicated) ground. If possible use a graphing multi-meter to analyze the O2 sensor data to determine any possible problems.
The reason for the computer supplying a bias voltage is for diagnostic purposes. O2 Sensor Diagnostics. As I just discussed, the computer supplies a bias voltage signal to the O2 sensor any time the key is on. This is done so the computer can monitor if the O2 sensor is warm enough to start operating. As mentioned before, a cold O2 sensor outputs no voltage signal. The O2 sensor is one of the most vital sensors used on the engine. It is responsible for helping the computer make adjustments to the fuel mixture (air/fuel ratio, or AFR) delivered to
