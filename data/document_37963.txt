Travel and Passport Expiration. Some foreign countries require U.S. passports to be valid at least six months before travel. Certain airlines will not allow U.S. citizens to fly if the passport requirement for the country to which they are traveling is not met.
It depends on what country issued your passport. If you have a British Passport, and renew it early, then Time left on your existing passport will be added to your new one-up to a maximum of 9 months. Thus you can have a British passport with an expiry date 10 years and 9 months into the future.
I have a valid passport. You can apply for a new passport up to 12 months before your current passport expires. Please note that if you apply for a new passport before your current passport expires, the unused validity period of your current passport will not be transferred to your new passport.
What to do if your passport will expire in less than six months: 1  Contact the host countryâ€™s embassy or consulate to see if you can get a special visa for travel within the expiration period. 2  Renew your passport. 3  Apply for an expedited renewal.
Most countries require that a passport be valid for at least six months beyond the completion of a trip. If your passport expires sooner than that, you must apply to renew your passport. Please view the Visas section to determine how long a passport must be valid for each specific country of travel.
