as a newfound foodie i was excited about eating at can can but in the end i was somewhat disappointed although i have to agree with other reviews that the hostess staff was a little pretentious i also ov view more erheard them gawk and sneer some of the people outside of the restaurant
if you end up coming at one of those time get ready for a potentially long wait or plan ahead and make reservations all that said their is better food in richmond for less think of dutch and company magpie s etc where you can pay for a more refined three course meal for the price of one plate at can can

carytown is easy to get to even with the uci bike race going on downtown don t be a afraid to enjoy the weather and the shops in carytown but please stop in for lunch dinner or even a cup of coffee while you re here we are open normal hours all week
can can brasserie isn t a brewery nor are there any high kicking dancers in case you were wondering but it is just about everything else food and beverage related you can imagine a restaurant raw bar patisserie boulangerie coffeehouse breakfast spot and late night bar destination mon dieu
silvanos i was surprised to see all the negative reviews of can can here because my experiences at can can have been positive my first experience at can can was for dinner early in 2007 the food was enjoyable and our waiter was fine if a little on the stuffy side
