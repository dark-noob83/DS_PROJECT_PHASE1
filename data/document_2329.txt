The price per square metre also depends on the size of the property. There are basic costs that don't increase too much with size and hence the cost per square metre will decrease as the floor area increases. The price for a home extension depends on several factors. 1  Where you are in the country.
You can expect to pay around £500 - £1650 per metre square for a single storey extension. A double storey extension can cost between £500 - £1500 per meter square. Planning costs can cost between £1000 - £27000, although the average price is around £5100. Basic conservatories cost around £500 per square metre to supply and fit. If the ground needs levelling this price will increase.
Most builders can give you an idea of what your extension will cost per square foot or metre. For example, a basic single storey extension would typically cost around £1,000 per square metre but it could be up to £1,600 or more for a premium two storey extension. So a 3 x 5 metre extension would cost £15,000 and up to £50,000 for a two storey, more premium extension. These costs are just to create a room, they would not typically include the cost of a kitchen or bathroom.
Extensions are more expensive: RICS gives a guide cost of between £1,260 and £1,680 per square metre for an extension with plastered finish. So a 20-square metre single-storey extension will range from £25,200 to £33,600 – before you've put down flooring or installed a kitchen.
It would not be unreasonable to target costs for the total build of an Extension, excluding professional fees and local authority charges, at around £1,200 to £1,800 per square metre, i.e. say £110 to £170 per square foot.
