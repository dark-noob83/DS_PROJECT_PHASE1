Skin-associated lymphoid tissue. Streilein JW. Skin-associated lymphoid tissues represents a conceptual framework on which an understanding of cutaneous immunity can be built. It is clear that regional specialization of the immune system exist, and one such specialization is represented by SALT.

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is scattered along mucosal linings in the human body and constitutes the most extensive component of human lymphoid tissue.
The lymphoid tissue consists of mesh-like areas of connective tissues within the body containing white blood cells, most commonly lymphocytes. This tissue and lymphatic vessels, which transport clear body fluid called lymph to the heart, comprise the lymphatic system.
Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. MALT stands for mucosa associated lymphoid tissue. This means that the lymphoma starts in the mucosa. The mucosa is a moist tissue that lines body organs and cavities including your nose, mouth, lungs, and digestive system. So, MALT lymphoma starts in the body organs and not in the lymph nodes.
