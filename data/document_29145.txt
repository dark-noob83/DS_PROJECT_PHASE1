The nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It is essentially the body’s electrical wiring. Structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.
Brain and Nervous System. Brain and nervous system problems are common. These neurological disorders include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and stroke, and can affect memory and ability to perform daily activities.
Diseases of the nervous system. “Of all the diseases of the nervous system, the most common difficulty that people have is pain, and much of that is nerve-related,” according to Dr. Shai Gozani, founder and CEO of NeuroMetrix, a medical device company.
Some serious conditions, diseases, and injuries that can cause nervous system problems include: 1  Blood supply problems (vascular disorders). 2  Injuries (trauma), especially injuries to the head and spinal cord. 3  Problems that are present at birth (congenital).
There are many diseases and conditions that can greatly affect the Nervous System. We have chosen three diseases to tell you about. Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson’s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. All of these illnesses are ones that can slow down the functions and abilities of this system.
Some forms of Motor Neurone Disease are inherited. Motor Neurone disease primarily affects the cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the motor nuclei in the brainstem, and the corticospinal fibres. Multiple Sclerosis. A chronic disease of the nervous system that can affect young and middle-aged adults.
