Depending on how cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs should be done perfectly in 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape of the pan, the size of the eggs, the ratio of water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more.
Boil water alone in the microwave. Put enough water to submerge the eggs into a microwave safe bowl, leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) clearance at the top. Heat for at least three minutes, or however long it takes for the water to begin to boil. Heating the water in advance reduces the risk of exploding the shell, although a few cracks may still occur.
Place the eggs in the pot, cover it and bring it to a boil. Boil the eggs 3 minutes for soft boiled eggs or 10 minutes for hard boiled. Drain the eggs and immediately cover them with cold running water until they are completely cooled, about 5-10 minutes, if they are to be served cold. If they are to be served hot keep them covered in the hot water.
Step 4: Place a dish back to the microwave and switch the oven on a medium-heat mode. Take a stop watch and note down the time. It’ll take 8 – 10 minutes for hard boil egg; while the soft boil eggs only take 5 – 6 minutes max. Peel it and eat it with a salt and black pepper for it’s time to enjoy! You can well imagine now as how long to boil an egg in the microwave.
For a hard-boiled egg, start the egg in cold water and bring up to the boil. Once the water is gently boiling, set the timer for between 7-10 minutes depending on how well cooked you like your eggs. The longer you boil the egg, the firmer it will be.
