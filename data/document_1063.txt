Golf carts are not designed for speed. Fast moving golf carts can do damage to both the greens and to the vehicles themselves. However, many have taken to driving their golf carts off the course. It can be a cheap and fun means of transportation. For this type of alternative use the slow speed of the average golf cart can be a detrement. Fortunately there are several things you can do to make your golf cart go faster.
One way to increase the speed of a gasoline-powered EZ Go golf cart is to add an octane booster when you fill the gas tank. The cart will have more pickup and possibly gain as much as 5 mph.
Written by Ed Arnold-LaPorte, IN. The standard speed of a golf cart today is 12 to 14 miles per hour but many options are available to increase both the speed and power should you desire.
Even if you are not trying to make your golf cart street legal, most users want the extra speed capability just to add more usefulness and enjoyment. 12 mph is just too painfully slow for most users. If you think that 12 mph is a fast enough golf cart, give it a few weeks.
The average golf cart that you'll find on golf courses hit top speeds of about 20 miles per hour. However, there are some custom carts that have topped 150 mph.
Gas powered golf cars will get about 14-15 mph top-speed (unmodified). Compared to electric golf cars, gas-powered golf cars are more powerful and useful on craggy terrain; more durable and last longer, and because you don't have to buy a new set of batteries every 3 or 4 years., they are also cheaper.
Adjusting the governor can make your golf cart go 5–10 mph (8.0–16.1 km/h) faster. If you do this to an E-Z-GO golf cart, you might be able to squeeze an extra 7 mph (11 km/h) out of it, going from 15 mph (24 km/h) to 22 mph (35 km/h) and it will only take about 5 minutes to do it. Ad.
