Pyrite can be found in sedimentary, magmatic, and metamorphic rock deposits, and also in hydrothermal vents, wherever there is sulfur and iron.
Pyrite is a very common mineral, found in a wide variety of geological formations from sedimentary deposits to hydrothermal veins and as a constituent of metamorphic rocks. The brassy-yellow metallic colour of pyrite has in many cases lead to people mistaking it for Gold, hence the common nickname 'Fool's gold'.
Of the sulfide minerals pyrite is the most common. It is usually found in quartz veins with other sulfides and oxides. Mining operations sometimes leave large amounts of pyrite in tailings.
Pyrite makes an impressive display piece and it is one of the more common minerals that can be found. You can find Pyrite throughout the United States including California, Colorado, North Carolina, and Washington.
Just like iron, Pyrite can be found and mined in many regions of the world. However, Pyrite is mostly mined in the states of Illinois and Missouri of America, Peru, Russia, Spain, and South Africa.
Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster. It has a chemical composition of iron disulfide (FeS 2) and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks worldwide.
Pyrite is one of the most commonly found minerals. In fact, it would be a normal ore for iron if it came in larger masses than it is normally found in.
Pyrite is a Greek word for fire and it sometimes is called many different names including Marcasite and Foolâ€™s Gold. Pyrite resembles gold in that it is yellow, or brassy yellow and looks like gold. It is ironic that lots of gold found throughout the world include small inclusions of Pyrite. Pyrite is mainly made from the element of iron. Besides iron, sulfur and oxygen are present.
