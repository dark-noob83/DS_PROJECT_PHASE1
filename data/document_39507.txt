**** Rainforests by Michael G. 2001 In an average year the climate in a tropical rain forest is very humid because of all the rainfall. A tropical rainforest gets about 150 cm of rain per year. The tropical rain forest is a forest of tall trees in a region of year-round warmth. An average of 50 to 260 inches (125 to 660 cm.) of rain falls yearly. Rain forests belong to the tropical wet climate group.
The Amazon rainforest climate is typically a tropical climate, also known as equatorial climate, found approximately 12 degrees to the North and South of the equator. Like any other tropical rainforest, it's hot and humid throughout the year, with an average annual temperature of 27 C (80.7 F).
In an average year in a tropical rain forest, the climate is very humid because of all the rainfall, which amounts to about 250 cm per year. The rain forest has lots of rain because it is very hot and wet. This climate is found near the equator. The f stands for sufficient precipitation for all months. The latitude range for rainforest climate is 15° to 25° North and South of the equator. The annual precipitation of a rain forest is greater than 150 cm. In only a month the rain forest receives 4 inches of rain.

Annual rainfall varies throughout the country. For example, it can be as much as 2000mm a year in the Southern Mountains or a much lower 400mm in the vicinity of Mainz which i … s more to the North West. As an average for the whole country, around 600-800mm is a good approximation.

An average of 50 to 260 inches (125 to 660 cm.) of rain falls yearly. Rain forests belong to the tropical wet climate group. The temperature in a rain forest rarely gets higher than 93 °F (34 °C) or drops below 68 °F (20 °C); average humidity is between 77 and 88%; rainfall is often more than 100 inches a year.
Features. Rainforests are characterized by heavy annual rainfall, thick vegetation and diverse plant and animal species. At a minimum, a true tropical rainforest receives 80 inches of rainfall annually. Most receive much more. The state of Kentucky, by comparison, receives an average of 40 to 50 inches of rain per year. This means even the driest of rainforests get twice the rainfall Kentucky does. True tropical rainforest -- equatorial evergreen rainforest -- typically receives at least 2,000 millimeters (80 in.) of annual rainfall, but the wettest may get 10,000 millimeters (304 in.) or more. The rain falls year-round, because there are no warm and cool seasonal changes to affect rainfall amount
The tropical rainforest has a relatively constant temperature throughout the year. The average temperature is 22°C (70°F) and it usually stays within a 2.2°C range. The monthly precipitation in tropical rainforests varies greatly depending on the season. The annual precipitation is 262 cm (103 in)
Southeast Asian Rainforests. The tropical rain forest is a forest of tall trees in a region of year-round warmth. An average of 50 to 260 inches (125 to 660 cm.) of rain falls yearly. Rain forests belong to the tropical wet climate group. The temperature in a rain forest rarely gets higher than 93 °F (34 °C) or drops below 68 °F (20 °C); average humidity is between 77 and 88%; rainfall is often more than 100 inches a year
Precipitation. The annual precipitation for temperate rainforests is at least 200 cm (78.74 in) and can go up to 350 cm (137.79 in). Temperate rainforests have four seasons with a distinct winter.
