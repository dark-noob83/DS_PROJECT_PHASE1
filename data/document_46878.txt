Centipedes actually have the ability to bite, and are poisonous. The poison from their fangs, located behind the head, is used to kill insects, which are their primary food. To a human, a bite feels like that of a bee sting, and can be dangerous,especially if there is an allergic reaction in response to the bite.
not dangerous to humans. centipedes definitely don't kill people. They are less dangerous compare to some poisonous spiders. It might cause severe pain, swelling and redness, swollen, headache, nausea and vomiting.
Despite this, the venom usually is not strong enough to be life threatening to people, and most centipede bites are typically more painful for humans than they are dangerous. Centipedes possess maxillipeds, a modified pair of front legs that curve around the head and behind the mandibles.
Centipedes are predators. They eat insects, spiders, and other centipedes. The large centipedes even eat lizards, birds, and small animals. They have a pair of claws at the front of their body. The claws have ducts that can deliver venom. The centipedes use the venom to paralyze their prey.
Smaller variants of centipedes produce nothing more than a painful, localized reaction, not unlike a bee sting. Larger species, however, administer more venom through a bite and can produce more extreme pain. While centipede bites can be extremely painful, they are not generally fatal to humans.
Pest Information-Centipedes. There are over 3,000 species of centipedes and some can grow to 12 in length. There are 3 species found in Hawaii but only one of medical importance; it can grow to 8 in length and its bite is dangerous to humans and pets.
The short answer is yes. All centipedes are poisonous. The effect on humans however varies greatly. Very small species of centipedes are unable to penetrate human skin and inject any venom, so could be considered harmless.
