Arteries,veins and capillaries are the blood vessels which help in transporting blood from one organ to another organ. Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. veins are unique because they connect to the capillaries and return oxygen-rich blood to the right atria of the heart so that blood can exchange carbon dioxide for fresh oxygen in the lungs.
Capillaries (/ˈkaepɨlɛriz/ ˈkæpɨlɛriz IN; /us/ kəˈpɪləriz IN) uk are the smallest of a'body s blood (vessels and lymph) vessels that make up the. Microcirculation their endothelial linings are only one cell layer. thick Capillary beds can consist of two types of vessels: true capillaries, which branch from arterioles and provide exchange between cells and the blood, and short vessels that directly connect the arterioles and venules at opposite ends of the beds, metarterioles, only found in the mesenteric circulation.
(Their diameter is 5 to 10  micrometers, or 5 to 10 millionths of a meter.) Capillaries connect  arterioles and venules, which are the smaller extensions of the  larger arteries and veins. the smallest blood vessels in the body branched off from arteries. Arteries carry blood to the tissues, and veins carry blood back to the heart.

Capillaries are where fluids, gasses, nutrients, and wastes are exchanged between the blood and body tissues by diffusion. Capillary walls contain small pores that allow certain substances to pass into and out of the blood vessel. The flow of blood in the capillaries is controlled by structures called precapillary sphincters. These structures are located between arterioles and capillaries and contain muscle fibers that allow them to contract. When the sphincters are open, blood flows freely to the capillary beds of body tissue.
A capillary is an extremely small blood vessel located within the tissues of the body, that transports blood from arteries to veins. Capillaries are most abundant in tissues and organs that are metabolically active. The flow of blood in the capillaries is controlled by structures called precapillary sphincters. These structures are located between arterioles and capillaries and contain muscle fibers that allow them to contract. When the sphincters are open, blood flows freely to the capillary beds of body tissue.
Capillaries. Capillaries are the smallest of all blood vessels and form the connection between veins and arteries. As arteries branch and divide into arterioles and continue to reduce in size as they reach the muscle they become capillaries. Capillaries have very thin walls comprised only of endothelial cells, which allows substances to move through the wall with ease. Capillaries are very small, measuring 5-10 micrometres in width.
Capillaries Tiny blood vessels connecting arteries to veins. These  blood vessels carry oxygen and nutrients to individual cells.
