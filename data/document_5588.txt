Women tend to have a higher proportion of fatty tissue than men and, as a result, a lower volume of body water. Equal amounts of alcohol will, therefore, result in a hig … her BAC for a 60-kg (130-lb.) woman than for a 60-kg man. A meadow that was not fertile to start with will therefore never reach 100%. The fertility of a meadow increases by 1% for each day that it lies fallow in spring or fall, by 3% in summer, and by 0.2% in winter. Land that lies fallow in winter will only slightly increase in fertility.
