Rocky Mountain Region: Alberta, Canada. Located in the Southwestern edge of Alberta, the Rocky Mountains are perhaps the best known and most well visited of Alberta's six natural regions. The Rocky Mountains comprise 8 percent of the province. Banff, Canada's first national park, was established in 1885. Soon after, Waterton Lakes National Park was established on the southern end and Jasper National Park on the northern end of Alberta's Rocky Mountain Chain. And, in 1959, the Government of Alberta protected another significant mountain region, Willmore Wilderness Park, just north of Jasper National Park. The foresight of those who set aside these parks ensured that two of the three sub-regions of the Rocky Mountains, the Alpine and Sub-Alpine, are well protected today.
As one of the 10 regional offices, the Alberta Region works closely with Alberta's 45 First Nations in the funding and delivery of essential programs â€“ education, government, social assistance, child and family services and housing, amongst others. Alberta is home to 45 First Nations communities in three treaty areas. Treaties 6, 7 and 8 consist of a combined 140 reserves spread over 812,771 hectares of land. The Regional Director General for the Alberta Region is Jim Sisson; the Associate Director General is Kevin Murchie.
