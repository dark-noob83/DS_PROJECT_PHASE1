In my area many jobs are only paid term time only, which for most schools is about 39 weeks a year, so 45 sounds like a lot, because even teachers don't work 45 weeks a year (isn't there usually 12 weeks holiday in a year?). Reason: change calculation. Hi, I work in a school and you are paid for around 45 weeks of the year including holidays. So you would multiply the lower rate of pay by 37 to give you your weekly salary and then multiply by 45 to give you your annual salary and then divide by 12 to give you your monthly gross pay.
So term time employees who have a 195 day working year (38 5-day weeks plus five inset days) and who are entitled to 25 days annual leave per annum should have a paid leave entitlement of 195 x 0.16 = 31.2 days. Total pay would therefore be for 226.2 days per year, compared with 261 days for a year-round employee. The term time employee should therefore receive 86.67% of their notional full pay (with a proportionate adjustment where they work less than 37 hours per week, or 36 hours in London).

Some school nursing positions require frequent travel among schools. Only 45% of public schools had a dedicated, full-time nurse in 2011. Due to funding cuts, more and more nurses are covering several public schools within a district. Most school nurses work regular, daytime hours. In some districts, they enjoy the same summer and holiday vacations as students and faculty
Your salary includes a holiday element. This is calculated as: Full-time salary x part-time hours/full time hours x term time holiday fraction. 22,221 x 27.50/36.25 x 67/522 = 2,163.68. To calculate the proportion of your holiday pay missing due to maternity pay the following calculation is done. 8 weeks 0% pay = 2163.68 x 8 x 100% = 332.87. Total = 707.36. Administrative, clerical and technical staff working term-time only are required to work for the 38 weeks (i.e. 190 days [38 x 5 = 190]) the school is open for pupils.
As I dont want to waste anyone's time should I be lucky enough to get an interview I want to make sure the job will be enough money. Ok, details are: Band B, SCP 9-13 (13,610 - 15,444) (7.05 - 8.01 per hour) 37 hours per week, term time only. The council site states teacher working days would be 195 day per year which works out at 39 weeks (guess it is same for support staff). So I take it I would start on the low rate. Reason: change calculation. Hi, I work in a school and you are paid for around 45 weeks of the year including holidays. So you would multiply the lower rate of pay by 37 to give you your weekly salary and then multiply by 45 to give you your annual salary and then divide by 12 to give you your monthly gross pay.
Salary. School nurses enjoy competitive salaries and benefits as well as flexible hours. The average annual salary for a school nurse is $43,856. Some of these professionals supplement their income by working temporary positions during the summer months. Only 45% of public schools had a dedicated, full-time nurse in 2011. Due to funding cuts, more and more nurses are covering several public schools within a district. Most school nurses work regular, daytime hours.
That's a question every parent should ask, for today a missing school nurse isn't the exception but the rule. According to the National Association of School Nurses, only 45 percent of the nation's public schools have a full-time on-site nurse. Thirty percent have one who works part-time -- often dividing her hours between multiple school buildings -- and a full 25 percent have no nurse at all. The implications are sobering.
