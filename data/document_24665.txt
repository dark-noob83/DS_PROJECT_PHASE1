Penalties on Earnings from Contributions. Unless an exception applies, most distributions from a Roth IRA before the owner reaches age 59 1/2 will be subject to an early withdrawal penalty of 10% on the amount of the distribution. In 2001, before he is age 59 1/2, Paul withdraws $10,000 from the Roth IRA. Paul will have no tax to pay on this withdrawal because he paid income taxes on the full $20,000 he converted in 1998; however, he WILL have to pay a 10% penalty (or $1,000) unless one of the IRA early withdrawal exceptions apply.
The IRS does not impose the 10 percent penalty tax on an IRA withdrawal if the money is used to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, as of 2012. 
All traditional IRA and 401(k) withdrawals require that you pay taxes at ordinary income rates. Contributions to a Roth IRA can be taken out at any time, and its earnings may be withdrawn penalty and tax-free after five years. 
The IRS tacks a 10 percent penalty onto other taxes due when you withdraw money from a traditional IRA before you are age 59 1/2. You can tap an IRA to pay unreimbursed medical expenses for yourself and members of your family. The same rules govern early distributions from a Roth IRA that apply to traditional IRAs. If the withdrawal meets the exception criteria for paying medical expenses or health insurance premiums when you lose your job, you don’t have to pay the penalty.
A qualified distribution from a Roth IRA is tax-free and penalty-free, provided that the five-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: 1  Over age 59½. 2  Death or disability. 3  Qualified first-time home purchase. 
To contribute, you must be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan, but your contributions are tax-deductible, the money grows tax-free in the account and your qualified withdrawals come out tax-free. It's like the benefits of a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA rolled into one for medical expenses. 
Note that penalty-free does not mean tax-free. All traditional IRA and 401(k) withdrawals require that you pay taxes at ordinary income rates. Contributions to a Roth IRA can be taken out at any time, and its earnings may be withdrawn penalty and tax-free after five years. The same rules apply to a Roth 401(k), but only if the employer plan permits. Unfortunately, the government imposes a 10 percent penalty on any withdrawals before age 59 1/2. Some early distributions qualify for a waiver of that penalty -- for instance hardships, higher education expenses and buying a first home.
In 2005, Jim's Roth IRA has a balance of $3,500. Jim decides to close his Roth IRA in a non-qualified distribution that year. Since the distribution is non-qualified, Jim will owe taxes on his Roth earnings of $1,500, and will pay tax on this amount at his marginal tax rate. In 2001, before he is age 59 1/2, Paul withdraws $10,000 from the Roth IRA. Paul will have no tax to pay on this withdrawal because he paid income taxes on the full $20,000 he converted in 1998; however, he WILL have to pay a 10% penalty (or $1,000) unless one of the IRA early withdrawal exceptions apply.
1 She'll also pay a 10% penalty, but only on the $2,000 taxable distribution. 2  The other $2,000 is tax-and penalty-free since it came from prior non-deductible contributions to the IRA. 3  She can convert the entire traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and then take the $4,000 distribution. 4  This is a bad choice for Karin. In 2001, before he is age 59 1/2, Paul withdraws $10,000 from the Roth IRA. Paul will have no tax to pay on this withdrawal because he paid income taxes on the full $20,000 he converted in 1998; however, he WILL have to pay a 10% penalty (or $1,000) unless one of the IRA early withdrawal exceptions apply.
