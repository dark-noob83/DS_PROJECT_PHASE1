2. A Mendelian trait is caused by a single gene. 3. Traits can be dominant or recessive and recur in a predictable pattern in subsequent generations. 4. Autosomal Dominant Inheritance: Autosomal dominant traits do not generally skip generations and can affect both sexes. 5.
A dominant allele produces a dominant phenotype in individuals who have one copy of the allele, which can come from just one parent. For a recessive allele to produce a recessive phenotype, the individual must have two copies, one from each parent. An individual with one dominant and one recessive allele for a gene will have the dominant phenotype. They are generally considered “carriers” of the recessive allele: the recessive allele is there, but the recessive phenotype is not.
Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. If expression of a trait requires only one copy of a gene (one allele), that trait is considered dominant.
The terms dominant and recessive describe the inheritance patterns of certain traits. That is, they describe how likely it is for a certain phenotype to pass from parent offspring.
Single Gene Traits in Humans. The following is a list of some autosomal human traits that have been attributed to a single gene. Although clearly other genes are involved, the inheritance of each of these phenotypic traits acts as if it were governed by
