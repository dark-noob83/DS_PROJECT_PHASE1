A 25-foot row of plants will produce from 25 to 40 pounds of cukes over a season; a 3-by-8-foot bed (24 square feet) should give you 40 to 70 pounds of cukes. However, if you use a trellis, a 25-foot long trellis will yield over 100 pounds of cucumbers depending on the variety. 1  read more: 2  Choosing Cucumber Varieties. 
1 Yield per plant is 20 to 25 cucumbers per plant depending on variety. 2  No pesticides, fungicides or artificial fertilizers are ever used. 3  Cucumbers can be harvested and used the same day for peak flavor and texture plus they store well. 4  Yields 4,000 lbs to 4,500 lbs [1,800 to 2045kg] per year per Grow Tray. 
Spacing can affect plant yield, so space plants appropriately. Cucumbers need 8 to 12 inches between plants and 4 to 6 feet between hills to ensure adequate pollination. Spacing plants too far or too close together can affect pollination and decrease fruit production. Cucumber plants produce long, green slender fruits, and need warm soil to sprout and flower pollination to produce fruit. There are many varieties of cucumbers, including types that work well for slicing and pickling.
Cucumber Production. If you plant cucumbers to use for pickling, plan on growing 3 to 4 plants per each quart of pickles you want to make. Generally, a healthy pickling cucumber plant produces about 5 pounds of cucumbers per plant. Cucumber plants produce long, green slender fruits, and need warm soil to sprout and flower pollination to produce fruit. There are many varieties of cucumbers, including types that work well for slicing and pickling.
If you plant cucumbers for slicing and eating fresh, plan on growing about 2 to 3 plants per person in your household; healthy plants generally grow 10, 6-ounce cucumbers per plant. Heirloom cucumber varieties generally produce less fruit, which is about 2 to 3 pounds of fruit per healthy plant. Cucumber plants produce long, green slender fruits, and need warm soil to sprout and flower pollination to produce fruit. There are many varieties of cucumbers, including types that work well for slicing and pickling.
Until 1948, the. recommendation for pickling cucumber spacing was 6 to 7 feet between rows and 3 to 4 feet between plants in the row, for a planting density of 1,500 to 2,500 plants per acre. In our economic analysis we used an average cost of $1.65 per thousand seeds and a selling price of $3.25 per bushel for grade 2 and 3 (marketable grades for machine-harvested cucumbers). Economic value was obtained by multiplying yield by selling price and subtracting seed cost.
Crop moisture requirements range from 15 to 24 acre-inches of water, depending on climate, soil type, plant populations, and market type. On the average, cucumbers need 1 inch of water each week, which may increase to 2 inches per week during hot and dry weather, or if plants are fruiting. Approximately 40% of the pickling crop is fresh-packed, 15% is refrigerated, and 40-45% is brined. Cucumbers for pickling are usually grown under contract, so profits are directly related to yield per acre. Florida, the Carolinas, and Texas lead in fresh market production.
I am hoping to find the average yield per plant of peppers, eggplant, tomatoes (I have found that 10 lbs/plant is a pretty safe estimate, while some will yield much more) squash, and cucumbers. Again-I know it is a very generic question-that I wouldn't have to ask if I kept better records from previous years! 
Grow 12 to 20 plants per person. Yield 1 to 2 ears per plants, 10 to 12 ears per 10-foot row. Space plant 4 to 6 inches apart in rows2 to 3 feet apart. Cucumber. Space plants 2 to 4 inches apart in rows 6 to 10 inches apart. Lettuce. Grow 6 to 10 plants per person; plant succession crops with each harvest. Yield 4 to 10 pounds per 10-foot row. Space looseleaf lettuce 4 inches apart and all other types 12 inches apart in rows 16 to 24 inches apart. Melon
