Cellular Respiration is divided into two series of biochemical reactions: anaerobic and aerobic reactions. Anaerobic reactions occur in the cytoplasm of the cell and aerobic reactions occur in the mitochondria of the cells. Notice in the picture below that glycolysis is happening in the cytoplasm and everything else is occurring inside the mitochondria, which require oxygen.
Glycolysis a. occurs in the mitochondria b. reults in the production of pyruvate c. occurs in the cytoplasm d. occurs in the mitochondria and results in the production of pyru … vate *e. results in the production of pyruvate and occurs in the cytoplasm Answer is E. 3 people found this useful. 1  Alcohol Fermentation Alcohol fermentation is familiar to humans because it's used in the process of making bread, beer and wine.
All life on Earth performs glycolysis to break down food (glucose and glycerol) and turn it into energy. Glycolysis is performed in the cytoplasm of the cell and produces a net product of two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and two coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), turning glucose into two pyruvate acids.

Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of a cell. The PDA comes next (in aerobic organisms), which is in the mitochondrial membrane. After that is the TCA Cycle (also known as the Krebs Cycle and the Citric Acid Cycle).
