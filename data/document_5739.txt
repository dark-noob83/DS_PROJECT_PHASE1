The normal body temperatures for children are the same as an adult human and are considered to be between 36 to 36.8 degrees Celsius or 96.8 to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit. In a child, any temperature that exceeds 36 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is considered to be high and is medically classed as a fever. The average body temperature for infants range from 97 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius, and anything above that is generally considered a fever. Children and infants with a fever need to be watched and comforted with lukewarm baths or sponge baths.

A normal temperature measured by mouth is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) and can be between 97 degrees Fahrenheit to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 degrees Celsius to 37.2 degrees Celsius). This is because different people have different normal body temperatures. It is normal for your child to have a slightly higher temperature at night than he did in the morning.
