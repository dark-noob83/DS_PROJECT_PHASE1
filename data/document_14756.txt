1 Chromosome: a long, thread-like molecule made of the chemical called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that is held together with special proteins and is visible (with strong microscopes) during cell division... 2  more. 3  Molecule: a chemical structure that has two or more atoms held together by a chemical bond.
A molecule of DNA is double-stranded. The molecule has the shape of a double helix, typically right handed (B form DNA). The DNA molecule consists of two complementary strands oriented in an antiparallel fashion. Each strand is composed of nucleotides.
DNA structure. DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). The order of these bases is what determines DNA's instructions, or genetic code.
The twisted ladder metaphorA DNA molecule is often likened to a spiral (or twisted) ladder. In this analogy, the rungs of the ladder are the base pairs (A-T and G-C). The sides of the ladder are the sugar-phosphate backbones of the two strands. This refers to B form DNA.
A closer look at the chemical structure of DNA includes the four nitrogenous bases Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C). DNA also includes sugars and phosphate groups that make the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone.
A DNA molecule consists of two long polynucleotide chains composed of four types of nucleotide subunits. Each of these chains is known as a DNA chain, or a DNA strand. Hydrogen bonds between the base portions of the nucleotides hold the two chains together (Figure 4-3). As we saw in Chapter 2 (Panel 2-6, pp.
The base pairs in DNA are adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine. DNA has a spiral staircase-like structure. The steps are formed by the nitrogen bases of the nucleotides where adenine pairs
