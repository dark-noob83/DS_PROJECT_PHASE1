1 A tympanic digital thermometer will quickly measure the temperature of the ear drum, which reflects the body’s core temperature. 2  The core temperature can be 1.4°F (0.8°C) higher than oral measurements. Equipment-Tympanic digital thermometer. Testing procedures. 1  Place the tympanic digital device in the external auditory canal with the probe aimed at the tympanic membrane. 2  Wait 2-3 seconds until the digital reading occurs or the digital beep sounds. 3  Document your findings.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period.

A rectal temperature is usually 0.9° F (0.5° C) higher than an oral temperature, and axillary and tympanic temperatures are usually 0.9° F (0.5° C) lower than an oral temperature. Agency policy usually specifies whether to document a temperature reading in degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius. The cone-shaped tip of the tympanic thermometer uses infrared technology to measure body temperature from heat of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) and the surrounding tissue. That heat is then converted to a digital reading. Most tympanic devices produce an easy-to-read digital display quickly.
1 The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. You can take a temperature using the mouth (oral), anus (rectal), armpit (axillary), or ear (tympanic). But the temperature readings vary depending on which one you use, and you need an accurate body temperature to determine if a fever is present.
1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. You can take a temperature using the mouth (oral), anus (rectal), armpit (axillary), or ear (tympanic). But the temperature readings vary depending on which one you use, and you need an accurate body temperature to determine if a fever is present.
Generally, the correlation of temperature results are as follows: 1  The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. You can take a temperature using the mouth (oral), anus (rectal), armpit (axillary), or ear (tympanic). But the temperature readings vary depending on which one you use, and you need an accurate body temperature to determine if a fever is present.
