The cost of attendance stipend being issued to student-athletes passed, 79-1, at the NCAA convention in January. The figure varies from school to school because it takes details such as the school’s location and cost of living into account. Interestingly enough, the $4,800 Arrington received per year because of his father’s disability in the late 1990s is now about the same figure Penn State’s full scholarship student-athletes will receive this year as part of the NCAA’s cost of attendance stipend.
The settlement cost the NCAA $228 million. In 2011, the NCAA’s Division I Board of Directors voted to adopt a $2,000 stipend that would cover an athlete’s full cost of attendance, but 125 Division I institutions then voted to override the decision, scuttling the increase. The increase at Alabama was also confined to the travel and miscellaneous categories of the cost-of-attendance budget, as was most of a $2,000 increase at Rutgers University, which is offering stipends between $4,100 and $4,900.
Division I college athletes will have new levels of support when the new school year begins in the fall. Schools will be able to give their athletes the full cost of attendance as part of a full athletics scholarship beginning Aug. 1, and those scholarships cannot be revoked for athletics reasons. 
The exact dollar amount per scholarship is still to be determined, but the stipend is estimated at $2,000 to $4,000 annually, which is a fraction of the cost of a year's worth of tuition, room and board at BC (valued at $62,000 a year). 
In a 79-1 vote amongst the 80 universities in the Power 5 conferences (Pac-12, SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC) in January, it was determined that NCAA Division I schools can provide their student-athletes with a supplemental stipend to cover the costs of attendance at their respective universities. Each university determines the cost of attendance individually. As such, Colorado State will be handing out $2,400 per year to in-state full scholarship athletes, and $3,100 per year to out-of-state full scholarship athletes.
The school’s official “cost of attendance” is just $63,022, so the football team can only offer its athletes a stipend of $1,400 per year. “Boston College voted against the cost-of-attendance measure at this year’s NCAA convention (in January),” the Chronicle of Higher Education reported. 
Pitt’s athletic department has $1.1 million set aside for the stipends, or $3,296 for undergraduate student-athletes on full scholarship. The cost of attendance stipend is $5,922 for graduate student-athletes. The Panthers will divide the stipend into four checks throughout the year. Interestingly enough, the $4,800 Arrington received per year because of his father’s disability in the late 1990s is now about the same figure Penn State’s full scholarship student-athletes will receive this year as part of the NCAA’s cost of attendance stipend.
Figuring in the cost-of-attendance stipend, a full scholarship for an out-of-state student-athlete at UVa will exceed $57,500 in 2015-16. (It will be about $27,500 for in-state student-athletes.). I think it will be very beneficial, Bausback said of the cost-of-attendance stipend, especially coming from California, when plane tickets are $700, $800. I know that will help my family out a lot, and me, with the cost of plane tickets..
