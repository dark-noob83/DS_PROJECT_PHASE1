Food irradiation (the application of ionizing radiation to food) is a technology that improves the safety and extends the shelf life of foods by reducing or eliminating microorganisms and insects. Like pasteurizing milk and canning fruits and vegetables, irradiation can make food safer for the consumer. 1 Prevention of Foodborne Illness – irradiation can be used to effectively eliminate organisms that cause foodborne illness, such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli (E. coli). 2  Preservation – irradiation can be used to destroy or inactivate organisms that cause spoilage and decomposition and extend the shelf life of foods.

Flavour Enhancers. A type of additive that is used to enhance and intensify the flavour within a food. The additive does not have its own flavour. Often used in Chinese food e.g. Monosodium glutamate (MSG). Emulsifier. An emulisifier that has a hydrophylic (water loving) head and a high hydrophobic (water hating) tail. The head attaches to a water based molecule and prevents them from separating, creating an emulsion.

Preservatives are added to foods to increase shelf life and prevent early spoilage from bacterial growth. Read product labels carefully as many frozen or canned vegetables have added preservatives to increase their shelf life or boost taste and texture. Fresh or frozen vegetables that have only the vegetables listed without added salt and sugars are better selections. Purchase organic varieties when possible.
