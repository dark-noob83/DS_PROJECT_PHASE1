Termite Droppings: Frass. The first sign of a termite infestation may be wormlike mud tunnels that run up walls or foundations. Termites are particularly attracted to damp wood which may be found in basements and tunnels, so termites are often discovered either within basements or emerging from them.
Mysterious piles of pellets are indicative of drywood termite presence. These piles could be drywood termite droppings known as frass. Drywood frass can be different colors, depending of the color of the wood termites have been eating, but all drywood droppings are six-sided.
Termites, like any other creatures, have to poop. Termite droppings are called frass, which is really just a fancy name for termite crap. Termite frass are little round pellets. Frass ends up as a combination of what the termites eat; a plant and wood mixture. These are formed into little pellets.
Termite droppings, called frass, can be white or black, according to Orkin Pest Control. The droppings are similar in color to the wood residue that the insects spill as they eat. Subterranean termite droppings are soft and used in constructing nests, whereas drywood termite droppings are hard and look like piles of sawdust, according to Extension.org.
Drywood termite pellets are tiny, oval-shaped capsules with six concave sides and rounded ends. These pellets, which are about 1 millimeter in length, can form small mounds beneath kick out holes. The mounds may look like small piles of salt or pepper.
The only condition drywood termites do not have inside their nest is unlimited space. As termites consume wood, they create kick out holes that are used to push frass (termite droppings or pellets) out of the nest.
