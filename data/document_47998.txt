Multiply this by $16 per square foot and your one-mile stretch of asphalt highway will cost $4,055,040.00 and will last an average of seven years. We plan to design the Solar Roadways™ to last at least 21 years (three times that of asphalt roads), at which time the panels would need to be refurbished. Adding no additional cost to the current asphalt system, this will allow us to invest about $48 ($16 x 3) per square foot. This means that if each individual panel can be made for no more than $6912.00, then the Solar Roadway™ can be built for the same cost as current asphalt roads.

With energy prices on the rise, this may be the perfect time to go solar. Here are a few things to consider that will affect the cost of installing solar panels. There are three major types of solar panels. As you may imagine, the most effective solar panels have the highest cost. The most effective and most expensive type of solar panel is Monocrystalline, which is constructed from one continuous sheet of silicone. Slightly less expensive, and less effective, is Polycrystalline. 
Adding the cost of the power plants and tripling the cost of the asphalt roads, we get a total cost of $48,059,670,000,000. Divide this amount by the 4.84 billion Solar Road Panels™ required to replace the asphalt, and we get a target cost of $9923.16 per panel. Adding no additional cost to the current asphalt system, this will allow us to invest about $48 ($16 x 3) per square foot. This means that if each individual panel can be made for no more than $6912.00, then the Solar Roadway™ can be built for the same cost as current asphalt roads.
Based on 15% efficiency, each Solar Road Panel™ can produce an average of 7.6kWh per day. Our hypothetical 4-lane, one-mile stretch of road would require 1760 Solar Road Panels™. That means that, each day, this stretch of Solar Roadway™ would produce at least 13,376 kWh of electricity. Adding no additional cost to the current asphalt system, this will allow us to invest about $48 ($16 x 3) per square foot. This means that if each individual panel can be made for no more than $6912.00, then the Solar Roadway™ can be built for the same cost as current asphalt roads.
1 Cost depends on the size of the gate and its style. 2  For example, a 12-foot wrought-iron gate from Amazing Gates costs about $1,600; a 12-foot steel panel gate at Lowe's costs about $1,800. 3  Single-panel gates can be automated either to swing open or to slide open. 1 Cost varies by size and style of the gate: a simple 12-foot dual-panel gate at Home Depot about $2,100, and a custom-sized wooden gate costs $2,900-$3,200.
1 Dual-panel iron, steel and wood gates cost $1,800-$3,200. 2  Dual-panel gates can be automated either to swing open from the middle, or for both panels to slide open. 3  Cost varies by size and style of the gate: a simple 12-foot dual-panel gate at Home Depot about $2,100, and a custom-sized wooden gate costs $2,900-$3,200. 1 Cost varies by size and style of the gate: a simple 12-foot dual-panel gate at Home Depot about $2,100, and a custom-sized wooden gate costs $2,900-$3,200.
1 SolarCity maintains and insures the system at no additional cost to you for 20 years. 2  At the end of your agreement, you can upgrade to a new system with the latest solar technology, you can keep your current panels and extend your lease, or you can simply have the panels removed for free. 
Provide a few details about your project and receive competitive quotes from local pros. The average national cost of a driveway installation is $3,647, with most homeowners spending between $2,026 and $5,278. This data is based on actual project costs as reported by HomeAdvisor members. If you're thinking about installing a driveway, it's important to consider a couple of different things.
