In 1961, East Germany closed the border and built the Wall dividing West Berlin from East Berlin. The area of East Berlin was the Sovjet zone, while West Berlin was compounded of the French, British and U.S. zones.   The Eastern Bloc, under the control of the USSR, fell in 1989, as did the infamous Wall. It was built (or rather, started) on 13 August 1961.

Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), starting on 13 August 1961, the wall completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin until it was opened in November 1989. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere.
Explain why Khrushchev ordered the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. There were several reasons why Khrushchev built the Berlin Wall in 1961, the first of which was the economic effects of free movement in between West and East Berlin. Since the division of the city, East Germans had been able, with enough money, to leave the GDR through Berlin which was described as a “gap in the Iron Curtain”. Between 1949 and 1961 in fact, up to 4 million had fled to the Western Germany, around 20,000 per month by 1960.
By Klaus Wiegrefe. Historians have long argued over whether East German leader Walter Ulbricht or his Soviet counterpart Nikita Khrushchev was ultimately responsible for the construction of the Berlin Wall. A newly discovered Russian document from August 1961 provides some answers. Khrushchev wanted to convince the East German population that the wall being built would protect them from Western spies, and he said that the Germans would understand. But even Khrushchev didn't appear to totally believe his own propaganda.

One of the reasons why the Berlin Wall was built related to the Bay of Pigs. Kennedy was seen as weak after the Bay of Pigs Incident in April 1961. Khrushchev risked that Kennedy would not take action if a wall was built around West Berlin. 
Further deepening the tensions of the Cold War, Khrushchev urged East Berlin officials to build a brick wall around West Berlin, cutting off all contact between citizens of East and West Berlin. The wall was completed in August 1961. 
The Berlin Wall was both the physical division between West Berlin and East Germany from 1961 to 1989 and the symbolic boundary between democracy and Communism during the Cold War. Dates: August 13, 1961 -- November 9, 1989. Also Known As: Berliner Mauer (in German). 
The wall stood from 1961 to 1989. Until 1961 East German citizens were allowed to travel to West Berlin. Travelling to West Germany became difficult after closing the border between East and West Germany in 1952. The Wall was erected in 1961 because more than 2.6 million East Germans escaped to West Berlin or West Germany from 1949 to 1961 (total population of East Germany was about 17 million!).

By the 1960s Berlin was still divided-the USSR controlled the East and the USA guaranteed freedom in the West. Thousands of refugees escaped to West Berlin each day-much to the embarrassment of the USSR-so in 1961 Khrushchev closed the border and ordered the construction of a wall to stop people leaving.
