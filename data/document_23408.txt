Hawksbill Sea Turtles. Considered by many to be the most beautiful of sea turtles for their colorful shells, the hawksbill is found in tropical waters around the world. They spend their time in coral reefs, rocky areas, lagoons, mangroves, oceanic islands, and shallow coastal areas.
Typical Lifespan: The normal lifespan of hawksbill turtles is thought to be about 30 to 50 years. Habitat: Hawksbills are the most tropical of the sea turtles and use different habitats at different stages of their life cycle, but are rarely seen in water more than 65 feet (21 meters) deep.
Size relative to a 6-ft (2-m) man: Hawksbill turtles are found throughout the tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They avoid deep waters, preferring coastlines where sponges are abundant and sandy nesting sites are within reach.
Habitat: Hawksbill Sea Turtles have a wide range, found predominantly in tropical reefs of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans. They frequent rocky areas, coral reefs, shallow coastal areas, lagoons or oceanic islands, and narrow creeks and passes. The red circles are known major nesting sites.
1 Hawksbills are considered Critically Endangered around the world by the IUCN Red List and are listed as Endangered in the US. 2  Some researchers believe the Eastern Pacific hawksbill is likely the most endangered sea turtle population worldwide. 3  Their scientific name is Eretmochelys imbricata.
The Critically Endangered hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) has been exploited for thousands of years as the sole source of commercial tortoiseshell. The beautiful carapace is generally streaked and marbled with amber, yellow or brown and often has a strongly serrated edge.
Size/Weight/Age: Adult Hawksbill Sea Turtles have been known to grow up to 1 meter (3 ft) in length, weighing around 80 kilograms (176 lb) on average. The heaviest Hawksbill ever captured was measured to be 127 kilograms (280 lb).
