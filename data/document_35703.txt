The length of the contract can be three months, six months, a year, or any other period you choose. Agents often don’t like taking listings for less than a month because they don’t have enough time to market the house before the listing expires. A six-month listing is average. A real estate listing contract is a written agreement between you and a real estate agent that offers the agent a commission for selling your home. To earn the commission, the agent agrees to market the home and to handle the sales transaction.
Like most broadband providers, Plusnet charge you for the remainder of your 12 months contract if you leave before those 12 months are up. After the first 12 months, Plusnet customers are put on a rolling 30-day contract.
