By comparing average income for people in the 65 to 74 year age group to the average income they made 10 years earlier in the 55 to 64 year age group, I found that retirees have an approximately 23 percent drop in real income.
According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), the average income for people aged 65 and older in 2008 was $29,214 per annum. This is up from $28,134 in 2007. Within the same age group, those who had graduate degrees earned $62,777 while those who held bachelor degrees made $45,948.
Social Security Earnings. Social Security provides 36.7 percent of income for Americans age 65 and over, according to Forbes. ABC News reports that the average retired worker in 2014 received $1,294 per month in Social Security earnings, while the average couple received $2,111. The benefit amount varies depending on the amount paid in and the age of retirement.
According to a 2014 Forbes article, married couples over age 65 have a median yearly income of $44,718. Forbes reports that individuals 65 and older have a median annual income of $25,757.
According to the Social Security Administration, the average Social Security recipient collected just $1,300 a month in 2014. Add that $1,300 in Social Security payments to the $343 in income from retirement savings, and the typical retiree is looking at a monthly income of just $1,643, or only $19,716 per year.
Job Wages and Self Employment Earnings. Pensions are another source of the average retirement income. About 30.3 percent of persons 65 and over have an average of $17,162 in pensions per year. This is another source of income that is declining. Most companies are phasing out their pension plans.
