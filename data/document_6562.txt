Principles of inheritance given by Mendel and discovery of nuclein (nucleic acids) by Meischer (1871) almost coincided but for claiming that DNA acts as a genetic material took long time. Earlier discoveries made by Mendel, Walter Sutton, T.H.
DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid) has been found to be a genetic material in all the living beings except few plant viruses where RNA is the genetic material because DNA is not found in such viruses.
Citation: O'Connor, C. (2008) Discovery of DNA as the hereditary material using Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nature Education 1(1) :104. It was a pleasant surprise to the scientific community when clinical research with the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material.
heredity. the transmission of genetic traits from parents to offspring. The hereditary material is DNA in the ovum and sperm, so that the offspring's heredity is determined at the moment of conception. Inside the nucleus of each germ cell are structures called chromosomes.
DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA.
B. Properties of Genetic Material (DNA versus RNA) : DNA is the genetic material RNA has been found to be genetic material in TMV (Tobacco mosaic virus), ф β bacteriophage etc. DNA is major hereditary material in most of the organisms. RNA mainly performs the functions of messenger and adapter.
