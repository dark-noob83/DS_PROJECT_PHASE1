The endocrine system includes all of the glands of the body and the hormones produced by those glands. The glands are controlled directly by stimulation from the nervous system as well as by chemical receptors in the blood and hormones produced by other glands. 
The 2 main thyroid hormones are T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). The amount of thyroid hormones secreted is controlled by another hormone, called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is released from the pituitary gland in your head. Calcitonin. Another hormone that’s produced in your thyroid gland is called calcitonin. This hormone, secreted by a small population of cells known as C cells, is involved in regulating the level of calcium in your blood. Last Reviewed: 02 July 2009.
The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland help control the thyroid gland. The hypothalamus produces thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A low level of T3 tells the hypothalamus to release more TRH, and it tells the pituitary to release more TSH.
Its correct functioning depends on having a good supply of iodine from the diet. The release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland is controlled by thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus in the brain and by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the pituitary gland. This forms part of a feedback loop called the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Collectively, T3 and T 4 are referred to as the thyroid hormones. Twenty percent of the body’s triiodothyronine is made by the thyroid gland; the other 80% comes from thyroxine converted by organs such as the liver or kidneys. The thyroid gland also produces calcitonin from cells called C-cells.
Thyroid hormones are made by the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland makes and releases two thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones affect every cell and all the organs of the body. Too much thyroid hormone speeds things up and too little thyroid hormone slows things down. They:
The pituitary gland and hypothalamus both control the thyroid. When thyroid hormone levels drop too low, the hypothalamus secretes TSH Releasing Hormone (TRH), which alerts the pituitary to produce thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The thyroid responds to this chain of events by producing more hormones. The two main hormones the thyroid produces and releases are T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine). A thyroid that is functioning normally produces approximately 80% T4 and about 20% T3, though T3 is the stronger of the pair.
The pituitary gland and the thyroid gland work together. The pituitary gland (located near the base of the brain) makes, stores, and releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). When TSH is secreted by the pituitary gland, it causes the thyroid gland to release more T3 and T4. The thyroid gland makes and releases two thyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones affect every cell and all the organs of the body. Too much thyroid hormone speeds things up and too little thyroid hormone slows things down. They:
Thyroid hormones (T 4 and T 3) are produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland and are regulated by TSH made by the thyrotropes of the anterior pituitary gland. The effects of T 4 in vivo are mediated via T 3 (T 4 is converted to T 3 in target tissues). T 3 is 3- to 5- fold more active than T 4. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T 4), which has a longer half-life than T 3. In humans, the ratio of T 4 to T 3 released into the blood is roughly 20 to 1. T 4 is converted to the active T 3 (three to four times more potent than T 4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase).
The thyroid gland is influenced by hormones produced by two other organs: 1  The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, produces thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). 2  The hypothalamus, a small part of the brain above the pituitary, produces thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). Normally, TSH increases the uptake of iodine by the thyroid gland and increases production of thyroid hormone. If there is little iodine available in our diet, insufficient thyroid hormone is produced by the thyroid; hypothalamic TRH causes TSH to be released from the pituitary in large amounts.
Thyroid Hormone Production. The thyroid gland produces two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and releases them as needed by the body. The hypothalamus produces thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A low level of T3 tells the hypothalamus to release more TRH, and it tells the pituitary to release more TSH.
