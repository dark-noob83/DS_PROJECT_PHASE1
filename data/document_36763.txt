Atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries is the primary cause of vertebrobasilar disease. The narrowing of the vertebral or basilar arteries caused by atherosclerosis creates vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI), or an insufficient delivery of blood flow to the posterior structures of the brain.
Description. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency is a condition characterized by poor blood flow to the posterior (back) portion of the brain, which is fed by two vertebral arteries that join to become the basilar artery. Blockage of these arteries occurs over time through a process called atherosclerosis, or the build-up of plaque.
Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) , or vertebral basilar ischemia (also called Beauty parlour syndrome (BPS)), refers to a temporary set of symptoms due to decreased blood flow in the posterior circulation of the brain.
Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency. The vertebrobasilar system is located at the back of the brain and includes several blood vessels, the vertebral and basilar arteries. These vessels supply blood, oxygen and nutrients to vital brain structures. For instance, the vertebrobasilar system supports the brainstem.
Vertebral Basilar Insufficiency. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) refers to a condition in which blood flow to the vertebral and basilar arteries is restricted, thereby providing transient insufficient blood flow to the posterior portions of the brain.
