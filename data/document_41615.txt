The average cost of a beer depends on if you are purchasing an individual beer, a case of beer and whether you are at a bar or retail store. An individual beer at a bar will generally cost someone between $1.50 to $5.00 with an average cost closer to $3 per beer. This can change based on promotions such as happy hours or specials for sporting events.
At a store, buying a standard 30-pack case of beer will cost someone around $18-$20 for a case of domestic beer. Imported beer will usually be more expensive and comes in 24-pack, usually for around $25. All prices change from region to region based on the beer being purchased.
