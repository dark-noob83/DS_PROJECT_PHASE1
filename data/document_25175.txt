The Ionosphere. Exosphere. The Exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere. It extends from the thermopause-the transition boundary which separates the exosphere from the thermosphere below-to 6,200 miles (10,000 km) above the earth. In this layer, atoms and molecules escape into space and satellites orbit the earth. The Stratosphere extends from the tropopause up to 31 miles above the Earth's surface. This layer holds 19 percent of the atmosphere's gases but very little water vapor. Temperature increases with height as radiation is increasingly absorbed by oxygen molecules leading to the formation of Ozone.
The temperature decreases with altitude. Stratosphere: The stratosphere is found from about 7 to 30 miles (11-48 kilometers) above the Earths surface. In this region of the atmosphere is the ozone layer, which absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The temperature increases slightly with altitude in the stratosphere. The highest temperature in this region is about 32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius.
The highest layer of atmosphere is the exosphere. The layers from earth are; troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, exosphere. Troposphere and stratosphere are the minor layers of Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere is where weather occurs, and it is the closest to the Earth. The stratosphere is … the second closest and where planes fly. It is 40 kilometers thick, and the troposphere is 12 kilometers thick. 2 people found this useful.
1 The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. 2  Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. Earth's atmosphere consists of five different layers, the troposphere, stratosphere, mesophere, thermosphere, and exosphere. Troposhere: Contains up to 75% of the Earth Mass. Primarily composed up of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen.
The thermosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere. The thermosphere is directly above the mesosphere and below the exosphere. It extends from about 90 km (56 miles) to between 500 and 1,000 km (311 to 621 miles) above our planet. At the bottom of the thermosphere is the mesopause, the boundary between the thermosphere and the mesosphere below. Although the thermosphere is considered part of Earth's atmosphere, the air density is so low in this layer that most of the thermosphere is what we normally think of as outer space.
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12 km, although this altitude actually varies from about 9 km (30,000 ft) at the poles to 17 km (56,000 ft) at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft).
Earth's Atmospheric Layers. Diagram of the layers within Earth's atmosphere. Troposphere. The troposphere starts at the Earth's surface and extends 8 to 14.5 kilometers high (5 to 9 miles). This part of the atmosphere is the most dense. Almost all weather is in this region. Stratosphere. The stratosphere starts just above the troposphere and extends to 50 kilometers (31 miles) high
The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 km (31 mi; 160,000 ft) to the mesopause at 80–85 km (50–53 mi; 260,000–280,000 ft) above sea level. The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft).
