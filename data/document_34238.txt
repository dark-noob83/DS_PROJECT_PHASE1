And in a way I recapture those happy times.”. The Story of The Very Hungry Caterpillar. The Very Hungry Caterpillar starts off with a little egg lying on a leaf. The egg hatches, and out crawls a very hungry, very tiny caterpillar. Focusing on the basic concept of the number of days in the week, we follow the famished caterpillar as he sets out to look for some food. He begins on Monday, eating through one apple. Tuesday, he eats through two pears. Wednesday he eats through tree plums, but he’s still hungry.
The very hungry caterpillar literally eats his way through the pages of the book—and right into your child's heart....
