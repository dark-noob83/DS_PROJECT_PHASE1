A documentary about the Ypsilanti Willow Run airport's legendary B-24 bomber plant will air Sunday on PBS. B-24 Liberators line the airfield at Willow Run Airport in this June 1945 photo. The bomber plant adjacent to the airport produced the famed World War II bombers in a plant built by Henry Ford. The influx of workers for the massive war-time production project gave rise to an entire community called Willow Run.
The Willow Run manufacturing complex, located between Ypsilanti and Belleville, Michigan, was constructed in the early years of World War II by Ford Motor Company for the mass production of war munitions, especially the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber.
