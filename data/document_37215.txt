The savanna climate has a temperature range of 68° to 86° F (20° - 30° C). In the winter, it is usually about 68° to 78° F (20° - 25° C). In the summer the temperature ranges from 78° to 86° F (25° - 30° C). In a Savanna the temperature does not change a lot. When it does, its very gradual and not drastic.
Precipitation in the temperate grasslands usually occurs in the late spring and early summer. The annual average is about 50.8 to 88.9 cm (20-35 inches). The temperature range is very large over the course of the year.
Tropical savanna climates have monthly mean temperature above 18°C in every month of the year and typically a pronounced dry season, with the driest month having precipitation less than 60 mm and also less than (100 − [total annual precipitation {mm}/25]).
Tropical grasslands are found in tropical wet and dry climates. These areas are hot year-round, usually never dropping under 64 degrees Farenheit. Although these areas are overall very dry, they do have a season of heavy rain. Annual rainfall is from 20-50 inches per year.
Annual Rainfall. Nearly all of the precipitation in the African Savanna occurs during the wet season. During the wet season, which stretches from May to November, the savanna receives a total of around 100 inches of rain or about 20 inches per month (254 cm per dry season and 50.8 per month). During the dry season, there is a total of around only 4 inches throughout the entire season (or 10.16 cm).
ABIOTIC DATA. The grassland climate is rather dry, averaging about 20 to 100 centimeters (8–40 inches) of precipitation a year. Summers are very hot and may reach 45°C (113°F). Winter temperatures often fall below freezing, which is 0°C (32°F).
