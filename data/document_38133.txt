All retail beef refers to all types of retail cuts -- including Choice, Select and ungraded beef.)Average fed cattle prices declined more than $4/cwt. in 1998. Feeder cattle and calf prices also declined compared to 1997.
As feed prices fluctuate, cattle producers should know what the breakeven price is for finishing beef and use it to determine what to charge for freezer beef. The price of beef at a retail level is near record high. The average retail price of Choice beef as of June 2013 was $5.29 per pound. Consumers can save around 20 percent of that cost by purchasing beef in larger quantities of quarters, halves or whole beef carcasses.
