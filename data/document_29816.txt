Staphylococcus (STAFF-ih-low-KOCK-us) aureus (ARE-ee-us) is a type of bacteria, or germ. These bacteria are often called “staph.” Staph bacteria can live in the nose and on the skin. 1 in 5 people have these bacteria. In most cases, Staph bacteria cause no infection.
Prevention. These common-sense precautions can help lower your risk of developing staph infections: 1  Wash your hands. 2  Careful hand-washing is your best defense against germs. 3  Wash your hands briskly for at least 15 to 30 seconds, then dry them with a disposable towel and use another towel to turn off the faucet.
Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial infection resistant to antibiotic methicillin. Staphylococcus aureus, sometimes referred to simply as staph, or staph A is a common bacterium found on the skin of healthy people.
MRSA is a type of staph, so the symptoms of a MRSA infection and the symptoms of an infection due to other staph are often the same. Pimples, rashes, pus-filled boils, especially when warm, painful, red or swollen, can indicate a staph skin infection.
About the organism. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterial infection that is highly resistant to certain antibiotics called beta-lactams. These antibiotics include methicillin and other more common antibiotics such as oxacillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin.
Staphylococcus aureus [staf I lō-kok is aw ree us] (staph), is a type of bacteria that about 30% of people carry in their noses. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm; however, sometimes staph causes infections. In healthcare settings, these infections can be serious or fatal, including:
MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It causes a staph infection (pronounced staff infection) that is resistant to several common antibiotics. There are two types of infection. Hospital-associated MRSA happens to people in healthcare settings.
