Full Definition of HYDROCARBON. : an organic compound (as acetylene or butane) containing only carbon and hydrogen and often occurring in petroleum, natural gas, coal, and bitumens. See hydrocarbon defined for English-language learners. See hydrocarbon defined for kids.
A hydrocarbon is a molecule that is composed of only hydrogen and carbon atoms. These molecules are traditionally a major focus of study in organic chemistry, the branch of chemistry that focuses on chemical compounds involving carbon. They can be described as pure or impure.
hydrocarbon. Organic compound (such as benzene, methane, paraffins) made of two elements carbon and hydrogen and found in coal, crude oil, natural gas, and plant life.
Hydrocarbons are chemical compounds made up of only hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons usually have a carbon skeleton to which the hydrogen atoms are attached. The simplest hydrocarbon is methane, with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Some of the well known energy sources such as petroleum and natural gas have a mixture of various hydrocarbons.
A hydrocarbon is an organic compound made of nothing more than carbons and hydrogens. It is possible for double or triple bonds to form between carbon atoms and even for structures, such as rings, to form. Saturated hydrocarbons have as many hydrogen atoms as possible attached to every carbon.
