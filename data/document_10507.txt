It can take nail polish up to two hours to fully cure, but you can usually resume using your hands and get back to life 15 minutes after applying polish. Fortunately, there is a way you can test your polish after this time to make sure 15 minutes is sufficient drying time.
How long it takes for your nails to dry depends partly on the type of nail polish and nail polish dryer you use. Generally, it takes one to two hours before nail polish is completely dry, especially if you've used a base coat, two coats of nail polish and a topcoat. Formaldehyde-free polishes take more time to dry.
Two hours is a long time to wait for your pedicure to dry completely. If you don't have that kind of time, speed things up. A blast with a cool hair dryer works -- be sure your setting is on cool as warm air keeps polish from firming. Or, grab a nail-drying spray from any drugstore to dry your nails more quickly.
Many nail polish dryers allow you to use your hands 5 to 15 minutes after polish is applied. For best results, polish your nails when you have time to let them dry completely.
Usually it doesn't take too long for the polish to dry. I find that 2 thinner coats will dry a lot faster than 1 thick coat. For a top coat I use Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Top Coat (in the red bottle). It literally dries your nail polish in 30 seconds (to the touch).
How Long. The amount of time it takes your pedicure to dry depends in part on the type of polish you use and how much of it you apply. In general, it takes up to 2 hours for your polish to completely dry. Formaldehyde-free polishes dry a bit quicker than other types.
