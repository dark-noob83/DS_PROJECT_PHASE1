In 1839, Theodor Schwann would expand Schleiden's cell theory to include the animal world, establishing cell theory as the fundamental concept in biology. Schleiden included this article and others in a botany textbook--one that introduced new teaching methods which would dominate the instruction of botany for years.
In 1838 Schwann became familiar with Matthias Schleiden's microscopic research on plants. Schleiden described plant cells and proposed a cell theory which he was certain was the key to plant anatomy and growth. Pursuing this line of research on animal tissues, Schwann not only verified the existence of cells, but he traced the development of many adult tissues from early embryo stages.

Matthias Schleiden was born in Hamburg, Germany, in 1804. He did not originally pursue his interest in botany; instead, he studied law at Heidelberg University from 1824 to 1827 (no doubt influenced by his wealthy family).

By 1838 his methods had led him to propose the cell theory for plants. Schleiden was the first to recognize the importance of cells as fundamental units of life. In his most well-known article, Schleiden described Robert Brown's 1832 discovery of the cell nucleus (which he renamed cytoblast).

Matthias Schleiden. He stated that the different parts of the plant organism are composed of cells. Thus, Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry.
