1 9. 2  Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) •VPF is an option for employees, where they can invest more than the 12% limit in provident fund. • 3 The maximum limit is 100% of basic salary. • 4 The contribution over and above 12% will be deducted only from employee’s salary.
The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has hiked the minimum salary limit to Rs 15,000 from Rs 6,500 earlier.
The Employee Provident fund is deducted from the Employee’s monthly salary. The employer also contributes to the PF fund. From 1st September 2014, the EPFO has revised the basic wage limit on which PF contribution will be done from Rs. 6500 to Rs. 15000. Employers have to revise the PF deductions from September 2014 onward for all employees whose basic salary is less than or equal
The salary ceiling (generally basic+DA) for PF is Rs. 6,500. But if the employer & employee wish, contribution can be made on actual salary in excess of ceiling limit. From both the employee and employer 12% will be deducted towards PF.
On May 27, 2014, the Employee Provident Fund Office issued a circular permitting Companies to limit its PF contributions against the required salary ceiling limit of INR 6,500 per month. Earlier, such PF contributions was calculated as 12% of Basic Salary. Under Provident Fund (PF) regulations, PF is computed at 12% (for both the employer and employee contributions) against ‘basic wages’. The minimum statutory limit against which such PF is to be computed is Rs
If you look at the PF act, it is clear that deduction of PF above monthly salary of Rs.6500/- (Basic+DA) is exempted only if he is a newly recruited employee. More clearly, if a person's salary (Basic+DA)was increased from 6000 to 6700 the employee will not be exempted, but he has to pay @12% of 6500, the wage ceiling.
Dear sir,my question is whether P.F. deduction is liability under Provident fund act or any other act on the part of company if employee's basic salary exceeds maximum ceiling limit of Rs. 6500 & employee does not want to make provident fund deduct from his salary.
