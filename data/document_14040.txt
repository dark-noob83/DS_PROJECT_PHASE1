Hawford dovecote, also owned and maintained for us all by the National Trust, lies about three miles north of Worcester. It is a square structure, in the vernacular of the area called a black and white, and is made of wood and stone. It has four gables in the roof, each one with a small window for additional light. The pigeons used the cupola on top for ingress and egress. Another very unique feature of this dovecote, are the nest boxes.
