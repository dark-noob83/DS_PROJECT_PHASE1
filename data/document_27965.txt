1. Lagers. Pilsners, wheat beer, light beers, and other lagers can be served cold, from about 34 ° -40 ° . These beers highlight smooth mouthfeel over flavor (which is perfectly fine in a good lager), so their hallmark is their refreshing nature, which is best served cold.
Timing is very important in the serving of refrigerated beer. A keg should be refrigerated at least as much as overnight before being served. This will allow the temperature to lower from room temp. to the regulation 38 degrees.
Another method for monitoring the liquid temperature (beer inside the keg) is to put a glass of water in the refrigerator with a thermometer in it. Allow the water to chill for 24 hours, and then you will have a accurate reading of the liquid temperature.
Temperature. Most beers have an ideal serving temperature. There’s a chart below outlining which styles are served at what temperature, but as a general rule the temperature at which to serve a beer is correlated to the strength of the beer.
We learned that it really depends on the type of beer: • Lagers, which are fermented at lower temperatures to begin with, can generally be served at a refrigerator temperature of about 40° or below. Light beers, pilsners, and some wheat beers can also be served at this temperature. • Ales like IPAs, ambers, and browns do better if served slightly warmer, at 45° - 55°.
There is also nothing wrong with serving all ales at room temperature. 3. Strong beers. Beers such as barleywines, very strong stouts (like Imperial Stouts), wild ales, saisons, and aged or casked ales should be served at room temperature, i.e. not chilled at all.
