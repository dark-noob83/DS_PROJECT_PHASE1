Also, if you were to accidently drop your phone, completely not on purpose of course, you would be eligible to get a new one at the one year contract price. The standard early termination fee for Verizon is $175, minus 5 dollars for every month you've been in contract, so your total would be $165. It would be cheaper just to buy another phone you like, perhaps a used one on Craigslist or Ebay, and keep the contract until a new device comes out that you like.
Verizon. Verizon's early termination fee is $175 for standard devices and $350 for advanced devices like smartphones. Like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint, Verizon gives you a discount based on how many months of the contract you've fulfilled.
For other contract terms entered into on or after November 14, 2014, your early termination fee will be $175, which will decline by $5 per month upon completion of months 7–17, $10 per month upon completion of months 18–22, $30 upon completion of month 23 and will be $0 upon completion of your contract term.
Until today, the early termination fees of $350 for new smartphone contracts declined $10 each month. Customers who signed contracts before today will still see their ETFs decline the first month and all months thereafter.
For other contract terms entered into prior to November 14, 2014, your early termination fee will be $175 minus $5 for each full month of your contract term that you complete. Cancellations will become effective on the last day of that month's billing cycle, and you are responsible for all charges incurred until then.
If you're signing up for Service for a minimum contract term, you'll also find information about that contract term and what happens if you cancel a line of Service early or don't pay on time, including the possibility of an early termination fee you may owe Verizon Wireless.
Now, however, according to the new policy, if your contract term results from your purchase of an advanced device on or after Nov. 14, 2014, your early termination fee will be $350, which will decline by: $10 per month in months 8-18, $20 per month in months 19-23, and $60 in the final month of your contract term.
The setup of early termination fees is similar for Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. If you've had your contract for longer than the company's initial return policy (usually 14 or 30 days), you'll probably be charged between $50 and $350 for terminating it early.
