Basic concrete slab cost. I'll base my price on what my actual estimate would be to install a 6 thick concrete slab for one of my customers. Base cost for a 6 thick concrete slab -- $4.00 dollars per square foot --. Take the length of the concrete slab x the width of the slab to get the. total square footage. Multiply the total square footage by 4 (dollars) to get the total price. L x W x $4.00 in this example. 
Cement Slab Costs. As the foundation for a house, as a patio or even as a driveway, a cement slab can be a great flooring choice for a flat, supportive and durable foundation that is designed to last.

1 A slab foundation for an average 1,600- to 1,800-square-foot family home might cost about $7,000-$16,000 or more, while a slab foundation for a 3,000- to 4,500-square-foot home might cost $13,000-$40,000 or more.
