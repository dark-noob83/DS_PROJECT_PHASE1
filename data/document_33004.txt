What name is given to cancer-causing genes? An oncogene is a gene that may be able to cause cancer. These genes  can cause cells to mutate, instead of simply dying, which they are  supposed to do.

Cancer gene types A cancer gene alters the normal functioning of a protein. There are three major categories of cancer genes. Bert Vogelstein, M.D. is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and the Clayton Professor of Oncology and Pathology at Johns Hopkins University. Causes, Inheritance: Cancer gene types, Vogelstein clip 1. Professor Bert Vogelstein, explains that cancer is in essence a genetic disease. It is caused by mutations of genes and there are three types of genes, that contribute to cancer. SOURCE: IC. 969.

Mutations in these important types of genes may also occur in an individual’s germ cells – eggs or sperm. In these cases, a mutation can be passed on from one generation to the next. Such mutations – called germ line or heritable mutations – are often associated with hereditary cancer. This group includes genes such as BRCA1, a gene associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. 1 Oncogenes – Oncogenes promote cell proliferation and stop cell death, at times resulting in cancer. 2  Tumor suppressor genes – These protective genes normally limit the development and/or growth of tumors; when a tumor suppressor gene is mutated, it may fail to prevent a cancer from growing.
Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, a poor diet, lack of physical activity, and consumption of alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants. It caused about 8.2 million deaths or 14.6% of all human deaths. The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer, and in females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer.
Changes in other genes: Other gene mutations can also lead to inherited breast cancers. These gene mutations are much rarer and often do not increase the risk of breast cancer as much as the BRCA genes. They are not frequent causes of inherited breast cancer. If you have inherited a mutated copy of either gene from a parent, you have a high risk of developing breast cancer during your lifetime. Although in some families with BRCA1 mutations the lifetime risk of breast cancer is as high as 80%, on average this risk seems to be in the range of 55 to 65%.
Less often, these cancers may be caused by an inherited gene mutation causing a family cancer syndrome. Certain things make it more likely cancers in a family are caused by a family cancer syndrome, such as. 1  Many cases of an uncommon or rare type of cancer (like kidney cancer). Cancer is a disease of abnormal gene function. Genes are pieces of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). They contain the instructions on how to make the proteins the body needs to function, when to destroy damaged cells, and how to keep the cells in balance.
Types of genes linked to cancer. Many of the genes that contribute to the development of cancer fall into broad categories: Tumor suppressor genes are protective genes. Normally, they limit cell growth by monitoring how quickly cells divide into new cells, repairing mismatched DNA, and controlling when a cell dies. Germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes increase a woman’s risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancers. The most commonly mutated gene in people who have cancer is p53. In fact, more than 50% of all cancers involve a missing or damaged p53 gene. Most p53 gene mutations are acquired mutations.
Cancer, also known as a malignant tumor or malignant neoplasm, is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. It caused about 8.2 million deaths or 14.6% of all human deaths. The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer, and in females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer.
