Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below
The body is very good at keeping its temperature within a narrow, safe range in spite of large variations in temperatures outside the body. When you are too hot, the blood vessels in your skin expand (dilate) to carry the excess heat to your skin's surface.
Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6°F (37°C). Some studies have shown that the normal body temperature can have a wide range, from 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C). A temperature over 100.4°F (38°C) usually means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness.
This temperature is however, the average body temperature and the overall normal temperature varies from a minimum of 97.7° Fahrenheit (36.5° Celsius) to a maximum of almost 99.5° Fahrenheit (37.5° Celsius). Any temperature above or below this range is abnormal.
Normal body temperature can range from 97.8 degrees F (or Fahrenheit, equivalent to 36.5 degrees C, or Celsius) to 99 degrees F (37.2 degrees C) for a healthy adult. A person's body temperature can be taken in any of the following ways: Orally.
Normal body temperature for healthy babies is in the range of 96.8°F to 98.6°F, or 36°C to 37°C. If the baby's body temperature rises above 100.4°F to 101.3°F, then it is considered as indication of fever. If it falls below 96.8°F then the child has low temperature and needs immediate warming up.
Normal Body Temperature Range. The ideal body temperature is 98.6 °F or 37.0 °C. However, the value 98.2±1.3 °F or 36.8±0.7 °C is considered to be the normal body temperature range for oral measurement. Here is some information about the factors that significantly influence body temperatures.
