Mount Kilauea (in Hawaii) does not lie on a plate boundary. The Hawaiian volcanoes occur in the middle of an oceanic plate. This lead people to theorize that Hawaii must lie over a hot spot on the earth caused by some underlying mechanism.
Answer by SBDW1 _. Confidence votes 23.8K. Kilauea is located in the centre of a crustal plate (the pacific plate) away from any plate boundaries. The Hawaiian island chain exists due to the presence of a hotspot (potentially caused by a mantle plume) under the centre of this plate causing volcanism.
Only two of Hawaii's volcanoes are active today-Mauna Loa and Kiluaea. Mauna Loa erupted in 1984 and Kilauea is considered to be one of the most active volcanoes on Earth today. It has erupted 30 times in the last 40 years.
Kilauea is in the middle of the Pacific Plate and is the result of a hot spot rather than plates interacting.
Hawaii is geologically a unique place on Earth because it is caused by a 'hot spot.' Most islands are found at tectonic plate boundaries either from spreading centers (like Iceland) or from subduction zones (like the Aleutian Islands).

Kilauea is a shield volcano that lies over a hotspot. It is one of the most continuously active volcanoes in the world, tending to erupt every two to three years. Kilauea's eruptions are not explosive.
