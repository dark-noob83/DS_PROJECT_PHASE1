Slot Machine Pay Off. Dear John, In reference to the reader's question about slot machines where you play for gold or silver tokens: In Las Vegas, many of the casinos have 25-cent slots that pay off a $10 jackpot with a $10 silver souvenir token. Caesar's Palace has higher denomination machines.
It s true. The slot machines with higher denominations will pay back more money. If you play a $5 slot it will pay back more than a dollar slot, therefore a dollar slot machine will pay back more than a quarter machine. The big decision of course is deciding how much cash you re willing to risk for that big pay back. Play the most coins allowed! This is huge!
When you hit the slot machines in a casino, you'll have dozens of gaming options. Machines come with varying numbers of reels, for example, and many have multiple pay lines. Most machines with multiple pay lines let players choose how many lines to play.
