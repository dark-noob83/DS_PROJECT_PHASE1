1 For our example, let’s assume you’ve worked two overtime hours per week for the past year, and that your salary is based on a 40-hour work week. 2  Thus, your $577 base salary per week, divided by 40 hours, equates to $14 per hour (with rounding to the nearest dollar for simplicity’s sake). You can figure out gross pay for the year, month, two weeks, week, even day if you desire, if you know how many hours you worked during that same period of time. 1  As an example, let’s say you worked 25 hours last week for a part time job — in fact, you’ve worked the same 25 hours per week for the past year.
