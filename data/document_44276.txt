Bake Until Opaque and Flaky. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for fillets or 350 degrees F for a dressed fish. You can bake the fillets at a lower temperature, if desired, but remember to increase the cooking time. Bake salmon fillets or steaks, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness.
Roast for 4 to 6 minutes per half-inch thickness of salmon: Roasting time depends on the thickness of your salmon, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon fillet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes — 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.
Preheat the oven to 350ºF/177°C. Although you will be wrapping the salmon in parchment paper, the oven doesn't need much extra in terms of heat. Cooking salmon or any other type of fish, in parchment paper is a very efficient way of baking, and almost fool-proof.
Bake the salmon for around 35 minutes, or until an internal temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit is reached and the fish flakes easily with a fork. Let the fish rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.
Directions. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Place salmon, skin side down, on a non-stick baking sheet or in a non-stick pan with an oven-proof handle. Bake until salmon is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with the Toasted Almond Parsley Salad and squash, if desired. Mince the shallot and add to a small bowl.
