General Elephant Information Average lifespan in the wild: Up to 70 years, 50 years is old in the wild Size: Height at the shoulder, 8.2 to 13 ft. (2.5 to 4 m) Weight: 5,000 to 14,000 lbs. (2,268 to 6,350 kg) African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. General Elephant Information. Average lifespan in the wild: Up to 70 years, 50 years is old in the wild. Size: Height at the shoulder, 8.2 to 13 ft. (2.5 to 4 m).
Size: Asian elephants live in large blocks of forest near water sources and grasslands, habitat that has been greatly reduced in the last half century. They inhabit India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Bangladesh, and southern China. Genus and Species: Elephas maximus. Asian elephants grow up to 21 feet long, stand up to 10 feet tall, and weigh up to 11,000 pounds. Females reach around eight and a half feet tall and weigh less than males. Despite their size, elephants are able to walk silently
The current Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) requirement for outdoor space for a single adult elephant is 1,800 sq ft (167 sq m) while the indoor space requirement is a mere 400 ft² (37.2 m²). To get an idea of how big a typical elephant home range is, try to picture a space that is 80 kilometers (50 miles) by 32 kilometers (20 miles) wide. That is about 640,000 acres. Another way to envision a typical elephant home range is to think about it as a football field (including the end zones).
Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). The elephant's penis can reach a length of 100 cm (39 in) and a diameter of 16 cm (6 in) at the base. It is S-shaped when fully erect and has a Y-shaped orifice. The female has a well-developed clitoris at up to 40 cm (16 in). The vulva is located between the hind legs instead of near the tail as in most mammals.
Space. In the wild, elephants inhabit very large home ranges and walk considerable distances every day. Their home ranges can be from several hundred sq km up to 5,000 sq km or more in size. For most people, this huge space is difficult to imagine. To get an idea of how big a typical elephant home range is, try to picture a space that is 80 kilometers (50 miles) by 32 kilometers (20 miles) wide. That is about 640,000 acres.

Life Expectancy. 55 - 60 Yrs (Wild) Over 80 yrs (in Captivity). Main Characteristics African Elephants are the largest of all land living animals. They have a head and body length between 5 and 7.5 m (16.4 - 24.6 ft), a tail length between 1 and 1.5 m (3.25 - 5 ft) and they weigh between 4 and 7 tonnes (3.9 - 6.9 tons). 
At the turn of the 20th century, there were a few million African elephants and about 100,000 Asian elephants. Today, there are an estimated 450,000 - 700,000 African elephants and between 35,000 - 40,000 wild Asian elephants. African forest elephants inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa. The Asian elephant is found in India, Sri Lanka, China and much of Southeast Asia.
They are the world’s largest terrestrial mammal. There are two recognized subspecies of elephants: the savanna (bush) elephant and the forest elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants and their tusks curve out, while forest elephants are darker and have tusks that are straighter and point downward. An elephant’s trunk is a long nose that is used for breathing, smelling, drinking, trumpeting, and grabbing objects. African elephants have two fingerlike extensions on the tips of their trunks that are used for holding onto small objects.
