To help your muscles recover and to replace their glycogen stores, eat a meal that contains both protein and carbohydrates within two hours of your exercise session if possible. Good post-workout food choices include: 1  Yogurt and fruit. 2  Peanut butter sandwich. 3  Low-fat chocolate milk and pretzels. 4  Pasta with meatballs.
More on the protein and carbs you need in a minute. First, let’s start with a quick explanation of why you shouldn’t eat fat after a workout. Many times throughout this website I explain why fat is NOT a bad thing (when it’s the “good” fat) and why it is an important part of everyone’s diet.
Considerations. Without a carb-rich snack like brown rice, your recovery after a workout can take longer -- up to 72 hours, says Carmichael. You only need a large carb and protein meal after a hard, long exercise session. Running a 5K or using an elliptical trainer for 30 minutes doesn’t tax your system as severely.
The food you eat after hitting the gym just may be the most important food you eat all day. See, muscles store excess energy in the form of glycogen and protein and, when you work out, the body burns fuel from your pre-workout meal, then it breaks down glycogen stored in muscles.
Brown rice with chicken: If you tend to exercise after lunch or dinner, avoid rich foods and have a simple dish of brown rice with chicken or tofu. It's a bland meal that sits well and provides a good amount of carbs and protein, says Meine.
