The cost shown in Table 3 can be projected to reflect costs per plant space. The total overhead costs will approximate $8.00 fixed and $7.50 variable for a total cost of $15.50 per year per plant space with a plant density of 3.95 ft2 (.37 M2) per plant. If the total fixed and variable costs of $11,313 are divided by the total production of 19,710 lbs (8940 kgs) determine break even production costs of $57/lb ($1.27/kg) or $.77/lb ($1.71/kg) if only the total production of U.S. No. 1 and 2 is used to calculate break even costs.
1 Kits to build a permanent outdoor greenhouse start between $500 and $2,500 for a basic metal and plastic structure (typically 6'x6' to 10'x10'), but can cost $3,000-$15,000 for larger (12'x12' to 18'x20' and up), more elaborate and/or more durable models. 1 Cooling can be provided by a simple fan ($10-$50 or more) or by covering the roof with shade cloth or roller shades (starting around $25-$100, but going as high as $1,000 or more). 2  A basic potting bench starts around $50-$250, but can cost $1,200 or more. 3  For details, see How Much Does a Potting Bench Cost.
1 A basic cold frame starts at $30-$100, but larger and more durable models can cost $100-$600. 2  Cold frames can also be constructed for free using recycled materials. 3  For more details, see How Much Does a Portable Greenhouse Cost. 1 Cooling can be provided by a simple fan ($10-$50 or more) or by covering the roof with shade cloth or roller shades (starting around $25-$100, but going as high as $1,000 or more). 2  A basic potting bench starts around $50-$250, but can cost $1,200 or more. 3  For details, see How Much Does a Potting Bench Cost.

But you don’t have to use it as a greenhouse. It can be a guest house or an energy-efficient small home. The design is flexible, so you can incorporate whatever recycled materials you can find. Even if you buy some of the materials and hire a bit of help, you can build a greenhouse for about $3,800. If you plan to use the building as a greenhouse, use insulated, wood-framed windows that aren’t coated with low-e or solar film, because the coating limits heat gain. To build your own greenhouse, start with a level building site, but make sure the site slopes enough to drain water from the building. Then cover the area where you’ll build the greenhouse with a weed barrier and gravel. Make a 10-foot-by-12-foot grid (on center) of concrete deck pads — three rows of four pads. Put a 10-foot rot-resistant 2-by-4 (flat, not on edge) on the short rows
1 Portable greenhouses start between $30 and $100 for low plastic pop-ups to protect plants; cost $100-$500 for walk-in-size greenhouses that pop up or fold out; and can be $100-$600 or more for snap-together frames with weather-resistant fitted translucent covers, with prices dependent on size, style and materials. 1 Cooling can be provided by a simple fan ($10-$50 or more) or by covering the roof with shade cloth or roller shades (starting around $25-$100, but going as high as $1,000 or more). 2  A basic potting bench starts around $50-$250, but can cost $1,200 or more. 3  For details, see How Much Does a Potting Bench Cost.
Whether you build the greenhouse from scratch or build it with a kit, you should choose the size carefully. 1  The larger the greenhouse, the more money it will cost to build and heat. 2  The most popular greenhouse size is 8 by 6 feet (2.4 by 1.8 m). Solar heat may only account for 25 percent of the heat in your greenhouse, so a backup heater is essential. 1  You can also use a wood or oil-based heater, but it must be vented to the outside to ensure good air quality.
In fact, it is usually best to spend the time to seek out and communicate with contractors who have already built such projects. For the purpose of this conversation we will consider the costs and requirements for the construction of a greenhouse on a residential lot. According to the Craftsman National Building Cost Estimator program, the pricing on a greenhouse measuring 12'x12' would be around $3587, or $25 per square foot. 1 This might be problematic in areas of heavy frost, however); 2  Concrete-the knee walls and flooring of the greenhouse would demand roughly 3.5 cubic yards of concrete. 3  This is priced at an average of $75 per cubic yard, and with labor would cost around $540;
