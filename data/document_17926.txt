These formed elements include erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets which are also known as thrombocytes. These elements are carried in the plasma, the liquid form of blood. These elements are responsible for the duties of transport, immunity, and clotting.
Erythrocytes or red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow from precursor cells called erythroblasts which themselves are formed from pleuripotential stem cells-the m â€¦ other of all blood cells. Along the way, erythroblasts take various forms/ stages until they differentiate into mature erythrocytes.
Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Erythrocytes or red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow from precursor cells called erythroblasts which themselves are formed from pleuripotential stem cells-the mother of all blood cells. Along the way, erythroblasts take various forms/ stages until they differentiate into mature erythrocytes.
Erythrocytes, also known as red blood cells (RBCs), function to transport oxygen in the blood. The shape of erythrocytes is ideal for this function. Seen from the top, erythrocytes appear to be circular, but a side view shows that they are actually biconcaved discs.
This short life span necessitates the process erythropoiesis, which is the formation of red blood cells. All blood cells are formed in the bone marrow. This is the erythrocyte factory, which is soft, highly cellar tissue that fills the internal cavities of bones.
Blood cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells and are formed in the bone marrow through the highly regulated process of hematopoiesis. Hematopoietic stem cells are capable of transforming into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
