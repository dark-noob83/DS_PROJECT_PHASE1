In planar geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.
In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.
An angle is defined as a figure that is formed from two lines that meet at a common place. The sides of a triangle are examples of lines that form an angle.
By Deb Russell. Definition: Angles are formed by two rays that begin at the same point or share the same endpoint. The angle measures the amount of turn between the two arms and is usually measured in degrees or radians. Where the two rays intersect (come together to meet) is called the vertex.
A ANGLE: The A angle is the relationship between the long axis of the patella and the tibial tuberosity; the Q angle describes the relationship between the long axis of the femur, measured from the anterior superior ilac spine.
Point B is the figure above is the vertex of the angle ∠ ABC. Legs. The legs (sides) of an angle are the two lines that make it up. In the figure above, the line segments AB and BC are the legs of the angle ∠ ABC. Interior. The interior of an angle is the space in the 'jaws' of the angle extending out to infinity.
Full Definition of ANGLE. 1. 2. a: the figure formed by two lines extending from the same point; also: dihedral angle b: a measure of an angle or of the amount of turning necessary to bring one line or plane into coincidence with or parallel to another.
1 The angle symbol, followed by three points that define the angle, with the middle letter being the vertex, and the other two on the legs. 2  So in the figure above the angle would be ∠ ABC or ∠ CBA. 3  So long as the vertex is the middle letter, the order is not important.
