One of my friend's ducks just hatched 19 eggs if you want 23 ducks to take care of I would suggest that you remove a few.My duck is sitting on 10 eggs and she laid them one a day. 
In 24 to 28 days for wild mallard ducks (28 to 32 days for muscovies), all the eggs in the nest will hatch within a twenty-four to 48 hour period. The female will return to the selected site to lay an egg each day, then return to the water to be with the male. Mallards lay between 8-12 eggs and muscovies lay between 12-18 eggs. The egg laying process lasts for an equal number of days (it takes 12 days to lay 12 eggs). Once egg laying is complete, she will leave the male (who will wait at the water for her) and she will begin incubation on the nest fulltime
Pekin ducks are less broody than other ducks which means they will incubate eggs less frequently and they are more likely to abandon their nest before their eggs hatch. Hens can be used to sit on the duck eggs, or they can be incubated artificially. Pekin ducks, for the most part, are too heavy to get airborne. 
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Duck eggs take 28-30 days to hatch, except for Muscovy eggs, which take 35 days. If you find a wild duck's nest on your property and don't see the mother on the eggs, don't necessarily worry. Ducks lay an egg every day or two until they have a full clutch (usually 8 to 15); only then will the mother start to sit on them. It takes the eggs 28 days to hatch from when she starts sitting all the time. When they hatch, she will soon lead them to a nearby body of water. The father takes no part in caring for the eggs or young. Source(s): internet readings.
How many eggs she will lay is determined by the breed of duck. Some breeds lay lots of eggs, some not as many. If you collect her eggs when she lays them, she won't sit on them. If you want her to hatch them, then leave them in her nest and after she has layed several eggs, she will start sitting on them. I have 2 male ducks, one a mallard and the other 1/2 black and 1/2 mallard. I have 1 female that is also 1/2 mallard and 1/2 black duck. Today 12/7/08 I saw the black male mating with the female and that has trigger several questions.
