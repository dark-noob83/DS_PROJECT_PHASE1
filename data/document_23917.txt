The second biggest car manufacturer in Europe, Peugeot have been producing cars for over a century, and in that time have gained a reputation for creating some of the most practical and stylish cars on the road. Used Peugeot Cars Overview. The beginning of their current success came in 1983, with the launch of the small city car the 205 - predecessor to the subsequently successful 206, 207, and today's 208.
Believe it or not, this garage-kept Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 is currently up for sale with an asking price of just 18,000 euros ($20,200). It’s been completely restored over the last 10 years, and it’s only had two previous owners. It also comes with all the original documentation and road registration. That’s quite the list already, but it seems that Peugeot would like to increase that last number, and has a car ready to compete in the 2016 Dakar Rally. That car is the 2008 DKR16, and despite its name, it has almost nothing in common with the regular road-going 2013 Peugeot 2008 crossover.
The Peugeot 206 is a supermini car that was produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from 1998 to 2010. The Peugeot 206 was also built at Ryton in Coventry, England, however, with the introduction of the 207 to the range, Peugeot decided to close the Ryton factory and move production to Slovakia with EU funding, due to the fact that they could produce their vehicles with same or better quality for a lower price there.
