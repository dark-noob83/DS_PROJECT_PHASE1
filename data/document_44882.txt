Most plants can withstand high temperatures if they have a large root system that can bring up an adequate amount of water to keep the plant comfortable during transpiration. During vegetative growth, temperatures that extend into the 80’s and 90’s (27-37*C) can produce elongated stems. For outdoor plants, you can cool the air with micro-sprayers that lower the temperature by an average of 20 to 30 degrees during the day. The spray emitted is full of droplets that are 5 microns or less in diameter.
There is also an issue of your plants having been grown indoors and never exposed to low temps. That is exactly what the major plant growers (Bonnie, etc) do. They maintain greenhouse temps at minimum 65 degrees to keep the plants growing rapidly. The result is a plant that cannot tolerate temperatures below 65 degrees. All things considered, you would have been better served to have set your plants outdoors in their pots for the day and then back indoors at night. 
Temperature. Temperatures for various hybrids of outdoor impatiens plants should be 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit at night and 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, but others thrive in warmer weather. Watering plants daily will help them stand tall and stay colorful during hot summer days

A heating mat is ideal if you’ve only got a few plants to worry about. Larger gardens might require the use of a recirculating hot water heater to ensure optimal temperatures. Most outdoor varieties can endure temperatures as low as 50*F (10*C) without any problem. For outdoor plants, you can cool the air with micro-sprayers that lower the temperature by an average of 20 to 30 degrees during the day. The spray emitted is full of droplets that are 5 microns or less in diameter.
Some plants just need protection from a hard freeze, others a light frost, and a few tender tropicals don't like temperatures below 60 or 70 degrees F. In general, I'd set the minimum temperature to 50 o F at night. During the day it should get warmer and you may have to vent a little to keep the greenhouse from over heating. Here's a basic outline of plant hardiness, these are the minimum temperatures and not recommended for growing.
Marijuana grown indoors functions better at moderate temperatures between 70 and 75*F (21-23*C) during the light period and a drop of no more than 15*F (9*C) to 60*F (15*C) during the dark period. CO2-enriched plants will produce more at a marginally higher temperature of just under 80*F (27*C). If the temperature drops below 60*F (15*C) during the dark period, plants will grow more slowly and yields will not be as abundant. For outdoor plants, you can cool the air with micro-sprayers that lower the temperature by an average of 20 to 30 degrees during the day. The spray emitted is full of droplets that are 5 microns or less in diameter.
