Tetracycline hydrochloride is a prescription antibiotic used to treat a wide range of infections. It's effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, as well as other organisms, including some protozoan parasites. Tetracycline has commonly been used to treat acne and other skin infections; respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia; genital and urinary infections; and Helicobacter pylori (the bacteria that can lead to stomach ulcers).
Tetracycline (INN) /ˌtɛtrəˈsaɪkliːn/ is a broad-spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of Actinobacteria, indicated for use against many bacterial infections. It is first-line therapy for rocky mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia), Lyme disease (B. burgdorferi), Q fever (Coxiella), psittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum (Chlamydia), mycoplasma pneumoniae and to eradicate nasal carriage of meningococci. Tetracycline tablets were used in the plague outbreak in India in 1992.
DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Tetracycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic, that is, it is active against many different types of bacteria. It is effective against Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and many others. STORAGE: Tetracycline should be stored below 30 C (86 F). PRESCRIBED FOR: Tetracycline is used for treating several types of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Some examples include infections of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin.
In the 1950s, when most of the tetracyclines were discovered, their antimicrobial spectrum was broader than of any othen antibiotic then known. Tetracyclines are characterized by their exceptional chemotherapeutic efficacy against a wide range of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, richettsia, spirochetes, and large viruses, such as members of the lymphogranuloma group [10].
A: Tetracycline is an antibiotic that fights bacteria in the body. It can be used to treat many different bacterial infections, such as urinary tract infections, acne, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and others. Common side effects include mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach upset. Tetracycline has commonly been used to treat acne and other skin infections; respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia; genital and urinary infections; and Helicobacter pylori (the bacteria that can lead to stomach ulcers).
It is a protein synthesis inhibitor. It is commonly used to treat acne today, and, more recently, rosacea, and is historically important in reducing the number of deaths from cholera. Tetracycline is marketed under the brand names Sumycin, Tetracyn, Lymecycline, and Panmycin, among others. It is first-line therapy for rocky mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia), Lyme disease (B. burgdorferi), Q fever (Coxiella), psittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum (Chlamydia), mycoplasma pneumoniae and to eradicate nasal carriage of meningococci. Tetracycline tablets were used in the plague outbreak in India in 1992.
Tetracycline and Antibiotic Resistance. Overuse of tetracycline (and other antibiotics) in humans and farm animals has allowed some bacteria to build up a resistance to antibiotics. The development of these so-called superbug bacteria limits the number of infections that antibiotics such as tetracycline can treat. Tetracycline has commonly been used to treat acne and other skin infections; respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia; genital and urinary infections; and Helicobacter pylori (the bacteria that can lead to stomach ulcers).
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common type of infection caused by bacteria (most often E. coli) that travel up the urethra to the bladder. A bladder infection is called cystitis. If bacterial infection spreads to the kidneys and ureters, the condition is called pyelonephritis. After a week of antibiotic treatment, most patients are free of infection. If the symptoms do not clear up within the first few days of therapy, doctors generally suggest that women discontinue their antibiotic and provide a urine sample for culturing in order to identify the specific organism causing the condition.
Tetracyclines can be safely used together with Methylene Blue. Minocycline is a broader spectrum antibiotic than the other tetracyclines, particularly in treating infections caused by gram negative bacteria. Of the tetracycline family, it is most effective against septicemia. Products Containing Tetracycline: ____________________________________________________. 1  API T.C. In 2005 a new subgroup of tetracyclines named glycylcyclines. These new antimicrobials are being used to treat drug-resistant infections that do not respond to standard tetracyclines. In ornamental fish, Tetracycline is used to treat a variety of external and internal bacterial infections, including these disorders:
