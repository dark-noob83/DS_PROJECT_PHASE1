Share to:   The average lifespan of an adult housefly is approximately 15 to 25 days. Since they can complete their lifecycle in as little as seven to ten days, flies typically live … between 22 and 25 days from egg to death.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housefly. 14 people found this useful.
The lifespan of a hover fly is similar to other flies. They can  live anywhere between 15 to 30 days and it all depends on the  climate and temperature they are in. 2 people found this useful.
The life expectancy of a housefly is generally 15 to 30 days and depends upon temperature and living conditions. Flies dwelling in warm homes and laboratories develop faster and live longer than their counterparts in the wild.
Fruit flies live only between 10 to 18 days, but they can reproduce very rapidly and start the metamorphosis all over again. Discover the fruit fly's life cycle with information from a high school biology teacher in this free video on insects.
There are many families of flies in North America. Although the life cycle of a fly can range from days to years depending on species and conditions, all flies undergo a complete four-stage life cycle that consists of egg, larva, pupa and adult stages. The adult housefly can live up to one month in the wild. The fruit fly also lives for approximately 30 days after reaching adulthood. Flies survive longest in warmer temperatures and their ideal temperatures—between 75 and 80 degrees—are those found in most American homes.
