Report Abuse. I get paid 7.25 an hour. Once you start working at McDonalds, it'll change the way you see the job. I thought it was going to be easy and boring but no it is not. My job is stressful. Employees and managers are yelling at eachother constantly. But its fun.
Best Answer: i worked at mcdonald's for three years as a crew member, and i never made any more than 7.35. i got started at minimum wage, and i only got a raise once... after three years... its a good first job, but i wouldn't suggest working there... it kinda sucks.
In a separate BLS category, we find over half a million fast-food cooks who earn, on average, $9.07 an hour. But that varies by industry and state. Cooks in gasoline stations earn, on average, $8.68 per hour, while cooks in grocery stores get $10.02. The San Francisco area has the highest average wages for fast-food workers in the country, but at $12.17 per hour, that falls well short of the $15 demanded by the protesting McDonald’s employees.
