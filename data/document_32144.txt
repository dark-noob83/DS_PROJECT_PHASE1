Infectious disease doctors (HIV/ID on the chart above) earned 22% more than they did last year, and family physicians earned 10% more.
The co-payment amount varies depending on the insurance plan. Typical co-pays for a visit to a primary care physician range from $15 to $25.

And finally, you must think we know finance, as we have to try balance a $230,000 loan while making $50,000 at age 30.

Or that “studies show that doctors lack empathy.”. Unfortunately, we physicians do not have much of a voice on Capitol Hill. 
Thats up front before the doc's will even see you. Then you get a bill. I have a $3000 deductable so after I pay that for the year I don't pay anything else. So I had surgury in January and after my insurance paid, I still had to pay out of pocket cash $7,000. I think a normal visit to a doctor with out insurance would be not $1000 but probably $100-$500 depending on the doctor. If you go to the ER its $1000 just for walking in the door. Then you pay for the doctor and any meds and tests and treatments. I was in between health insuarance for work I had 3 days where I wasn't covered and I ended up in the ER and it cost me $3000 with all the tests.
