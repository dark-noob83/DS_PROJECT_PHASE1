Poison ivy rash is caused by an allergic reaction to an oily resin called urushiol (u-ROO-she-ol). This oil is in the leaves, stems and roots of poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac.
What are the symptoms of poison ivy, oak, and sumac? Wherever the oil touches the skin of a sensitive individual, an exquisitely itchy, red rash will appear between 8 and 72 hours (usually 12-48 hours) later, which will often go on to develop blisters.
About 15 percent of the 120 million Americans who are allergic to poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac are so highly sensitive that they break out in a rash and begin to swell in 4 to 12 hours instead of the normal 24 to 48. Their eyes may swell shut and blisters may erupt on their skin.
Urushiol oil from poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac plants can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to penetrate the skin. Once the oil binds to your skin, an allergic reaction can develop. You may experience symptoms within 12-48 hours after exposure.
Healing. Many cases of poison oak rashes lasted for 2 to 3 weeks depending on the gravity of the situation. The time it takes for the rashes to heal varies on the exposure of skin to the oil and any possible complications.
Urushiol Oil. The itching and scratching of poison oak is caused by urushiol oil, excreted by both the oak and its cousins poison ivy and poison sumac. Almost everyone is allergic to urushiol oil; when it gets on the skin, it causes itching, redness, swelling and terrible blisters.
Most rashes caused by poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac are mild and last from five to 12 days. In severe cases, the rash can last for 30 days or longer.
The healing period for poison oak varies depending on the extent of exposure and any complications which may develop. In most cases, the rash starts to appear within 48 hours. It typically lasts from one to two weeks, but can last up to three weeks or longer in some cases.
