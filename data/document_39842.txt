Reabsorption in a nephron occurs in the Loop of Henle Reabsorption has been addressed to substances which are absorbed back from the nerphrone back in to the blood(capillaries …). On other hand Secretion is the absorption of substances from blood.
It is important to mention that additional reabsorption occurs in the Loop of Henle, distal convoluted tube, and the collecting ducts as well. Again, however, MOST reabsorption of filtrate from the glomerolus takes place in the proximal convoluted tube of the nephron.
Once inside the lumen of the nephron, small molecules, such as ions, glucose and amino acids, get reabsorbed from the filtrate: 1  Specialized proteins called transporters are located on the membranes of the various cells of the nephron. 2  These transporters grab the small molecules from the filtrate as it flows by them.
Within the nephron (the functional unit of the kidneys), filtration occurs in the glomerolus. The filtered fluid is called filtrate. Reabsorption of filtrate occurs in a few places within the nephron, however, the majority of reabsorption takes place in the proximal convoluted tube.

The proximal tubule is the site of most reabsorption via glucose transporters (reabsorb 100% of glucose in healthy individuals), approx. 65% Sodium and various other solutes are also reabsorbed.
