At densities of about five to 10 locations per linear plant mile, costs were about $5,000 per location.Generally speaking, at densities of 35 locations per plant mile or more, costs dropped below $5,000 a mile. But others say the cost of fiber plant, even in rural areas, is about $1,1
The cost of a 6-count fiber cable is $2,000 per mile, while an 864-count cable is. $50,000 per mile, implying a marginal cost of approximately $50 per fiber per mile. Actual costs for fiber purchase or lease,of course, reflect market costs and depend on the.
View Details. Fiber Optic Cable Installation. Fiber Optic Cable. 288 Count Fiber Cost = 5,000 ft at $5.87 per foot; , 144 Count Fiber = 5000 ft at $2.98 per foot; 24 Count Fiber = 70,000 ft at $0.68 per foot.
Vertical fiber cable cost is calculated as 98.4 feet at $0.35/fiber/meter for two fibers. In this scenario, the all-fiber system is more expensive than UTP, due to the high cost of 100Base-FX NICs and the high cost of the Cisco 4000 series equipment.
1 Expect to pay $1 to $6 per linear foot for fiber optic cable installation (depending on the fiber count) plus the cost of connection hardware and terminations.
We installed fiber to interconnect large facilities because of runs in excess of 6,000 feet and the cost was no where close to $100,000. Then we had a ranch project that would have been 2 1/2 miles to the nearest cable provider that we were trying to work with.
The switch is connected to other switches via 3M Gigabit Ethernet modules, and port utilization is assumed to be 90%. Horizontal fiber cable cost is calculated using $0.50/fiber/meter for two fibers. Vertical fiber cable cost is 98.4 feet at $0.50/fiber/meter for two fibers. Again, the costs used for the model represent a starting point.
