Answers. Best Answer: The correct answer is C. During El Nino, the surface temperature of the eastern Pacific increases, blocking the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water than would normally support very rich phytoplankton growth. B. the ocean surface off the coast of Peru is about 2 ft higher than off the coast of Australia. C. there is an increase in the number of phytoplankton in the Pacific.
