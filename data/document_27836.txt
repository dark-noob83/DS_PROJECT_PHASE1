The “Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010” addresses sodium intake in detail. The average daily sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 milligrams per day, an excessive amount that raises blood pressure and poses health risks. In general, Americans should limit daily sodium consumption to 2,300 milligrams, but this is an upper safe limit, not a recommended daily allowance
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that everyone limit sodium intake to below 2,300 mg per day and that everyone should also get at least 4,700 mg of potassium a day to help balance their levels of sodium and potassium in the body. The National Heart Lung and Blood Association reports that 500 mg is a safe daily minimum intake of sodium. This amount will be enough to maintain the bodily functions that require sodium. In an average temperate climate, a normal adult may be able to thrive with as little as 115 mg of sodium each day.
The FDA urges Americans to limit dietary sodium. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that individuals consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, and that certain groups limit intake to 1,500 milligrams per day. The average daily sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 milligrams per day, an excessive amount that raises blood pressure and poses health risks.
Most Canadians consume far more sodium than is needed. The recommended amount per day is between 1500 mg (considered adequate intake) and 2300 mg (upper amount) for people 9 -50 years of age. For people over 50 years of age, an adequate intake drops to 1300 mg per day until 70 and then 1200 mg over 70 years of age. However, the average daily intake in the Canadian diet is about 3500 mg of sodium, although many Canadians eat well in excess of 5000 mg per day. Can I get too much sodium? Yes.
Some people are more sensitive to the effects of salt than others. The guidelines also recommend that, in general, individuals with hypertension, blacks, and middle-aged and older adults should limit intake to 1,500 mg of sodium per day. 1 Potassium can help blunt the effects of sodium on blood pressure. 2  The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. 3  Potassium-rich foods include leafy, green vegetables and fruits from vines. 4  Flavor food with pepper and other herbs and spices instead of salt. 5  Choose unsalted snacks.
Considerations. According to the National Heart Lung and Blood Association, the average sodium intake for adults in America is over 3,400 mg per day, far above the minimal level required and more than double the recommended maximum limit for most people. The National Heart Lung and Blood Association reports that 500 mg is a safe daily minimum intake of sodium. This amount will be enough to maintain the bodily functions that require sodium. In an average temperate climate, a normal adult may be able to thrive with as little as 115 mg of sodium each day.
Although sodium is a vital mineral for the proper functioning of your body, you don't need to worry about getting enough sodium. Most Americans consume far more than they need. The minimum needed for good health is 116 milligrams (mg) a day, and the average American gets more than 4,000 mg a day. 
However, the average daily intake in the Canadian diet is about 3500 mg of sodium, although many Canadians eat well in excess of 5000 mg per day. For people over 50 years of age, an adequate intake drops to 1300 mg per day until 70 and then 1200 mg over 70 years of age. However, the average daily intake in the Canadian diet is about 3500 mg of sodium, although many Canadians eat well in excess of 5000 mg per day. Can I get too much sodium? Yes.
Setting Limits. The American Heart Association recommends limiting your sodium intake to less than 2,000 milligrams per day. And this may be easier said than done, due to the amount of sodium found in processed and canned foods. Frozen foods can even contain high amounts of sodium in an effort to keep them fresh longer.
