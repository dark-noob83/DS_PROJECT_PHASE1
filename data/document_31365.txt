Transgenic organisms. A transgenic organism contains a gene or genes which have been artificially inserted instead of the organism aquiring them through reproduction. Please contribute to this project, if you have more information about this term feel free to edit this page.
A transgenic organism occurs when an organism is modified by inserting DNA from an organism of another species. Transgenic organisms are often developed for agricultural purposes. Kiwis, oranges and other fruits have been genetically modified to be resistant to certain diseases. A transgenic organism is an organism which has been modified by inserting the DNA of another species into it as an embryo.
Transgenic organisms are organisms whose genetic material has been changed by the addition of foreign genes. This foreign material can come from other organisms of the same species, from a whole different species, or synthetic sources.
Transgenic animals are animals (most commonly mice) that have had a foreign gene deliberately inserted into their genome. Such animals are most commonly created by the micro-injection of DNA into the pronuclei of a fertilised egg which is subsequently implanted into the oviduct of a pseudopregnant surrogate mother.
This process is also known as “genetic engineering.” Genes of one species can be modified, or genes can be transplanted from one species to another. Genetic engineering is made possible by recombinant DNA technology. Organisms that have altered genomes are known as transgenic. Most transgenic organisms are generated in the laboratory for research purposes. For example, “knock-out” mice are transgenic mice that have a particular gene of interest disabled.
A transgenic organism is an organism which has been modified with genetic material from another species. The genetic modification is accomplished by inserting DNA into an embryo with the assistance of a virus, a plasmid, or a gene gun.
