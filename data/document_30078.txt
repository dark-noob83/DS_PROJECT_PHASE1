2. This mean we are given two angles of a triangle and one side, which is not the side adjacent to the two given angles. Such a triangle can be solved by using Angles of a Triangle to find the other angle, and The Law of Sines to find each of the other two sides. See Solving AAS Triangles.
SSS. Let's start with the case where we know the three sides, $a$, $b$, and $c$. We can use the Law of Cosines, in the form where it is solved for the cosine of an angle, to find the measures of two of the angles, then use the fact that the sum of the measures of the angles is 180° to find the third:
If we know two sides and the measure of the angle they include, say $a$, $b$, and $C$, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the unknown side length, then pick up with the SSS process to find the unknown angles: $$c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C}$$. $$A=\arccos\left(\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\right)$$. $$B=180°-A-C$$.
SSS means Side, Side, Side.  SSS  is when we know three sides of the triangle, and want to find the missing angles. To solve an SSS triangle: 1  use The Law of Cosines first to calculate one of the angles. 2  then use The Law of Cosines again to find another angle. 3  and finally use angles of a triangle add to 180° to find the last angle.
This means we are given two sides and one angle that is not the included angle. In this case, use The Law of Sines first to find either one of the other two angles, then use Angles of a Triangle to find the third angle, then The Law of Sines again to find the final side. See Solving SSA Triangles.
