The Center Hall is a broad central hallway on the second floor of the White House, home of the President of the United States.

Later, Woodrow Wilson watched motion pictures here as the present White House theater was still a cloakroom.

The Vaulted Ground Floor Hall. Like all the floors, the ground floor of the White House features a large central hall. But the ground floor's hall has a dramatic vaulted ceiling that helps transfer the weight of the upper floors to the main supporting walls. Originally, this vaulting was a functional architectural element, but when the White House was rebuilt in 1952, the steel infrastructure made it unnecessary. The look was retained anyway, but it is now essentially decorative. The hall is about 17 feet wide and 161 feet long. Presidents sometimes use this hall for televised addresses to the nation, since the vauls provide a dramatic backdrop and an easy means of approaching and departed from the cameras.
