a general rule for comparing periodic salaries to hourly wages is based on a standard 40 hour work week with 50 weeks per year minus two weeks for vacation example $ 40000 year periodic salary divided by 50 weeks equals $ 800 week according to the payment of wages act if a company has less than 1000 employees salary is paid by the 7th of every month if a company has more than 1000 employees salary is paid by the 10th of every month
a person who receives wages is also entitled to overtime pay of 1 5x his normal rate of pay if he works more than 40 hours per week there is also a difference between salary and wages in regard to the speed of payment for example if a person has a $ 52000 salary and he is paid once a week then the gross amount of each of the 52 paychecks he receives during the year is $ 1000 $ 52000 52 weeks the person receiving a salary is not paid a smaller amount for working fewer hours nor is he paid more for working overtime
wages and salaries are the compensation that workers and employees get in exchange for their labor the difference between a salary and wage is that a salary is paid periodically while wages are commonly paid per unit mostly per working hour the bureau of labor statistics also compiles average wage data for large occupational groups in 2009 the average annual salary for elementary school teachers was 53150 u s dollars retail sales people the largest occupational group in the united states earned an average annual salary of 24630 u s dollars
the essential difference between a salary and wages is that a salaried person is paid a fixed amount per pay period and a wage earner is paid by the hour someone who is paid a salary is paid a fixed amount in each pay period with the total of these fixed payments over a full year summing to the amount of the salary for example if a person has a $ 52000 salary and he is paid once a week then the gross amount of each of the 52 paychecks he receives during the year is $ 1000 $ 52000 52 weeks the person receiving a salary is not paid a smaller amount for working fewer hours nor is he paid more for working overtime
this person is considered to be a non exempt employee for example a person who is paid a wage of $ 20 per hour will receive gross pay of $ 800 $ 20 hr x 40 hours if he works a standard 40 hour week but will only receive gross pay of $ 400 $ 20 hr x 20 hours if he works 20 hours in a week for example if a person has a $ 52000 salary and he is paid once a week then the gross amount of each of the 52 paychecks he receives during the year is $ 1000 $ 52000 52 weeks the person receiving a salary is not paid a smaller amount for working fewer hours nor is he paid more for working overtime
