And to remove: 1  Gently file the surface of the GEL TOP COAT to break the seal and remove shine. 2  Saturate a cotton wool or cosmetic pad with ACETONE and apply to the top of the nail surface. 3  Wrap snugly in foil (I use cut tin foil) and allow to sit for 10 MINUTES.
Removing the Nails: This method is simple and easy for DIY gel nails you did at home or for your salon manicure. 1  Start by gently buffing or filing the top coat of your nails to break the seal of the gel polish. 2  Make sure to only file the top of the nail. 3  Filing too deep will rough up the nailbed.
