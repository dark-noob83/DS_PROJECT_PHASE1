Calculations for a rectangular prism: 1. Given the length, width and height find the volume, surface area and diagonal of a rectangular prism. 1  h, l and w are known; find V, S and d. 2  V = lwh. 3  S = 2(lw + lh + wh). 4  d = √(l 2 + w 2 + h 2). 3. Given the volume, length and width find the height, surface area, and diagonal of a rectangular prism. 1  V, l and w are known; find h, S and d. 2  h = V / lw. 3  S = 2(lw + lh + wh).
Again, the basic formula is V = Ah, or volume equals the area of the base times the height. However, the formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1/2 ab, where a is the distance from 1 of the triangle's vertices to its opposite side, and b is the length of that side (its base). By substituting this into the equation for A, the formula for the volume of a triangular prism is V = 1/2 abh. 1  You may be more familiar with the triangle area formula as A = 1/2 bh, where b is the base of the triangle, and h refers to its height. 5. Divide the volume by the product of the length and width (area) of the base. This is 64 divided by 16, or 4 units. (Height is also a distance measure.). 1  The volume could also have been divided by first the length (64 divided by 8, making 8) and then by the width (8 divided by 2), again making 4 units.
2. Given the surface area, length and width find the height, volume and diagonal of a rectangular prism. 1  S, l and w are known; find h, V and d. 2  h = (S - 2lw) / (2l + 2w). 3  V = lwh. 4  d = √(l 2 + w 2 + h 2). 3. Given the volume, length and width find the height, surface area, and diagonal of a rectangular prism. 1  V, l and w are known; find h, S and d. 2  h = V / lw. 3  S = 2(lw + lh + wh).
H = Volume/Area of base. Where, Area of base = length of base x width of base. For example: Find the height of a rectangular prism with volume = 70 cm and length and width of base equal to 7 and 5 cm respectively. Solution: Volume of prism = 70 cm. Area of base = length of base x width of base. 
In this case, our rectangle has a width and it has a length, like so -- and we have three. Simplify that up a little bit and we end up with base times height plus three rectanlges. And that is how you find the volume and surface area of an isoceles triangular prism. Thanks for watching! In this case, the area of the base is going to be a triangle, and the formula for the area of a triangle is one half base times height. In this case, the base is going to be the distance from here to here -- we will call that the width -- and the height will be the distance from here to here.
Surface Area. Rectangular Prism The surface area S.A. of a rectangular prism with base l, width w, and height h is the sum of the areas of its faces. S.A. = 2lh + 2lw + 2hw Practice Problem 1 Find the surface area of the rectangular prism shown to the right
