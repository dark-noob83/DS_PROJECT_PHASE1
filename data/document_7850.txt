Cyclins are a family of proteins that control the progression of cells through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) enzymes.
Cyclins go hand in hand with kinases. Cyclins do not cause a cell to progress in the cell cycle because cyclins are mere proteins that regulate the rate of the process, and h â€¦ ow fast the cell progresses through this process. Cyclins also act by binding to various kinases, which are enzymes that transfer a phosphate group from ATP to other enzymes.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of protein kinases first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle.

Cyclins do not cause a cell to progress in the cell cycle because cyclins are mere proteins that regulate the rate of the process, and how fast the cell progresses through this process. Cyclins also act by binding to various kinases, which are enzymes that transfer a phosphate group from ATP to other enzymes. The phosphate group activates these enzymes. The quantity of these kinases in the cell remains steady throughout the cell cycle; however they are active only when bound to cyclins.
Best Answer: CDKs (cyclin dependent kinases) are, as the name implies, kinases (enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins) that are dependent of a family of proetins called kinases. Cdks do not have any phosphorylation enzymatic activity unless they are bound to cyclins.
