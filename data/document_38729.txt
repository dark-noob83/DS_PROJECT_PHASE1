back to Blog. There seems to be some confusion in the press over how many votes will be needed to override President Bush's veto of the SCHIP bill. It's pretty much basic arithmetic. There are 435 members in the House. You need a 2/3rds majority of all voting members to overide a veto. So at most, 290 members will have to vote to override. That's all we know for sure. 265 members voted for the SCHIP bill the President vetoed. 
To override a presidential veto, a supermajority vote of two-thirds  of the voting members of each house, the House of  Representatives and the Senate, is required. There ar … e 435 voting  representatives in the House. If all these representatives voted,  it would take 2/3rds of 435 = 290 votes to override a veto. In the  Senate, it also takes a 2/3rds of 100 members = 67 votes to  override a veto. (But if only 90 actually voted, then it would take  only 2/3 of 90 = 60 votes to override).

In other words, the votes within the House of Representatives in excess of 2/3 cannot be tacked onto the vote from the Senate in order to override a Presidential veto. If only 98 Senators were seated, then 2/3 would be 65.2.
Action by both the House and the Senate is required to override a presidential veto. A two-thirds, supermajority vote of the Members present is required to override a presidential veto. If one house fails to override a veto, the other house does not attempt to override, even if the votes are present to succeed. The House and Senate may attempt to override a veto anytime during the Congress in which the veto is issued. Should both houses of Congress successfully vote to override a presidential veto, the bill becomes law. According the the Congressional Research service, from 1789 through 2004, only 106 of 1,484 regular presidential vetoes were overridden by Congress

Last week, the House approved construction of the Keystone XL pipeline in a vote of 266 to 153. The legislation now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to pass, but the White House has warned that President Obama would veto the bill. The Senate needs 67 votes to override a presidential veto. &nbsp. The Senate has 63 of the 67 votes needed to override a presidential veto on the Keystone XL pipeline, Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) said Sunday. “Right now we’ve got about 63, but we’re going to the floor with an open amendment process,” Hoeven said on Fox News Sunday.
It can let the legislation drop, which is what usually happens. Or, the Congress can attempt to override the veto. To override a presidential veto, both houses of congress must pass a bill by a two-thirds majority. This is called a super-majority. In the Senate, this means a bill must have 67 (out of 100) votes.
