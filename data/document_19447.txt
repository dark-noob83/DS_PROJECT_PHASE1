The Periodic Table of Elements--The location of the metalloids: Below is some basic information on the metalloids. We have their symbol, atomic number, atmoic mass, a few properties, and a few uses for metalloids. Physical Properties of Metalloids. What makes elements metalloids is some of them share properties of metals, while at the same time they share properties of non-metals. The metalloids are Boron, Silicon, Germanium, Polonium, Tellurium, Astatine, Arsenic, and Antimony. These elements all rest next to the staircase (imaginary line on the table from boron diagonally going down to astatine) whether above or below.
Metalloids are the elements found along the stair-step line that distinguishes metals from non-metals. This line is drawn from between Boron and Aluminum to the border between Polonium and Astatine. The only exception to this is Aluminum, which is classified under Other Metals. Metalloids have properties of both metals and non-metals. Some of the metalloids, such as silicon and germanium, are semi-conductor
The metalloids or semimetals are a group of elements that contain properties of both metals and nonmetals. The highlighted elements are the metalloids. Metalloids, also known as semimetals are elements containing properties similar and midway between metals and nonmetals. They are found to divide the periodic table between the metals on the left and the nonmetals on the right. Metalloids often have the following properties: 1  could be dull or shiny. 2  conducts heat and electricity, but not as well as metals. Leave a reply. The metalloids or semimetals are a group of elements that contain properties of both metals and nonmetals. The highlighted elements are the metalloids.Metalloids, also known as semimetals are elements containing properties similar and midway between metals and nonmetals.
The metalloids of symbols are(also known as Semimetal): B: (Boron) SI: (Silicon) GE: (Germanium) AS: (Arsenic) SB: (Antimony) TE: (Tellurium) PO:(Polonium) AT: (Astatine) Acco … rding to the science of periodic table.

Metalloid elements are called so because they share properties of both metals and nonmetals. Boron, Silicon, Germanium, Arsenic, Antimony, Tellurium, and Polonium make up most … of the metalloids. The six metalloids treated here are listed below, with the atomic number and chemical symbol of each.05. boron (B)14. Silicon (Si)32. Germanium (Ge)33. Arsenic (As)51. Antimony (Sb)52.
Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or more from selenium, polonium, or astatine sometimes are added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. Elements less commonly recognised as metalloids include carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine. On a standard periodic table all of these elements may be found in a diagonal region of the p-block, extending from boron at one end, to astatine at the other.
A metalloid is a chemical element with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals. There is no standard definition of a metalloid, nor is there complete agreement as to which elements are appropriately classified as such. Elements less commonly recognised as metalloids include carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine. On a standard periodic table all of these elements may be found in a diagonal region of the p-block, extending from boron at one end, to astatine at the other.
Between the metals and nonmetals is a group of elements known as either the semimetals or the metalloids. Here is a look at the location of these elements and their common properties. Location on the Periodic Table. The metalloids or semimetals are located along the line between the metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. The metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Polonium is often considered a metalloid, too. Properties of the Semimetals or Metalloids. The electronegativities and ionization energies of the metalloids are between those of the metals and nonmetals, so the metalloids exhibit characteristics of both classes.
The metalloids can be defined as those elements which exhibit characteristics of both metals and nonmetals. They are all solids, but not lustrous, and conduct heat and electri … city moderately well.
