Southwest is a little unusual in that it calculates salary based on a flight's distance and time. After their first year, Southwest's flight attendants are guaranteed at least 80 flight segments per month, which are based on $22.36 for each trip up to 243 miles and 55 minutes or less. Whenever airlines advertise openings for flight attendants, the applications gush in. Southwest Airlines recently received 10,000 applications for 750 attendant positions—in about two hours. A year ago, 114,000 people sought 2,500 flight attendant spots at the airline, known for its laid-back work environment.
On average flight attendants make $35,000-$40,000 a year. What most people don’t realize is newly hired flight attendants in the U.S. start out only making between $14,000 – $18,000 a year. In 1995 I made $18,000 a year working for a major U.S. carrier. Nowadays most newly hired flight attendants make even less than that. This is because right after 9/11 the majority of flight attendants took huge pay cuts in order to help keep the airlines up and running.
Check-in/Check-Out. A major irritant for most flight attendants are check-in/check-out times. Although the airline will expect you to be on-duty (on the aircraft) and ready for the safety and service briefing one hour prior to flight departure, you will only be paid 15 minutes pre-flight and 15 minutes post-flight.
Based on the factors above, the salary for a newly hired flight attendant in the U.S. is $24,000 – $38,000 on an annual basis, depending on the number of flight hours they are given. The average salaries end up leveling off around $45,000 – $60,000 per year. 
Flight Attendant income varies from airline to airline. The pay ranges from about $13.00-$50.00 per flight hour or more. Most airlines have in place a monthly guarantee which ranges between 65-80 flight hours. The Flight Attendant is paid the guarantee whether he/she actually works those hours or not.

In a typical month, a Flight Attendant will usually work between 75 and 85 hours up to a maximum of approximately 100 hours. Factors such as weather, employees calling in sick or employees going over their maximum monthly limitation are among some of the reasons why airlines need Flight Attendants to cover extra shifts.
