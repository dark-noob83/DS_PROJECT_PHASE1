The application of PEMS for PM measurements is not straightforward:  Strong effect on the volatile fraction of PM  The gravimetric determination of PM also implies the lack of real time information that is a prerequisite for PEMS measurements irrespective  Several systems were evaluated in JRC. Most promising: 1.
1 Installation of a PEMS requires the installation of a single computer with the DAS/PEMS software installed and interfaced to the boiler control system. 2  Typically a one day installation and start up process. 3  3. PEMS have lower startup costs, normally one day including DAS. 4  4. PEMS require less on site training.
1 A PEMS can be configured, delivered and installed in 30-45 days. 2  Installation of a PEMS requires the installation of a single computer with the DAS/PEMS software installed and interfaced to the boiler control system. 3  Typically a one day installation and start up process.
