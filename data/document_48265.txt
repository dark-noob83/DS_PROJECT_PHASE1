Hi Jaander, Snipping Tool can be used only as a screen shot, or snip, of any object you see on your screen. So, snipping tool cannot scroll. You might have to scroll down the screen and then use the tool. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Snipping-Tool-frequently-asked-questions. Bindu S-Microsoft Support.

Sometimes you need to capture a scrolling screen. For this purpose you may use Snipping Tool Scroll Capture or any other screen capture tool like SnapIt.
On the “Apps” screen, scroll to find the “Snipping Tool” in the “Windows Accessories” section and click on it. NOTE: You can also open the “Snipping Tool” by starting to type “snipping tool” on the Start screen to activate the “Search” box. When the “Snipping Tool” displays in the results, click on it to open it. You are returned to the Desktop and the small “Snipping Tool” dialog box displays.
The snipping tool is a very nice feature, but only as long as you can get all of the area that you wish to snip on the screen at one time. I am not aware of any way to make it scroll down a page of text which is longer than the screen.
Capture a portion of your screen so you can save, annotate, or share the image is the tag line of the Snipping Tool, a new feature for some versions of Windows 7 and Windows Vista an to capture a screenshot of any object on your screen and save, annotate or share the image.
