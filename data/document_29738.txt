Place uncovered in the oven for 18 to 20 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F on a meat thermometer. When done, let the ham rest for a few minutes before slicing. 1 cup salt. 1/4 cup black pepper. 
1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. 2  To heat the ham, place it on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and bake uncovered. 3  For a whole ham, allow 15 to 18 minutes to the pound; for a half, 18 to 24 minutes per pound. 4  The ham will be ready when the internal temperature reaches 140°F. 1 For a whole 10- to 15-pound ham, allow 18 to 20 minutes per pound; for a half--5 to 7 pounds--about 20 minutes per pound; or for a shank or butt portion weighing 3 to 4 pounds, about 35 minutes to the pound. 2  In all cases, cook uncovered until the internal temperature reaches 160°F.
The best way to do this is to place the ham on a rack in a roasting pan. Add water to the bottom of the pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil (cover the pan with the ham). Cook approximately 12 to 15 minutes per pound for a whole or boneless ham and approximately 18 to 20 minutes per pound for a half ham. Timetable For Cooking Ham: Set oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Both cook-before-eating cured and fresh hams should be cooked to 160 degrees F. Reheat fully-cooked ham to 140 degrees F. Use a Cooking or Meat Thermometer for the perfect ham for your Christmas dinner.
Step 2: Baking the ham. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert an oven-safe thermometer into the center of the ham (it should not touch the bone of a bone-in ham). Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until ham registers desired temperature (140°F for cooked ham). 
1 Place the ham, skin side up, in a large roaster. 2  Add 5 cups of water. 3  Place the cover on the roaster or if it does not have a cover, use foil to cover tightly. 4  Place in an oven preheated to 375°F. Turn oven up to 500°F and leave for 10 minutes only. 1 Bake until internal temperature reaches 155°F. 2  Allow ham to rest for 15 minutes before carving. 3  Internal temperature should rise to 160°F during this time. 4  If using a glaze, the glaze should be applied during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. 2  For a whole 10- to 15-pound ham, allow 18 to 20 minutes per pound; for a half--5 to 7 pounds--about 20 minutes per pound; or for a shank or butt portion weighing 3 to 4 pounds, about 35 minutes to the pound. 1 For a whole 10- to 15-pound ham, allow 18 to 20 minutes per pound; for a half--5 to 7 pounds--about 20 minutes per pound; or for a shank or butt portion weighing 3 to 4 pounds, about 35 minutes to the pound. 2  In all cases, cook uncovered until the internal temperature reaches 160°F.
Step 3: Baking the ham. Place the ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert an oven-safe thermometer into the center of the ham (it should not touch bone). Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until the ham registers the desired temperature (140 to 150 degrees F). Because cooking times vary based on the size and type of ham, use the timings below as a guide.
1 Place the ham in an oven preheated to 325°F for 20 to 25 minutes per pound or until internal temperature reaches 155°F on a meat thermometer. 2  Be sure the cooking bag is not touching the sides or top of the oven, otherwise the bag might melt. 3  Remove the ham from the oven and discard the bag and drippings. 1 Bake until internal temperature reaches 155°F. 2  Allow ham to rest for 15 minutes before carving. 3  Internal temperature should rise to 160°F during this time. 4  If using a glaze, the glaze should be applied during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
Try to work the glaze into the scored lines. 5 Place ham in oven. Cook for about 1 1/2 hours (check after 1 hour, will take longer if the ham is not at room temp to begin with), or about 10 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature of the ham is 110°-120° (use a meat thermometer).
1 Place ham, fat side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. 2  Bake, uncovered, 11/2 hours, basting with sauce or glaze, as desired. 3  Insert meat thermometer into thickest part of ham, not touching bone. 4  Bake 1 to 2 hours more until meat thermometer registers 140 ° F, basting with sauce two more times. 1 Bake, uncovered, 11/2 hours, basting with sauce or glaze, as desired. 2  Insert meat thermometer into thickest part of ham, not touching bone. 3  Bake 1 to 2 hours more until meat thermometer registers 140 ° F, basting with sauce two more times. 4  Total cooking time for ham should be 18 to 24 minutes per pound.
