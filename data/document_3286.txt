But instead of reflecting an image, it reflects microwaves. If you were to put food in a heavy metal pan and put it in the microwave, it wouldn't cook. The pan would shield the food from the microwaves, so the food would never heat up. Other metals are a no-no in the microwave, too. Tim Flach/Riser/ Getty Images. Tiny sharp pieces and thin pieces of metal are a different story.
1 If the microwave oven has metal shelves OR a metal turntable, don't microwave food in foil containers or metal pans, and don't let foil used for shielding touch or be close to the shelves or turntable.
Though a small amount of aluminum foil might not cause problems with your microwave, it's wise to err on the side of caution and never nuke metal. When food is microwaved, electromagnetic radiation is created in the form of microwaves, which are absorbed by water inside the food.
Finally, never put metal such as aluminum foil into a microwave oven. Besides preventing the microwaves from reaching and heating up the food it conceals, aluminum foil tends to give off sparks that might start a fire. Here's why. As its name implies, a microwave oven uses intense microwaves to heat and cook food.
It can be safe to use small amounts of aluminum foil in a microwave oven. Microwaves cannot pass through metal but are absorbed by food. No food completely covered by aluminum foil or in a covered metal pan should be put in a microwave oven because food wouldn't be available to absorb the microwaves.
