In a bowl whisk together lour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper. In a heavy skillet heat 1/2 inch oil to 365Â°F. in a deep-fat thermometer. Dredge pork in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Fry pork loins in oil, 1 at a time, turning, until golden brown, about 3 minutes, and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Serve pork loins on a hamburger buns with lettuce, tomato, mustard, and pickles.
Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the pork until it reaches an internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees F, about 30 minutes.
