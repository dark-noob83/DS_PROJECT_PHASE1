People who are infected with CMV sometimes shed the virus in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. The shedding of virus may take place intermittently, without any detectable signs, and without causing symptoms.
Most people who have been infected with CMV never show symptoms. In some people, the virus causes mild symptoms that mimic the flu or infectious mononucleosis, such as fever, chills, body aches, headache, swollen lymph nodes * , sore throat, and fatigue.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) belongs to the herpes virus family. Infection with CMV is very common. Between 50% and 80% of people in the United States have had a CMV infection by the time they are 40 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Cytomegalovirus, also known as HCMV, CMV or Human Herpes virus 5 (HHV-5) is part of the herpes family of viruses. It is a common virus and spreads through bodily fluids, including saliva, blood, breast milk, semen and urine.
CMV infection can bring about flulike symptoms when a person is first infected, but many people have no symptoms at all. The virus usually becomes dormant after it enters the body, meaning that it remains hidden and does not cause symptoms of illness.
However, if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system, CMV is cause for concern. Once infected with CMV, your body retains the virus for life. However, CMV usually remains dormant if you're healthy. CMV spreads from person to person through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. CMV spread through breast milk usually doesn't make the baby sick.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the herpes virus group, which includes the viruses that causes chicken pox, mononucleosis (mono) and herpes simplexes 1 and 2. The viruses all share the ability to remain dormant in the body for a long time. There is currently no cure for CMV.
