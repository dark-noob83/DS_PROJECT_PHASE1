Primers: Syntheic nucleotide strands inserted for pairing with parent template of DNA; usually it is installed at the opposite ends of the strand, and zipped back together by dna polymerase. The primary use for primers is building recombintant dna.
primer. A primer is a short nucleic acid sequence that provides a starting point for DNA synthesis. In living organisms, primers are short strands of RNA. A primer must be synthesized by an enzyme called primase, which is a type of RNA polymerase, before DNA replication can occur.
The primer therefore serves to prime and lay a foundation for DNA synthesis. The primers are removed before DNA replication is complete, and the gaps in the sequence are filled in with DNA by DNA polymerases.
primer. [prī′mər]. 1 a short piece of DNA or RNA complementary to a given DNA sequence that acts as a point at which replication can proceed, as in a polymerase chain reaction. 2 a molecule, such as a small polymer, that induces the synthesis of a larger molecule.
Primase is an enzyme that synthesizes short RNA sequences called primers. These primers serve as a starting point for DNA synthesis. Since primase produces RNA molecules, the enzyme is a type of RNA polymerase. Primase functions by synthesizing short RNA sequences that are complementary to a single-stranded piece of DNA, which serves as its template.
A primer is a short nucleic acid sequence that provides a starting point for DNA synthesis. In living organisms, primers are short strands of RNA. A primer must be synthesized by an enzyme called primase, which is a type of RNA polymerase, before DNA replication can occur.
The polymerase starts replication at the 3'-end of the primer, and copies the opposite strand. In most cases of natural DNA replication, the primer for DNA synthesis and replication is a short strand of RNA (which can be made de novo).
