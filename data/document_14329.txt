Genetics. 1  Achondroplasia is a single gene disorder caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene on chromosome 4. 2  Two different mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause more than 99 per cent of cases of achondroplasia. 3  It is a dominant genetic disease so only one copy of the FGFR3 gene needs to be mutated for symptoms to develop. 1 Two different mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause more than 99 per cent of cases of achondroplasia. 2  It is a dominant genetic disease so only one copy of the FGFR3 gene needs to be mutated for symptoms to develop. 3  Achondroplasia can be inherited from a parent with the disease.
Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder affecting bone development that results in short-limb dwarfism. 1  Achondroplasia is the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, a disorder in which bone tissue does not develop properly, especially the long bones of the arms and legs. 1 Two different mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause more than 99 per cent of cases of achondroplasia. 2  It is a dominant genetic disease so only one copy of the FGFR3 gene needs to be mutated for symptoms to develop. 3  Achondroplasia can be inherited from a parent with the disease.
Causes. Most dwarfism-related conditions are genetic disorders, but the causes of some disorders are unknown. Most occurrences of dwarfism result from a random genetic mutation in either the father's sperm or the mother's egg rather than from either parent's complete genetic makeup
There are many causes of dwarfism. In fact, more than 200 conditions are known to cause short stature. However, one medical condition, achondroplasia, accounts for the majority of the cases of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is the most common type of short-limbed dwarfism. Typical features of people with achondroplasia includes: average-size trunk, short arms and legs with particularly short upper arms and thighs, limited range of motion at the elbows, and an enlarged head (macrocephaly).
Dwarfism Causes. Dwarfism can be caused by any of more than 200 conditions. Causes of proportionate dwarfism include metabolic and hormonal disorders such as growth hormone deficiency. The most common types of dwarfism, known as skeletal dysplasias, are genetic. Skeletal dysplasias are conditions of abnormal bone growth that cause disproportionate dwarfism. They include: Achondroplasia. The most common form of dwarfism, achondroplasia occurs in about one out of 26,000 to 40,000 babies and is evident at birth. People with achondroplasia have a relatively long trunk and shortened upper parts of their arms and legs.
Achondroplasia is a bone growth disorder that causes disproportionate dwarfism. Dwarfism is defined as a condition of short stature as an adult. People with achondroplasia are short in stature with a normal sized torso and short limbs. It is the most common type of disproportionate dwarfism. Normally, most cartilage converts to bone. However, in people with dwarfism, a lot of the cartilage does not convert. This is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. The FGFR3 gene instructs the body to make a protein necessary for bone growth and maintenance.

In most cases, this common type of short-limbed dwarfism is related to a genetic mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene. There are two possible causes of achondroplasia. One possible cause is a genetic mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene located on chromosome 4. The other possible cause is that the condition can be inherited from a parent with achondroplasia
