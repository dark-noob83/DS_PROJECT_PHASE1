DNA replication is one of the most basic processes that occurs within a cell. Each time a cell divides, the two resulting daughter cells must contain exactly the same genetic information, or DNA, as the parent cell. To accomplish this, each strand of existing DNA acts as a template for replication.
Cytokinesis is the process where one cell splits off from its sister cell. It usually occurs after cell division. The Cell Cycle is the sequence of growth, DNA replication, growth and cell division that all cells go through. Beginning after cytokinesis, the daughter cells are quite small and low on ATP.
DNA replication occurs during the synthesis (S phase) phase of interphase in the cell cycle. DNA replication begins in areas of DNA molecules called origins of replication.
5. Cancel. DNA replication occurs in the nucleus of almost every cell in the body, and replication takes place when hair or nails grow. Learn about DNA replication, which creates two identical cells, with information from a biology teacher in this free video on science. Part of the Video Series: DNA Structure & Testing.
DNA replication occurs in the synthesis or S phase of the Cell Cycle. Every chromosome is copied with high fidelity in a process that involves a large number of enzymes.
DNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and in the nucleus of eukaryotes. Regardless of where DNA replication occurs, the basic process is the same. The structure of DNA lends itself easily to DNA replication.
