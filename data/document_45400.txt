During the period of low profitability (1998-2002), operations with between 500 and 1,500 acres earned an average net farm income of $67 to $68 per acre, or more than $10 per acre more than farms with less than 500 acres.
Farms between 1000 and 4000 acres have non-land costs between $186 per acre and $200 per acre (see Table 1). These farms have roughly 70% of their acres cash rented, with average cash rents ranging from $206 per acre up to $242 per acre.
Net farm income averaged $65 per acre across all grain farms in the sample, with corn prices averaging just under $2/bu and soybean prices averaging just under $5/bu. This second time period is one of moderate farm profits with an average net farm income of $95/acre from 2002 to 2004.
Note that farms in the over 4000 acre category have higher costs than farms in smaller size categories. The over 4000 acre farms have average costs of $525 per acre compared to smaller size categories (see Table 1). Much of the difference can be explained by higher percent of acres in corn.
You can always use more than the minimum. = (animals 11) x (average animal weight 1200 lb) x (.04) x (grazing days 365) (average yield per acre 9,500 lb) Acres of Pasture Needed (11) x (1200 lb) x (.04) x (365) = 192,720 20 acres (9,500 lb/ac) 9,500 = Letâ€™s start with how many animals should be on our example farm. This is the maximum number of animals.
The average cost per acre of land can vary across the United States, but does have a general range. According to the Lincoln Institute and the Federal Housing Authority figures, an acre of land in 2010 sold for an average of $1,000.
Larger farms, operating more than 1,500 acres, also had higher average net farm income than smaller farms but the difference was only $4 per acre. During the period of moderate profitability (2002-2004), operations with up to 1,500 acres reported similar net farm income numbers averaging $96 to $97 per acre.
