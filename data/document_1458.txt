I pay my cat sitter who is an adult and works for our vet $20 per visit...but we live in Manhattan where prices for everything are thru the roof. I think 1/2 that amount would be appropriate. Taking care of a cat would have been a piece of cake. I pay my professional cat sitter $18 per day. I would pay a neighbor kid $50 for a week if the visit is as short as you say. I would also have him/her stop by everyday, not every other.
I pay my pet-sitter $30 for two visits to my dog per day, and no overnight stay. Considering there were multiple animals in the household, and she stayed overnight, $50 seems more fair. Certainly, not an overpay to the pet-sitter. I never nailed down how much she expected to be paid. I asked my gf and she said $350. Thinking about it, that would be $50 a day. Sounded good, so I gave the house-sitter a thank you card with $350 in it.
In defense of 14 year olds, I was babysitting newborns to 5 year olds at that age, with no supervision. Taking care of a cat would have been a piece of cake. I pay my professional cat sitter $18 per day. I would pay a neighbor kid $50 for a week if the visit is as short as you say. I would also have him/her stop by everyday, not every other. Things can go downhill quickly
Cat sitters’ fees vary from region to region and are based on fees for nearby animal boarding. Fees are also based on which service package you choose. All cat sitters should check on the animals daily, provide fresh water and food, empty the cat litter box if necessary and spend time with the animal.

Report Abuse. Professional cat sitters who do this generally get $25-35 a VISIT and add $10 for each cat beyond one. Some will make return visits (2x a day for free, some charge $15, others the full amount again). I'd say at least $10-15 a day and take her out to or make a nice dinner for her...and maybe a cake to take home with her.
