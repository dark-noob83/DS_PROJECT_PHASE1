ClearCase is Rational's market-leading solution for software configuration management system. ClearCase is a powerful system for managing versions of files and directories, generally refers to as elements. Virtually any project artifact can be stored in ClearCase repository called Versioned Object Base or simply VOB. ClearCase tightly integrates with the underlying operating system to track changes and control access. The ClearCase administrator is the most powerful user having full control of a site installation. On Unix, this would be the superuser, UID=0, on the VOB server.
What is ClearCase VOB; - Websphere. This is a discussion on What is ClearCase VOB; - Websphere; I want to create a WebSphere Studio project under Rational ClearCase control. The help reads: ...The project must be located in a folder beneath a ClearCase VOB for which you have created a view. Do not place the project directly ... + Reply to Thread.
Rational ClearCase is a family of computer software tools that supports software configuration management (SCM) of source code and other software development assets. It includes revision control. Under base ClearCase, each view is controlled by its associated configuration specification, commonly referred to as a config spec. This is a collection of rules (stored internally in a text file, but compiled before use) that specifies what element versions (files or directories) are to be displayed in a view.
Unified Change Management (UCM) is the object-oriented realization of ClearCase, a set of software tools typically supporting the process area software configuration management. UCM is activity based. 
Section 3: My first VOB and view. ClearCase stores project artifacts in a VOB. A VOB is a repository for storing versioned project artifacts and metadata. Project artifacts are source, binary, or other contents that is checked into ClearCase. ClearCase tightly integrates with the underlying operating system to track changes and control access. The ClearCase administrator is the most powerful user having full control of a site installation. On Unix, this would be the superuser, UID=0, on the VOB server.
vs. BlueTalon. A Versioned Object Base (VOB) is a centralized database that stores version information about the files and folders in a software configuration management (SCM) system. The term is usually associated with ClearCase, a distributed program developed by Rational Software that is used in a client/server environment. 
246 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM Gateway shipping server The most secure implementation for using the shipping server through the firewall is to install a shipping-server-only configuration on a UNIX client. 268 Software Configuration Management with IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest UCM If you can guarantee that a single site has the most current information in the family, restricting the restore to the single site is a good way to streamline the restore process.
ClearCase supports two configuration management models: UCM (Unified Change Management) and base ClearCase. UCM provides an out-of-the-box model while base ClearCase provides a basic infrastructure (UCM is built on base ClearCase). Both can be configured to support a wide variety of needs. Under base ClearCase, each view is controlled by its associated configuration specification, commonly referred to as a config spec. This is a collection of rules (stored internally in a text file, but compiled before use) that specifies what element versions (files or directories) are to be displayed in a view.
Nortel Networks hired me from August 1999 to October 2001 to do a bunch of configuration management for them and the tool they were us-ing was ClearCase, so I got a certain amount of exposure to ClearCase.
