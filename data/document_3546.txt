Tooth decay is a process by which the tooth breaks down. There are a number of reasons for tooth decay including a poor diet high in sugars and acid, inadequate personal oral hygiene, genetics, and other factors.
Tooth decay is a process created by the bacteria that live in our mouths. The bacteria use the food that passes through our mouths to create a sticky substance called plaque. The plaque, which is full of bacteria, releases acid onto the teeth. The acid then starts to break down the outer layer of the tooth, the enamel.
Tooth decay is the destruction of the outer surface, or enamel, of a tooth. It is caused by acid buildup from plaque bacteria, which dissolves the minerals in the enamel and creates cavities.
Dental caries or cavities, more commonly known as tooth decay, are caused by a breakdown of the tooth enamel. This breakdown is the result of bacteria on teeth that breakdown foods and produce acid that destroys tooth enamel and results in tooth decay.
Decay. Tooth decay is the destruction of your tooth enamel, the hard, outer layer of your teeth. It can be a problem for children, teens and adults. Plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, constantly forms on your teeth. When you eat or drink foods containing sugars, the bacteria in plaque produce acids that attack tooth enamel.
Definition. Tooth decay, which is also called dental cavities or dental caries, is the destruction of the outer surface (enamel) of a tooth. Decay results from the action of bacteria that live in plaque, which is a sticky, whitish film formed by a protein in saliva (mucin) and sugary substances in the mouth.
Tooth decay is also called dental caries. Itâ€™s a disease that causes damage to tooth structure. If bits of food are left on the teeth after a drink or meal, the germs in your mouth (called plaque) can turn those tiny bits of food into acid.
