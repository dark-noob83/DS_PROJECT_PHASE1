0 R 1 [DETR 1983] STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS 2000 No. 2531BUILDING AND BUILDINGS ENGLAND ANDWALES The Building Regulations 2000 Made----13th September 2000Laid before Parliament 22nd September 2000Coming into force 1st January 2001 ARRANGEMENT OF REGULATIONS PART I General 1. Citation and commencement.2. Interpretation.
The Regulations also apply where certain changes of use to a building occur, however there are certain minor building works that do not require approval. The Regulations are arranged in a series of Approved Documents that provide guidance as to how you can comply with the various regulations.
I read on another thread that the building regs change stated that the last 1m of pipework into the boiler could be 15mm. I assume this was so the boiler manufacturers could sell off existing stock with 15mm connectors, now they've all gone and are all 22mm connectors.
I'm in the process of obtaining quotes for a replacement combi boiler. The house is 13 years old (built 1999) and has 4 bedrooms. We currently have an Ideal SE Combi with 15mm gas inlet pipework that disappears into the wall directly behind the boiler.
From 1st April 2005 it is a requirement of the Building Regulations Part L1 (Conservation of Fuel and Power) that any replacement or new gas fired boiler be of the condensing type.

The Regulations revoke the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1994, the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) (Amendment) Regulations 1996 and the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1996; the Regulations make minor amendments to Schedule 2B of the Gas Act 1986 (regulation 41) .
Legislation Regulations etc. 1.1 The main regulations are made under the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974. The current regulations are the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 (referred to as the Gas Safety Regulations) which came into force on the 31st October 1998.
Scotland was the first country in the United Kingdom to adopt national regulations. The Building (Scotland) Act in 1959 created the power to do so. The first set of Building Regulations was published in 1963 and came into force in 1964. England and Wales followed suit. The Public Health Act of 1961 was the statutory instrument and the first regulations were published in 1965.
