From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a rare, potentially life-threatening gastro-vascular disorder characterized by a compression of the third and final portion of the duodenum by the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.
Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome (also known as Wilkie syndrome) is a rare acquired vascular compression disorder in which acute angulation of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) results in compression of the third part of the duodenum leading to obstruction.
Background. Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is an uncommon but well recognized clinical entity characterized by compression of the third, or transverse, portion of the duodenum between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. This results in chronic, intermittent, or acute complete or partial duodenal obstruction.
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) is a digestive condition that occurs when the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) is compressed between two arteries (the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery). This compression causes partial or complete blockage of the duodenum.
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome: A rare condition where the third portion of the duodenum is compressed between two large blood vessels-the aorta and superior mesenteric artery.
