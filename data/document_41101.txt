The least expensive states for preschool-age care in a childcare center, with costs ranging from less than $4,000 a year ($333 a month) to around $7,000 a year are Mississippi, Kentucky, Louisiana, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Idaho, West Virginia, South Carolina, and Alabama. Nanny care costs significantly less in, say, St. Louis than in Manhattan simply because the cost of living is lower there and so are wages. And daycare – whether in a center or in someone's home – could cost double or triple per month in a relatively expensive city compared to a cheaper area.

Last year, average center-based child care costs rose by nearly 3% nationwide, according to a report from the nonprofit Child Care Aware of America. Full-time care for an infant ranged from a high of $16,430 a year in Massachusetts to $4,863 in Mississippi. In Colorado, care was $12,736 for an infant. In Oregon, the average care for an infant represented more than 18% of the median income for a married couple last year. NEW YORK — Child care costs continue to soar, with prices so high in some parts of the country that they exceed tuition at state colleges.
Daycare costs vary greatly by state. Last year, the average annual cost for a 4-year-old was $4,312 in Mississippi and $12,355 in New York, according to the Child Care Aware report. 
To put things in perspective, the study compared the annual child care costs for a 4-year-old to the annual average cost of in-state tuition at four-year public colleges. Child care is more expensive in 24 states and the nation's capital. Infant care is even worse – higher than tuition in 33 states and Washington. There is also great variation among states, with the monthly care costs for a 4-year-old ranging from $344 in rural South Carolina to $1,472 in the District of Columbia.
In San Francisco the average monthly rent is $1,956 for two adults and two children, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The average monthly cost of child care for two children in the city is $901. These children spend an average of 36 hours a week in child care, which can cost $500 a month for an infant. Obviously if you have an infant, child care costs will be different for that of a five year old, which is mostly after-school care, Gould said.
