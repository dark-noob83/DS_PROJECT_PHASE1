To my (midwestern-US-reared) mind, 72 degrees F is indeed normal room temperature. My initial guess would be that it's because Imperial measurements are a base 10 / base 12 hybrid, and 72 is divisible by 12, making 72 a natural point of reference. The Wikipedia article on Fahrenheit is related and interesting. 
Average Room Temperature... Typically average room temperature is about 72 degrees Fahrenheit or roughly 21 degrees Celsius. It can also be 70 degrees Fahrenheit, too. The average room temperature is normally 36 Celsius
Room temperature is defined as the common range of 20 °C (68 °F) to 25 °C (77 °F). All the sources of heat and cool would average out in that area and that temperature would be the ambient temperature. Room temperature is comfortable to live in and is generally determined to be around 20 to 25 degrees Celsius (68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit).
Room Temperature. 28 pages on this wiki. Room Temperature (RT) is generally defined as the ambient air temperature in whatever environment being used for a given procedure. More specifically, it is defined as 20-25°C (68-77°F), as some ambient temperatures, by nature, do not fall within this range.
Mercury-in-glass thermometer for measurement of room temperature. Room temperature is a colloquial expression for the typical or preferred indoor (climate-controlled) temperature to which people are generally accustomed. Owing to variations in humidity and likely clothing, recommendations for summer and winter may vary; a suggested typical range for summer is 23 °C (73 °F) to 25.5 °C (78 °F), with that for winter being 20 °C (68 °F) to 23.5 °C (74 °F).
It represents the small range of temperatures at which the air feels neither hot nor cold, approximately 21 °C (70 °F). In scientific contexts, it may denote the range between 20 and 26 °C (68 and 79 °F), with an average of 23 °C (73 °F). Owing to variations in humidity and likely clothing, recommendations for summer and winter may vary; a suggested typical range for summer is 23 °C (73 °F) to 25.5 °C (78 °F), with that for winter being 20 °C (68 °F) to 23.5 °C (74 °F).
Also, your normal body temperature changes by as much as 1°F (0.6°C) throughout the day, depending on how active you are and the time of day. Body temperature is very sensitive to hormone levels and may be higher or lower when a woman is ovulating or having her menstrual period. Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C)
