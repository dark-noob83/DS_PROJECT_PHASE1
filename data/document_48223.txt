The average cost of one day of futile treatment in the ICU was $4,004 per patient. The cost of caring for the 123 patients whose treatment was perceived as being futile, both in and out of the ICU, was $2.6 million, the researchers found. 
Depending on the services the patient requires, and the length of stay, patients can expect to pay roughly $3000 to $5000 for a typical stay. If the stay is prolonged, and you require more care, expect to pay roughly $50,000 for one week of service. +. 1  Purchasing Guide. 
My limited memory tells me that costs for the first two days in the icu average about 10k per day. After that it starts to decease,such that in most cases the last day in the icu is about 2k or so. If you do a search on google scholar you should be able to find the paper. # 1 9. 
Daily cost of an intensive care unit day: the contribution of mechanical ventilation. Dasta JF(1), McLaughlin TP, Mody SH, Piech CT. Author information: (1)The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. Comment in Crit Care Med. 
The average cost for a day of futile treatment in the ICU was about $4,000, the researchers found. For the 123 patients perceived as receiving futile ICU care, total costs during the three months of the study amounted to $2.6 million for the five ICUs. 
-Mean hospital costs were $34,257 dollars (+/- $40,559 dollars) with lower average costs in rural and small hospitals. Discontinuing mechanical ventilation continues to be one of the most challenging events in ICU management, and a significant portion of time spent on the ventilator (40%) is dedicated to weaning.. -A total of 44.6% had at least one major co-morbid condition; the most common co-morbidities included diabetes (13.2 %) and pulmonary disease (13.2%). -Daily incremental cost of mechanical ventilation for ICU patients is estimated at between $600 and $1500 per day.
The average cost of private health care insurance depends on the country one is living in. In the US, the average cost paid by employees annually is about $4,130 and employers â€¦ pay about $11,000. These are rounded up amounts. 
Cost Savings. Between 2000 and 2005, annual critical care medicine costs increased from $56.6 to $81.7 billion, representing 13.4% of hospital costs, 4.1% of national health expenditures, and 0.66% of gross domestic product. All acute care hospitals have at least one ICU, and approximately 55,000 critically ill patients are cared or each day. In 2007, the number of adult critical care beds (medical, surgical, coronary care, neurological, and burn unit beds) totaled 67,357.
The average cost per day per patient in the ICU has been calculated to be about $2,401. There has been rising concern on the increasing health costs in the country. This is particularly seen in terminally ill patients, whose death seems imminent. These patients are often admitted into the ICU despite knowing about their terminal illness. In most US hospitals, the average cost per day in critical care unit is $2,000 to $ 3,000. Therefore, physicians can probably think of other palliative measures.
For instance, in a $2-trillion health care economy, the total economic costs of preterm birth has been estimated to be $26 billion (between 1 and 2 percent of total health care expenditures) [10]. Nonetheless, $26 billion is a substantial amount of money.
