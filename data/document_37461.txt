Trespassing/Parking. For the most part, spending an extended period of time in your car isn't a problem -- you can sleep in your parked car in your driveway if you'd like. Rather, it's the fact that your car is in one spot for at least as long as you're sleeping in it. Parking your car on someone's private property can get you arrested for trespassing, unless you have the owner's consent. And if you do, you might as well as to just crash on a couch.
Even in areas where sleeping in the car is legal, police have the right to search you and your vehicle if they believe you are exhibiting suspicious behavior. Police are on the lookout for drug dealers, drug users, and other felonious activity.

1. Vagrancy. In most cases where police don’t want you to sleep in your car it is because they are looking to clear the streets of vagrants. Many times, people who are homeless will find any shelter from the elements, and this includes abandoned or unlocked cars.
