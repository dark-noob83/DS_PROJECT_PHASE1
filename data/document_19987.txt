Then it carries the amino acid back to the ribosome where the amino acid is transferred from the tRNA to the growing protein. At this point it is important to remember that amino acids are added to the protein in a specific order. The order is contained in the code of the mRNA inside the ribosome. Synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, tRNA are made by a special protein that reads the DNA code and makes an RNA copy (pre-tRNA). This process is called transcription and for making tRNA it is done by RNA polymerase III. Pre-tRNA are processed once they leave the nucleus.
You'll need to login or register. mRNA is messenger RNA. mRNA is transcribed from DNA, and carries coding information to the ribosomes. Here, the RNA is translated into a protein. In mRNA genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides arranged into codons. 
The interaction of tRNA and mRNA in protein synthesis. A transfer RNA (abbreviated tRNA and archaically referred to as sRNA, for soluble RNA) is an adaptor molecule composed of RNA, typically 76 to 90 nucleotides in length, that serves as the physical link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins. 1 The amino acid loaded onto the tRNA by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, to form aminoacyl-tRNA, is covalently bonded to the 3'-hydroxyl group on the CCA tail. 2  This sequence is important for the recognition of tRNA by enzymes and critical in translation.
It takes the codons to the rRNA which is the ribosome itself to begin translation. tRNA has the anticodons which match the mRNA and bring the amino acids which are linked together to form a protein. 
Ribosomal ribonucleic (rRNA) is RNA that forms part of ribosomes. rRNA plays a role in translation, in which mRNA's codons and tRNA's anticodons are used to build a protein. Transcription is the synthesis of an mRNA molecule using a DNA molecule for a template. That mRNA molecule then goes on to complete translation in the ribosome. Translation is … the process in which proteins are produced based on instructions carried by mRNA.
Transfer RNA plays a huge role in protein synthesis and translation. Its job is to translate the message within the nucleotide sequence of mRNA to a specific amino acid sequence. A peptide bond forms connecting the amino acid of the tRNA in the P site to the amino acid of the tRNA in the A binding site. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA molecule, the tRNA in the P site is released and the tRNA in the A site is translocated to the P site.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. mRNA is messenger RNA. mRNA is transcribed from DNA, and carries coding information to the ribosomes. Here, the RNA is translated into a protein. In mRNA genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides arranged into codons. Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons that terminate protein synthesis
