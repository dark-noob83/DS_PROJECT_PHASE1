Formula. To determine the amount paid for salaries as a percentage of operating expenses, simply add up all the operating expenses in your company, including research and development, supplies and equipment, and general and administrative costs.

If the percentage is too large, you risk running out of money for other expenses. If it's too small, you risk losing employees to competitors.

Calculate your salaries as a percentage of operating expenses by dividing the total salary expenses by your total operating expenses. As an example, if you pay $145,000 in total operating expenses with a salary expense of $41,000, 28 percent of your operating expenses are salaries. A report by the Society for Human Resource Management indicates that retail industry businesses may have a salary to expense percentage of as little as 18 percent.
