I've heard that you can increase the interval between oil changes if you use a synthetic oil, but no one has been able to tell me precisely how much the interval can be expanded. I have a 2003 Pontiac Bonneville, 3.8l 6 cylinder engine, 128k miles. The car manufacturer maintenance recommends every 7500 miles. Follow. I&#39;
That synthetic oil gets changed at 7,000 miles. But regular conventional oil must be changed every 3,000 miles. My local mechanic that I go to is the the most trustworthy mechanic around. I asked him what if I go 5,000 miles between oil changes. He said, you will ruin your engine eventually.
Ford, Volkswagen and Porsche, for example, recommend oil changes every 10,000 miles. So does Toyota on several engines, including the Prius' 1.8-liter four-cylinder and the Camry's 2.5-liter four-cylinder. BMW says owners can go up to 15,000 miles between oil changes (with synthetic oil). The intervals vary by manufacturer and engines, so consult your owner's manual or maintenance schedule to see how often to change the oil in your vehicle and what type of oil to use. You may be surprised. If you're nervous about going 10,000 miles or more between oil changes, then do it every six months, when you probably should also have your tires rotated (also explained in your owner's manual). GM says to change your oil at least once a year even if the service indicator warning light doesn't come on.
1 Only Toyota vehicles in which 0w-20 synthetic oil is required (except for the 2TR-FE and 3UR-FBE Engines*) have been approved for extended oil change intervals of 10,000-miles/12-months.

1 In the case of vehicles with 10,000 mile oil change intervals, the 5,000 mile service interval has not been eliminated. 2  The traditional 5,000 mile maintenance procedures (such as tire rotation) will continue to be required, and the fluid levels (such as brake fluid) will need to be checked and adjusted at this time.

Now for all corolla's up to 2011 the oil change intervals is set by toyota at 5000 miles or 6 months whichever comes first. However the ideal time to replace your oil is 3000 miles or 6 months whichever comes first. If you are using toyota's genuine oil which then it's 5000 miles. If you are using any other brand of oil then the recommended interval is 3000 miles. I would recommend you replace your engine oil at 3000-4000 miles for the longest life of the engine. If your corolla is 2011-2013 year then it will use a full synthetic 0w20 and then the oil change interval by toyota is 10,000 miles or 1 year whichever comes first. Having said these miles intervals I would highly recommend you check your oil level and adjust it every fuel fill up or at the MOST every 1000 miles
Depending on where you drive (dusty, dirty climates), and how much and far you drive (shorter distances don't heat oil enough to boil off condensation in the engine), you can probably last between oil changes for 10,000, 15,000, on up to 20,000 miles with some brands of synthetic. For your pocket book, there is not much of a difference if you allow your oil change cycles to last longer with synthetic. There is a debate on when you should change your oil, because the age old consensus has always been every 3 months or 3,000 miles, whichever comes first.
Any synthetic oil can go to about 5000 miles. Just keep in mind how much abuse you put your car through. If you do long hauls a lot then you could get 5k to 6k in between oil changes. But if you do a lot of stop and go and city driving you may want to do it at about 4k. I&#39;ve heard that you can increase the interval between oil changes if you use a synthetic oil, but no one has been able to tell me precisely how much the interval can be expanded.
