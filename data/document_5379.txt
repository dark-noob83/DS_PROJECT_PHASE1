And in 2013 Juno is slated to make a flyby of Earth, using our own planet's gravity to slingshot itself toward Jupiter. Right now we plan to operate most of the instruments at the earth [flyby], Bolton said. You learn about the spacecraft long before you get to the outer planet that you're going to.. Eventually Juno will take up a year-long polar orbit around Jupiter to study in detail the planet's magnetic and radiation fields with the goal of understanding how Jupiter formed.
Since the Earth and Jupiter are both revolving around the sun, the distance between them is always changing. The average distance between the Earth and Jupiter is 483 million miles. If you could travel at the speed of light, it would only take you 43 minutes to get to Jupiter. Since people cant travel at the speed of light, you would probably have to take a rocket ship to Jupiter instead-which would take you about 2.2 years if it was going at top speed the whole way.
Share to: It takes a space probe an average of 5 years to reach Jupiter-the latest one, Juno, was launched on 5th August 2011 and will not reach the Jovian system until 2016.
A day on Jupiter is about 10 Earth hours long. Jupiter takes about 9 hours 56 minutes to do one full rotation, compared to 24 hours here on Earth. This velocity is based on … the visible cloud layers, and represents an equatorial rotation speed of 45,000 kph (28,000 mph), the fastest for any planet.
About ten hours; however, since Jupiter is not solid but a gas giant, its rotation time varies with latitude. Features near the equator complete a rotation in 9 hours 50 minut … es; those at higher latitudes take about five minutes longer.
The table below gives you some sense for how long it takes to get to each planet at different speeds. The Space Shuttle, of course, can't leave Earth orbit but its speed is typical of manned spacecraft.
