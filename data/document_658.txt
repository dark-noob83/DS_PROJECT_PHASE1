Occasional atypical lymphocytes is found in the bloodstream as an indicator of immune system activation or antigen stimulation in the body. It has more cytoplasm and grows larger in size than normal lymphocytes.
Atypical lymphocyte refers to unusual structure of lymphocytes that are a part of the cell mediated immune system of the body. Also referred to as reactive lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes are larger in size with a diameter of more than 30 microns. The large size of the lymphocytes is attributed to antigen stimulation. There are several factors that are responsible for atypical lymphocytes.
Lymphocytosis (lim-foe-sie-TOE-sis), or a high lymphocyte count, is an increase in white blood cells called lymphocytes (LIM-foe-sites). Lymphocytes are an important part of the immune system.
