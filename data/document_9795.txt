Definition: Formal charge is the difference between the number of valence electrons of each atom and the number of electrons the atom is associated with. Formal charge assumes any shared electrons are equally shared between the two bonded atoms.
The battery terminals are represented as electron-source and electron-sink in the user interface of the models. The function of this variable is to stop the model once a certain number of electrons reach the battery positive, and a monitor displays the time taken to fill the electron-sink.
For any given value of the maximum filling capacity of the electron-sink, find two different sets of values of the Number and Speed of electrons for which the time taken to fill the electron-sink is identical.
An electron source is a bond or a lone pair of electrons. It is either a p bond or a lone pair on an atom of relatively high electron density in a molecule or ion, or a bond that must break during a reaction. An electron sink is an atom on a molecule or ion that can accept a new bond or lone pair of electrons. Learning to identify the characteristic sources and sinks in different functional groups is the key to learning organic chemistry reaction mechanisms.
