The Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, issued a report that lowered the recommended daily amount of sodium. Previously, the daily allowance was 2500 milligrams, but it has been lowered to 1500 milligrams per day. No more then 2,300 mg (about one teaspoon of salt) per day for an average adult See link http://heartdisease.lifetips.com/faq/119544/0/how-much-sodium-intake-should-a-healt … hy-adult-have-daily/index.html.
1 The Nutrition Facts Label lists the Percent Daily Value (%DV) of sodium in one serving of a food. 2  The %DV for sodium is based on 100% of the recommended amount of sodium, which is less than 2400 milligrams (mg) per day. 1 Low Sodium → 140 mg of sodium or less per serving. 2  Reduced Sodium → At least 25% less sodium than in the original product. 3  Light in Sodium or Lightly Salted → At least 50% less sodium than the regular product. 4  No-Salt-Added or Unsalted → No salt is added during processing, but not necessarily sodium-free.
Most Canadians consume far more sodium than is needed. The recommended amount per day is between 1500 mg (considered adequate intake) and 2300 mg (upper amount) for people 9 -50 years of age. For people over 50 years of age, an adequate intake drops to 1300 mg per day until 70 and then 1200 mg over 70 years of age.
The minimum requirement of sodium for normal body function is about 500 mg/day. The recommendation for sodium intake is less than 2,300 mg/day for adults. This equals about one teaspoon of table salt. Most people consume far too much sodium through processed foods and table salt, therefore, this recommendation is set at an upper limit. 
Recommendations. The adequate intake of sodium for healthy, young men is 1.5 grams per day. This does not include individuals who require larger amounts, such as competitive athletes or those exposed to extreme heat. Older men require 1.2 to 1.3 grams per day due to decreased energy intakes.
A. 1  Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. 2  Consume foods that are rich in potassium. 3  Potassium can help blunt the effects of sodium on blood pressure. 4  The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. 1 The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. 2  Potassium-rich foods include leafy, green vegetables and fruits from vines. 3  Flavor food with pepper and other herbs and spices instead of salt. 4  Choose unsalted snacks. 5  Read food labels and choose foods low in sodium.
Some people are more sensitive to the effects of salt than others. The guidelines also recommend that, in general, individuals with hypertension, blacks, and middle-aged and older adults should limit intake to 1,500 mg of sodium per day. 1 The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. 2  Potassium-rich foods include leafy, green vegetables and fruits from vines. 3  Flavor food with pepper and other herbs and spices instead of salt. 4  Choose unsalted snacks. 5  Read food labels and choose foods low in sodium.
Recommended intake of sodium. It is recommended that people over the age of one year eat between 1000-1500 mg sodium per day. This is referred to as the Adequate Intake (AI) . People aged 14 and over should not eat more than 2300 mg sodium per day. This is referred to the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). A sodium intake above 2300 mg per day is likely to pose a health risk. 
The FDA urges Americans to limit dietary sodium. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that individuals consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, and that certain groups limit intake to 1,500 milligrams per day. The “Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010” addresses sodium intake in detail. The average daily sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 milligrams per day, an excessive amount that raises blood pressure and poses health risks. In general, Americans should limit daily sodium consumption to 2,300 milligrams, but this is an upper safe limit, not a recommended daily allowance. Even active people who lose lots of sodium through sweating require no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium
