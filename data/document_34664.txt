For all jobs earning less than $50,000 per year, or more than 40 percent of U.S. jobs, the average cost of replacing an employee amounts to fully 20 percent of the person's annual salary, the liberal-leaning think-tank found in a study that looks at 31 corporate case studies. 
Regional Breakdown. According to the BLS, the total cost per employee per hour for private industry employers in the Northeast was $33.43, and $10.41, or 31.2 percent, of that cost was employee benefits. The total cost per employee per hour in the West was $30.94, and $8.97, or 29.4 percent, of that was benefits. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the average cost of employee benefits to employers was relatively steady at 27 to 29 percent of the total compensation cost throughout the 1990s but began to increase at the turn of the century as health insurance costs began rising rapidly.
For the past four years, learning and development budgets have been growing. That same presentation by Tauber, for example, estimates total spending on employee training at $150 billion in the U.S. Tech firms lead the way, with an average of $1,847 spent each year per employee. 
Market Sector. Retail businesses and wholesale corporations provided more than twice the amount of training hours per employee, with an average of 93 hours of training in 2011 for a budget of up to $1,900 per person. Military organizations and Government functions also strongly endorse training with an average of 68 hours per individual, a statistic from the 2011 Industry Report. Other market segment enterprises average 39 hours per year with a training budget in the range of $375 to $922 per employee.
Training turns out to be one of the costliest investments a company can make. In a report from Training magazine in 2007, companies spent an average of over $1,200 annually per employee. In 2005, employees spent an average of 32 hours per year on training. And those aren't necessarily only new hires who would not only require the same on-the-job training and continuing education as current employees, but the additional hours and cost of orientation and initial job training. The level goes up to 50% productivity for weeks 5 through 12, with corresponding cost of 50% of employee salary. Weeks 13 -20 usually bring the employee up to 75% productivity rate, with the cost being 25% of employee salary. Around the five-month mark, then, companies can expect a new hire to reach full productivity.
Similar to the direct learning expenditure per employee, the cost per learning hour available slightly increased from 2012 to 2013. In 2013, organizations report that the cost to have one hour of learning available was $1,798, which is a 1.5 percent increase over 2012, or $26. Healthcare/pharmaceutical organizations spend on average $1,392 and provide 24 hours of training per employee. The combined group of finance, insurance, and real estate spend on average $1,107 and provide 33 hours of training per employee. (See Figure 2,  Direct Learning Expenditure per Employee by Industry .).
Small organizations with fewer than 500 employees spent on average $1,888 per employee, and midsize organizations with 500 to 9,999 employees spent $838, which was the same amount spent by large organizations with 10,000 or more employees in 2013. Healthcare/pharmaceutical organizations spend on average $1,392 and provide 24 hours of training per employee. The combined group of finance, insurance, and real estate spend on average $1,107 and provide 33 hours of training per employee. (See Figure 2,  Direct Learning Expenditure per Employee by Industry .).
The cost of turnover ranges from $3,000 to $25,000 for an employee earning $8 per hour, according to a 2007 research compilation from Sasha Corporation. The ability to retain employees blossoms into achieving greater customer satisfaction and results in higher corporate profits, a conclusion from Bassiâ€™s studies. Military organizations and Government functions also strongly endorse training with an average of 68 hours per individual, a statistic from the 2011 Industry Report. Other market segment enterprises average 39 hours per year with a training budget in the range of $375 to $922 per employee.
The costs to replace an employee vary by their earning level, so training costs also vary. The Sasha Corporation averaged the results of 15 studies that determined average costs to replace an $8 per hour employee, determining an average cost of $9,444.47 per turnover. Even when the 33 percent of estimates with the highest prices were removed from calculations, replacement costs were $5,505.80 per turnover.
The total cost per employee per hour in the Midwest was $27.93, and $8.52, or 30.5 percent, of that was benefits. The total cost per employee per hour in the South was $26.64, and $7.55, or 28.4 percent, of that was benefits. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the average cost of employee benefits to employers was relatively steady at 27 to 29 percent of the total compensation cost throughout the 1990s but began to increase at the turn of the century as health insurance costs began rising rapidly.
