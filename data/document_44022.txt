The hamstring group of muscles, located at the back of the upper leg, are actually a group of three separate muscles. The top of these muscles are attached to the lower part of the pelvis, and the bottom of the hamstring muscles are attached to the lower leg bone just below the knee joint.
Two of the hamstring muscles -- the semimembranosus and semitendinosus -- lie on the inner side of the back of your thigh. Both muscles originate from the sitting bone, or ischial tuberosity, on the back of the pelvis.
The semimembranosus muscle is one of the three muscles that make up the hamstring. It is found on the back of the thigh and runs from the base of the pelvis (specifically the tuberosity of the ischium) to the back of the tibia, one of the bones that make up the lower leg.
Semitendinosus. The semitendinosus muscle is one of three hamstring muscles that are located at the back of the thigh. The other two are the semimembranosus muscle and the biceps femoris. The semitendinosus muscle lies between the other two. These three muscles work collectively to flex the knee and extend the hip.
The Hamstrings consist of three muscles the Biceps Femoris muscle, the Semitendinosus muscle, and the Semimembranosus muscle. These muscles combined are primarily responsible for the flexion of the knee joint (bending of the knee) as well as assisting the extension of the thigh (moving the upper leg backwards).
The semitendinosus is a very long muscle which is located in the posterior and medial of the thigh and connects the ischium to the proximial of the tibia.
