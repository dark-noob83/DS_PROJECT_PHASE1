This study will briefly explain the causes of electric shock and their effects on human body. INTRODUCTION. Electric shock occurs upon contact of a human body with any source of voltage high enough to cause sufficient current through the skin, muscles or hair.
3 Electric Shock & the Human Body Three primary factors affect the severity of the shock a person receiveswhen he or she is a part of an electrical circuit:  Amount of current flowing through the body (measured in amperes).  Path of the current through the body.  Length of time the body is in the circuit.
This research identifies the causes and effect of electric shock to a human body and is directed towards benefiting the following: Electrical Engineering students: this study helps them to become aware of the causes and effects of electric shock since they will be handling electricity in their study.
Some of the common causes of Electric shocks down the body may include: 1  Lesion of the dorsal column of the cervical cord. 2  Trauma. 3  Vitamin B12 deficiency. 4  Radiation. 5  Myelopathy. 6  Disc herniation. 7  Cervical spondylosis. 8  more causes...Â».
Electric shock is the sufficient amount of current flowing through human body which the person could feel. But, this doesn't mean that shock is not caused by Voltage. Of course, it depends upon voltage which is given by Ohm's law ...
4 Electric Shock & the Human Body The human body, particularly the heart, is very vulnerable to electrical current. Muscle contraction, paralysis, or heart stoppage can result from the flow of current through the body. Burns of the skin may also occur.
