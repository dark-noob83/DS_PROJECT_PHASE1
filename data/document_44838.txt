A googol is the large number 10 100. In decimal notation, it is written as the digit 1 followed by one hundred 0s : Using an integral, binary numeral system, one would need 333 bits to represent a googol, i.e., 1 googol ≈ 2 332.19280949, or exactly. However, a googol is well within the maximum bounds of an IEEE 754 double-precision floating point type.
