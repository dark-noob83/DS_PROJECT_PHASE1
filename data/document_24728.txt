1 Set the roast at room temperature for 1 hour prior to cooking. 2  Thoroughly rinse the roast& pat dry with paper towel. 3  Generously salt& pepper the roast on all sides. 4  Cover the bottom of a roasting pan with olive oil& set on medium-high heat about 4 minutes until very hot.
Remove from the heat and strain it into a gravy boat. Letting the roast rest for 10-15 minutes, pulls the juices back into the roast and results in juicy tender meat. Use a nice long craving knife to slice up the roast. There are many different cuts of beef and the top sirloin roast is one of my favourites.
1 Cook for 15 to 20 minutes (depends on size of roast) at 450 degrees F. 2  Then, without opening the oven door, turn the heat down to 325 degrees F. 3  Cook until meat thermometer inserted reaches about 140 degrees. 4  Generally this should take about 2½ to 3 hours, but it varies on oven and roast size.
1 Preheat oven to 325°, place roast in pan and place on upper oven rack. 2  Cook for 25 minutes per lb for medium or approximately 50 to 60 minutes. 3  Use a meat thermometer to check doneness-should read 140° for medium. 4  Remove from oven, cover with foil to keep warm and let rest for 15 minutes before carving.
1 Salt and pepper the vegetables. 2  After the meat has roasted for 15 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and place the pan with the vegetables on the lower shelf. 3  Continue to roast the beef until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 130 to 135 degrees, about 50 to 60 minutes.
Roast for 15 minutes, reduce heat to 225°, and continue roasting for about 3 hours longer, or until done as desired. For medium rare, the beef should register from 130° to 135°. on a meat thermometer or oven probe in the thickest part of the roast. Let the roast rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
I love to stick a few garlic cloves in the roast. It adds a nice flavour right through all the meat. Simply, use a paring knife to spear into the roast about 1 1/2 to 2 inches. Press a garlic clove into each of the slots in the meat. For a 5-6 pound top sirloin roast, I use 5-7 garlic cloves.
