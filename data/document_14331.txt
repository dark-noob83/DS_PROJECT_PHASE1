The fastest airplane ever that made into production was the American Lockheed-Martin SR-71 Blackbird, capable of in excess of MACH 3 at up to 85,000 feet. The fastest recorded … speed for the Blackbird was over 1,905 knots or 2,193 mph in 1976.

X43A Scramjet fastest airplane - 7,500 mph. It is the world's fastest air breathing engine vehicle and is pilotless. The record was set on 11/16/2004 when the X-43A was launched by a booster rocket at 40,000 feet from a B-52. At an altitude of 110,000 feet it reached top speed for about 11 seconds, officially Mach 10
Here are 10 of the fastest military airplanes. Aviation has come a long way since the intrepid Wright brothers made the first powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight in 1903. More than a cen} DUPipeline_QISnippet_FirstGood_Snippet_v1: {},{-1|-1|1|Highway to the Danger Zone.
The X-15 reached Mach 6.72, but it is a rocket powered aircraft. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, which made it's first flight on December 22, 1964, is still considered to be the world's fastest airplane reaching Mach 3.2 or 2,193.167 MPH in July 1976.
An air speed record is the highest airspeed attained by an aircraft of a particular class. The rules for all official aviation records are defined by Federation Fédération Aeronautique (AéRONAUTIQUE), internationale fai which also ratifies. any claims Although the official record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is held by a Grumman F8F Bearcat, the Rare Bear, with a speed of 528.31 mph (850.24 km/h), the unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is a held by a British Hawker Sea Fury at 547 mph (880 km/h).
List the names here are top 10 fastest plane in the world. All represented at mach speed or the speed of sound units and each of the aircraft that was piloted using a jet engine. Just so you know mach speed 1 is equivalent to 1225 km / hour. 10. 
An air speed record is the highest airspeed attained by an aircraft of a particular class. The rules for all official aviation records are defined by Federation Fédération Aeronautique (AéRONAUTIQUE), internationale fai which also ratifies. Any claims speed records are divided into multiple classes-with. sub divisions Although the official record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is held by a Grumman F8F Bearcat, the Rare Bear, with a speed of 528.31 mph (850.24 km/h), the unofficial record for fastest piston-engined aeroplane in level flight is a held by a British Hawker Sea Fury at 547 mph (880 km/h).
The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird is the fastest jet ever built, a machine so far ahead of its time even its own pilots thought it looked more like a spaceship than an airplane. It is an engineering marvel, powered by innovative engines that operated most efficiently at Mach 3.2, its typical cruising speed. Flying the world's fastest plane: Behind the stick of the SR-71. By Spencer Hall  @edsbs on Mar 7, 2014, 1:30p 86. Spencer Hall interviews former SR-71 Blackbird pilot Rick McCrary about what it's like to fly the world's fastest plane.
Published on Tuesday, 02 April 2013 15:12. NASA X-43A is an unmanned experimental hypersonic aircraft designed by NASA. It is the fastest aircraft ever built, currently holding the fastest flight speed record. From that moment, the X-43A is powered by its own jet engine. The aircraft uses a scramjet engine, a variant of a ramjet air-breathing jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow.
