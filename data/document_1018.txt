Answer by Kalarni.solomon. Confidence votes 213. Milo (or more commonly referred to as Grain Sorghum) is a grain product that is grown in hot dry climates that cannot sustain corn. It is used in many parts of the world as a food grain for human consumption. However, in the United States it is more commonly used as an ingredient in the production of animal and livestock feeds.
Sorghum is a cereal grain that originated in Africa about 5000 years ago where it continues to be an important food source today. It's sometimes called milo and in India it is known as jowar. Today the United States is the largest producer of sorghum where it's primarily used for animal feed.
In 2010, Nigeria was the world's largest producer of grain sorghum, followed by the United States and India. In developed countries, and increasingly in developing countries such as India, the predominant use of sorghum is as fodder for poultry and cattle. Leading exporters in 2010 were the United States, Australia and Argentina; Mexico was the largest importer of sorghum.
Farmers on the hot, dry plains from Texas to South Dakota grow and use grain sorghum like Corn Belt farmers use corn. Large acreages of grain sorghum are also grown in Africa and Asia in areas where the climate is too hot and dry for corn.
The United States is the world's largest producer of sorghum. While Americans do use sorghum, India and parts of Africa consider it a particularly valuable food source. Milling the grain like wheat to make flour is one way to use sorghum; however, this is not one of the better-known uses of the crop.
