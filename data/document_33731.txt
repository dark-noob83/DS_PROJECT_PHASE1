Exercise 1: The period of oscillation of an object in an ideal mass-spring system is 0.50 sec and the amplitude is 5.0 cm. What is the speed at the equilibrium point? At equilibrium x=0:2 2 2 2 21212121E K U+ kx kA= mv Since E=constant, at equilibrium (x = 0) the KE must be a maximum.
Period of oscillation (T) (or just period): duration of time between one wave and the next one passing the same spot. Units: seconds (s). The inverse of the period is frequency. Use a capital, italic T and not a lowercase one, which is used for time.
Amplitude-The maximum displacement of an oscillating system. Period-The time it takes for a system to complete one oscillation. Frequency-The rate at which a system completes an oscillation. Hertz-The unit of measurement of frequency.
That is, it is the time between successive oscillations of the system (see figure 2). The other basic property of an oscillating system is the frequency, which is closely related to the time period. As we know, one complete oscillation of the system is defined by the time period, T and is known as 1 cycle. The frequency of the oscillating system is simply the amount of cycles that happen in 1 second. So, The units of frequency are cycles per second which are given the name Hertz (Hz).
For periodic motion, frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time. The relationship between frequency and period is. The SI unit for frequency is the cycle per second, which is defined to be a hertz (Hz): A cycle is one complete oscillation. Note that a vibration can be a single or multiple event, whereas oscillations are usually repetitive for a significant number of cycles.
The angular frequency is measured in radians per second. The inverse of the period is the frequency f = 1/T. The frequency f = 1/T = ω/2π of the motion gives the number of complete oscillations per unit time. It is measured in units of Hertz, (1 Hz = 1/s).
The SI unit for period is seconds and the symbol is t (because the period is a time measurement, it is expressed in the SI unit seconds).
(2). 1  Amplitude (A): The maximum distance that an object moves from its equilibrium position. 2  Period (T): The time that it takes for an oscillator to execute one complete cycle of its motion. 3  Frequency (f): The number of cycles (or oscillations) the object completes per unit time. 4  The unit of frequency is usually taken to be 1 Hz = 1 cycle per ...
