Step 1. Calculate the wages paid by tallying the number of hours worked at each pay rate in your restaurant and multiplying by the hourly wage. For example, if your wait staff receives $2.50 per hour plus tips, and your servers work a total of 360 hours in a week, you incur $900 in payroll for your wait staff. If you pay cooks $10 hourly, and they work a total of 200 hours weekly, you pay $2,000 weekly to kitchen staff. Include the wages you pay to greeters, cleaning staff and bus crews. Step 2. Determine the weekly salary expense for your managers if you pay salary. Divide the weekly payroll figure by your total weekly sales. If your restaurant brought in $28,157 and you spent $5,350 on labor, your labor cost percentage would be about 19 percent, or $5,350 divided by $28,157.
