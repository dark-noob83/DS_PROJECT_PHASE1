lava flow. (geology). A lateral, surficial stream of molten lava issuing from a volcanic cone or from a fissure. The solidified mass of rock formed when a lava stream congeals.
The single most important factor on the form of a lava flow is probably the effusion rate, or rate of discharge, measured in cubic meters per second. The higher the effusion rate, the greater the distance traveled before cooling lowers the viscosity and impedes flow.
Lava flows get their name from the manner in which the hot molten lava flows outward parallel to the surface of the Earth. The result is a large flat lava covered plain. As additional lava flows escape from a volcano or fissure, they create layers of lava rock left behind from the many different flows.

Lava Flow. mode of occurrence of lava that has issued from a volcano. Lava flows are characterized by great length (up to several dozen kilometers) with relatively small width and thickness. The length and thickness of the lava flow depend on the viscosity of the lava and the slope of the terrain.
