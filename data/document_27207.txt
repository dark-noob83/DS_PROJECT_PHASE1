While certain antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can raise serotonin levels in the brain -- and may well be essential for your ability to cope and function -- it's useful to recognize that foods containing certain vitamins and minerals can also give this important chemical a boost. ALA -- alpha-linolenic acid -- is found in vegetable oils like canola and soybean, flaxseed and walnuts. Brussels sprouts, kale, spinach and salad greens are also rich sources of ALA. EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid, and DHA, docosahexanoic acid, can be found in fatty fish like salmon.

Serotonin isn’t found in foods, but tryptophan is. Foods high in protein, iron, riboflavin, and vitamin B6 all tend to contain large amounts of the amino acid. Unfortunately, though, boosting your serotonin levels isn’t as simple as eating a “high tryptophan diet.”. It’s possible that eating foods high in tryptophan with a healthy serving of carbohydrates can have an effect on your serotonin levels. When you eat carbs, more insulin is released into your system.
Cereals, whole grains, potatoes, pork, liver, kidney beans, chicken, wheat germ, bananas, peanuts, eggs, mushrooms, watermelon, grapefruit, shellfish and dairy products are all excellent sources of B vitamins. ALA -- alpha-linolenic acid -- is found in vegetable oils like canola and soybean, flaxseed and walnuts. Brussels sprouts, kale, spinach and salad greens are also rich sources of ALA. EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid, and DHA, docosahexanoic acid, can be found in fatty fish like salmon.
Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Many foods contain tryptophan, so the common belief is that by eating foods high in tryptophan, you can boost your serotonin levels. It’s possible that eating foods high in tryptophan with a healthy serving of carbohydrates can have an effect on your serotonin levels. When you eat carbs, more insulin is released into your system.
Soy products, including soy milk, tofu and soybeans provide nutrients that help serotonin levels stay stable. Sea vegetables include kelp, seaweed and spirulina -- a blue-green algae -- contain tryptophan, an essential amino acid that is necessary for creating serotonin in the brain. The brain uses the amino acid tryptophan to produce serotonin, as long as the process is not blocked by conflicting amino acids. Serotonin is also found in the digestive system, and certain foods may raise or lower serotonin levels.
Many foods boost serotonin levels naturally and can improve mood. Serotonin acts as a neurotransmitter, relaying signals from one area of the brain to another. Researchers believe that an imbalance in serotonin levels can cause depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic anxiety disorder and anger management issues. ALA -- alpha-linolenic acid -- is found in vegetable oils like canola and soybean, flaxseed and walnuts. Brussels sprouts, kale, spinach and salad greens are also rich sources of ALA. EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid, and DHA, docosahexanoic acid, can be found in fatty fish like salmon.
