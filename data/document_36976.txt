An implant in Chicago may be $4,000, whereas an implant in Salt Lake City may be $2,500. It may cost more if a bone graft is required prior to placing the implant. Dentists or oral surgeons may offer financing or may partner with a company or bank that does. There are two major fees associated with dental implants. The surgical portion (placing the implant into the bone) will cost from $1500 to $2500 per tooth. The non-surgical portion (attaching the tooth to the implant) will cost from $1000-$2000 per tooth
