SAFENET is a form, and process, that has been in demand by firefighters themselves. It is a method for prompt reporting and timely resolution of safety and health concerns encountered in wildland fire, all hazard operations, or other related work environments. 1 There is no punishment or penalty for filing a SAFENET, nor is it mandatory. 2  SAFENETs related to incidents that have on-going serious accident investigations will not be posted until formal investigation process is completed.
SAFENET is a program with a form designed for reporting and correcting unsafe situations and for sharing critical safety information related to fire operations (wildland and prescribed). SAFENET has three primary purposes: 1  To provide immediate reporting and correction of unsafe situations in fire operations. 2  To provide a vehicle for sharing important safety information throughout the fire community. SAFENET Submissions: 1  Anyone may initiate a SAFENET for the purpose of reporting an unsafe condition, unsafe procedure, or near miss. 2  In order to ensure the most immediate corrective action.
The SAFENET form and process was designed for frontline firefighters and endorsed by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) in 2002. SAFENET provides another way for frontline firefighters to be heard-to get unsafe situations resolved on the fireline. SAFENET is also a means of capturing important safety-related data for a common data base at the National Interagency Fire Center to help determine long-term trends and problem areas.
