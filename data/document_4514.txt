Abstract. Background: A prevailing blame culture in health care has been suggested as a major source of an unacceptably high number of medical errors. A just culture has emerged as an imperative for improving the quality and safety of patient care.
Blame culture is a description given to an organisation in which people are blamed for mistakes. This contrasts with those in which the problem leading to a mistake is identified and improvements are made. A good way of detecting a blame culture is to see what happens when a senior person detects the mistake. If they ask Who (rather than What or How) you may be seeing evidence of a blame culture. The difficulty with blame cultures is that people often begin to fear being blamed.
If you are thinking that Just Culture is equivalent to a No Blame Culture, think again. We do hold people accountable for their actions and their decisions. But rather than assigning blame, we are seeking to identify shortcomings in the system that led to or enabled mistaken action.
In a Just Culture, there is recognition that errors are often system failures (not personal failures) and a focus on understanding the root of the problem allows for learning, process improvement, and changes to design strategies and systems to promote prevention. A “Just Culture” is not a “blame-free” culture. Rather, it is a culture that requires full disclosure of mistakes, errors, near misses, patient safety concerns, and sentinel events in order to facilitate learning from such occurrences and identifying opportunities for process and system improvement.
A major part of this role is to transform the culture from one of a silent, hierarchical structure of blame to an open team-oriented culture to improve patient safety. Reason argues that an informed culture requires a reporting culture, Just Culture, flexible culture, and learning culture.
