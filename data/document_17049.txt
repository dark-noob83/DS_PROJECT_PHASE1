In captivity, Canada geese have breed with other geese species, such as greylag geese, snow geese and barnacle geese, to form hybrid goslings. This is less common in nature; however, it may happen when orphaned chicks are adopted by other species, or when geese lay their eggs in the nests of other species. In captivity, the longest lived goose was 80 years old. In the wild, the oldest goose was reportedly 30 years and 4 months old. This is an extraordinary lifespan for a wild bird; the life expectancy for most wild geese is 12 years.
Canada geese (Branta canadensis) are among the most familiar birds in Washington. They are a source of recreation for bird watchers and hunters and symbolize nature for many people. No one can miss the clear honking call of Canada geese when they fly overhead in their V-shaped formation. Canada geese hatched in urban environments may have very low first-year mortalities due to the abundance of food and relative scarcity of natural predators. Canada geese can live more than 20 years in captivity; in the wild they have a much shorter life span.

The maximum flight ceiling of Canada geese is unknown, but they have been reported at 9 km (29,000 feet).
