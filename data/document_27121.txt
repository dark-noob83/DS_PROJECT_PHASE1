1 With all needed parts and labor, hiring a plumber to install a traditional gas water heater costs $300-$3,500 or more, depending on capacity (with 40 or 50 gallons the most common sizes); length of warranty (typically 5-12 years); and the amount of repairs required to meet current building codes. 1 CostHelper readers report paying $385-$750 for do-it-yourself installation of new water heater, at an average cost of $574, while a New Jersey reader reports paying $2,500 a plumber (triple the normal rate) to fix the botched do-it-yourself installation of a 40-gallon water heater.
1 Because tankless water heaters require a 220V/240V electrical outlet or larger gas pipes than found in an average home plus a stainless steel ventilation system, installation can add $1,000-$3,000 or more, bringing total costs to $1,800-$4,500. 1 A central tankless water heater providing hot water for an entire house can cost $800-$3,000 or more, depending on gpm capacity and whether it's gas or electric, plus features like a safety temperature lock or a remote control.
Up-front costs are high. The tankless water heaters we tested cost $800 to $1,150, compared with $300 to $480 for the regular storage-tank types. Tankless models need electrical outlets for their fan and electronics, upgraded gas pipes, and a new ventilation system. Gas tankless water heaters, which use high-powered burners to quickly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger, were 22 percent more energy efficient on average than the gas-fired storage-tank models in our tests. That translates into a savings of around $70 to $80 per year, based on 2008 national energy costs.
