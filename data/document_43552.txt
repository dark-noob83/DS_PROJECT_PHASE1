uniform temperature unlike a planet such as earth which has a variable temperature range venus surface temperature remains constantly around 480 degrees celsius or 896 degrees fahrenheit this uniform temperature is due to two primary causes the tilt of the planet on its axis and the atmospheric conditions
the mass of the venus atmosphere is about 90 times that of the earth s atmosphere 90 % of the earth s atmosphere is within 10 km of the surface whereas you have to go to 50 km to capture 90 % of the atmosphere of venus the clouds of venus may extend from about 50 to 70 km and may be divided into three distinct layers
atmosphere the surface temperature of venus is around 890 degrees f the hottest average temperature in the solar system this is due to a runaway greenhouse effect the atmosphere of venus is composed of 97 % co2 2 % n2 and less than 1 % of o2 h2o and ch4 methane
the surface temperature on the planet venus is almost uniform planet wide even at the poles and even at night this is about 464 c 867 f the heat is carried by convectio n through its thick atmosphere which blocks 60 % of the sunlight but also prevents the surface from cooling by infrared radiation
the average temperature on venus is about 464 c 867 f it is this hot because it is the second planet from the sun and has what scientists call a runaway greenhouse effect a thick layer of clouds carbon dioxide and some sulphuric acid covers the surface and traps infrared radiation raising the surface temperature of the planet
in addition the surface temperature on venus does not vary like it does here on earth on our planet temperatures vary wildly due to the time of year and even more so based on the location on our planet the hottest temperature ever recorded on earth was 70 7 c in the lut desert of iran in 2005
the surface temperature on the planet venus is almost uniform planet wide even at the poles and even at night this is about 464 c 867 f the heat is carried by convectio n through its thick atmosphere which blocks 60 % of the sunlight but also prevents the surface from cooling by infrared radiation
