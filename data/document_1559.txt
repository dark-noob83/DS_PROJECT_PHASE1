$449,410. Once we have estimated the ASC revenue, the next step is to calculate the cost of building the ASC. If you are going to construct a new building from the ground up, you will need to add the cost of the land plus the cost of the building shell that will run about $60 per square foot.
The overriding reason: hospital expansion projects are extremely capital intensive, with a price tag of $1 million to $2 million per bed. Or, to put it another way, hospitals cost about $600 per square foot to build compared with $250 on average for medical office space. While more than 90% of surgeries were performed in a hospital in 1981, today only 47% are.
Unfortunately, building big is a cost that one never stops paying for. In a recent project, we witnessed a situation where the center could have readily been completed for 13,000 square feet (the national average size for a surgery center) instead of the 21,000 square feet plan that was developed.
You can feel comfortable using a cost of $128 per square foot for the cost of the build out of the ASC if you include architectural, engineering, and consulting fees. I would also figure on a 10% reserve for contingencies.
In addition, the more urban a project setting, the higher the costs. For example, the same new ASC built in Abilene, Texas, for $150 to $200 per square foot will cost $260 to $350 in New York City.
Below is a chart from RSMeans construction cost data that illustrates the cost per square foot for new construction sorted by region from the most expensive to the least expensive. price per square foot construction cost for medical office building. The chart shows a significant spread in cost per square foot by geographic location â€“ as much as 74% increase from the lowest (Winston-Salem) to the highest (New York). The average cost per square foot hovers around $220 per square foot.
