In the example, you would multiply .30 by 100 which equals 30. This tells you that consuming one serving of the snack will give you 30 percent of the daily recommended value for calcium. Knowing the percent daily values for nutrients in your food products helps you to choose foods that provide for a well-balanced diet. The nutrition label found on your food products provides you with the percent daily value of several nutrients when you consume one serving.

Typically, a healthy diet for the average person is composed of about 50 percent carbohydrate, 20 percent protein, and 30 percent fat. To break this down into calories, 50 percent of 1600 is 800 calories carbohydrates, 20 percent is 320 calories, and 30 percent is about 480 calories.
The daily allowance for protein is .5 pound, lysine 9 g, Ca 16 g, and P 14.5 g. This allowance can be met by feeding 4 pounds of a 14 percent crude protein diet per day. During the summer, feed intake may be reduced to about 3.5 lb per head per day. In this case, the protein in the diet must be increased to about 16 percent to meet the .5 lb per head per day requirement, assuming amino acid levels are adequate. Feeding levels lower than 4 pounds will also require an increase in the levels of minerals and vitamins to maintain proper amounts on a daily basis.
Why We Miss It: The recommended intake of potassium for adults is 4,700mg per day, but currently only 56 percent of American adults reach this goal. One big reason why is that sodium often takes the place of nutrients like potassium in processed foods like cheese, packaged meats, fast food, and pastries. Why We Miss It: Seventy-five percent of Americans consume the daily recommended intake of calcium of 1,000mg per day for adult men and women—that’s not bad! And most Americans consume their calcium through dairy and dairy byproducts.
Remember that there are 2500 calories in a pound of muscle and 3500 calories in a pound of fat. For a client to gain one pound of muscle per week, you need to make sure that every seven days they have consumed 2500 calories (average of 350 calories per day) more than they expended. .90 x 200 = 180 grams of protein per day. 180 grams x 4 calories per gram = 720 calories from protein. Fat-Learn More. Percentage of calories from fat can vary quite a bit, depending on whom you talk to.
If you consume 50 percent of your energy intake from carbs and 20 percent from protein, aim to eat 30 percent of your calories from fat, which is equivalent to 40 grams when following a 1,200-calorie weight loss diet and 53 grams of fat when consuming 1,600 calories per day. Many well-balanced, reduced-calorie diets contain about 50 percent of calories from carbohydrates, which is equivalent to 150 grams when consuming a 1,200-calorie diet, and 200 grams of carbs when following a 1,600-calorie weight loss plan.
The Institute of Medicine recommends adults consume 45 to 65 percent of their daily calories from carbohydrates. Carbs provide 4 calories per gram. Therefore, you’d need 135 to 195 grams of carbohydrates when consuming a 1,200-calorie diet, and 180 to 260 grams of carbs when following a 1,600-calorie weight loss plan. Many well-balanced, reduced-calorie diets contain about 50 percent of calories from carbohydrates, which is equivalent to 150 grams when consuming a 1,200-calorie diet, and 20
For example, if the label lists 15 percent for calcium, it means that one serving provides 15 percent of the calcium you need each day. The Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet for healthy adults. Even if your diet is higher or lower in calories, you can still use the Percent Daily Value as a guide. For example, the Percent Daily Value can help you determine whether a food is high or low in specific nutrients: 1  If a food has 5 percent or less of a nutrient, it's considered to be low in that nutrient. 2  If it has 20 percent or more, it's considered to be high in that nutrient
Using the above example, 800 calories of carbohydrates divided by 4 calories per gram equals 200 grams carbohydrates for the day. Similarly, 320 calories of protein (divided by 4) is 80 grams protein, and 480 calories of fat (divided by 9 calories per gram) is 53 grams fat daily. To break this down into calories, 50 percent of 1600 is 800 calories carbohydrates, 20 percent is 320 calories, and 30 percent is about 480 calories.
Healthy carbohydrates are in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat milk, low-fat yogurt, legumes, nuts and seeds. Protein helps increase satiety, which is beneficial for weight loss. Protein needs range from 10 to 35 percent of your daily calorie intake, according to the Institute of Medicine. Many well-balanced, reduced-calorie diets contain about 50 percent of calories from carbohydrates, which is equivalent to 150 grams when consuming a 1,200-calorie diet, and 200 grams of carbs when following a 1,600-calorie weight loss plan.
