At what temperature and for how long per pound do you cook a pork roast? My co-worker wants her daughter(13) to put the roast in the oven for her before she gets home, but she did't know at what temp and for how long to tell her to leave it in. She said it is a small 2 lb pork roast. Should take 30-45 minutes per pound, but, it all depends on the internal temperature of the pork roast, more than the amount of time. It used to be 165F but some people say that is too long or past rare; and 185F is dry and stringy.
1 Cook the pork roast in the oven on 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). 2  Cooking time will be 35 minutes per lb. (0.45kg) of meat. 3  A pork roast with the bone in will cook faster than a boneless roast. 4  It will result in a crispier surface texture with less moisture. 1 Cooking time will be 35 minutes per lb.

1 Place pork loin into oven, turning and basting with pan liquids. 2  Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. 3  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 4  Remove roast to a platter. 1 Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. 2  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). 3  Remove roast to a platter. 4  Heat the wine in the pan and stir to loosen browned bits of food on the bottom. 5  Serve with pan juices.
The rule of thumb for pork roasts is to cook them 25 minutes per pound of meat at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
3. Heat the oven to 500 degrees for a raw roast, 375 for a pre-browned one. 4. Place the roasting pan in the oven; cook for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 300 degrees. 5. Cook for about 45 minutes, then start checking the roast's temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the roast when the internal temperature, measured as deep into the roast as you can get, reads 165 degrees. 6. Should take 30-45 minutes per pound, but, it all depends on the internal temperature of the pork roast, more than the amount of time.

Pork roasts should cook for about 20 minutes per pound. However, a pork shoulder may need to cook for 30 minutes per pound depending on its size. This means for a pork roast that is 5 pounds, cooking time will be around 2 1/2 hours, as opposed to the normal cooking time of 90 minutes for other cuts of pork. Bones in a roast will speed up the cooking time. A bone acts as a heat conductor which helps to cook the meat from the inside.
Continue cooking about 50-80 minutes or until the meat registers 145 degrees on a meat thermometer. Some roasts are long and thin and others are short and fat, consequently the cooking times will vary depending on the shape of your roast. The meat thermometer is the best way to judge the right amount of cooking time. Remove the roast from the oven and set on a cutting board. Cover the meat with tin foil and let it rest for about 15 minutes before slicing it. The temperature of the roast will continue to rise about another 5 degrees.
Roast. Roasting, very similar to baking, is a method of cooking pork in the oven in a shallow, uncovered pan, and without adding liquid to the pan. Any cut of pork can be roasted, and should be roasted at 350Â° F unless otherwise noted. This chart will help you decide how long you need to roast the cut of pork you have
