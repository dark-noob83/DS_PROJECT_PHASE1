Best Answer: glittery, as it says on the Jobs page at sephora.com: If you're interested in a position at one of our Sephora USA retail stores, please apply in person at the store where you wish to work, or mail your resume and cover letter to the store.

I had an interview at Sephora and they actually were going to hire me on the spot, but then they told me that I was too young and that I had to be 18 years old due to their regulations and hygenic reasons. If I... show more I am 17, and there is a new sephora opening in my town at the end of march, and I will be 18 in two weeks after opening. They say you have to be 18, but is there a possibility they would let me in anyways, because I have a lot of experience with makeup art from fashion, to photography, fashion shows???
Sephora employees must stand at least 18 years old and possess high school diplomas or equivalent GEDs. An ability to demonstrate knowledge of current makeup application, trends, and fashions and desire to work with the public generally prove the most pressing hiring requirements. 
You have to be 18 I believe to work at Sephora and definitely so at MAC. I would recommend you having a portfolio, I only know what MAC is looking for, sorry... You need to have at least some makeup background and be able to apply and know color on someone else demonstrating skill. i'm not sure how old you gotta be to work at sephora, but i went there with no retail experience at all and they hired me, obviously. at sephora, they don't care if you don't have any background for whatever you're applying.
