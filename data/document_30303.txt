Causes and Risk Factors. Whipple's disease is an infection by the bacterium Tropheryma whippelii (T. whippelii). T. whippelii causes lesions on the lining of the small intestine which damage the villi (tiny, finger-like structures that protrude from the intestine wall and aid in nutrient absorption). Whipple's disease primarily affect men (over 80% of cases), and most commonly occurs during middle age.
When exposed to a gram stain, gram-positive bacteria retain the purple color of the stain because the structure of their cell walls traps the dye. In gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is thin and releases the dye readily when washed with an alcohol or acetone solution. Cytoplasm-The cytoplasm, or protoplasm, of bacterial cells is where the functions for cell growth, metabolism, and replication are carried out. It is a gel-like matrix composed of water, enzymes, nutrients, wastes, and gases and contains cell structures such as ribosomes, a chromosome, and plasmids.
The inflammation of Crohn's disease most commonly affects the last part of the ileum (a section of the small intestine), and often includes the large intestine (the colon). However, inflammation may also occur in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, affecting the mouth, esophagus, or stomach.
Nonencapsulated mutants of these organisms are avirulent, i.e. they don't cause disease. Cell Envelope-The cell envelope is made up of two to three layers: the interior cytoplasmic membrane, the cell wall, and -- in some species of bacteria -- an outer capsule.
The colon and how its bacteria helps digest food. The colon is a part of the digestive system it is also called the large intestine. The large intestine or colon is shorter than the small intestine but has a larger diameter. The length of the colon is approximately 5 feet long.
