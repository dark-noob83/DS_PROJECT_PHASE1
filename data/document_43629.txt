Two enantiomers of a generic amino acid that is chiral. Chirality /kaɪˈraelɪtiː/ kaɪˈrælɪtiː is a property of symmetry important in several branches of. Science the word chirality is derived from The, greek (χειρ), kheir, hand a familiar chiral. object An object or a system is chiral if it is distinguishable from its mirror image; that is, it cannot be superposed onto it. Conversely, a mirror image of an achiral object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object.
The symmetry of a molecule (or any other object) determines whether it is chiral. A molecule is achiral (not chiral) when an improper rotation, that is a combination of a rotation and a reflection in a plane, perpendicular to the axis of rotation, results in the same molecule. For tetrahedral molecules, the molecule is chiral if all four substituents are different. Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase).
Chirality is when an object is present in two forms which are mirror images of each other. The two forms cannot be superimposed. Human hands are chiral. The left hand is a mirror image of the right hand. You cannot turn or move one of your hands to look exactly the same as the other. In chemistry, chirality refers to molecules. If a molecule is chiral it has two forms that are mirror images of each other but otherwise identical. Chemists call these enantiomers or optical isomers.

Normally, when a tetrahedral atom has four different substituents it is chiral. However, in rare cases, if two of the ligands differ from each other by being mirror images of each other, the mirror image of the molecule is identical to the original, and the molecule is achiral. Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase).
Conversely, an achiral object, such as an atom, is symmetric; its mirror image is not truly opposite, but rather is indistinguishable from the original. In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called enantiomers or optical isomers.

We call that atom a chiral center, or chirality, center. When two of the groups on a carbon atom are the same, that carbon is not a chiral center. In this molecule, called 2-butanol, carbon two has four different groups: an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group. Let's compare 2-butanol to butane, where carbon 2 has two hydrogen atoms.
Chirality. A chiral molecule is a type of molecule that has a non-superposable mirror image. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an asymmetric carbon atom. The term chiral in general is used to describe an object that is not superposable on its mirror image. It is a mathematical approach to the concept of handedness. In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called enantiomers or optical isomers.
