The olfactory epithelium is a specialized epithelial tissue inside the nasal cavity that is involved in smell. In humans, it measures about 3 square centimeters (on each side) and lies on the roof of the nasal cavity about 7 cm above and behind the nostrils.
The olfactory epithelium is a specialized epithelial tissue inside the nasal cavity that is involved in smell. In humans, it measures about 1 square centimetre (on each side) and lies on the roof of the nasal cavity about 7 cm above and behind the nostrils.
The olfactory membrane is a layer of cells on the roof of the nasal cavity also called theepithelium, . It is made up of three layers, the supporting cells, the olfactor â€¦ y receptor cells, and the basal cells. Supporting cells help produce mucus.
Olfactory Membrane. The olfactory membrane, or epithelium, is a layer of cells on the roof of the nasal cavity. It is made up of three layers of cells: the supporting cells, the olfactory receptor cells, and the basal cells. Supporting cells are similar to glial cells and help produce mucus.
In humans, the olfactory epithelium is located about 7 cm up and into the nose from the nostrils. The Olfactory System. Hair cells are the receptors in the olfactory epithelium that respond to particular chemicals. These cells have small hairs called cilia on one side and an axon on the other side.
The olfactory epithelium is a layer of odor-sensitive cells located inside the depths of the nose. These cells react to odors as they enter the nose, sending signals to the olfactory bulb.
