The average age at which women in the U.S. have their first child is 25.2, according to a 2003 National Vital Statistics Report (the most recent available) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that number's in flux. In 1970, for example, the average was 21.4. This isn't breaking news: A series of social and medical advances over the past 50 years—the women's rights movement, the Pill, infertility drugs, in vitro fertilization and egg and embryo freezing—have steadily extended the age at which women can (and want to) become mothers.
So, at what age are women having their first child? The median age of mothers giving birth to their first child is roughly 28 years, two years younger than the average across all mothers. It is also important to note that this median age is based on children of the current relationship only. The median age for both childbirth and birth of first child has remained steady since 2001. About one-half of births are registered as first births. The median age of women giving birth to their second child is roughly 32 years.
For women who graduated from high school and went to some college, the average age for first birth is 24 and the average marriage age is 27; 58 percent of first births are to unwed mothers. NBC. Americans are getting married later and later. The average age of first marriage in the United States is 27 for women and 29 for men, up from 23 for women and 26 for men in 1990 and 20 and 22 (!) in 1960.
The average age of first-time mothers is increasing because more women are waiting until their 30s and 40s to start having kids and fewer women are having their first kids in their teens and 20s, the CDC report says. In 1970, only 1.7 out of 1,000 women were having their first child between the ages of 35-39 years. Since 1985, the rate of women having their first child between age 40-44 has risen steadily, though it's still far below that for women ages 35-39: CDC. Rates for all births, not just of a first child, to women over 35 have been rising over the past 20 years, while birth rates for younger women are stable or declining.
The last five years have also seen the fertility rate increase to 1.7 children per woman from 1.5. The average age of a first-time mother in 1983 was 26.9 years of age. In 2012, 29 years later, the average first-time mother was well over 29 years old. Interestingly, the average age of brides has steadily increased to 31.5 years and for grooms, to 34 years
The average age of women having their first child was a record high of 26 years old in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics Report. Since 1985, the rate of women having their first child between age 40-44 has risen steadily, though it's still far below that for women ages 35-39: CDC. Rates for all births, not just of a first child, to women over 35 have been rising over the past 20 years, while birth rates for younger women are stable or declining.
College-educated women are unlikely to have a child before getting married For college-educated women, the average age of first birth (30) has risen along with the average age of marriage (27). Only 12 percent of births by college graduates are to unmarried women. NBC. Americans are getting married later and later. The average age of first marriage in the United States is 27 for women and 29 for men, up from 23 for women and 26 for men in 1990 and 20 and 22 (!) in 1960.
The average age of first birth for this group is lower than the average marriage age. For women who dropped out of high school, the average age of first birth is 20, while the average marriage age is 25; 83 percent of first births in this demographic are to unmarried mothers. NBC. Americans are getting married later and later. The average age of first marriage in the United States is 27 for women and 29 for men, up from 23 for women and 26 for men in 1990 and 20 and 22 (!) in 1960.
The average age of first-time mothers increased by 3.6 years, from 21.4 years in 1970 to 25.0 years in 2006. While the average age for first births increased from 1970 to 2006, the increases were more dramatic during the first two decades (1970 to 1990) (Figure 1).
