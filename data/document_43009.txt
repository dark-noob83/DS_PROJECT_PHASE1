Weight Loss. The minimum a woman should consume daily is 1,200 calories, according to Medline Plus. One pound of fat equals about 3,500 calories. To lose one pound a week, a woman should reduce her calories or increase her physical activity by 500 calories a day. To lose two pounds a week, a deficit of 1,000 calories is needed. For women, those aged 19 to 25 are allowed the most calories on this chart, ranging from 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day depending on activity level. Sedentary women ages 51 and older should consume the least amount, at 1,600 a day.
Your BMR is the minimum amount of calories that your body needs on a daily basis and depends on height, weight, gender and age. For example, a 29-year-old woman who stands 5 foot 4 inches tall and weighs 180 lbs. will require approximately 1,602 calories per day. However, your exact number may differ. Plan to lose no more than 1 to 2 lbs. a week, even if your initial weight loss is a little faster in the first week or two, notes the Mayo Clinic. Creating a daily deficit of 500 calories will result in 1 lb. of weight loss over a week while a 1,000 calorie daily deficit will lead to 2 lbs. of weight loss. According to Columbia University, the minimum amount of total calories a woman can consume daily while remaining healthy is 1,200
According to the What We Eat in America report for 2009 to 2010, a woman's average daily caloric intake changes at different stages of life. In her twenties, she takes in about 1,949 calories a day, which is the highest caloric intake level of her lifetime, and this decreases to 1,831 in her thirties. Then, until she reaches age 50, she should get 2,000 calories a day and taper down to 1,800 calories a day from age 51 on. Sedentary women ages 19 to 25 need 2,000 calories a day; sedentary women ages 26 to 50 need 1,800 calories a day and sedentary women ages 51 and over need 1,600 calories a day.
For people with only a small amount of weight to lose, 1000 calories will be too much of a deficit. As a guide to minimum calorie intake, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that calorie levels never drop below 1200 calories per day for women or 1800 calories per day for men. Even these calorie levels are quite low
To maintain weight, the chart below shows you your daily calorie limit. It's based on your age, activity level, and the BMI (body-mass index) of 21.5 for women and 22.5 for men. To lose weight -- about 1 pound a week -- reduce total calories in the chart by 500 a day. To gain weight, add 500 calories per day for each pound you want to gain per week.
Women over age 51 need 1,600 calories -- for a sedentary lifestyle -- 1,800 calories for a moderately active lifestyle and up to 2,200 calories for an active lifestyle. Add 300 calories to your daily intake if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. 
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 report that active women need 2,000 to 2,400 calories per day for healthy weight maintenance. According to Harvard Medical School, active women need about 18 calories per pound of body weight. This would be approximately 2,160 calories per day for a 120-pound woman. Athletes generally have higher calorie needs. According to a study published in a 2009 edition of the “North American Journal of Sports Physical Therapy,” collegiate women swimmers consume an average of 3,229 calories per day
Sedentary women don’t participate in exercise outside of normal, day-to-day activities—such as house cleaning. Based on USDA guidelines, inactive women need about 1,600 to 2,000 calories per day for healthy weight management. To estimate a sedentary woman’s individualized calorie needs, multiply her body weight by 13. According to Harvard Medical School, active women need about 18 calories per pound of body weight. This would be approximately 2,160 calories per day for a 120-pound woman. Athletes generally have higher calorie needs.
What is easy to determine, however, is the fact that 3,500 calories equals about one pound of fat. Therefore, you have to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose one pound. For example, if you cut 500 calories from your diet every day, you would lose about one pound a week. They recommend that women should eat at least 1,200 calories per day, and men should eat at least 1,800. The reason that the metabolic rate slows with prolonged dieting of less than 1,200 calories per day is a chain reaction of physiologic responses to the stress associated with such a restricted diet.
