The second stage is the paroxysmal stage, lasting for about 1-6 weeks, and is characterized by various pathognomonic symptoms of pertussis such as episodes of paroxysmal cough with a characteristic whooping sound. The paroxysmal cough can also be associated with post-tussive cyanosis and emesis.
What are the symptoms of pertussis? Pertussis disease can be divided into three stages:Catarrhal stage: can last 1–2 weeks and includes a runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, and a mild cough (all similar symptoms to the common cold).Paroxysmal stage: usually lasts 1–6 weeks, but can persist for up to 10 weeks.
Pertussis is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. This disease has 3 stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The symptoms of the catarrhal stage are mild and may go unnoticed. The paroxysmal stage of Pertussis is characterized by episodes of coughing with a distinctive whooping sound when breathing in (inspiration). This characteristic cough gives the disease its common name, Whooping Cough.
Symptoms of pertussis usually develop within 5 to 10 days after being exposed, but sometimes not for as long as 3 weeks. Pertussis has an insidious onset with catarrhal symptoms that are indistinguishable from those of minor respiratory tract infections. The cough, which is initially intermittent, becomes paroxysmal.
