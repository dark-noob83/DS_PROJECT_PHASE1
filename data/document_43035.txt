For 18 months, the baby nurses while its mother is on land, or it swims underwater to suckle. When it dives, the calf closes its nose and ears to block out water. All hippos have this ability. They also have membranes that cover and protect their eyes while they are underwater.
Common hippos give birth underwater, while pygmy hippo calves are born on land. A pygmy hippo calf can nurse from its mother on land or underwater. A loud eater, the pygmy hippo can be heard munching from up to 150 feet (45 meters) away. Pygmy hippos were unknown to Western science until about 1840. A common or river hippo weighs about 10 times as much as a pygmy hippo.
It has been suggested that they may even be able to hold their breath for longer than an hour or two if needed. Typically when an alligator goes underwater it does so by submerging itself in the water or sinking to the bottom of the water. Afterwards they generally hold their breath and remain there for 10-15 minutes.
sloth bears-and they can close off their nostrils so no termites crawl up their nose. http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/g... Manatees also have two other special breathing adaptations. They can only breathe through their nose, and their nostrils have special flaps that close tightly when they dive. http://www.thewildones.org/Animals/manat... Beavers, manatees, and anteaters can also close their noses to keep out water or dirt. Camels live in the desert where there is a lot of sand blowing around.
Usually these creatures are able to hold their breath anywhere from 4 to 15 minutes; however they have been known to remain underwater for longer periods of time if necessary. The longest time an alligator has been known to hold its breath varies from 30 minutes to 2 hours.
