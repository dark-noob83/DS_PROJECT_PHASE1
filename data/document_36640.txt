1 Having a car radiator replaced can cost $150-$900 or more depending on the age, make and model of vehicle; the type of coolant used; whether the new radiator is made by the original vehicle manufacturer (called OEM) or is aftermarket (manufactured by another company); and where the work is done. 1 CostHelper readers who purchased a radiator online and hired a local mechanic to install it (usually with the work done in the reader's garage or driveway) report total costs of $174-$400, or an average of $259. 2  Radiator stop leak products that seal small holes are available for $5-$15
Coolant. The type and amount of coolant will affect the cost of a radiator replacement. There are many types of coolant that your car may use and they can cost between $12 to more than $25 per gallon. The quantity varies by vehicle; the 2001 Civic calls for 1 gallon and the 2004 Chevrolet 3500 diesel takes approximately 5 gallons. A basic radiator with an aluminum core and plastic tanks, as in a 2001 Honda Civic, may cost $120. A larger radiator of the same construction which also contains an internal transmission and oil cooler, as in a 2005 Chevrolet 3500 diesel, costs about $360.
The average radiator repair cost tends to be between $400 and $600. However, the cost will vary depending on the standard price of labor for automotive professionals in the area. 
Labor Cost. The labor cost of replacing a radiator depends on the shop labor time that the radiator calls for and the shop's hourly rate. A 2002 GMC Yukon radiator calls for 1.6 hours of labor while a 2006 Audi A6 calls for 3.4 hours. Assuming a shop labor rate of $100 per hour the GMC would be $160 and the Audi would be $340. A basic radiator with an aluminum core and plastic tanks, as in a 2001 Honda Civic, may cost $120. A larger radiator of the same construction which also contains an internal transmission and oil cooler, as in a 2005 Chevrolet 3500 diesel, costs about $360.

However, the average cost of a radiator is in the neighborhood of $150 to $200 depending on the model. By the time you factor in the coolant, the hoses (if applicable), and the time it takes to burp the system, you could be in the neighborhood of $400 to $600. Most coolant hoses are not that expensive ($20 to $40 on average, though some longer hoses can climb up to $70), and it’s better to replace them while they’re already halfway off than to have one fail while you’re driving.
