Several foods have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) without having an impact on HDL (see Cholesterol Lowering Food). When looking for foods that raise HDL (good cholesterol), however, the data is not as clear.
Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL cholesterol, is what you may know as bad cholesterol. High LDL levels can cause heart disease, hypertension and stroke. To lower your LDL levels, avoid foods with saturated fats. Having high levels of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL cholesterol, is healthy. HDL cholesterol helps remove LDL cholesterol from your blood, reducing your risk for disease.
Oatmeal, oat bran and high-fiber foods. Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. Five to 10 grams or more of soluble fiber a day decreases your total and LDL
Foods containing low density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol are animal-based and/or commercially-prepared products. LDL cholesterol, according to the American Heart Association, is found in foods containing saturated and/or trans fats.
Foods containing LDL include milk, mayonnaise, butter, eggnog, cream, hard and soft cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, ice cream and yogurt. Included in the whole fat category are products labeled as containing 2 percent fat. Egg yolks are notable for containing high amounts of cholesterol.
