A few nosebleeds stem from large vessels in the back of the nose. These nosebleeds can be dangerous. They may occur after an injury. This type of nosebleed is more common in the elderly and is often due to high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, daily aspirin use or bleeding disorders.
Bleeding can occur on one, or both, sides of the nose. Your blood might flow out of your nose and/or down the back of your throat. Bleeding can last for a few seconds or a few minutes or longer and range from a few drops to a rapid flow. Nosebleeds usually stop when a blood clot forms. The blood clot is loosely attached to the mucous membranes.
The nose is a part of the body that is very rich in blood vessels (vascular) and is situated in a vulnerable position on the face. As a result, any trauma to the face can cause a bloody nose, and bleeding may be profuse. Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out, crust, and crack, as is common in dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is dry and warm from household heaters.
Trauma to the outside of the nose, such as a blow to the face, or trauma inside the nose, such as nose picking or repeated irritation from a cold, can cause a nosebleed. Less commonly, an underlying disease process, such as an inability of the blood to clot, may contribute to the bleeding.
Inability of the blood to clot is most often due to blood-thinning drugs such as warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin. Liver disease can also interfere with blood clotting. Abnormal blood vessels or cancers in the nose are rare causes of nosebleeds.
