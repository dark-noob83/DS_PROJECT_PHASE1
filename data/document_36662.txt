A chloroplast is one of three types of plastids, characterized by its high concentration of chlorophyll (the other two types, the leucoplast and the chromoplast, contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis). In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack rubisco, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store CO 2 in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called C4 photosynthesis.

Our cells have mitochondria (Greek mitos = thread, and khondrion = little granule), our energy-producing structures. We don't have any
In summary, the chloroplast is an important plant cell structure and the site of photosynthesis, which converts energy from sunlight into food. The chloroplast contains chlorophyll within its thylakoids, which absorbs light energy and gives chloroplasts its green color. In this lesson, we'll explore the parts of the chloroplast, such as the thylakoids and stroma, that make a chloroplast the perfect place for conducting photosynthesis in plant cells.
The sketch of the chloroplast above was made from an electron micrograph of a chloroplast from a higher order plant (Levy). Plants use energy from the sun in tiny energy factories called chloroplasts. The green color of leaves is attributable largely to these chloroplasts because they contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis.
Inside the chloroplasts are stacks of discs called thylakoids. They are compared to stacks of coins within the walls of the chloroplast, and they act to trap the energy from sunlight. The stacks of thylakoids are called grana. They are connected with an extensive sytem of tubules. The thylakoid membranes contain chlorophyll and other pigments arranged in antenna arrays to capture light energy for two photosystems called Photosystem I and Photosystem II. Plants use energy from the sun in tiny energy factories called chloroplasts. The green color of leaves is attributable largely to these chloroplasts because they contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis.
The thylakoids are surrounded by the stroma, or the inner liquid portion of the chloroplast. Both the stroma and the thylakoids contain important molecules for photosynthesis. Thylakoids are often stacked on top of each other-they look like a stack of flapjacks. In this lesson, we'll explore the parts of the chloroplast, such as the thylakoids and stroma, that make a chloroplast the perfect place for conducting photosynthesis in plant cells.

A thylakoid is a membrane-bound compartment inside chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. They are the site of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Thylakoids consist of a thylakoid membrane surrounding a thylakoid lumen. Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as grana (singular: granum). In higher plants thylakoids are organized into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A granum (plural grana) is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergrana thylakoids or lamellae
Grana, or singular 'granum,' are stacks of thylakoids within chloroplasts. The thylakoids contain numerous integral and peripheral membrane proteins as well as chemicals important to photosynthesis. In this lesson, we'll explore the parts of the chloroplast, such as the thylakoids and stroma, that make a chloroplast the perfect place for conducting photosynthesis in plant cells.
