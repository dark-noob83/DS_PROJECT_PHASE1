The average price to cover 200 square feet with a spray foam insulation kit will run between $300 and $600 (about two to three kits). Inside spray foam kits is something called Icynene, a foam made from two liquids that are heated and pushed through a gun on the can. Since spray foam takes up less space than other types of insulation -- fiberglass or blown-in insulation, for example -- you can change its thickness to meet the requirements of the application space. The average thickness of spray foam is three inches, but it can be made deeper if needed.
@ $2.60/sq. ft. This amounts to $6,240 for 3 spray on foam with an R value of approximately 20-21. 2X4 inch walls with 16 Bats has R of 11. Cost for insulation is $0.38/sq. ft for material plus installation, which you can do yourself. Cost for same area with bats is $912.00. It cost me right at 5k for the walls on a 2400 sq ft house. Walls were 9 ft and that included rim joists.This was poly foam at 3 inches thick.I also used one inch sheeting on the outside for a total of 4 inches of foam. We used blown in fiberglass in the attic 15
1 The cost of spray foam insulation is usually expressed per board foot, which is a measure of volume (not linear feet). 2  1 board foot is equal to 144 cubic inches, or a board that measures 1 foot long and 1 foot wide and 1 inch thick. 3  Open-cell spray foam costs $.40 to $.70 per board foot. Spray Foam Insulation Prices. While the function of spray foam insulation—to keep buildings warm during cold weather and cool during warm weather—is the same as traditional pink fiberglass insulation, that’s where the similarities between the two materials end.
1 Open-cell spray foam costs $.40 to $.70 per board foot. 2  Closed-cell spray foam costs $.75 to $1 per board foot. 3  Expressed in terms of square feet, spray foam installation cost is $1.50 to $3.00 per square foot (for an average-sized home between 2,000 to 2,500 square feet, that’s a total cost of $3,000 to $7,500. Spray Foam Insulation Prices. While the function of spray foam insulation—to keep buildings warm during cold weather and cool during warm weather—is the same as traditional pink fiberglass insulation, that’s where the similarities between the two materials end.
For a general sense of what spray foam insulation costs, if you choose a light density product the cost can be roughly about $0.44 to $0.65 per board foot while opting for a closed-cell insulation product can cost roughly $0.70 to $1 per board foot. Again, these costs should be regarded as a guide only. As with most building products, the cost of spray foam insulation will be influenced by variables such as quantity, labor, type and region. Think about how the price of a car is influenced by the options, model and make you choose
