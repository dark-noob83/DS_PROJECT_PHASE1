People with tree pollen allergies sometimes assume that trees with colorful flowers -- like apple or cherry trees -- will trigger symptoms. In fact, flowering trees usually have bigger, stickier pollen that doesn't blow in the wind or cause symptoms.
Tree pollen is one of the more common causes of allergy symptoms, particularly in spring. The majority of trees release their pollen in late winter or early spring. Tree pollens that trigger allergies in people are usually very powdery and fine. The wind has the ability to carry tree pollens for miles.
While pine tree allergy is relatively uncommon, there are two main allergens of concern that come from pine trees: pine nuts and pine pollen. Pine nuts (pignoli) are the edible seeds of certain species of pine trees, and are used in a variety of foods, including Italian pesto.
For many people with allergies, this yellow pollen is the cause of all their sinus and nasal misery triggering bouts of sneezing, sniffling, water eyes, etc. However, this yellow pollen produced by pine trees is NOT a significant allergy trigger. When it comes to allergy, the biggest culprits are the pollen you can not see. Such springtime microscopic pollen that IS the culprit for allergies come from trees (non-pine) and grasses. So don't demonize the yellow pollen!
Tree pollen is the first type of pollen released in the spring. In the south, tree pollen can be released as early as January. In the far northern states, it is not usually found in the air until June.
Yellow Pollen. Yellow pollen is a highly visible tree pollen. It can easily be seen on trees, and often rises in a cloud when a tree is shaken. Yellow pollen is produced by evergreen trees, primarily pine trees, including spruce, true cedar trees, fir trees, larch and hemlock. Although yellow pollen looks like it could cause an allergic reaction, in reality it does not trigger allergy symptoms at all. It can stain the skin and clothing, however.
