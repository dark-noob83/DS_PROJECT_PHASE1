So one of the best indicators that the alternator is charging it, is verifying that battery voltage should be at 2 Volts over battery voltage (at rest) when the engine is running. CASE 2: The multimeter DID NOT maintain a 13.5 to 14.5 Volts value: This usually means that the alternator is BAD. 
4) check the battery Voltage. *** The Battery voltage Should read between about 13.8 to 14.2 volts. (Possibly up to 14.5 Volts.) 5) Increase motor speed to about 1500 RPM. The Alternator should now produce a battery voltage between 14.2 and 14.6 Volts. *** If it is Lower than 14.2 volts, the Alternator probably has one or more Bad Diodes. 6) Now, Maintain the 1500 RPM and Turn off the Headlights.
You should connect the voltmeter to the battery as before but not the charging voltage and this should be done after charging the battery or jump starting the car. 13.5 to 14.5 or more volts at idle should be produced by a charging system that operates normally. The alternator may not be putting out enough current to keep the battery charged if the charging voltage is less than 13.5 volts. Make sure the alternator is tested (can be tested at an auto parts store).
In this case the battery charging voltage is 14.61 volts with the engine at high idle. 14.4 volts is the gassing threshold. The battery above will slightly gas, but not enough to be harmful, and the battery will get a quick full charge recovery after starting. Since a 12 volt battery has six cells, any 12 volt lead-acid battery needs at least 13.8 volts to start to charge. This voltage will be enough to fully charge or maintain the battery on a trickle charge, but charging time will be very long at 13.8 volts. To fully charge in reasonable times, alternator output must be 14.2 V to 14.5 V as measured right across the battery posts. Above 14.5 volts charging voltage, batteries have a greatly increased tendency to release excessive acidic vapors, hydrogen gas, and to corrode things around the battery
A fully charged car battery has 12.6 volts. There is a very big difference when a car battery voltage drops even a small amount of voltage. When a car drops, for instance, from 12.6 to 12.0, there will be 75% difference. Its power drops from 100% to 25%. At 12.4 volts, a car battery is 75% charged while at 12.2 volts its 50% charged. Consider your car battery charged at 12.4 volts or higher and discharged at 12.39 volts or less. It is important that you first check the battery plus the charging system output (alternator). The alternator may not be putting out enough current to keep the battery charged if the charging voltage is less than 13.5 volts. Make sure the alternator is tested (can be tested at an auto parts store).
Best Answer: A new, fully charged lead/acid battery produces 2.1 volts per cell which means a new, fully charged battery should show voltage of 12.6 volts at the terminals with nothing on. An alternator is NOT designed to recharge a dead or discharged battery. 
To charge the battery, the alternator voltage output has to exceed a minimum charging voltage. This minimum charging voltage is 13.8 volts dc across the battery terminals, or at the output of the alternator. A single lead-acid cell starts to charge at anything over 2.25 volts. Since a 12 volt battery has six cells, any 12 volt lead-acid battery needs at least 13.8 volts to start to charge. This voltage will be enough to fully charge or maintain the battery on a trickle charge, but charging time will be very long at 13.8 volts. To fully charge in reasonable times, alternator output must be 14.2 V to 14.5 V as measured right across the battery posts. Above 14.5 volts charging voltage, batteries have a greatly increased tendency to release excessive acidic vapors, hydrogen gas, and to corrode things around the battery
You will have to check it with a digital voltmeter. When an alternator is charging, depending on the level of charge of the battery, it will produce from 14 volts for a fully charged battery to 15 volts for a partially charged battery. When the battery is fully charged and the engine is OFF, the nominal voltage across the battery is approx 12.6 volts. With the engine running (above 1000 RPM) it should be 14 - 14.6 volts.
Gordon B has it dead on. Each cell in the battery when fully charged produces 2.1 Volts. Multiply that by six, and a fully charged battery produces 12.6 volts. When the alternator is charging, depending on the state of charge for the battery, at approximately 1500 RPM, the voltage should be 14.5 to 14.9 Volts. When the battery is fully charged and the engine is OFF, the nominal voltage across the battery is approx 12.6 volts. With the engine running (above 1000 RPM) it should be 14 - 14.6 volts.
