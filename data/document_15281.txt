Normal Levels. Normal hemoglobin levels for women range from 12 to 15.5 g of hemoglobin per deciliter of blood. Hemoglobin levels below 12 g/dL for non-pregnant women and 11 g/dL for pregnant women are a sign of iron deficiency, according to the National Anemia Action Council.
1 Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 2  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 3  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 4  Ferritin.
An iron serum level of 170 micrograms per deciliter is the upper limit of normal for women, whereas just under 200 micrograms per deciliter is the healthy limit for most men. Iron levels beyond this range typically indicate some health condition such as hepatitis, a blood infection or a vitamin B-12 or B-6 deficiency.

Healthy or normal serum iron values depend on your gender. Normal serum levels for men range from 76 to 198 micrograms of iron per deciliter. Normal levels for women are a little lower and range from 26 to 170 micrograms of iron per deciliter. Blood tests used to examine iron levels are usually taken in the morning because thatâ€™s when levels tend to be highest.
