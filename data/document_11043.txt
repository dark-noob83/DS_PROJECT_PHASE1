Electrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacturing of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems, and power generation equipment. The work of electrical engineers and electronics engineers is often similar. Both use engineering and design software and equipment to do engineering tasks. Both types of engineers also must work with other engineers to discuss existing products and possibilities for engineering projects.
Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering / Master of Science (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of Engineering Management, a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an Engineering Doctorate (Eng.D.), or an Engineer's degree.
by admin on. Electric engineers are the professionals that deal with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. They work on the development of new and advanced products that are powered by electricity or produce electricity. They usually work on a project which can be anything related to electricity like medical technology, gaming systems, cellular phones, robots, cars, airline navigation systems. Now the branch includes various topics like electronics, power, control systems, telecommunication and signal processing. Electrical engineers work in labs, offices or in industries. They start a project by deciding the purpose of the new electronics as in what it will do. Next they work on the circuit and wiring of the product. Computers are of great help in working out the circuit
Building power system designing is also done by electrical engineers. They work with the architects to plan the power supply and communication distribution network in a building. Medium Scale Projects: Commercial products like blender, cell phones, video games, air conditioner, batteries are medium scale projects.

An electrical engineer focuses on designing, maintaining and improving products that are powered by or produce electricity. Sometimes, an electrical engineer will dedicate his or her time to a single electrical product or type of product, such as motors, generators, wiring or communications systems. He or she often will design, assemble and test new devices. I am an electrical engineer and I have not found many jobs in our field. People think we also write code. People are so dumb. They do not have any clue that there is a big difference between science and engineering.
Electrical engineers study and apply the physics and mathematics of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism to both large and small scale systems to process information and transmit energy. To do this, electrical engineers design computers, electronic devices, communication systems, test equipment, and improve systems through problem solving techniques.
Electrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacturing of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems, or power generation equipment. Electrical engineers also design the electrical systems of automobiles and aircraft. Electronics engineers design and develop electronic equipment, such as broadcast and communications systems, from portable music players to global positioning systems (GPS). Many also work in areas closely related to computer hardware. The work of electrical engineers and electronics engineers is often similar. Both use engineering and design software and equipment to do engineering tasks. Both types of engineers also must work with other engineers to discuss existing products and possibilities for engineering projects.
An electrical engineer focuses on designing, maintaining and improving products that are powered by or produce electricity. An electrical engineer might design and oversee the implementation of a new power generator. I am an electrical engineer and I have not found many jobs in our field. People think we also write code.

Electrical engineers design, develop, test and supervise the manufacturing of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems and power generation equipment, states the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is the branch of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity. Electrical engineers work on a wide range of components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge power station generators. Early experiments with electricity included primitive batteries and static charges.
