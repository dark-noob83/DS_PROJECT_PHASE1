Best Answer: All breeds of domestic dog are the same species. However, opinion varies on whether they are a species in their own right, Canis familiaris, or a subspecies of the grey wolf, Canis lupus, which is their ancestor (this would make dogs Canis lupus familiaris). It's worth considering the following points: dogs and wolves are not genetically identical.

Classification. For years the domestic dog was classified as a species, Canis familiaris. However, recent DNA analysis shows domestic dogs evolved from wolves, Canis lupus. This led scientists to reclassify the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, a subspecies of the wolf rather than a separate species.
