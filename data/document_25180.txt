Body mass index, or BMI, is a way to help you figure out if you are at a healthy weight for your height. BMI is a number based on your weight and height. In general, the higher the number, the more body fat a person has. 10 in. tall is considered overweight (BMI is 25 to 29) if he weighs between 174 and 202 pounds, and is obese (BMI is 30 or more) if he weighs 209 pounds or more.
In this article. Your BMI is based on your height and weight. It's one way to see if you're at a healthy weight. Underweight: Your BMI is less than 18.5. Healthy weight: Your BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. Overweight: Your BMI is 25 to 29.9. Obese: Your BMI is 30 or higher. The chart below shows examples of body mass indexes. The figure at which your height corresponds with your weight is your body mass index. 
An obese person has accumulated so much body fat that it might have a negative effect on their health. If a person's bodyweight is at least 20% higher than it should be, he or she is considered obese. If your Body Mass Index (BMI) is between 25 and 29.9 you are considered overweight. If your BMI is 30 or over you are considered obese.
The degree to which a person is overweight is generally described by body mass index (BMI). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, thus it includes pre-obesity defined as a BMI between 25 and 30 and obesity as defined by a BMI of 30 or more. Pre obese and overweight however are often used interchangeably thus giving overweight a common definition of a BMI of between 25 -30.
The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m 2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. In 1998 a NIH report concluded that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese. In the 1990s the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that a BMI of 25 to 30 should be considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese, the standards the NIH set.
Weight that is higher than what is considered as a healthy weight for a given height is described as overweight or obese. Body Mass Index, or BMI, is used as a screening tool for overweight or obesity. 1 If your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the underweight range. 2  If your BMI is 18.5 to 24.9, it falls within the normal or healthy weight range. 3  If your BMI is 25.0 to 29.9, it falls within the overweight range. 4  If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obese range.
She is considered obese (BMI is 30 or more) if she weighs 174 pounds or more. A man who is 5 ft. 10 in. tall is considered overweight (BMI is 25 to 29) if he weighs between 174 and 202 pounds, and is obese (BMI is 30 or more) if he weighs 209 pounds or more.
1 For children, the charts of Body-Mass-Index for Age are used, where a BMI greater than the 85 th percentile is considered at risk of overweight and a BMI greater than the 95 th percentile is considered obese. (See the Boys BMI chart and Girls BMI chart for more detail). Back to the Body Mass Index calculator. First, lets discuss the current standard definitions of overweight and obesity used by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). 1  For adults, a body mass index of 25 or more is considered overweight and a BMI of 30 or mor
Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. There are criticisms of using the BMI to define obesity in individuals. One is that the BMI was designed for population studies, not individuals. Another is that body fat percentage (BFP) is a more reliable indicator of obesity than BMI: very muscular, lean (low body fat) individuals can be classified as obese using BMI, but are classified as having a normal weight using BFP. In 1998 a NIH report concluded that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese. In the 1990s the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that a BMI of 25 to 30 should be considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese, the standards the NIH set.
The terms overweight and obesity refer to body weight thatâ€™s greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. The most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight.
