A volume of 1 m 3 is equal to 1,000,000 centimeters cubed (10 6 cm 3) or 1,000,000,000 millimeters cubed (10 9 mm 3). In the opposite sense, 1 m 3 is equal to 0.000000001 kilometer cubed (10 -9 km 3). When converting between cubic meters and non-SI units of volume such as cubic inches (cu in) or cubic miles (cu mi), the linear-unit conversion factor must be cubed. For example, one meter is approximately 39.37 inches (39.37 in); therefore 1 m 3 = 39.37 3 = 6.102 x 10 4 cu in (approximately).
You can view more details on each measurement unit: meters cubed or liter. The SI derived unit for volume is the cubic meter. 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liter. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results. Use this page to learn how to convert between cubic meters and liters.

The cubic meter is the unit of volume in the International System of Units. The symbol for cubic meters is m 3. Less formally, cubic meter is sometimes abbreviated cu m. When calculating volume, it is important to realize that volume is proportional to the cube of the linear dimension.
