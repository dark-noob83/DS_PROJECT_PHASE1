Syracuse Lacrosse Welcomes Incoming Class of 18 for 2015. SYRACUSE, N.Y. Head coach John Desko announced the addition of 18 student-athletes to the Syracuse men's lacrosse program on Thursday, Sept. 11. This year's incoming class features 13 freshmen. The rookie crop is ranked 17th in Inside Lacrosse's list of the top 20 recruiting classes and features two players No. 58 Austin Fusco (Yorktown Heights, N.Y.) and No. 60 Brad McKinney (Watertown, N.Y.) ranked in the magazine's Power 100.
With St. John's on the horizon, it would be hard to imagine that Syracuse will relinquish that number one position. In terms of other top-10 matchups, the biggest game for next week is Notre Dame at Denver. The Syracuse Orange moved up to the number one spot today after pulling off a very convincing win over Virginia this weekend. Syracuse earned 15 first place votes in the media poll while UNC had seven and Notre Dame two.

But to date, the NCAA does not officially recognize USILA lacrosse records. Several USILA era lacrosse records, nonetheless, have been included below.
Like with the last two games, I have feelings of smoke and mirrors with Syracuse, but not as strongly as I felt with Virginia and Ohio State. Those two were solely based on scheduling. Syracuse is something else entirely. With the #2-ranked strength of schedule by Laxpower, Syracuse has no problem in that department. Syracuse would go on to win 19-7 but the game was essentially over by the end of the first quarter. And Duke won the whole thing last season! Yikes. On attack, outside of Notre Dame, Denver and maybe Albany, Syracuse has one of the best attack units in the country. Leading the way are Kevin Rice (15g, 20a), Dylan Donohue (20g, 11a) and Randy Staats (15g, 11a). This trio lights up the scoreboard as well as any top-flight attack uni
