The KY Derby is 1.25 miles and 2:00 goes into an hour 30 times; so multiplying 1.25 by 30 = 37.5 mph. For a short burst a race horse can go faster than that; but that was the easiest computation I could think of using the well known Fastest 2:00 in sports. Edited. 
Horse Speeds and Gaits. A horse's walk is a basic four beat gait. The walk is the slowest gait. A trot is the next speed up from walk, it is a two beat gait where the horses front and back legs move in sync. The trot is the equine equivalent to jogging, and is in fact referred to as a jog in some disciplines. The canter, also called lope, is a three beat gait that is faster than trot but not a full gallop. A gallop, which is what race horses are doing on the race track, is the fastest gait. It is a four beat gait. This is the gait that should be referred to as running.
The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about 4 miles per hour (6.4 km/h). When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will alternate between having three or two feet on the ground. The average speed of a canter is 16–27 km/h (10–17 mph), depending on the length of the stride of the horse. Listening to a horse canter, one can usually hear the three beats as though a drum had been struck three times in succession. Then there is a rest, and immediately afterwards the three-beat occurs again.
The gallop averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph). The world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is 88 kilometres per hour (55 mph). Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot. 
The fastest thoroughbreds average nearly 40mph! And an average thoroughbred runs about 36 mph. The world record for a Thoroughbred racehorse's average speed over a mile is 43 miles per hour...but their spurts of speed can be slightly faster. Converted to kilometers per hour that equals 69.2km/h. In the '73 Belmont, it was estimated that Secretariat hit 55 mph down the stretch. The average top speed of a Thoroughbred racing horse is 63 kph (39 mph). This average for quarter horses is much faster: about 81 kph (50 mph).
The Guinness Book of Records reports that the fastest speed of a racehorse ever reported was approximately 70.76 kilometers (43.97 miles) per hour and was achieved by the horse Winning Brew at the 2008 Penn National Race Course at Grantville, over a distance of 402 meters. There are five main gaits, or ways in which a horse can move; these are called walking, trotting, cantering, galloping and backing. The average speed at which a horse gallops is approximately 48.2 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, but the top speed reported is considerably higher.
The average speed for a horse is around 40 miles, which is about 64 kilometers an hour. Horses are pretty fast creatures and can got pretty far in an hour, that is without any weigt from a person :). The top speed for a horse is the gallop, which can reach as fast as 45 mph in a Thoroughbred in top condition. Quarter Horses have been known to sprint up to 55mph for a VERY short time. An avergae gallop is 35mph. A racehorse (Thouroghbredor TB) can run up to 45mph
A horse can run at speeds of up to around 27-40mph which is about 43.5-64.4km/h. The fastest speed a race horse had been recorded at a speed 43.97mph which is about 70.76km/h. The size of the horse is depends on the horses breed and diet. There are many breeds from the small miniature horse to the large draft horses. The smallest miniature horse was around 0.43 meters tall which is about 1.41 feet tall. As for weight, the small miniature horse weighed around 26kg which is about 57 pounds. The largest horse was a shire horse which is a type of draft horse. This large shire horse was 2.2 meters tall which is about 7.2
