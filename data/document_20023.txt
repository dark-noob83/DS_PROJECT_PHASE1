One for the price of the item and a separate fee for shipping. The FVF for shipping was 11.24%, That is a huge fee and I was in shock! This is a fee increase for every seller on eBay except those who are already including shipping in their pricing. This additional fee will now become the cost of shipping all items on eBay where shipping is a separate charge.
Enter the terrible new idea called the FVF (Final Value Fee) on shipping: Eventually eBay came up with the idea of charging a FVF on shipping charges in addition to a separate FVF for the ending price of each item.
For example, if you sell an item for $20 and charge $4 for shipping, your Paypal fee will be $1.02 (3% of $24 is $0.72 plus the automatic $0.30). When you are selling items with a low value, that automatic 30 cents can really hurt! I am not trying to bash Paypal, I actually only take Paypal, I just want you to be aware.
Final value fee. If the item sells, you're charged a final value fee. Final value fees are calculated based on the total amount of the sale and are charged per item. The total amount of the sale is the final price of the item, shipping charges, and any other amounts you may charge the buyer. Sales tax is not included.
When ebay started charging fvf's on ship fees, they also dropped the fvf percentage a few points to cover the difference. At that time, the top % of FVF's was 13%...which was dropped to 11%...and is now 10%.
