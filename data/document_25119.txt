How much do you have to weigh to donate blood? The minimum weight for donating whole blood is 110 lbs. There is no maximum limit. If you are female and donating double red blood cells, you must be 5 5 tall and weigh 150 lbs. if you are a male and donating double red blood cells, you must be 5 1 tall and weigh 130 lbs.
You must be at least 17 years old to donate to the general blood supply, or 16 years old with parental/guardian consent, if allowed by state law. Learn more about the reasons for a lower age limit.
To ensure the safety of blood donation for both donors and recipients, all volunteer blood donors must be evaluated to determine their eligibility to give blood. The final determination will be made on the day of the donation at the blood drive or blood donation center. If you were deferred from donating in the past, you may be able to donate again. Please call 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) for more information.
Individuals who want to donate whole blood or apheresis must be : At least 16 years old (donors under the age of 17 may only donate whole blood, and must have a signed parental/guardian consent form). At least 19 years old and weigh a minimum of 110 pounds. Greater than or equal to (age 18 and younger): 5' tall if you are male. 5' 6 tall if you are female.
Weight is a good guideline for blood volume in people of average build. This is why we set a minimum weight limit of 7st 12lbs (50 kg) because if more than 13% of blood volume is taken there is more risk of the donor feeling faint after donating. People who are very overweight may not be allowed to give blood for their own safety.
