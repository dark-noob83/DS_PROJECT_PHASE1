Each passenger who pays for a hold bag can take up to 20kg of luggage. This weight allowance applies to the passenger rather than to the bag so purchasing extra bags is possible but will not increase the weight allowance.
Hold luggage. Each item you check-in as hold luggage has to be under a certain size and weight. Its total size has to be under 275cm (to find this out simply add its length + width + height) and a standard weight of 20kg per bag, except for sporting and medical equipment.
Carry-on Allowance. Each EasyJet passenger is allowed one item of cabin baggage. If the baggage is no larger than 50 x 40 x 20 cm then it is guaranteed to travel with you in the cabin.

Remember, although there is a charge for each hold item, it's always cheaper to book hold luggage online than at the airport. Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/easyJet.
EasyJet has announced plans to scrap its guaranteed cabin baggage policy meaning more passengers could see their luggage taken off them and placed in the hold. The current rules mean that if the bag measures 50x40x20cms or less it is guaranteed to travel in the cabin.
If your cabin bag is larger than the maximum cabin bag size (56 x 45 x 25cm including handles and wheels) the Bag Drop desk will ask you to check the bag into the aircraft hold and a charge of Â£30.00 will apply.
There's no weight limit for hand-luggage-pack right, and you might be able to take more than you think. Like other budget airlines, Easyjet is pretty strict with its hand luggage policy in terms of the size of your bag-its maximum allowed bag is no more than 56 x 45 x 25cm. But crucially there's no weight limit.
