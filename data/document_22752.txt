Inhalation vs Exhalation. Respiration is the process of exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide between the cells of the body and external environment. According to physiology of the respiratory system, the process of respiration can be divided into two types; cellular respiration and external respiration.
The diaphragm also contracts to extend the cavity further downwards. Due to the function of the pleural membrane, the size of the lungs is increased which, in turn, creates an area of lower air pressure inside the lungs; hence, air is drawn into the lungs. Exhalation is the process of expelling air out of
Due to the pressure gradient between the atmosphere and thoracic cavity, air moves into lungs via trachea. When the air pressure equalizes, the inhalation stops. Exhalation. Exhalation is the process of moving out of air from the lung to the outer atmosphere during ventilation.
Confidence votes 352. Inhalation is the process of taking air into the lungs. For this to occur, the air pressure inside the lungs must be lower than that of the external atmosphere as air flows from areas of higher pressure to lower pressure.
During the process of exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscle relax, causing thoracic cavity to decrease in size. It eventually creates a high pressure in the lung due to the reduction of volume and thus the resulted pressure gradient causes air to move out from the lungs through the trachea to atmosphere.
Holonyms (exhalation is a part of...): breathing; external respiration; respiration; ventilation (the bodily process of inhalation and exhalation; the process of taking in oxygen from inhaled air and releasing carbon dioxide by exhalation).
