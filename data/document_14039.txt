Chat: Kronos does not work well on Windows 8 or Internet Explorer 11. Windows 8 has Internet Explorer 11 integrated into its operating system. Therefore it cannot be uninstalled and downgraded to a previous version of Internet Explorer. It can only be upgraded when later versions are available. So I configured Internet Explorer to use compatibility settings for the KRONOS website.
To see which edition of Internet Explorer you're using. Open Internet Explorer, and then do one of the following: In Internet Explorer 8, click the Help menu, and then click About Internet Explorer. In Internet Explorer 9, click the Tools button, and then click About Internet Explorer. If you're using the 64-bit edition of Internet Explorer, 64-bit Edition will appear to the right of the version number.
Report a problem in the immersive browser. On the Start screen, tap or click Internet Explorer to open Internet Explorer. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Settings.(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click Settings.).
Something's Broken. Each time I get on Facebook, a comment quickly comes up that says Internet Explorer has stopped working. The internet is working fine, but it blocks me from seeing anything on facebook. The same thing happens with my daughter on this computer, but not on hers. by Gay Nell Royea.
Facebook not working in Internet Explorer. Like the title says... I can't connect to Facebook on IE anymore. Almost* every other site works too, and Facebook works just perfectly in Firefox. I've already reset my router because that was the solution for a similar problem months ago, but it didn't help.
