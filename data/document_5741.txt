I agree that your gift should not depend on how much it cost the couple. We had about 100 guests at our wedding and I would say the average gift we received was between $100 and $150 (closer family and friends gave more). For weddings we’ve attended we give at $100 (generally if one of us was in the wedding)or more depending on how close we are to the couple. I’m really shocked to hear so many people say $200 or more is an appropriate gift for a wedding. We didn’t receive any gifts more than $150 at our wedding. Granted it was 5 years ago but $75 – $150 was the range not anywhere near $200. You shouldn’t expect to recoup costs for y
What guests spend can also vary significantly by location or region. You can use the above as a guideline, but customs in your family or area may be higher or lower. I can share that the average amount spent on a wedding gift in 2014 through RegistryFinder.com was $120. If you choose to buy from the couple's wedding registry, we recommend purchasing early, so you have the best selection of gifts and price ranges. We just don't know how much we are expected to spend on a wedding gift. Unfortunately, there's no simple answer and no set amount you should spend (or amount you should give if gifting cash). The amount you spend is dependent upon your budget and relationship with the wedding couple (or their parents).
Not only is the cost of a wedding soaring — couples spent an average of $30,000 in 2013, according to TheKnot.com, up from $28,000 the year before and the highest level since 2008 — but wedding guests are spending more than ever, as well. The majority of wedding guests who are friends of the bride and groom spent less than $100 for a gift, according to a 2010 survey by TheKnot.com. Relatives shelled out an average of $146 on wedding gifts and were twice as likely to spend more than $100 compared with friends of the couple.
If you're attending a relative or a friend's wedding, the wedding website suggests somewhere between $100 and $125. TheKnot.com also took the pulse of what real brides and grooms have spent on weddings in the past in its registry study. On average, friends spend $79 on the bride and groom's present, said Miles. Family members, meanwhile, spend an average of $146. Hill says, though, overall wedding guests should assess their budget and how well they know the bride and groom. On average the typical cash gift is around $150, she says. Still, though, Hill says there are some exceptions. Some people don't think that's [giving money] a great idea, Hill said.
According to the American Express survey, the average wedding gift is $144 for a family member and $97 for a close friend. More affluent wedding guests give an average wedding gift worth $251 for any wedding they attend, while co-workers come in at the low end of the scale at an average of $66. Not surprisingly, the more removed a wedding guest is from the bride and groom, the smaller their wedding gift tends to be. If you are going to attend, I suggest that you take the high road to avoid future conflict. The average wedding gift for a family member is around $150 per person – so something in the order of $200 – $400 for the both of you would be reasonable – depending on the venue and style of the wedding.

Couples spent an average $220 per guest at weddings in 2013, according to TheKnot.com, including $66 on food alone. But all of our experts agreed that basing the cost of your gift on how much you think the couple is spending on food and entertainment is an antiquated notion. The majority of wedding guests who are friends of the bride and groom spent less than $100 for a gift, according to a 2010 survey by TheKnot.com.

Wedding planner Lynzie Kent says a general rule is to give a gift that at least covers the cost of your reception dinner. It used to be $100 a head is kind of the going rate, but these days I think it's anywhere between $150 and $250 per person, Kent told CTVNews.ca.
I'm from Chicago. A typical wedding gift is $100 per person ($200 per couple). You'll give more if you're better off or if the bride or groom is family. This is also in addition to any shower or other gifts. Of course, not everybody gives the same amount. So, normally each person will give about $100 ($200 for a couple), but, if someone is still in school, they tend to give only $50. If a person is apart of the wedding party or a really good friend, they tend to give more, though.
Andrews Sunkel said one of the most common questions she's asked is how much cash to give, and she believes it should be based on your relationship with the couple, and what you're comfortable with. But when really pressed for a dollar figure, she said between $100 and $150 per person is appropriate. It used to be $100 a head is kind of the going rate, but these days I think it's anywhere between $150 and $250 per person, Kent told CTVNews.ca.
