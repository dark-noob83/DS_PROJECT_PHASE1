First, both parties may consent to the divorce after 90 days from when the complaint was filed and served. This is referred to as a 90-day mutual consent divorce. Alternatively, if one party won't consent, the other party can move forward after the parties have been separated for two years. This is referred to as a 2-year separation divorce.
The cost of divorce after 2 years separation will be considerably cheaper if you can do it with mutual consent and avoid lawyers fees. The court filing fee is currently Â£410 unless you are on low income or certain benefits.
After two years you can submit an affidavit of separation with the court. You would need to serve a copy of that affidavit on your wife along with a counteraffidavit allowing her to object and 20 days notice. If no objection is received within the 20 days you can file a praecipe to transmit for a grounds order.
You also have to give the addresses at which you have lived since the date of separation given in the divorce petition and then swear a statement of truth. We can give you advice as to whether or not your situation is suitable for a divorce on the fact you have been separated for 2 years with the consent of your spouse. Please call 01793 384 029 for free advice as to whether you can divorce on 2 year separation grounds. Last edited: Sep 15, 2015. Mark Keenan, Jan 9, 2013.
If you file for a no-fault divorce in Pennsylvania, you can get a divorce in six months if you and your spouse are in agreement. However, if the two of you disagree, you must wait at least two years from the date you and your spouse separated. After the two-year waiting period, you can ask the court to grant a divorce.
A two-year separation divorce: This is also a no-fault divorce. If one of the parties refuses to sign an affidavit consenting to the divorce, the other party can wait until the parties have been separated for two years.
