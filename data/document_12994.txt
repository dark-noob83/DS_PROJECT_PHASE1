Evacuation Soviet authorities started evacuating people from the area around Chernobyl within 36 hours of the accident. The Chernobyl accident: What happened. Reactor Four at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant began to fail in the early hours of 26 April, 1986. Seven seconds after the operators activated the 20-second shut down system, there was a power surge. The chemical explosions that followed were so powerful that they blew the 1,000 ton cover off the top of the reactor.
On April 26, 1986, the world’s worst nuclear accident happened at the Chernobyl plant near Pripyat, Ukraine, in the Soviet Union. An explosion and fire in the No. 4 reactor sent radioactivity into the atmosphere.
At the time of the accident--April 26, 1986--the Chernobyl nuclear power station consisted of four operating 1,000-megawatt power reactors sited along the banks of the Pripyat River, about sixty miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine, the fertile grain-producing region of the southwestern USSR.

Chernobyl in 1999: Human error was a major factor Reactor Four at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant began to fail in the early hours of 26 April, 1986. Seven seconds after the operators activated the 20-second shut down system, there was a power surge. The chemical explosions that followed were so powerful that they blew the 1,000 ton cover off the top of the reactor.
Chernobyl was a nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union. On 26 April 1986, it suffered a massive failure which caused it to spread radioactive waste across large parts … of Europe.    The accident began with a steam explosion that caused a fire, more explosions, and a subsequent nuclear meltdown.
