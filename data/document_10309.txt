1 Place the ribs in the smoker and let it go. 2  You want the good smoking temperature in the area about 200 degrees. 3  You can go lower if you plan on doing a long smoke, but I don't go higher. 4  After smoking for 2 hours.
They will be closer to room temperature by cooking time. 7. Heat your smoker to 250 degrees F. I also use an oven thermometer, placed where the rack of ribs will lay, to insure that the temperature is 250 degrees at the cooking surface.
Place the ribs in the smoker and let it go. A good smoking temperature in the area of 200 degrees. You can go lower if you plan on doing a long smoke, but I don't recommend going higher. At this rate the ribs should be cooked through and tender after 4 hours. Go longer if you can.
8. Smoke the ribs for about 5 hours, applying your mop about every 45 minutes. The thickest part of the rack of ribs should be about 170-180 degrees F if a constant temperature was maintained while smoking. During the last 30 minutes, I wrap the ribs in foil, apply my mop, and put them back on the smoker.
I have found that 250 degrees F is the ideal temperature to smoke ribs at. I use a mixture of Kingsford charcoal and mesquite wood, but other types of wood may be used including hickory, apple, cherry, pecan, etc. It just depends on what flavor you are looking for.
Cook. temperature about 200 degrees, smoke and patience. A full rack of ribs can be smoked in about 4 hours but do take the time and go the distance. The longer you smoke the more flavor you will get. I'm using a mustard rub to form a nice crust.
