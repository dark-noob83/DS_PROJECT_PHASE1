Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. Chromosomes are made up of chromatin, tangled DNA networks, that are 'super-coiled' and large enough to be seen by a microscope.
Chromosome. A chromosome is a structure that occurs within cells and that contains the cell's genetic material. That genetic material, which determines how an organism develops, is a molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). A molecule of DNA is a very long, coiled structure that contains many identifiable subunits known as genes.
Before we discuss mitosis, let’s review the structure of DNA. Chromosomes are packaged by histone proteins into a condensed structure called chromatin. The first level of packaging is represented as the “beads-on-a-string” structure. The condensed chromatin is folded and tightly coiled, like a coiled telephone cord, allowing the cell’s DNA to be packed into the nucleus.
DNA and histone proteins are packaged into structures called chromosomes. In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. Chromosomes are not visible in the cell’s nucleus—not even under a microscope—when the cell is not dividing.
