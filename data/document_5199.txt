Plasma is the watery portion of the blood on which red and white blood cells are seen. When the percentage of plasma reduces, the body shows elevated hematocrit levels. In this case, to restore normal hematocrit range, one simply has to drink adequate water. Replenishing water stores in our body is the key to decrease hematocrit levels. Hematocrit gives a general idea about red blood cell (RBC) count in the bloodstream. Hematocrit range conveys the volume of red blood cells present in blood. It tells us how much space red blood cells are occupying in a given volume of blood. Hematocrit value measures the amount of space occupied by RBCs when packed together, in a sample of blood
On the contrary in men, it is usually in the range of 41-50% . ...in Children. High Hematocrit Levels. Disturbances in normal hematocrit levels, that remain for a considerable amount of time, can be a symptom of wide range of health problems. Hematocrit gives a general idea about red blood cell (RBC) count in the bloodstream. Hematocrit range conveys the volume of red blood cells present in blood. It tells us how much space red blood cells are occupying in a given volume of blood. Hematocrit value measures the amount of space occupied by RBCs when packed together, in a sample of blood
Normal values for the hematocrit test vary according to age, sex, pregnancy, altitude where people live, and even vary slightly between various testing methods. The following are reported ranges of normal hematocrit levels: 1  Newborns: 55%-68%. 2  One (1) week of age: 47%-65%. 3  One (1) month of age: 37%-49%. 4  Three (3) months of age: 30%-36%. 5  One (1) year of age: 29%-41%. 6  Ten (10) years of age: 36%-40%.
Hematocrit (Hct) Levels. This is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood. Normal range for hematocrit is different between the sexes and is approximately 45% to 52% for men and 37% to 48% for women. This is usually measured by spinning down a sample of blood in a test tube, which causes the red blood cells to pack at the bottom of the tube
The hematocrit is the proportion, by volume, of the blood that consists of red blood cells. The hematocrit (hct) is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood. Normal range for hematocrit is different between the sexes and is approximately 45% to 52% for men and 37% to 48% for women.
A. The normal ranges for hematocrit are dependent on age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 55%-68%. 2  One (1) week of age: 47%-65%. 3  One (1) month of age: 37%-49%. 4  Three (3) months of age: 30%-36%. 5  One (1) year of age: 29%-41%. 6  Ten (10) years of age: 36%-40%.
The hematocrit (Ht or HCT, British English spelling haematocrit), also known as packed cell volume (PCV) or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF), is the volume percentage (%) of red blood cells in blood. It is normally 45% for men and 40% for women. 
The normal ranges for hematocrit are depend on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 55% to 68%. 2  One (1) week of age: 47% to 65%. 3  One (1) month of age: 37% to 49%. 4  Three (3) months of age: 30% to 36%. 5  One (1) year of age: 29% to 41%. 6  Ten (10) years of age: 36% to 40%. 7  Adult males: 42% to 54%. Higher than normal hematocrit levels represent abnormally elevated red blood cell counts. High hematocrits can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in chronic smokers. Dehydration produces a falsely high hematocrit that disappears when proper fluid balance is restored.
