On average, each federal income taxpayer in America spends $8,776 annually to keep federal welfare programs afloat. In the U.S. today,[1] there are more than 80 federal means-tested welfare programs that provide cash, food, housing, medical care, and social services to low-income residents.
The annual cost to the Federal government of these programs, according to CATO, is $668.2 billion. Add in State programs that cost $284 billion and the annual welfare costs in the country often exceeds $1 trillion dollars. Cato considered only six of the Federal programs and none of the State programs to reach their “average annual welfare benefit” number. If a welfare recipient receives $40,000 per year, that income equals $19.23 per hour for someone who works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year. An income of $19.73 per hour is 2.7 times the federal minimum wage of $7,25 per hour. Articles quantifying the total income of welfare recipients are badly needed.

Applying the same standard to means-tested welfare spending reveals that welfare will cost each household $560 per month in 2009 and $638 per month in 2010. Most of Obama's increases in welfare spending are permanent expansions of the welfare state, not temporary increases in response to the current recession. According to President Obama's budget projections, federal and state welfare spending will total $10.3 trillion over the next 10 years (FY 2009 to FY 2018). This spending will equal $250,000 for each person currently living in poverty in the U.S., or $1 million for a poor family of four.
Total means-tested welfare spending in FY 2008 amounted to around $16,800 for each poor person in the U.S.; however, some welfare spending goes to individuals who have low incomes but are not below the official poverty line (about $22,200 per year for a family of four). According to President Obama's budget projections, federal and state welfare spending will total $10.3 trillion over the next 10 years (FY 2009 to FY 2018). This spending will equal $250,000 for each person currently living in poverty in the U.S., or $1 million for a poor family of four.
In the U.S. today, total spending on means-tested welfare programs amounts to $956 billion per year. This figure represents an increase of 32% over the level of welfare spending that was in place at the beginning of the Obama presidency. In the U.S. today,[1] there are more than 80 federal means-tested welfare programs that provide cash, food, housing, medical care, and social services to low-income residents.
In 2010, the average unlawful immigrant household received around $24,721 in government benefits and services while paying some $10,334 in taxes. This generated an average annual fiscal deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of around $14,387 per household. This cost had to be borne by U.S. taxpayers. In reality, postponing access to government benefits has only a marginal impact on fiscal costs. If amnesty recipients are barred from receiving welfare aid and health benefits from Obamacare for 13 years after initial amnesty, the total fiscal deficit falls by 12 percent from $7.1 trillion to $6.3 trillion.
Of the $714 billion in welfare spending, $522 billion (73 percent) was federal expenditures, and $192 billion (27 percent) was state government funds. Nearly all state government welfare expenditures are required matching contributions to federal welfare programs. According to President Obama's budget projections, federal and state welfare spending will total $10.3 trillion over the next 10 years (FY 2009 to FY 2018). This spending will equal $250,000 for each person currently living in poverty in the U.S., or $1 million for a poor family of four.
Welfare is slightly more generous in Connecticut, where benefits are worth $38,761; a person leaving welfare for work would have to earn $21.33 per hour to be better off. And in New Jersey, a worker would have to make $20.89 to beat welfare. In 33 states and the District of Columbia, welfare pays more than an $8-an-hour job. In 12 states and DC, the welfare package is more generous than a $15-an-hour job. Of course, not everyone on welfare gets all seven of the benefits in our study.
