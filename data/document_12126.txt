Amount-With the Child Tax Credit, you may be able to reduce your federal income tax by up to $1,000 for each qualifying child under the age of 17. Qualification-A qualifying child for this credit is someone who meets the qualifying criteria of six tests: age, relationship, support, dependent, citizenship, and residence.
Sam and Judy also have two children under age 17, but their joint income is $130,000, meaning they will lose some of their child tax credit. Since their combined income exceeds the $110,000 phase-out threshold for married couples by $20,000, they must reduce their credit by $50 for every $1,000 they are over the limit. So they would lose $1,000 of their credit ($50 x 20) and could claim only a $1,000
The Child Tax Credit is an important tax credit that may be worth as much as $1,000 per qualifying child depending upon your income. Here are 10 important facts from the IRS about this credit and how it may benefit your family.
Everyone with a qualifying child starts out the tax year entitled to a $1,000 credit per child for the tax year. This credit is gradually phased out for taxpayers whose incomes rise up to and above the annual threshold amount specified for the year.
Credit is phased out at higher income levels. The child tax credit is reduced or eliminated if your adjusted gross income is above certain thresholds. The credit amount is reduced by $50 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) by which the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds the threshold amount.
For 2014, the Child Tax Credit begins to phase out (decrease in value) at an adjusted gross income of $75,000 for Single filers and Heads-of-Household, $110,000 if Married Filing Jointly, and $55,000 if Married Filing Separately.
For married taxpayers filing a separate return, it begins at $55,000. For all other taxpayers, the phase-out begins at $75,000. In addition, the Child Tax Credit is generally limited by the amount of the income tax you owe as well as any alternative minimum tax you owe.
1. For example, the federal Child Tax Credit begins to phase out for married taxpayers filing jointly when their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) reaches $110,000. If their MAGI falls below this number, they can claim the full credit.
