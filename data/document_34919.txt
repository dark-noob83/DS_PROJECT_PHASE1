By definition, the average. IQ score for children or for adults is 100. This was originally calculated for children by dividing the mental age of an individual's perf … ormance (derived from the average performance for that age) by the individual's chronological age, and then multiplying the quotient by 100. The IQ, or intelligence quotient, is actually a bell curve* statistic whereby the score of 100 is dead centre meaning that half of the normal distribution falls be … low 100 and half fall above 100.
Interpreting Your Child’s IQ Score. According to the National Association for Gifted Children, a score between 90 and 110 corresponds to the 50th percentile of the population—in other words, an average score. The top tier, represented by 2 to 3 percent of the population, scores higher than 130.
If your child is scheduled to take an IQ test at school, assure him or her that the test isn't the type of exam one can study for. A solid night of sleep and a nutritious breakfast may be the best way to prepare your child for an intelligence test. An IQ score higher than 110 categorizes the test-taker as having an above average or superior level of intelligence. Those who score above 130 on an IQ test are frequently labeled as gifted. Palmer points out, however, that IQ test publishers offer different ways of describing IQ scores.
Determining a child’s IQ, intelligence quotient, can be challenging. Understanding the basics of IQ testing and what the normal range is for children can help determine if there are concerns about how a child is developing. (Polka Dot/Polka Dot/Getty Images). Definition and Significance of IQ Testing. IQ is the measure of general intelligence of a child or person. The French psychologist Alfred Binet along with a physician, Theodore Simon, developed the Binet-Simon Test in the early 1900s. The Binet-Simon Test was designed to measure the intelligence of mentally handicapped children
According to Palmer's 2006 publication, a child who scores between 90 and 109 on an IQ test is classified as having an average level of intelligence. Students who score below 70 on an IQ test are designated with a borderline intellectual disability or some form of mental delay. An IQ score higher than 110 categorizes the test-taker as having an above average or superior level of intelligence. Those who score above 130 on an IQ test are frequently labeled as gifted. Palmer points out, however, that IQ test publishers offer different ways of describing IQ scores.
IQ tests are standardized so that a score of 100 is in the middle. There is a standard deviation of 15. Typically anything between 85 and 115 is considered average. This simply means that most people's scores are in the 85 to 115 range. Your child's score was slightly above average. 105-115 his above average,116-125 is well above average, 126 and up is gifted and work up to genius... I imagine the numbers for average IQ for that of a 10 year would be higher than a 6....It should show in the report the scores in all the categories and the and the final score overall, along side the averages..

To relate the mental development of a child to the child's chronological age the IQ was invented. IQ = (MA/CA) * 100. The intelligence quotient was equal to 100 times the Mental Age divided by the Chronological Age. For example, if a certain child started reading, etc., at the age of 3 (CA) and average children start reading, etc., at the age of 6 (MA), the child would get an IQ score of 200. (Such a score is very, very rare).
