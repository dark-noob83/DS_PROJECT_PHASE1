An electromagnet is a device that sends electricity through a coil of wire to produce a magnetic field. This leads to a magnet that can be controlled -- turned on and off with the flip of a switch, or increased or decreased in strength. The coils are often wrapped around a regular magnet to make it stronger.
An electromagnetic field, sometimes referred to as an EM field, is generated when charged particles, such as electron s, are accelerated. All electrically charged particles are surrounded by electric fields. Charged particles in motion produce magnetic fields.
An electromagnet is a magnet that runs on electricity. Unlike a permanent magnet, the strength of an electromagnet can easily be changed by changing the amount of electric current that flows through it. The poles of an electromagnet can even be reversed by reversing the flow of
slide 1 of 5. Electromagnetism is the branch of physics that deals with electricity and magnetism and the interaction between them. It was first discovered in the 19th century and has extensive application in today's world of physics. Electromagnetism is basically the science of electromagnetic fields.

The electromagnetic spectrum is the term used by scientists to describe the entire range of light that exists. From radio waves to gamma rays, most of the light in the universe is, in fact, invisible to us! Light is a wave of alternating electric and magnetic fields.
