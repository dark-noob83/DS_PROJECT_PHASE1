essential thrombocythemia-associated with the CALR gene. Some gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in the CALR gene in early blood-forming cells are associated with essential thrombocythemia, a disorder characterized by an increased number of platelets, the blood cell fragments involved in normal blood clotting.
Clinical Significance. Calreticulin (CALR) mutations have been reported in 50-71% of essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 56-88% of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) that are negative for JAK2 and MPL mutations.
primary myelofibrosis-associated with the CALR gene. Somatic mutations in exon 9 of the CALR gene are also associated with primary myelofibrosis, a condition in which bone marrow is replaced by scar tissue (fibrosis).
Published on: January 08, 2015. The discovery of mutations in exon 9 of the calreticulin (CALR) gene in the majority of cases of JAK2 wild-type essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) came out of left field.
Reference Range(s). Calreticulin (CALR) mutations have been reported in 50-71% of essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 56-88% of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) that are negative for JAK2 and MPL mutations.
The JAK2 V617F mutation is identified in 95% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) but is present in less than half of patients with myelofibrosis (MF) or essential thrombocythemia (ET). A mutation in the thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL) is observed in even fewer MF or ET patients (5%â€“10%).
Test Summary Calreticulin (CALR) Mutation Analysis Clinical Use Diagnose essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) Assess prognosis Clinical Background Diagnosis of BCR/ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) includes demonstration of a clonal marker such as a JAK2 or MPL mutation.
