The normal hemoglobin range for women is slightly on the lower side compared to that of men. This is because, women lose blood during menstruation. Normal hemoglobin level tends to rise slightly during pregnancy, as there is an increased need for oxygen in the body. 
Normal hemoglobin levels are different in women and in men. In non-pregnant women, normal hemoglobin ranges from 120 g/L to 160 g/L. In men, normal hemoglobin levels range from 140 g/L to 180 g/L. Canadian Blood Services tests each donor’s hemoglobin at the clinic and requires a minimum of 125 g/L for donatio
If it gets more severe and causes symptoms, your low hemoglobin count may indicate you have anemia. A low hemoglobin count is generally defined as less than 13.5 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter (135 grams per liter) of blood for men and less than 12 grams per deciliter (120 grams per liter) for women. In children, the definition varies with age and sex. 
For people without diabetes, the normal range for the hemoglobin A1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes, and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes. 
A. The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 17-22 gm/dL. 
However, the National Institutes of Health offers the following general, accepted range for normal hemoglobin levels in children and adults: Normal range for adults: Male: 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL). Female: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL. Normal range for children: Newborn: 14 to 24 g/dL. Infant: 9.5 to 13 g/dL. The normal hemoglobin levels for adults according to Mayo Clinic are similar, with the ranges slightly broader by a few points. For children, the ranges vary with age and sex. Hemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs into the body’s cells and transports carbon dioxide out.
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter. 
Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together. Each globulin chain contains an important central structure called the heme molecule. Embedded within the heme molecule is iron that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood. The iron contained in hemoglobin is also responsible for the red color of blood.
Normal hemoglobin values are related to the person's age and sex. Normal values may vary slightly between test systems, and which groups of doctors have determined normal values for their group of patients; however, the value ranges are close (vary by about 0.5 g/dl) for almost every group. 1 Age 2 to 6 years: 11.5 to 13.5 g/dl (mean 12.5 g/dl). 2  Age 6-12 years: 11.5 to 15.5 g/dl (mean 13.5). 3  Female. 4  Age 12-18 years: 12.0 to 16.0 g/dl (mean 14.0 g/dl).
Answers-Russell Portenoy What is normal depends on the lab. Most women with hemoglobin above 14 or 14.5 would be considered to have a normal level. There are some new data to suggest that hemoglobin levels in the range of 10-12 are critically important in terms of the onset of fatigue. Many oncologists were trained to consider hemoglobin of 11 or 11.5 to be so close to normal that it is clinically insignificant
