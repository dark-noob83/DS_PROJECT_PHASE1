Predominant structure [edit]. DNA is a double-stranded molecule with a long chain of nucleotides while RNA is single-stranded molecule, in most of its biological roles and has a shorter chain of nucleotides (after transcription and splicing, only exons remain in RNA).
DNA vs RNA structure. Nucleic acids are the building blocks of genetic material of all organisms. The nucleic acids are of two types depending on the sugar molecule in their structure. Nucleic acids are long chains of nucleotides joined by phosphoric acid bonds.
1 The only difference between ribose and deoxyribose is that ribose has one more-OH group than deoxyribose, which has-H attached to the second (2') carbon in the ring. 2  DNA is a double stranded molecule while RNA is a single stranded molecule. 3  DNA is stable under alkaline conditions while RNA is not stable.
DNA is a doubled stranded structure, while RNA is a single stranded structure. RNA contains the sugar ribose, while DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose. RNA can have 4 nucleoti â€¦ des: cytosine, guanine, uracil, and adenine. DNA can have all these nucleotides except for uracil, which is replaced by thymine.

One of the major differences between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with 2-deoxyribose being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (abbreviated A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
well the difference is that DNA's bases are thymine guanine cytosine and Ardine. But RNA instead of having thymine has uracil. DNA in most of the time doubled stranded when RNA is normally single stranded. The DNA contains the genetic information and the rna transferes the information into proteins.
