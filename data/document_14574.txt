As you can see, the LEAF is the cost winner in this situation, the Volt and C-Max Energi cost a bit over $100 more, the Prius about $200 more, the Camry $243.33 more, and the Prius PHEV $359.29 more per month than the LEAF. Now let's try an example with a longer commute: 60 miles per day. 
Assuming you lease the Nissan Leaf for $349.00 and $1,6999 down, put another $2,000 into the Charging Station, your net payment averages out to around $455.00 per month. However, you will be saving about $125.00 a month on gas, so you’re back to leasing a car for around $330 per month. The total cost over 5 years for the Civic drops to $17,931.50. The Total cost over 5 years for the Nissan Leaf drops to $ $15,781.50. The savings are not quite as impressive. Still, the Nissan Leaf Lease will save you over $2,000 over the course of five years.
Why, offer incentives, of course! Which is how it comes to pass that you can lease a brand-new Nissan Leaf SL battery-electric car for a mere $139 a month with $2,995 down. The lower-than-ever lease deal is available from Boardwalk Nissan in Redwood City, California, and potentially a number of other dealers as well. In California, however, a 24-month lease does not qualify for the full $2,500 state purchase rebate--which stays with the lessee, not the issuer of the lease, but requires the lessee or owner to keep the car for 36 months.
Also, we are talking about cost here. A Leaf with $100/month battery leasing program will cost more than a Prius to run on per mile basis. Not to mention that fact that if you stop paying for the battery, you will end up with a EV that doesn't have battery. USELESS. Due to launch in the first half of next year, Nissan’s Battery Replacement Program will offer existing and new customers a way of guaranteeing their LEAF’s 24-kilowatt-hour battery pack will retain at least a 70% battery capacity.
With a purchase, the purchaser must wait until the following year to apply to receive the tax credit. According to the EPA, the average cost to fuel a Nissan LEAF is $550 per year (based on 15,000 miles per year), or less than $50 per month. Compare that to what you are spending on gasoline now. 
The math changes, however, now that the cheapest Leaf is $6,000 less. State rebates help put the math in the Leaf’s favor too, of course. Based on the new math, it would seem that it’s less expensive to own a Leaf rather than a similar traditional car like the Nissan Versa, all things being equal. Impressively, the retail price of the 2013 Nissan Leaf will drop by over six grand. This week at the Detroit Auto Show, Nissan announced that the new Leaf S series will start with an MSRP of $28,800, which undercuts the previous least expensive Leaf by $6,400, representing a drop of 18%.
The Nissan Leaf Lease Offer. That said, Nissan is offering a $349.00 a month, 36-month lease of the Nissan Leaf based on a $7,500 tax savings Capital Cost reduction. The savings goes directly to the lender which in turn nets you the $349.00 payment. Furthermore, a $1,699 initial cap-cost reduction is required at leas siging. The total cost over 5 years for the Civic drops to $17,931.50. The Total cost over 5 years for the Nissan Leaf drops to $ $15,781.50. The savings are not quite as impressive. Still, the Nissan Leaf Lease will save you over $2,000 over the course of five years.
