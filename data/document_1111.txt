Pilots flying for American airlines, who earn by flight hours, fly 72 hours per month on average. The Federal Aviation Administration also limits commercial airline pilots to no more than 100 flight hours in a 28-day period.
Corvus, an airline with about 86 pilots, has the highest average pay for the regional category at $97.25 an hour. Horizon Air ($88.61), Compass ($85.22), Air Wisconsin ($81.44), PSA ($80.79), GoJet ($78.93) and Trans States Airlines ($77.89) all pay an average above $75.
Captains. Senior pilots, called captains, earn considerably more than first officers. According to the 2009 FltOps salary survey, the average maximum pay for a captain across the airline industry was $165,278. JetBlue has the lowest maximum captain's salary, $123,400.
Starting Salaries. Airline pilot salaries start low at about $20,000 a year, and most airlines pay hourly. The average airline pilot logs 75 hours a month in the air and 150 hours a month performing ground duties.
Regional airlines pay much less, but pilots also fly smaller aircraft. On Island Air, a first officer makes $26 an hour the first year, $40 an hour the fifth year, and $43 an hour by year 10. Captains for the same airline earn $59 the first year, $66 by year five, and $78 in the tenth year.
According to data for 14 regional airlines, the average new pilot’s hourly wage is about $24 per hour, the report says. But the Air Line Pilots Association estimates that the average starting salary is even lower than that — $22,500 per year, which for a 40-hour work week equals an hourly rate of $10.75.
Delta pays their first year pilots, at the lowest, $173 an hour with the highest paid pilot hitting $263.00. Not every airline has a payscale that close, however. The lowest paid pilots at both U.S. Airways and American Airlines are making just $35 an hour while the highest is at $241.00.
Southwest has the highest pay rate for first year pilots out of the major airlines at $191. Allegiant and JetBlue pay first year pilots $131, though JetBlue has a higher pay rate for their top fliers at $189 compared to Allegiant's $153.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, reports that airline pilots earned an average of $118,070 per year in 2011. The majority were employed by the scheduled air transportation industry and averaged $119,180 per year.
