Higher carrier frequency will reduce audible noise but at a cost in losses in the variable frequency drive. Lower carrier means high motor noise and higher losses in the motor.
For that reason there is no commercially available VFD with a higher carrier frequency than 15 KHz (Fuji). For industrial applications where efficiency is far more important than-slight-noise levels, carrier frequencies of 1 - 4 KHz are normal. I hope this clarifies the issue.
Could some one please explain what the (Carrier Frequency) is in a VFD and what it does, all i know so far is that you can play with its value to change the noise of the motor.
The VFD’s Carrier (Switching) frequency is the frequency of the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pulses, i.e. the frequency at which the VFD’s output transistors; usually IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), are switching. This typically ranges from 2 to 20 kHz.
Take the carrier down, the VFD likes it and the motor hates it. Motors like pure sinusoidal waves coming from generators-any reconstructed wave form coming off a DC bus (all VFD outputs) has harmonics that heat up the motor and the lower the carrier, the more the harmonics and motor losses.
VFD Carrier frequency. Carrier frequency is the frequency at which the output transistors are switched. In the mid 1980's when I got into the business, the power transistors were Darlingtons, fired by injecting a current on the base that was a percentage of the current carried by the collector and emitter.
Carrier frequency. Carrier frequency in fact causes the audible noise. You can diminish the noise with high frequency ripple filters which will add cost to the installation. This may be necessary in places where the public or employees are in close proximity to the SMPS or VFD. In most cases of a VFD you may increase the carrier frequency beyond the audible level of human hearing level, however, not without drawback.
