January 19, 2014 at 8:08 am. Zimmy, I actually recommend new freelance writers shoot for $35-$50 an hour as a starting rate. You have many more expenses as a freelancer than you do as an employee, so you can’t make it as a freelance writer in any developed country earning much below that. Remember that every hour is not a billable hour, too. 
A good ballpark figure is 10 cents a word, so a 100,000-word book might set you back $10,000 while a 400-word blog post could cost around $40. These are just rough averages, however. Some editors work cheaper and some charge substantially more — it’s all about supply and demand. Some editors will tell you they’re charging by the page or the project but we all base our fees on our preferred hourly rates. 1  Substantive editing, $50-$60 per hour or more, depending on the editor.
Developmental editing: $50 to $80 per hour Pace: 2 to 5 pages per hour. Of course, rates vary from one book editor to another. Some freelance book editors will work for $10 to $20 per hour, but you can expect experienced book editors to charge $25 or more per hour. Expect to pay more for editing technical writing or specialized subject matter, as well. 
Expected Lifetime Earnings: $2,249,000. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, copy editors make a mean annual wage of $59,340 a year. Basically, you may make $28.53 an hour as a copy editor, but the range is wide and fat (like many of the editors who feast on late night Chinese food). The salary differs depending on the size and prestige of a company. Copy editors in New York make roughly $74,690 a year. Editors living in Texas make an annual mean wage of $50,150 a year. Basically, those living in an area with a high cost of living will make more. Well if that isn't the darnedest coincidence. Freelancers generally make less than an editor on staff.
Your wage may also depend on where you live. Copy editors in New York make roughly $74,690 a year. Editors living in Texas make an annual mean wage of $50,150 a year. Basically, those living in an area with a high cost of living will make more. Well if that isn't the darnedest coincidence. Freelancers generally make less than an editor on staff.
Editors in North America can be hired for anywhere from $25 an hour to north of $60 an hour, which is reasonable compared to a lawyer, CPA or a plumber, but it’s far from free. Some editors will tell you they’re charging by the page or the project but we all base our fees on our preferred hourly rates. 1  Substantive editing, $50-$60 per hour or more, depending on the editor.
And so on. Editors make between $30,000 and $80,000 a year. Of course there are outliers (those making more or less); but the average salary is around $50,000. Freelance editors can earn between $30 and $100 an hour. A higher salary and hourly rate is earned by those with many years of experience, and who have established themselves in that field. Phew, that was long.
