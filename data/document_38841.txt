through to the incoming inspection, acceptance, maintenance, and eventual retirement and disposal of medical equipment. Medical equipment management is a recognized profession within the medical logistics domain. Work order management may be paper-based or computer-base and includes the maintenance of active (open or uncompleted) and completed work orders which provide a comprehensive maintenance history of all medical equipment devices used in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients.
Medical equipment repairers work for wholesale suppliers and at hospitals, electronic repair and maintenance shops, and health and personal care stores. Because repairing vital medical equipment is urgent, the work can be stressful. Much of the equipment that they maintain and repair use specialized software, and repairers use that software to calibrate the machines. Many doctors, particularly specialty practitioners, rely on complex medical devices to run tests and diagnose patients, and they must be confident that the readings are accurate.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), medical equipment repair professionals worked in about 41,430 positions across the United States in 2014. The BLS predicts a faster than average job growth rate of 30% for medical equipment repairers between 2012 and 2022. Medical Equipment Maintenance Training and Education Programs. Individuals in a biomedical equipment technology degree program study the fundamentals of technical systems that make up biomedical equipment.
In a hospital setting, medical equipment repairers must be comfortable working around patients because repairs occasionally must take place while equipment is being used. When this is the case, the repairer must take great care to ensure that their work activities do not disturb patients. Much of the equipment that they maintain and repair use specialized software, and repairers use that software to calibrate the machines. Many doctors, particularly specialty practitioners, rely on complex medical devices to run tests and diagnose patients, and they must be confident that the readings are accurate.
Typically, the purpose of a medical device is not achieved by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means. 4 Medical equipment: Medical devices requiring calibration, maintenance, repair, user training, and decommissioning – activities usually managed by clinical engineers. Therefore, in conjunction with the medical equipment inventory, the health-care facility should maintain a separate inventory of consumables necessary to operate medical equipment (2) . These include items such as blood tubing sets, electrodes, electrocardiographic (ECG) paper, conductive gel and reagents.
They perform repairs and maintain medical equipment such as electric wheelchairs, defibrillators, beds, and imaging equipment. Technicians use a variety of hand tools, electronic tools, and computers to keep the equipment in top working order. Despite the fact that most medical equipment repair technicians work during business hours, some on-call, weekend, or night shifts may be required. The majority of such workers are employed full-time, but varied schedules are available. Travel, including long distances, is part of the job. Additionally, working as a medical equipment repair technician often comes with stress, since there is pressure to have the medical equipment working as fast as possible.
36 Medical equipment maintenance programme overview components of electronic devices (such as resistors or capacitors in an electronic circuit, or fuses) this is often the most effective repair approach. 22 Medical equipment maintenance programme overview responsibility, will reduce the cost of maintaining a hospital’s equipment.Where substantial resources are available to support technical personnel, it is typical that one technical person may be responsible for the maintenance of several hundred medical devices.
What it is. workers install, repair and maintain medical equipment to ensure it is clean, safe and functioning properly. Biomedical equipment technicians use computers with specialized software, hand tools and machining equipment to diagnose and fix problems with a wide variety of healthcare technology. Medical equipment preparers may also work in medical laboratories. Medical equipment repair workers typically work normal, daytime hours, although those working in hospitals may be expected to be on call if equipment breaks down during the night or on a weekend.
