The size if the tank effects how quickly the temperature drops when the heater is off. The heater effects how quickly it warms back up and the over all range of temp that the tank will maintain. The type of fish determine the ideal temp. OK your tank is about 56 liters so you would want a 50 to 100 watt heater.
Depends on the type of tropical fish you have in your tank, the temperature can be from 70 to 82 degrees farenheit.
Aquarium Water Temperature. For the vast majority of tropical fish, an aquarium water temperature of 76 to 78º Fahrenheit will be fine. Some species like cooler water and some prefer warmer water, but as a compromise, this range works well.
Hiya! The average temperature for normal tropical fish is about 20 - 25oC. But certain fish need higher/lower temperatures so you would have to research into each individual temperature for the fish you are hoping to get.
Tropical fish are those that require heated water, generally in the range of 75-80°F (24-27°C). Because many homes are not kept in that temperature range day and night, these fish require a heated aquarium.
When talking temperature, the size of the tank does not matter. The only size will matter is in determining what size heater you put in the tank.You have an approx. 54L (14 gal.) tank, so you will need a 100 watt heater. The proper temperature for most tropical fish is around 24 to 28oC.
Another time when temperature can have an impact is when a new fish is brought from home and added to an existing tank. Water temperature can change in transit, and again when the fish is added to the new tank. This is an unavoidable issue, but can be minimized by making sure the fish is insulated during transport.
