There is some confusion when organisations organise or advertise for devops skills or roles. I think there are at least three devops skills / roles you could potentially be asking for: 1  Build team members doing the infrastructure as code (or full stack) and managing the resulting environments. 2  Tool makers providing the [facilities, the automation and self-service infrastructure,] to role 1. 1 Tool makers providing the [facilities, the automation and self-service infrastructure,] to role 1. 2  The person who builds the automation tool chain used by 1. 3  DevOps practice owners providing expertise, standards, knowledge, templates, coaching, tools for the toolmakers... 4  This is the DOO or devops Office.

DevOps (a clipped compound of development and operations) is a software development method that emphasizes the roles of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals.
