Calorie Counts. The exact number of calories in your perfectly grilled tuna steak depends on the type of tuna. Both yellowfin and skipjack tuna provide around 110 calories from a 3-ounce grilled steak. By opting for bluefin tuna steak, though, you’ll get over 155 calories from the same amount. If you cook tuna steaks in oil to prevent sticking on the grill, you’ll want to account for those calories. One teaspoon of oil adds nearly 40 calories to your otherwise low-calorie entree.
