Report Abuse. 6 protons, 6 neutrons (in most favorable isotope) and 6 electrons. Carbon is # 6 on the periodic table, so it has 6 protons by convention of the periodic table. For a neutral atom the number of electrons always equals the number of protons. Carbon has an atomic mass of 12 nucleons, which equals 6 protons + 6 neutrons for the most favorable form (Carbon-12).
Copper has 29 protons and 29 electrons, corresponding to its atomic number of 29 on the periodic table. Copper also has 35 neutrons. It has an atomic mass of 63.546 atomic mass units and is grouped in the transition metals.
No matter how many electrons or neutrons an atom has, the element is defined by its number of protons. The periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number, so the number of protons is the element number. For hydrogen, the number of protons is 1. For zinc, the number of protons is 30.
For example, a typical carbon atom has six protons and six neutrons, and it has an atomic weight of 12 amu. A carbon also has six electrons, but they are so small that they don't contribute to carbon's weight. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus.
However, ma â€¦ n-made isotopes of carbon contain as few as two neutrons (8C) or as many as sixteen (22C). Thirteen of the fifteen isotopes of Carbon (i.e. all except 12C and 13C) are radioactive. In addition to neutrons and protons, a carbon atom always has six electrons in orbits around the nucleus.
The mass number, A, is the sum of the protons and neutrons in the element. The atomic number, Z, is the number of protons only. On the periodic table, elements are arranged by atomic number. In this case we see that Carbon is element 6, and so it had 6 protons.
