AGC Glass Europe develops an anti-condensation range: Planibel Low-e Anti-Fog! AGC’s new anti-condensation glazings delay the onset of condensation thanks to a pyrolytic coating on the outside of the glass. The range is available from July 2012.
Transparent Planibel glass is available in a range of colours: clear, bronze, grey, green and three unique shades of blue.Thicker glass is available as Linea Azzurra, the blueish tint of which distinguishes it from ordinary glass which gives off a green reflection, and making it a popular choice for furniture designers.
The new AGC range features clear float glass with a transparent pyrolytic coating (1) . Applied to the outside of the glass, the coating keeps the glazing at a higher temperature, thereby delaying – and in certain conditions preventing – the formation of condensation.
AGC PLANIBEL G is a pyrolytic, low emissivity glass. The low-emissivity coating is applied on a sheet of clear float glass by a toughenable pyrolytic coating process.
