One type of limestone which is very pure is called chalk, but most other limestones contain variable amounts of mud or sand or other material. Much of Ireland is composed of limestone, especially in the Dublin district and the Central Plain, and as far apart as South Donegal and Waterford.
Northern Ireland Geology-Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock made up of calcite (CaCO3) as its main mineral. Some limestones were formed by chemical deposition and others by the accumulation of shells from minute sea creatures.
Geology. The Burren is underlain by limestones of the Lower Carboniferous (Visean) period. The limestone formed as sediments in a tropical sea which covered most of Ireland approximately 350 million years ago.
Where is Limestone found. Where is Limestone found On continental crust, limestone is found virtually anywhere an ancient sea existed. The limestone could be exposed at the surface due to erosion or roadcuts, or could be buried hundreds of feet underground, covered by other sedimentary rock or unlithified sediments.

Image: geologic map showing limestone areas in Ireland. Ireland has a rather complicated geoloy, as the island is the remains of ancient mountain ridges, formed during orogenies (orogeny=forming of mountains) very long ago. The rocks are generally very well folded, and metamorphic and crystalline rocks are common.
