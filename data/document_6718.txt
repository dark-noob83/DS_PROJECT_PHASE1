In a pool of average size (10,000 to 20,000 gallons), and depending on the size of both your pump and filter, you should be able to run your pump for three to four hours during the winter and six to eight during the summer. For larger pools, increase the summer running time to eight to ten hours.
Thanks...MJ. Thanks for the question MJIn general, you want to run the pool pump 8 - 10 hours per day in the Summer and 4 - 8 hours in the Winter. When I had my pool route in Arizona it was recommended that pump be on for 12 hours per day during the Summer.
Pump Timing. A pool pump should run for as long as necessary to circulate all of the water through the pump and filter system. This turnover rate varies based on pool size and the pump. Pumps can typically circulate all of the water within a 6 to 8 hour period; some pools require pumping for up to 12 hours.
You should run your swimming pool pump motor around 6 - 8 hours during the Winter months and around 10 - 12 hours during the hot Summer months. Some places can even get away with running their pump around 4 hours each day, but 6 hours is optimal.
Another user said: If by the pool filter, you mean how long to run the pool pump to circulate water, I have been advised by pool pros to run it according to the hours of daylight at the time. e.g., in the summer run it 12 to 14 hours and in the winter, 8 hours. Well, I myself would run it for at least four hours a day.
