Safety is borderline, assuming your refrigerator is at a properly cool temperature. However, after 5 days of sitting in a marinade, the meat will almost certainly be mush. – Sean Hart Jan 15 '13 at 15:36. add a comment |. up vote 1 down vote. Generally 5 days is too long, however it depends on the sell-by date of the chicken. If it was very fresh when you bought it any you marinaded it right away then it may be within its sell-by date in which case it may be safe to cook and eat.
Five days in the refrigerator is definitely stretching it for chicken-usually no more than a few days is recommended, and that's assuming it was fresh when you bought it (not a day before the sell-by date). Even if it's safe, it's not going to be very good. For marinades that are meant to soak for more than a few hours, they generally call for about 24 hours. This is not an unsafe length of time. Longer than 24 hours is going to have no positive effects on your food... UNLESS you happen to be brining the meat.
You can store marinated poultry in your refrigerator for 2 days. Beef, veal, pork, and lamb roasts, chops, and steaks may be marinated up to 5 days. (From http://www.foodsafety.gov/blog/marinades.html). For marinades that are meant to soak for more than a few hours, they generally call for about 24 hours. This is not an unsafe length of time. Longer than 24 hours is going to have no positive effects on your food... UNLESS you happen to be brining the meat.
1 Removing the skin from the chicken will help it absorb marinade. 2  In general, two hours of marinating is long enough for the meat to soak up the flavor, but poultry can marinate for up to two days in the refrigerator, according to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service. 1 In general, two hours of marinating is long enough for the meat to soak up the flavor, but poultry can marinate for up to two days in the refrigerator, according to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service.
Thawing Chicken. Thaw frozen chicken slowly and safely. It will take anywhere from 24 hours to two days to thaw a whole chicken in the refrigerator, and about 2 to 9 hours for cut-up chicken parts (less for boneless pieces). You can thaw chicken more quickly in a cold water bath or by using the defrost cycle of the microwave. Always let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, even for a short soak of 30 minutes. And never baste the cooked chicken with the same marinade that’s touched raw chicken: either make extra marinade and set aside a portion just for basting, or boil it for two to three minutes, enough time to kill any bacteria.
Report Abuse. It depends how much time you have. Meat is fine marinating out of the fridge for an hour or so, but to get the same result in the fridge you would need to leave for about 8 hours. The more time you have the better! Aimee M · 7 years ago.

I can't see any reason for the marinating itself to make any difference. If it's safe to leave the (un-marinated) meat in the same conditions for the same length of time, then it's safe to marinate it for that long. For marinades that are meant to soak for more than a few hours, they generally call for about 24 hours. This is not an unsafe length of time. Longer than 24 hours is going to have no positive effects on your food... UNLESS you happen to be brining the meat.
1 Add wings to the marinade and place in the fridge for about 20 minutes before cooking. 2  Wings don't need to be marinated for very long. 3  Cook on a BBQ or place in a moderate oven, about 180 degrees celcius until caramalized and golden. 4  About 40 minutes. Directions. 1  Cut tips off the chicken wings and discard. 2  Separate the drumette from the wingette and put aside. 3  If you prefer you can just leave wings as they are. 4  In a large bowl mix together all the other ingredients until smooth making sure all the honey is mixed in well. 5  Add wings to the marinade and place in the fridge for about 20 minutes ...
