(July 2011). Buttercream (also known as butter cream, butter icing, and mock cream) is a type of icing or filling used inside cakes, as a coating, and as decoration. In its simplest form, it is made by creaming butter with powdered sugar, although other fats can be used, such as margarine or lard.
With this type of frosting, either Italian meringue (hot sugar beaten into egg whites) or Swiss Meringue (egg whites and sugar heated together and beaten) is prepared and cooled, then a generous amount of butter is beaten into it until the frosting is glossy.
Less well known buttercreams include a French buttercream, which is prepared in a similar way to the meringue buttercreams but uses egg yolks that are beaten until very light instead of egg whites. This type of buttercream tends to be the trickiest to make.

Typically twice as much sugar (by weight) as butter is used.
The most common covering for cakes is either fondant or buttercream. The type of icing you choose to cover your confectionary masterpiece with is a personal decision but there are pros and cons with either choice. You simply have to consider the style of the finished cake.
A simple buttercream, also called an American buttercream, is probably the most common buttercream variation. This frosting is made by creaming together butter, confectionersâ€™ sugar, milk or cream, and some kind of flavorings until everything is smooth and fluffy.
