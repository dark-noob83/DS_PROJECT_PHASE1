2 tbsp. catsup. 1/2 tsp. onion salt. 1/8 tsp. pepper. This would be enough to marinade 2 pounds of steak for at least 3 hours, then broil for 5 minutes on each side or your own taste.
Put the steak in a large food storage bag and pour the marinade over. Turn to coat the steak, seal the bag, and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours. Broil the steak 2 to 3 inches from the heat for about 6 to 9 minutes on each side, depending on thickness. Serves 4.
