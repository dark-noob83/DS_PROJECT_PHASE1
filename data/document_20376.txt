The love of this in-depth industry starts with agriculture teachers. They teach students how to use the newest techniques to become environmental stewards and effectively use resources to sustain life without destroying those resources. Teaching agriculture is also more broad and diverse than most people realize.
The National Teach Ag Campaign is an initiative to bring attention to the career of agricultural education, get students thinking about a possible career in agricultural education, and support current agriculture teachers in their careers.
Includes teachers of agronomy, dairy sciences, fisheries management, horticultural sciences, poultry sciences, range management, and agricultural soil conservation. Includes both teachers primarily engaged in teaching and those who do a combination of teaching and research.

Great teachers do it all. They have to. Across all ages, languages, ethnicities, and subjects, teachers are, and need to be, some of the most widely skilled people around in order to be successful. A day in the life of a teacher can vary greatly depending on the subject and grade level in which they teach.
Agriculture teachers can be found in public schools, technical schools, adult and business education programs, colleges, universities and state-run farmer training programs. They teach a variety of subjects, such as horticulture, animal and plant science, agricultural chemicals and agricultural technology.
Undergraduate Programs. To become an agricultural teacher, you must have at least a bachelor's degree in agriculture science or a closely related field of study and complete a teaching training program. Completion of a program in agricultural education might qualify you for immediate entry into the field.
