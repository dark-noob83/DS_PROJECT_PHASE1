muscular dystrophy md is a broad term that describes a genetic inherited disorder of the muscles muscular dystrophy causes the muscles in the body to become very weak the muscles break down and are replaced with fatty deposits over time duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disease which means it is inherited our genes determine our traits such as eye color and blood type genes are contained in the cells of our bodies on stick like structures called chromosomes there are normally 46 chromosomes in each cell of our body or 23 pairs
dmd associated dilated cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in the dmd gene at least 18 mutations in the dmd gene can cause a form of heart disease called dmd associated dilated cardiomyopathy dmd the largest known human gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin this protein is located primarily in muscles used for movement skeletal muscles and in heart cardiac muscle small amounts of dystrophin are present in nerve cells in the brain
overview one of the nine types of muscular dystrophy duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is a genetic condition characterized by progressive weakening of voluntary muscles that leads to death dmd worsens more rapidly than other types of muscular dystrophy
dmd is a genetic disease those who inherit it have a defective gene related to a muscular protein called dystrophin this protein keeps muscle cells intact and its absence causes rapid muscular deterioration as a child with dmd grows one of the nine types of muscular dystrophy duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is a genetic condition characterized by progressive weakening of voluntary muscles that leads to death dmd worsens more rapidly than other
mutations in the dmd gene cause the duchenne and becker forms of muscular dystrophy the dmd gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin this protein is located primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscle where it helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers 
duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd is a recessive x linked form of muscular dystrophy affecting around 1 in 3600 boys which results in muscle degeneration and premature death the disorder is caused by a mutation in the gene dystrophin located on the human x chromosome which codes for the protein dystrophin 
cause of dmd until the 1980s little was known about the cause of any of the forms of muscular dystrophy in 1986 mda supported researchers identified a gene on the x chromosome that when flawed mutated causes both duchenne and becker muscular dystrophies 
duchenne muscular dystrophy related medical conditions to research the causes of duchenne muscular dystrophy consider researching the causes of these these diseases that may be similar or associated with duchenne muscular dystrophy dystrophinopathies congenital muscular dystrophy congenital md limb girdle muscular dystrophy emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy 
the dystrophinopathies include a spectrum of muscle disease caused by pathogenic variants in dmd which encodes the protein dystrophin the mild end of the spectrum includes the phenotypes of asymptomatic increase in serum concentration of creatine phosphokinase ck and muscle cramps with myoglobinuria 
inheriting muscular dystrophy you have two copies of every gene with the exception of the sex chromosomes you inherit one copy from one parent and the other copy from the other parent if one or both of your parents has a mutated gene that causes md it can be passed on to you depending on the specific type of md the condition can be a recessive inherited disorder dominant inherited disorder sex linked x linked disorder
