A taproot system is one in which the primary root becomes the main root of the plant with minimal branching consisting of secondary, smaller lateral roots. The taproot system occurs in dicot plants and is one of the basis of distinguishing these plants from the monocots which have fibrous roots.
In a plant with a taproot system, the taproot is the largest, most central, and most dominant root from which other roots sprout laterally. Typically a taproot is somewhat straight and very thick, is tapering in shape, and grows directly downward.
Most trees begin life with a taproot, but after one to a few years the main root system changes to a wide-spreading fibrous root system with mainly horizontal-growing surface roots and only a few vertical, deep-anchoring roots.

Taproot vs. Fibrous Root System. There are two main types of roots according to origin of development and branching pattern in the angiosperms: taproot system and fibrous system. Generally, plants with a taproot system are deep-rooted in comparison with those having fibrous type.
A tap root is a specific type of root structure present on some plants, which is typified by being rather large, and going directly down into the ground. This structure has other roots growing off of it as it descends, acting as a sort of trunk beneath
