An Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking: 2012 Update 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In late 2008, the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) published an Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking in an effort to provide more accurate marginal cost data for motor carrier operations. Average Total Cost per Mile by Sector Sector 2008 2009 2010 2011 Specialized $1.87 $1.67 $1.61 $1.79 LTL $1.81 $1.43 $1.76 $1.93 TL 60 $1.48 $1.36 $1.43 $1.57 The following sections analyze specific line-item cost centers that comprise major marginal operating costs for motor carriers.
An Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking: 2014 Update 1 INTRODUCTION The American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) first published an Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking report in 2008 to provide more accurate marginal cost data on motor carrier operations. The driver benefits CPM also increased from 2012 to 2013 (from 11.6 to 12.9 cents). An Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking: 2014 Update 18 Cost Trends After decreasing by four percent from 2011 to 2012, the total average marginal costs increased by three percent from 2012 to 2013 (Table 12).
An Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking The Problem In response to mounting infrastructure improvement needs and dwindling state budgets, policy makers â€“ led by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), have begun embracing creative financing strategies. Findings Total marginal costs for the industry were $1.73 per mile and $83.68 per hour. Marginal costs were divided into vehicle-and driver-based. Top costs for carriers were diesel fuel/oil, driver wages and truck/trailer lease or purchase payments.
Advertisement. Total aggregate operational mean costs of trucking average $1.73 cents per mile or $83.68 per hour, according to an analysis sponsored by the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) Advisory Committee.

The Real Cost of Trucking. $1.38 The average per mile operating cost for the trucking industry. $180,000 The average total yearly cost of operating a commercial truck. The largest operating expense is diesel fuel. A commercial truck can easily consume more than $70,000 of diesel fuel per year. Driver Salary is the second largest operating cost. 
An Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking: 2013 Update 4 INTRODUCTION As an update to reports released in 2008, 2011 and 2012, the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) is once again publishing An Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking. An Analysis of the Operational Costs of Trucking: 2013 Update ii LIST OF FIGURES AND TABLES Table ES 1. Average Carrier Costs per Mile, 2008-2012 ............................................ 2 Table ES 2. Average Carrier Costs per Hour, 2008 - 2012......................................... 2 Table ES 3.
$1.38 The average per mile operating cost for the trucking industry. $180,000 The average total yearly cost of operating a commercial truck. The largest operating expense is diesel fuel. A commercial truck can easily consume more than $70,000 of diesel fuel per year. Driver Salary is the second largest operating cost. Standard commercial truck driver salaries are based on the distance driven, per mile. Although drivers spend a fair amount of time in docks and traffic, their operating costs are only derived from miles traveled. 26% of overall expenses ($0.36 per mile).
