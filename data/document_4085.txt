Compounds. There are more carbon compounds than there are compounds of all other elements combined. The study of carbon compounds, both natural and synthetic, is called organic chemistry. Plastics, foods, textiles, and many other common substances contain carbon.
About 94% of the six million known compounds contain carbon, far more than any other element. Carbon, in the form of diamond, is the hardest natural material on Earth. Carbon is found in a wide variety of rocks, such as chalk and limestone.
All living things are made of compounds containing mostly carbon, so lots of things that are “organic” to a gardener are also “organic” to a chemist. Of course, there are many carbon compounds that are human-made, or synthetic. To chemists, these are organic compounds too.
This section lists some binary compounds with halogens (known as halides), oxygen (known as oxides), hydrogen (known as hydrides), and some other compounds of carbon. For each compound, a formal oxidation number for carbon is given, but the usefulness of this number is limited for p-block elements in particular.
The simplest organic compounds contain molecules composed of carbon and hydrogen. The compound methane contains one carbon bonded to four hydrogens. Ethane is another example of a simple hydrocarbon. Ethane contains two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms.
Organic compounds are mainly composed of carbon atom. There are several common examples of organic compounds which we can observe in our surroundings. Crude oil is a mixture of many compounds. These compounds are known as hydrocarbons, because their molecules contain carbon and hydrogen elements bonded together.
Compounds of carbon are defined as chemical substances containing carbon. More compounds of carbon exist than any other chemical element except for hydrogen. Organic carbon compounds are far more numerous than inorganic carbon compounds. In general bonds of carbon with other elements are covalent bonds.
