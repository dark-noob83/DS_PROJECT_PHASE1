The protostome group encompasses an incredible variety of animals. Some of the most common protostomes are flatworms (such as tapeworms), nematodes (such as heartworms), mollusks (such as snails and slugs), annelids (such as earthworms) and arthropods (spiders, insects, lobsters, ticks, barnacles, and more!).
You are likely already familiar with many of the world's protostomes. This is because protostomes are animals such as flatworms, nematodes, segmented worms, mollusks, and arthropods.
The annelids are generally referred to as the segmented worms to distinguish them from the non-segmented flatworms and roundworms. The major defining characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a series of similar segments that make up the body.
In protosomes, the blastopore develops into the mouth and the second opening forms the anus. In deuterostomes, the blastopore develops into the anus and the second opening forms the mouth.
This is why earthworms are called protostomes. The word is derived from Greek and means first mouth.. The relationship between the embryonic cell layers can be more clearly understood by examining a longitudinal-section. Mesoderm gives rise to muscle and a variety of tissue types.
Protostomes (mollusks, annelids, and arthropods) develop so that the first opening in the embryo is the mouth (protostome = first mouth). Protostomes are bilaterally symmetrical, have three germ layers, the organ level of organization, the tube-within-a-tube body plan, and a true coelom.
deuterostomes also usually are Cnidaria and Echinodermata and they show radial symmetry. In most protostome animals with a true coelom, the body cavity originates as a split within a bud of mesodermal tissue at the time of gastrulation.
