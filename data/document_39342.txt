Definition of PERMITTIVITY. : the ability of a material to store electrical potential energy under the influence of an electric field measured by the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor with the material as dielectric to its capacitance with vacuum as dielectric â€”called also dielectric constant.

If e o represents the permittivity of free space (that is, 8.85 x 10 -12 F/m) and e represents the permittivity of the substance in question (also specified in farads per meter), then the relative permittivity, also called the dielectric constant e r, is given by:
Dielectric constant (permittivity). Definition and measurement. Drilling down: dielectric behavior. Further reading. Definition and measurement. First, a reminder of what is meant by an electric field: it is a region of space in which objects experience forces if they have the right properties.
Part of the Electronics glossary: Permittivity, also called electric permittivity, is a constant of proportionality that exists between electric displacement and electric field intensity. This constant is equal to approximately 8.85 x 10 -12 farad per meter (F/m) in free space (a vacuum).
Part of the Electronics glossary: The dielectric constant is the ratio of the permittivity of a substance to the permittivity of free space. It is an expression of the extent to which a material concentrates electric flux, and is the electrical equivalent of relative magnetic permeability.
A high dielectric constant, in and of itself, is not necessarily desirable. Generally, substances with high dielectric constants break down more easily when subjected to intense electric fields, than do materials with low dielectric constants.
As the dielectric constant increases, the electric flux density increases, if all other factors remain unchanged. This enables objects of a given size, such as sets of metal plates, to hold their electric charge for long periods of time, and/or to hold large quantities of charge.
