The average age of the sampled buffalo was 8.01 years. The majority of the buffalo shot (76%) were between 6 and 8 years old; the remaining 24% comprised mostly of 9 and 10 year-olds, with less than 6% of the hunted population being 11 years or older. Bull buffalo are sexually mature at approximately 5 to 6 years old. By this age, the horn tips are sharp and they will usually stick up well above the level of the forehead. The forehead will still be covered with course, spares hair. There will be no boss per se and PH’s will refer to this bull as being ‘green’.
Death by natural means is more likely to occur as buffalo age, and is usually around 14 years or older amongst unexploited (protected) wild buffalo populations. The average Rowland Ward (RW) score was 36.98 inches with “40 inch” buffalo considered the bench mark for a good quality trophy. The average SCI score was 96.26 inches, just short of the bench mark SCI trophy score of 100 inches. Bull buffalo are sexually mature at approximately 5 to 6 years old. By this age, the horn tips are sharp and they will usually stick up well above the level of the forehead. The forehead will still be covered with course, spares hair. There will be no boss per se and PH’s will refer to this bull as being ‘green’.
1 S. c. nanus (forest buffalo) is the smallest subspecies; the height at the withers is less than 120 cm and average weight is about 270 kg (600 lb). 2  Their color is red, with darker patches on the head and shoulders in the ears forming a brush. 3  The dwarf buffalo is common in forest areas of Central and West Africa. The horns form fully when the animal reaches the age of five or six years. In cows, the horns are, on average, 10–20% smaller, and the boss is less prominent. Forest buffalo horns are smaller than those of the savannah buffalo, usually measuring less than 40 centimetres (16 in), and are almost never fused.
No. Any product labeled as buffalo milk, or buffalo cheese is produced from the milk of water buffalo. Water buffalo are a separate species, and are not related to bison, even though American bison are commonly known as buffalo. Bison are not milked commercially for a couple of reasons. Female bison breed when they are two years old and have their first calves when they are three. Cows can live to be 20-25 years old having a calf each year under the right conditions.
The average dressed weight of buffalo is 500 pounds and the larger bulls around 800 pounds. Buffalo meat is a prime source of many essential nutrients in our diet. It is both high in quality and quantity of protein (28% to 35%). It is also low in fat (.8% to 5%). The normal life span of a buffalo is from twenty to twenty five years but some individuals have lived thirty or more years. Buffalo reach puberty a year later than cattle, hence drop their first calf a year later, usually at the age of three. Mating begins in mid June and builds to a climax in late July.
Swamp buffalo carry their calves for one or two weeks longer than river buffalo. It is not rare to find buffalo that continue to work well at the age of 30, and instances of a working life of 40 years are recorded. Swamp buffalo generally become reproductive at an older age than river breeds. Young males in Egypt, India, and Pakistan are first mated at about 3.0–3.5 years of age, but in Italy they may be used as early as 2 years of age. Successful mating behaviour may continue until the animal is 12 years or even older
Buffalo-area historical tornado activity is below New York state average. It is 74% smaller than the overall U.S. average. On 8/19/1970, a category F3 (max. wind speeds 158-206 mph) tornado 16.3 miles away from the Buffalo city center injured 3 people and caused between $50,000 and $500,000 in damages. On 7/30/1987, a category F2 (max. wind speeds 113-157 mph) tornado 4.2 miles away from the city center injured one person and caused between $500,000 and $5,000,000 in damages. Buffalo-area historical earthquake activity is near New York state average. It is 87
The newborn buffalo is reddish in color and in about 3 months sheds and replaces it with a dark brown adult coat. Calves weigh between 50-60 pounds at birth and grows rapidly weighing about 500 to 600 pounds at the age of one year. The normal life span of a buffalo is from twenty to twenty five years but some individuals have lived thirty or more years. Buffalo reach puberty a year later than cattle, hence drop their first calf a year later, usually at the age of three. Mating begins in mid June and builds to a climax in late July.
If the cow is not pregnant, a calf will nurse for 18 months. At three years of age, bison cows are mature enough to produce a calf. Bison bulls of that age may try to mate with cows, but if more mature bulls are present, they may not be able to compete until they reach five years of age. Bison have a life expectancy of approximately 15 years in the wild and up to 25 years in captivity. For the first two months of life, calves are lighter in color than mature bison. One very rare condition is the white buffalo, in which the calf turns entirely white. Plains bison are often in the smaller range of sizes, and Wood bison in the larger range. Head-and-body length ranges from 2 to 3.5 m (6.6 to 11.5 ft) long, the tail adding 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in). Shoulder height in the species can range from 152 to 186 cm (60 to 73 in).
