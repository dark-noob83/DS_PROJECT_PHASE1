Dominant vs Recessive. Genetics is the science of heredity, genes, and the differences in living organisms. It is a biological discipline that deals with the structure and function of genes, their behavior and patterns of inheritance from the parents to the offspring.
• Dominant and recessive are terms used for genes that are strong and weak respectively. • Dominant genes show up in the form of a trait while recessive genes get hidden by dominant genes. • It is only when an individual receives recessive genes from both parents that recessive gene shows up.

2.A dominant gene is one which is strong while a recessive gene is one which is weak. 3.A dominant gene will show up in the trait while a recessive gene, although still present, is masked or hidden by the dominant gene. 4.A recessive gene will only show up if the offspring inherits recessive genes from both parents.
For a recessive allele to produce a recessive phenotype, the individual must have two copies, one from each parent. An individual with one dominant and one recessive allele for a gene will have the dominant phenotype. They are generally considered “carriers” of the recessive allele: the recessive allele is there, but the recessive phenotype is not.
A gene is called dominant when it is often seen and a recessive gene is one that doesn’t appear as often or disappears completely. In the case of eye color, brown is the dominant gene while blue is recessive gene. Dominant genes are more likely to be passed down to future generations while recessive or weak genes disappear in the process, continuing to a few generations only.
