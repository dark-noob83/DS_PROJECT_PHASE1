DNA is more stable than RNA. DNA is double-stranded and forms a double helix. RNA is usually single-stranded and folds back on itself to form stem-loop structures. RNA has 2' … -OH group that can participate in intramolecular reactions, facilitating hydrolysis.
yet the structure of a DNA is more stable then RNA. The main difference between the two nucliec acids is that DNA contains … Deoxyribose and RNA contains ribose sugar which has a free hydroxyl group in its pentose ring which makes it prone for hydrolysis, thereby making it more unstable than the DNA.
A further test of the stability of DNA over RNA is if you mix RNA into a dilute NaOH solution, it will completely destroy the molecule at room temperature, while DNA is unaffected. DNA is therefore, a more stable repository of genetic information than is RNA.
This hydroxyl group makes RNA less stable than DNA because it is more prone to hydrolysis. Several types of RNA (tRNA, rRNA) contain a great deal of secondary structure, which help promote stability.
Answer by Aawais Malik. DNA is more stable form then RNA b/c DNA is present in double helix form & is highly super coiled which make it more stable and carries genetic information from parents to off springs.
While DNA contains deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose there is no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA because it is more prone to hydrolysis.
