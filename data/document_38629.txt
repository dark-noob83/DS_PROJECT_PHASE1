But the biggest beverage markup of them all belongs to wine in restaurants. The average retail markup on a bottle of wine in a restaurant is 300 percent [source: Bailey ]. 
Markup is based on cost, and margin is based on revenue. A 100% markup becomes a 50% margin. With a cost of $1.00 and a 100% markup, the markup is $1.00 and gross revenue is $2.00. The markup is 100% of the cost (markup of $1.00/Cost of $1.00=100%). However, the margin is 50% — the markup divided by gross revenue (markup [or gross profit] of $1.00/Revenue of $2.00=50%). 
The example shown is a Mark-On. The markup in the example is a 50% markup, meaning that of the retail price 50% is markup and 50% is cost. The correct forumula to computer Retail selling price is. Cost / (1 – Markup) where markup is expressed as a decimal value. A 50 percent markup would be 0.50. To arrive at the selling price, take the cost and divide by (1-.50) or .50 which is to double the cost. A 35 percent markup on a 100 item is $100 / (1 – 0.35) = $100 / .65 = $153.85/. The average gross margin for Gift, Novelty and Souvenir Stores was 47.9% in 2009. So on a $100 item, on average the store paid $52.10 for the merchandise, and had $47.90 in gross margin to pay for everything else. Now we just have to convert that into a markup.
Large markup percentages drive up the cost of eating out, especially for beverages and cheaper ingredients, like pasta. MSN reports that the average markup for a food item is about 60%, and a restaurant may mark up a nonalcoholic beverage by as much as 500%. Restaurants do, however, have very high overhead costs and keep only $0.04 of every dollar the customer spends.
Markup as a Percentage of Cost or Selling Price. Markup can be expressed as a percentage of cost or of selling price. Consider an item that costs the seller $50 and retails for $100. This is a 100-percent markup over cost, but in terms of the selling price it is only a 50-percent markup. Retailers typically express markup as a percentage
Use the multiplier on cost to achieve the desired margin. For example, to achieve a 33.33% margin use a 150% (1.50) multiplier. Another way to express the difference is that a markup percentage of 50% only yields a margin percentage of 33.33%. Markup, defined as the percentage added to cost to arrive at a selling price, is commonly used to price materials. If you want to mark up an item 20%, you add 20% of the item's cost to the cost. However, as we have demonstrated, a 50% markup does NOT yield a 50% margin! 
Shoe Markups: 100-500%. Markup is as varied in the footwear industry as sizes and styles. Typical cross-trainers or athletic shoes carry a 100% mark-up, while higher-end fashion shoes at boutique stores can be marked up by as much as 500%. 
Typical markup on designer fashions ranges from 55 to 62 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal.. If the wholesale price of a silk dress is $50, the retail price might range from around $110 to $130. Premium denim jeans often wholesale for around $150 and may sell at retail for up to $375. Using Markup to Calculate Selling Price. Here's a formula for calculating markup by percentage: Selling price = [(Cost) ÷ (100 - percentage markup)] × 100. Say you buy a sweater at wholesale for $60 and need to sell it at a 60 percent markup. The calculation would be [($60) ÷ (100 - 60)] x 100. This breaks down to ($60 ÷ 40) x 100, resulting in a selling price of $150
Markup can be expressed as a fixed amount or as a percentage of the total cost or selling price. Retail markup is commonly calculated as the difference between wholesale price and retail price, as a percentage of wholesale. Other methods are also used.
