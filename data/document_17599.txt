Technically, a PaaS is an Application Platform comprised of an operating system, middleware and other software that allows applications to run on the cloud with much of the management, security, scaling and other stack related headaches abstracted away. PaaS makes it faster, easier, and cheaper to launch your next big application idea. PaaS is not an Application. It’s a platform! SaaS, or Software-as-a-Service, solutions represent a complete application that is running on the cloud.
OpenShift also supports binary programs that are web applications, so long as they can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This allows the use of arbitrary languages and frameworks. OpenShift takes care of maintaining the services underlying the application and scaling the application as needed. OpenShift is a platform as a service product from Red Hat. The software that runs the service is open-sourced under the name OpenShift Origin, and is available on GitHub. Developers can use Git to deploy web applications in different languages on the platform. A version for cloud computing is named OpenShift Enterprise
OpenShift Origin is the open source project of the software that enables the OpenShift hosted service. Using OpenShift Origin, you can build your own PaaS. A PaaS typically runs on top of an IaaS provider. 
In my first 3 days with the OpenShift Online service I was able to stand up Django-CMS, Redis, OwnCloud, Sonar, Sugar-CRM, WordPress, Jmeter, Node.JS, MongoDB, and Jenkins; and hosted a hackathon and several workshops for 88 senior developers, solution architects. Host your applications in the public cloud. OpenShift Online automates the provisioning, management and scaling of applications so that you can focus on development and creativity. Enterprise Private PaaS Accelerate your IT service delivery and streamline application development by leveraging PaaS in your own datacenters or private cloud.

What is OpenShift Origin. OpenShift Origin is the upstream open source version of Red Hat's distributed application system, OpenShift. We launched this project to provide a platform in which development teams could build and manage cloud native applications on top of Docker and Kubernetes. Extend OpenShift. You can add new runtimes and frameworks to OpenShift with community cartridges and quickstarts. The Origin architecture builds upon the flexibility and scalability of Docker and Kubernetes to deliver a powerful new Platform as a Service system.
