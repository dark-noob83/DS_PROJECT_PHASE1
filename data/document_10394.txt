When it comes to cooking, temperatures are measured in one of three ways: Celsius (°C), Farenheit (°F) or gas mark. These are simply different ways of expressing the same temperature, so it’s nothing to worry about. All ovens vary, and you may not have all of these temperature settings on the oven you are using. 
Oven temperatures may be quoted in degrees in Celsius (International), Fahrenheit (in Canada and USA) or by gas mark (sometimes in the UK and France). This table allows you to convert between the scales. Bold gas mark numbers are the most well-accepted matches. 
Fahrenheit is a thermodynamic temperature scale, where the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and the boiling point 212°F (at standard atmospheric pressure). This puts the boiling and freezing points of water exactly 180 degrees apart. The Celsius scale is an interval system but not a ratio system, meaning it follows a relative scale but not an absolute scale. This can be seen because the temperature interval between 20 °C and 30 °C is the same as between 30 °C and 40 °C, but 40 °C does not have twice the air heat energy of 20 °C.
Equivalents in Fahrenheit and Celsius [edit]. Gas mark 1 is 275 ° Fahrenheit (135 ° Celsius). Oven temperatures increase by 25 °F (13.9 °C) each time the gas mark increases by 1. Below Gas Mark 1 the scale markings halve at each step, each representing a decrease of 25 °F. To convert gas mark to degrees Celsius (D), multiply the gas mark number (G) by 14, then add 121. (G × 14) + 121 = D. For the reverse conversion, G = (D - 121)/14. (These do not work for G less than 1.). However it is usual to round the result of this calculation to a round number of degrees Celsius
CONVERSION CHART FROM FAHRENHEIT TO CELSIUS. Cooking times may vary slightly, depending on the type of oven you are using. We suggest you check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure proper temperature control and purchase an oven thermometer to make certain your oven is working properly. 450. 8. A note for non-U.S. users: For fan-forced ovens, check your appliance manual, but as a general rule, set oven temperature to 20 degrees Celsius lower than the temperature indicated on the conversion chart. Fahrenheit:
177 degrees Celsius x 9 = 1593 1593 / 5 = 318.6 318.6 +32 = 350.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which can be rounded to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll often come across a recipe that we would love to make, but find the oven temperature listed in the recipe is not what we are used to. Here, in the United States we use Fahrenheit. How to Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. To convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, you will need to subtract 32 to the Fahrenheit temperature, multiply by 5, then divide by 9. For example, to convert 350 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius you would complete the following equation: 350 degrees Fahrenheit – 32 = 318. 318 x 5 = 1590
1 The Gas Mark scale is always in 25 °F breaks. 2  Fahrenheit was the standard measure of temperature in the UK until metrication in the late 1960's/early 1970's. 3  Celsius temperatures are given to the nearest 5 degrees. French recipes may well give oven temperatures as Th1, Th2, Th3 ... Th9. The Th stands for Thermostat, thus Thermostat 1 is the French equivalent of Gas Mark 1. You need to be careful as the oven temperatures for the French Th1, Th2 are not the same as those for the UK & Irelands Gas Mark 1, 2 etc.
OVEN TEMPERATURES Found a recipe you want to try but, unfortunately, it only gives oven temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and you cook by gas-what is the gas mark equivalent?
