By Chad Langager AAA |. A: The cost basis of any investment is the original value of an asset adjusted for stock splits, dividends and capital distributions. It is used to calculate the capital gain or loss on an investment for tax purposes.
What cost basis is. In its broadest sense, cost basis refers to the price you paid for your shares. That figure is adjusted upward for reinvested dividends and capital gains and any commissions or transaction fees you paid. What cost basis won't necessarily tell you is how much money you made on an investment.
In this case, you will need to know your cost basis to calculate the tax amount for which you are liable. Your investment has risen to $15,000 from $10,000, so you face capital gains tax on the $5,000 ($15 - $10 x 1,000 shares).
Cost basis is usually used to determine capital gains (or losses). To calculate capital gain, subtract the cost basis from the asset sales price. For example, if you sell 100 shares of XYZ for $1500 and want to calculate the capital gains, subtract the cost basis ($1000) to get a capital gain of $500.
The cost basis of the investment is $10,000, but it is more often expressed in terms of a per share basis, so for this investment it would be $10 ($10,000/1,000). After a year has passed, the value of the investment has risen to $15 per share, and you decide to sell.
Shares & Saves. Save. Cost basis is a measure of the amount of the original investment in a stock or other asset. It is often used to calculate capital gain or loss, especially for tax purposes. The gain or loss is the price which the asset was sold at minus the cost basis.
You can calculate you cost basis per share in two ways: First, you can take the original investment amount ($10,000) and divide it by the new amount of shares you hold (2,000 shares) to arrive at the new per share cost basis ($5 $10,000/2,000).
