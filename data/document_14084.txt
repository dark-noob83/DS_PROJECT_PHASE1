Of course, mice like dog food. Like people and like dogs, mice are omnivorous animals which means they eat a combination of vegetables and meat. If you look at the ingredients in a bag of food for pet mice at the pet store you will see that the ingredients are very similar to those in your pet’s dry food at home.
Mice are omnivorous, which means they eat a combination of meats and vegetables. Pet mice should eat a varied and balanced diet that includes fresh vegetables, protein, store-bought mice food, fresh water and treats. The varied diet will help keep your pet mouse healthy and aid in his development.
Crunchy Vegetables and Fruits. Pet mice will eat most kinds of vegetables, but they tend to enjoy crunchy ones more. Vegetables such as broccoli, carrots and celery contain a balance of vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates that are essential to keeping your pet mouse healthy. A piece of apple also serves as a healthy treat.
• Mice are naturally omnivorous scavengers, and quite good ones at that. Wild mice will eat almost anything they can find, but this doesn’t mean you should feed your pet mouse anything you like. Like any animal, mice have favorite foods, and foods that will make them sick. There are some general things you should feed your mouse for nutrition, but favorite snacks can vary from mouse to mouse. • The easiest way, is to simply buy prepared mouse food from your local pet store.
