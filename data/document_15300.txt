This food will only last a few days. 5 days in the refrigerator if the food is stored properly. Place in an air tight container for the best results. You can transfer the food … to the freezer if longer storage is needed. Temperature is probably the most critical factor in being able to store oranges for a long period of time.

A freezer that is mostly empty will not provide as much protection to keep foods frozen and the quality of insulation in the freezer walls, will also affect how long foods will stay frozen when the freezer is unplugged.

[Edited] I think 10 hours would be safe enough for most food: the first couple of hours the fridge will still be quite cold, and after that it takes more than a few ours for most food to spoil. When I leave milk out of the fridge for three hours at room temperature (say, 20 °C), nothing happens. I do this often. And the temperature inside the fridge will never reach room temperature in those 10 hours. When it is really hot in summer, it might spoil after 2 hours outside the fridge, but otherwise it takes much longer. Cheese, food in jars, sauces, leftover cooked food: none of these are more sensitive to spoiling than milk.
Bear in mind that a refrigerator continues to insulate even when it is off, so cold food inside a refrigerator can remain adequately cold for about 4 hours or even up to 6 hours, depending on the refrigerator itself, the ambient temperature, and the number of times the refrigerator door is opened.

The refrigerator: how long will foods remain safe without power? · All foods: at least 4 hours, if the fridge is left unopened. · Discard after 4 hours without power: Meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, cooked leftovers, soft cheeses, deli cold cuts/salads and other perishable foods. · Approximately 48 hours, if the freezer is full. · Approximately 24 hours, if the freezer is half-full. Keep the freezer door closed as much as possible to maintain its cold temperature.
Times are based on a refrigerator set at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or colder. Shelf life also depends on the freshness of foods at the time of purchase. 1  Cheese, hard: six months. 2  Butter: 1 to 3 months. 3  Olives and pickles: one month. 4  Fresh eggs (in shell): 3 to 5 weeks. 5  Cheese, soft, unopened: 3 to 4 weeks. 6  Cheese, soft, opened: 1 to 2 weeks. 7  Bacon, cooked: one week. 8  Hard-boiled eggs: one week
Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to maintain the cold temperature. The refrigerator will keep food safely cold for about 4 hours if it is unopened. A full freezer will hold the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if it is half full) if the door remains closed. And the temperature inside the fridge will never reach room temperature in those 10 hours. When it is really hot in summer, it might spoil after 2 hours outside the fridge, but otherwise it takes much longer. Cheese, food in jars, sauces, leftover cooked food: none of these are more sensitive to spoiling than milk.
