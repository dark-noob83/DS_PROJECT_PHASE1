A. While research has suggested that caffeine may slow down the progression of liver fibrosis, alcoholic cirrhosis and liver cancer 1,2,3,4,5,6 the extent to which caffeine is implicated in the reduced risk of developing these diseases remains unclear.
When caffeine enters the body, the liver releases enzymes to metabolize it before releasing it into the bloodstream. This can temporarily impair the liver's blood sugar uptake and release functions.
A study in a 2007 issue of Nigerian Journal of Physiological Sciences reports that caffeine may suppress liver scarring in patients with chronic liver disease. The buildup of scar tissue blocks blood flow to the liver, impairing the organ’s ability to function and heal itself.
Plasma caffeine concentration determined 12 h after administration of the test dosage discriminated best between patients with cirrhosis (5.4 +/- 1.6 mumol/l), patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (2.0 +/- 1.4 mumol/l) and healthy volunteers (0.8 +/- 0.2 mumol/l).
Many liver diseases cause scar tissue, known as fibrosis, to develop. In the early stages of fibrosis, the liver functions relatively well and few people experience symptoms. But as the inflammation and liver injury continue, scar tissue builds up.

Caffeine affects the blood sugar function of the liver, and it may help prevent diabetes or diabetes symptoms. Whether or not caffeine can help prevent liver disease is still a subject of much study.
Coffee consumption and liver function. Coffee and Health includes current scientific information on a wide range of coffee-related topics. One such topic addresses coffee consumption and liver function. This post provides an overview of this topic. Liver disease is estimated to affect 6% of the EU’s population.
