Difficulty passing urine. Difficulty passing urine can include: 1  having a weak flow (so it takes you longer than usual to go to the toilet). 2  having a flow that stops and starts.
Call your doctor if you notice urinary hesitancy, dribbling, or a weak urine stream. Call your doctor right away if: 1  You have a fever, vomiting, side or back pain, shaking chills, or are passing little urine for 1 to 2 days.
The most common cause of urinary hesitancy in older men is an enlarged prostate. Almost all older men have some trouble with dribbling, weak urine stream, and starting urination. Another common cause is infection of the prostate or urinary tract. Symptoms of a possible infection include: 1  Burning or pain with urination. 2  Frequent urination. 3  Cloudy urine. 4  Sense of urgency (strong, sudden urge to urinate).
When it becomes difficult to urinate, other symptoms such as dribbling (leaking or mild incontinence) and a weak urine stream may also be present. Certain medications can also cause problems with urination. Scar tissue from surgery or trauma can also cause problems with the flow of urine.
Urinary problems. Urine carries waste from your kidneys. This waste is stored in your bladder until it's passed from your body through a tube, called the urethra. Common urinary problems include frequent, painful, difficult and uncontrolled passing of urine.
