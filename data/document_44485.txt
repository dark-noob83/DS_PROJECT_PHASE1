Tax rates and insurance costs also affect how much you can buy depending on where you live. Not everyone chooses to purchase a new car, but Americans spend an average of $5,000 per year on gas and maintenance alone, as well as an average of $250 per month for a car payment. Vacations are another common expense that Americans rack up.
It's springtime, and you know that means: The return of your gas price nightmares. Hey, with the average American spending over $2,000 per year just to fill up the tank, we can't blame you. Based on recent estimates, the national average for a gallon of gasoline is roughly $3.74, FOX Business reports.
If you don’t keep track of your gas receipts, you might want to start. You're probably spending more on gas each month than you realize. A recent study the Oil Price Information Service did for CNNMoney found that the average American household spent $368.09 on gas in April. That’s college textbooks for one semester, two weeks of groceries or two 16 GB iPod Nanos.
Unfortunately, the nearly $370 or more you spend each month to fuel your car may only increase. Today, AAA reports that the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is just 1.5 cents shy of four dollars.
“The study, which compared average gas prices with median incomes nationwide,” writes CNNMoney, “also showed that U.S. households spent nearly 9% of their total income on gas last month.” That nine percent jump is $194.29 more than the $173.80 Americans spent in 2009.
The national average for gas spending is about $220 a month and married couples my age with kids tend to spend about $250. That’s interesting, but how does my personal gas spending stack up? Unfortunately, we’re above average, even for our particular location. We typically spend right around $275-$290 each month on gas.
The Energy Information Administration reported that the average household spent $2,912 on gasoline in 2012, or nearly four percent of their pre-tax income. In 2012, average gas prices came close to $3.70 per gallon.
