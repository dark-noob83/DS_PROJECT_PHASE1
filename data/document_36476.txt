Passport Renewal. Passport Renewals are for U.S. citizens that currently have a valid passport in their possession that was obtained after the age of 18. Please note that if your passport has expired more than 5 years ago you fall into the category of a New Passport Application.
The cost of a passport can vary depending on the type of service you require, how quickly you need to get the application processed and any additional services you might need. There is an application fee for most services ranging from only $15 for a passport card for a minor to $110 for a new passport or renewal.
The passport application fee and the execution fee (new passport only) are the only mandatory fees. There are several optional fees such as the ones for expedited service, overnight delivery and a file search. All the fees are listed below.
Costs for Minors. Passport holders younger than 16 are able to renew at a lower rate than adults. As of the time of publication, minors wishing to renew a passport book and card must pay $95, a minor passport book alone costs $80 and a minor passport card only is $15. In addition, all minors must pay a $25 execution fee designed to cover costs of a passport application.
Adult passport renewal for adults ages 16 and over is $110 if you are applying for the passport book alone. If you are applying for the passport card, along with the book, you will need to send in a fee of $140 along with your completed DS-82 form. When applying for the passport card alone, if you already have an active passport book, the cost for this renewal is $40.
Costs for Adults. Adult passport book and card combined renewals cost $140 as of the time of publication. The passport book only costs $110 for adults, and the card only costs $30. Adults renewing a passport do not have to pay an execution fee, although this is paid at the time of first application.
