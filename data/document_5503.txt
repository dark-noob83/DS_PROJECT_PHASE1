Hemoglobin is a molecule that is within a red blood cell. Each red blood cell is about one third hemoglobin by volume. Each red blood cell can carry four hemoglobin molecules. Hemoglobin is responsible for the color of blood. When they put that thing on the tip of your finger at the ER they are measuring the percentage of hemoglobin's that are in red blood cells
Beta-globin is a component (subunit) of a larger protein called hemoglobin, which is located inside red blood cells. In adults, hemoglobin normally consists of four protein subunits: two subunits of beta-globin and two subunits of another protein called alpha-globin, which is produced from another gene called HBA. More than 10 mutations in the HBB gene have been found to cause methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type, which is a condition that alters the hemoglobin within red blood cells. These mutations often affect the region of the protein that binds to heme.
In mammals, the protein makes up about 96% of the red blood cells' dry content (by weight), and around 35% of the total content (including water). Hemoglobin has an oxygen-binding capacity of 1.34 mL O 2 per gram, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventy-fold compared to dissolved oxygen in blood. 1 Hemoglobin S (α 2 β S 2) – A variant form of hemoglobin found in people with sickle cell disease. 2  There is a variation in the β-chain gene, causing a change in the properties of hemoglobin, which results in sickling of red blood cells.
Myoglobin is an iron-and oxygen-binding protein found in the muscle tissue of vertebrates in general and in almost all mammals. It is related to hemoglobin, which is the iron-and oxygen-binding protein in blood, specifically in the red blood cells. In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury. It is an abnormal finding, and can be diagnostically relevant when found in blood
Hemoglobin (or haemoglobin, frequently abbreviated as Hb), which is contained in red blood cells, serves as the oxygen carrier in blood. The name hemoglobin comes from heme and globin, since each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embedded heme (or haem) group. Each heme group contains an iron atom, and this is responsible for the binding of oxygen.
hemoglobin (hēˈməglōˌbĭn) [ key ], respiratory protein found in the red blood cells (erythrocytes) of all vertebrates and some invertebrates. A hemoglobin molecule is composed of a protein group, known as globin, and four heme groups, each associated with an iron atom. In the lungs, each iron atom combines reversibly with a molecule of oxygen. Each hemoglobin molecule also has attached a single cysteine amino acid, which attracts nitric oxide from the lung
Hemoglobin in the blood carries oxygen from the respiratory organs (lungs or gills) to the rest of the body (i.e. the tissues). There it releases the oxygen to permit aerobic respiration to provide energy to power the functions of the organism in the process called metabolism. 1 Hemoglobin S (α 2 β S 2) – A variant form of hemoglobin found in people with sickle cell disease. 2  There is a variation in the β-chain gene, causing a change in the properties of hemoglobin, which results in sickling of red blood cells.
Hemoglobin and hemoglobin-like molecules are also found in many invertebrates, fungi, and plants. In these organisms, hemoglobins may carry oxygen, or they may act to transport and regulate other things such as carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfide. 1 Hemoglobin S (α 2 β S 2) – A variant form of hemoglobin found in people with sickle cell disease. 2  There is a variation in the β-chain gene, causing a change in the properties of hemoglobin, which results in sickling of red blood cells.
Hemoglobin is also found outside red blood cells and their progenitor lines. Other cells that contain hemoglobin include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, macrophages, alveolar cells, and mesangial cells in the kidney. 1 Hemoglobin S (α 2 β S 2) – A variant form of hemoglobin found in people with sickle cell disease. 2  There is a variation in the β-chain gene, causing a change in the properties of hemoglobin, which results in sickling of red blood cells.
