Biography. Glass artist Beth Lipman is renowned for her sculptural compositions which recreate the bounty and visual sumptuousness of Renaissance and Baroque still-life paintings, particularly 17th-century Dutch scenes.
Organized by Museum of Glass. American artist Beth Lipman is known for her complex clear glass assemblages comprising fruits, flowers and topiary forms; Scandinavian artist Ingalena Klenell is recognized for her kiln-formed clear glass often overlaid with lacework patterns.
Beth Lipman (born 1971) uses the vocabulary of the still life, particularly the table setting with its various vessels, foods, and associated objects, in complex sculptures created in clear glass. For Lipman, the still life operates as a commentary on our current consumer culture.

Beth Lipman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1971. The artist now lives and works in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin. Optimizing glass’s clarity, fragility, and absence of color, Beth Lipman’s opulent sculptures and photographs of meticulous, glass-based compositions are a contemporary response to and homage of still life paintings from the seventeenth–twentieth centuries.
