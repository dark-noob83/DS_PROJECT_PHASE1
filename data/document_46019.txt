Abnormal Results. The normal amount of glucose in urine is 0 to 0.8 mmol/L (millimoles per liter). Any number higher than this could indicate a problem. The most common diagnosis, confirmed by a simple blood test, is diabetes.
In urine, there should not be any signs of glucose. Even if there exists urine, it will be in the small range of 0-15 mg/dl. There is no such thing as normal glucose levels in urine, because glucose is not supposed to be present in urine, in the first place.
Glucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed. Normal glucose range in urine: 0 - 0.8 mmol/l (0 - 15 mg/dL). The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.

A urine glucose test is used to indirectly determine whether your levels of glucose, or blood sugar, are within a healthy range. It's used to monitor both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If your blood glucose rises above normal, your kidneys get rid of the extra glucose in your urine.
