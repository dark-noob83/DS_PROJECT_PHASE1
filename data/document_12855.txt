PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). is a revolutionary method developed by Kary Mullis in the 1980s. PCR is based on using the ability of DNA polymerase to synthesize new strand of DNA complementary to the offered template strand.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an in vitro DNA amplification protocol. It selectively amplifies a specific DNA sequence from any source (i.e. virus, bacteria, plant, human) hundreds of millions of times in a matter of hours.
The annealing temperature (typically between 48-72°C) is related to the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers and must be determined for each primer pair used in PCR. During the extension step (typically 68-72°C) the polymerase extends the primer to form a nascent DNA strand.
· Cycling temperatures: Of the three temperatures used in a cycle of PCR, the denaturing and extension temperatures remain unchanged for the most part, since most DNA is denatured at 94-95 degrees C, and the temperature optimum for the Taq DNA polymerase lies between 72 and 74 degrees C.
PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction, a method for amplifying DNA in vitro. Where, in cloning DNA into a plasmid, the DNA is amplified by the bacterial cell when it replicates the plasmid, PCR amplifies DNA in a test-tube.
Since PCR is, basically, replication of DNA in a test-tube, all the usual ingredients needed for DNA replication are required: A template (the DNA that is being copied) Primers (to initiate the synthesis of the new DNA strands) DNA polymerase (to carry out the synthesis) dNTPs (nucleotide precursors).
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1 is a trick for producing relatively large amounts of a specific DNA or RNA sequence from only a few molecules of template. (Keep in mind that relatively large amounts typically means µg of the DNA or RNA.) Thus, PCR is said to amplify a particular sequence.
PCR. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method to rapidly amplify sequences of DNA. During a typical PCR, template DNA (containing the region of interest) is mixed with deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), a DNA polymerase and primers.
