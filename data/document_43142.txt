concentric contraction, a common form of muscle contraction that occurs in rhythmic activities when the muscle fibers shorten as tension develops. Compare eccentric contraction. See also isotonic exercise.
An isotonic contraction can be concentric, which is where the muscle shortens as the fibres contract or eccentric, where the fibres contract as the muscle lengthens. When a muscle contracts with no resulting movement, it is an isometric contraction. Page: 1  1. 2  2. 3  3. 4  4. 5  5. 6  Back. 7  Next.
(concentric action) the 'true' form of contraction of a muscle in which it shortens against a load (which may be only that of gravity on the relevant body part), and so does positive work. Hence concentric exercise: that in which the principal agonists act concentrically. See also muscle contraction.
medical: a movement of a muscle that causes it to become tight and that is sometimes painful; especially: a movement of muscles in the womb when a woman is giving birth to a child. : a short form of a word or word group that is made by leaving out a sound or letter.
Muscles and movement. In a tug of war muscles contract isometrically. Muscles contract [Contract: A muscle tenses as fibres shorten. ] when they work. If a muscle contracts to create movement, it is called an isotonic contraction.
