Really, it's more of a drying aid, but that just doesn't have the same ring to it. Anyway, rinse aid solutions contain chemicals called surfactants, which lower the surface tension of water. So instead of forming droplets, the water spreads into thinner sheets that roll right off your dishes. If you’ve ever used Rain-X on your car’s windshield, you'll have a good idea of what this looks like. Once again, the name rinse aid doesn't really evoke this delightful reality.
