Principle. This test depends on the presence of cytochrome oxidase in bacteria that will catalyze the transport of electrons between electron donors and redox dye. Tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine dihydrochloride in the reagent is reduced to deep purple color.
The oxidase test identifies organisms that produce the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. Cytochrome oxidase participates in the electron transport chain by transferring electrons from a donor molecule to oxygen.
1 The oxidase test is a biochemical reaction that assays for the presence of cytochrome oxidase, an enzyme sometimes called indophenol oxidase. 2  In the presence of an organism that contains the cytochrome oxidase enzyme, the reduced colorless reagent becomes an oxidized colored product.
Development of the blue color is positive for presence of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. The color change does not occur in a negative test. Because of the expense and instability of oxidase reagent, this test is rarely performed in that manner.
Purpose. 1  The oxidase test is a biochemical reaction that assays for the presence of cytochrome oxidase, an enzyme sometimes called indophenol oxidase. 2  In the presence of an organism that contains the cytochrome oxidase enzyme, the reduced colorless reagent becomes an oxidized colored product.
The oxidase test is used to identify bacteria that produce cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme of the bacterial electron transport chain.
The oxidase test is used to identify bacteria that produce cytochrome c oxidase, an enzyme of the bacterial electron transport chain. (note: All bacteria that are oxidase positive are aerobic, and can use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor in respiration. This does NOT mean that they are strict aerobes.
