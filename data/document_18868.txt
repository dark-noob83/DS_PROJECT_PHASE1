Describe how Mendeleev organized the elements into rows and columns in his periodic table. Mendeleev arranged the elements in rows in order of increasing mass so that elements with similar properties were in the same column.
He realised that the physical and chemical properties of elements were related to their atomic mass in a 'periodic' way, and arranged them so that groups of elements with similar properties fell into vertical columns in his table.
For example, iodine has a lower relative atomic mass than tellurium, so it should come before tellurium in Mendeleev's table-but in order to get iodine in the same group as other elements with similar properties such as fluorine, chlorine and bromine, he had to put it after tellurium, so breaking his own rules.

Mendeleev arranged the elements into rows in order of increasing mass so that elements with similar properties were in the same column. Section 5.1 â€“ Organizing the Elements. A periodic table is an arrangement of elements in columns, based on a set of properties that repeat from row to row.
