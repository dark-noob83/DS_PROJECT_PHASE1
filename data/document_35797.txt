Over 375 million people speak English as their first language (third in rank of total native speakers after Chinese and Spanish), and it is the number one second language to learn.
Estimates of the number of English speakers who are second language and foreign-language speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1,000 million depending on how proficiency is defined. Linguist David Crystal estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.
