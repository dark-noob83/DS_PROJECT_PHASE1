This is called a 'brood patch'. Different birds sit on their eggs for different lengths of time. Bigger birds lay bigger eggs which take longer to hatch. Blue tits incubate their eggs for two weeks but swans sit on theirs for nearly six weeks! Most birds lay one egg a day until the eggs are all laid. Some birds lay up to 15 eggs but others lay only one. But the parent birds do not start to incubate the eggs until they
12 - 14 days   Both male and female bluebirds take turns incubating their eggs for about (13 to 15 days) or two weeks. Young bluebirds grow fast, but they usually … cannot fly on their own until about 20 days.
Even if you were successful in getting an egg to hatch, the survival chances of the young nestling would be minimal at best. Feeding a nestling would require a commitment of 16 hours a day 7 days a week for 2 weeks on average. Dietary needs of baby birds vary with species. Not all birds eat worms.
They will sit on it when they are ready. The incubation will take about 15 days for the eggs to fully hatch. Dove eggs do not have a waterproof membrane like chicken eggs so it is important not to get a dove egg wet. Anything you put on the egg will penetrate the shell and affect the baby inside.
Record the day and how many eggs you've incubated on a calendar. You should be able to estimate your hatch date based on average incubation times for the bird species you want to hatch. For example, chicken eggs typically take 21 days to hatch, whereas many duck varieties and peafowl may take 28 days.
Turkey eggs usually take 21 to 28 days to hatch depending on what they are incubated in like an incubator or by a hen. It also depends on how fertile it is and how it is cared … for. It usually takes closer to 28 days.
