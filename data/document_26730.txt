In accounting, salaries are recorded in payroll accounts. Salary is a fixed amount of money or compensation paid to an employee by an employer in return for work performed. Salary is commonly paid in fixed intervals, for example, monthly payments of one-twelfth of the annual salary. A general rule for comparing periodic salaries to hourly wages is based on a standard 40 hour work week with 50 weeks per year (minus two weeks for vacation). (Example: $40,000/year periodic salary divided by 50 weeks equals $800/week. Divide $800/week by 40 standard hours equals $20/hour)

The employee is entitled to an additional one-half times this regular rate for each hour over 40, plus the full piecework earnings. Example: An employee paid on a piecework basis works 45 hours in a week and earns $405. The regular rate of pay for that week is $405 divided by 45, or $9.00 an hour. Nonexempt workers must be paid overtime pay at a rate of not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay after 40 hours of work in a workweek. Wages required by the FLSA are due on the regular payday for the pay period covered.
For example, an employee may be hired to work a 45 hour workweek for. a weekly salary of $405. In this instance the regular rate is obtained by dividing the $405 straight-time salary by. 45 hours, resulting in a regular rate of $9.00. Similarly, where an agreement provides for 6 hours pay at $13.00 an hour regardless of the time actually spent for work on a job performed during overtime hours, the entire $78.00 must be included in determining the employees' regular rate.
Report Abuse. You can say you were paid a flat fee for the work. Then, enter a typical amount with the most applicable description. For example, $100/per design. (just guessing here, but you get the idea) Enter the information in such a way that it is likely to correspond with the manner in which it might be verified
Under this agreement, the regular rate will vary in overtime weeks. If the employee works 50 hours, the regular rate is $9.60 ($480 divided by 50 hours). In addition to the salary, half the regular rate, or $4.80, is due for each of the 10 overtime hours, for a total of $528 for the week. Nonexempt workers must be paid overtime pay at a rate of not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay after 40 hours of work in a workweek. Wages required by the FLSA are due on the regular payday for the pay period covered.
Definition. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, when an employee is paid on a salary basis, this means essentially that she receives regular pay on a regular basis, and that this amount doesn't fluctuate in regard to the quality or quantity of work actually performed.
