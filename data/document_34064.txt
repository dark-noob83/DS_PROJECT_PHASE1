They will usually lay an egg each day up to about 5-7 eggs. Depending on when the hen begins to incubate them in earnest (usually after the second or third egg is laid) you can expect them to begin hatching after about 15-17 days. You will need to beef up their diet and begin feeding them some soft foods.
12 - 14 days   Both male and female bluebirds take turns incubating their eggs for about (13 to 15 days) or two weeks. Young bluebirds grow fast, but they usually â€¦ cannot fly on their own until about 20 days.
Egg Laying and Incubation. Soon after the nest is finished, the female will begin laying one pale blue egg a day in the morning over the duration of about a week. After ALL of the eggs have been laid (usually 4-6), she then begins to incubate them for 13-14 days, taking breaks to go feed. During the week while the female bluebird is egg laying she spends very little time at the nestbox, so if you see eggs and no female around at this time do not conclude the nest is abandoned.
