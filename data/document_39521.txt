b= A chemical metallic bond is formed when two metallic atoms share the valence electrons. A point noteworthy is, the valence electronics of any region of the metal atoms can be shared to form metallic bonds. examples: Any metallic element has metallic bonds: Copper, zinc, sodium, lithium, francium, iron, cobalt, calcium, magnesium, silver, gold, barium, platinum, chromium are a few.

Metallic bonding is the principal force holding together the atoms of a metal. A metallic bond results from the sharing of a variable number of electrons by a variable number of atoms. The force that binds together the atoms of metals is called metallic bond.
The structure of a metallic bond is quite different from covalent and ionic bonds. In a metallic bond, the valence electrons are delocalised, meaning that an atom's electrons do not stay around that one nucleus.
Metallic Bond. a= metallic bond is formed in metals. Let's take the example of copper. The copper atoms are arranged in a certain manner in a copper metal. Here the valence electrons are free to move around in a piece of
The metallic bond is a unique type of chemical bond found in metal elements. In a sample of metal, the valence electrons detach from the atoms and are free to move throughout the metal. This results in a sea of electrons, or big pool of delocalized or valence electrons. The sea of electrons is negative and the metal atoms have become positive ions. The attraction between the two parts of the metal is the metallic bond. This special type of bond gives metals unique properties.
