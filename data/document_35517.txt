That's the green fee. An individual course's green fees typically vary depending on time of week, time of day and status of the golfer.

Juniors and seniors often receive discounts. And anyone with a club membership will pay less than a guest. Also, many courses offer 9-hole and 18-hole green fees, the 9-hole fees obviously being lower. Some courses are even starting offer 12-hole rates. There is no standard green fee for golf courses.
