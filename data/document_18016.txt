In November 1970, the Bhola Cyclone smashed into East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Bengal (a province in northeastern India) and killed at least 500,000 people (although the true death toll will never be known). Bhola is widely regarded as the deadliest tropical cyclone in recorded history. The cyclone also played a part in leading to the independence of East Pakistan from its rulers in West Pakistan.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The 1970 Bhola cyclone was a devastating tropical cyclone that struck East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and India 's West Bengal on 12 November 1970. It remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded, and second most deadliest natural disasters in modern times. Up to 500,000 people lost their lives in the storm, primarily as a result of the storm surge that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the Ganges Delta.
Thirty-five percent of the area is less than 6 m (20 ft) above sea level, and over 20% of the entire country is submerged beneath annual river floods in an average year. The 575 km (360 mi)-long coastline is contoured in such a way that it funnels cyclones from the warm waters of the Bay of Bengal into the area. With it, the cyclone brought a 6 m (20 ft)- storm surge and average winds in excess of 225.3 km/h (140 mph). Although meteorologists knew of the approaching storm, there was no way to communicate to most of those living in the coastal plain and on the islands of the Ganges River delta.
The Great Bhola Cyclone started forming on November 11th, 1970 in the Bay of Bengal. Once the Great Bhola Cyclone started to develop, it travelled north with rapid wind speeds up to 185 km/h and hit eastern Pakistan which is now Bangladesh. 
The 1970 Bhola cyclone was the strongest storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. The Bhola cyclone made landfall in East Pakistan (today known as Bangladesh). Since the Bhola cyclone killed from 300,000 to 500,000 people, the Bhola cyclone holds the world record as the deadliest storm. Most of the people that were killed, were killed in East Pakistan (Bangladesh), because of the storm surge that caused flooding. 
The Bhola cyclone was a devastating tropical cyclone that struck on 12 November 1970 at East Pakistan and the State of West Bengal, India. The cyclone formed over the central Bay of Bengal on 8 November and travelled north and reached its peak with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) on 12 November and made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan that night.
Edit 0 12 â€¦. The 1970 Bhola cyclone was a tropical cyclone that hit current day Bangladesh, but at the time was East Pakistan. The cyclone reeked havoc on many different cities in East Pakistan and neighboring communities, killing as many as 500,000 people. 
In November 1970, the Bhola Cyclone smashed into East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Bengal (India) and killed at least 500,000 people (although the true death toll will never be known). By comparison, Hurricane Katrina in the southern U.S. killed less than 2,000 people in August 2005. 
Build up to the Great Bhola Cyclone. On the morning of 8 November 1970 a major cyclone formed over the central Bay of Bengal. This new and deadly cyclone possibly resulted from the tropical storm that arose in the South China Sea and then moved west over the Malay Peninsula on 5 November 1970 into the Bay of Bengal. This unnamed cyclone intensified from 8 November to 11 November 1970 and head northward towards East Pakistan
The 1970 Bhola cyclone was a devastating tropical cyclone that struck East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and India's West Bengal on November 12, 1970. It was the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded, and one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern times. This cyclone was the sixth cyclonic storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, and also the season's strongest, reaching a strength equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane. The cyclone formed over the central Bay of Bengal on November 8 and travelled north, intensifying as it did so.
