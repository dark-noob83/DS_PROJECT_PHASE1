The Anion Gap is an approximate measurement of ions, that is molecules with a charge, either negative or positive. Sodium and potassium are positively charged and therefore called cations; this is why they are often represented as Na+ and K+ respectively. These two are the main cations measured in the blood.
The anion gap blood test is a calculated value that comes from the results of an individual’s electrolyte panel. It is used to determine what a person’s anion and non-anion gap happens to be in regards to excess acid levels that may exist in the body.
Anion gap: A measurement of the interval between the sum of routinely measured cations minus the sum of the routinely measured anions in the blood. The anion gap = (Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-) where Na-is sodium, K+ is potassium, Cl-is chloride, and HCO3- is bicarbonate. The anion gap can be normal, high, or low.
Answers. Best Answer: An anion gap is the sum of routinely measured cations minus the routinely measured anions in blood. It is measured because it is often the first laboratory sign of an acid-base disorder. The normal range is 5 - 16 mmol/L.
Anions are electrons that have a negative charge. They differ from cations which have a positive charge. In medical terms, the anion gap is the difference between the amount of anions and cations in a person's blood. The anion gap may be high, normal or low. This difference may be caused by diabetes or by a condition known as acidosis.
