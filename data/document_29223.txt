Read on………… “In October 1908, the first Model T Fords were sold for $950. As Henry Ford found new ways to reduce production costs, he passed the savings on to consumers as lower prices. By 1912, the car was selling for $575.
The Model T made its debut in 1908 with a purchase price of $825.00. Over ten thousand were sold in its first year, establishing a new record. Four years later the price dropped to $575.00 and sales soared. By 1914, Ford could claim a 48% share of the automobile market.
When the Model T was introduced in 1908, it was only available in 4 colors, none of which were black. From 1908 to 1914 the Model T was available in green, blue, red, and grey … . In 1912, all Model T cars were midnight blue with black fenders.
When it sold for $575 in 1912, the Model T for the first time cost less than the prevailing average annual wage in the United States. Ignoring conventional wisdom, Ford continually sacrificed profit margins to increase sales. In fact, profits per car did fall as he slashed prices from $220 in 1909 to $99 in 1914.
Best Answer: Over 15 million Model Ts were produced/ sold between 1908 –1927. The cost to produce the Model T varied by year. The reason is Henry Ford constantly found ways to reduce production costs through the years. Most notably, he did this with the introduction of the moving/ mechanized assembly line in 1913.
Today, the average price of a new car is $23,543. Prior to the introduction of the Model T Ford, the average price for a new car in 1908, adjusted for inflation was $43,950. The Model T cost $950 new in 1908, which is almost $20,000 in today’s dollars. However, due to constant improvements in and optimization of Ford’s assembly line, the Model T’s cost declined through the years until it cost less than $300 in the 1920s.
Henry Ford, however, did not want anything in the price of a Model T except good value. His solution was a bold stroke that reverberated through the entire nation. On January 5, 1914, Henry Ford announced a new minimum wage of five dollars per eight-hour day, in addition to a profit-sharing plan.
