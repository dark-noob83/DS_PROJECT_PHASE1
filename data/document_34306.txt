The QRS interval represents the time it takes for depolarization of the ventricles. Normal depolarization requires normal function of the right and left bundle branches. The QRS duration may vary with the size of the heart and is longer in the base-apex lead. 
The QRS complex is a name for the combination of three of the graphical deflections seen on a typical electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) . It is usually the central and most visually obvious part of the tracing. It corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left ventricles of the human heart. In adults, it normally lasts 0.06–0.10 s; in children and during physical activity, it may be shorter. Typically an ECG has five deflections, arbitrarily named P to T waves.
QT Interval. (measured from beginning of QRS to end of T wave in the frontal plane). 1  Normal: heart rate dependent (corrected QT = QT c = measured QT, sq-root RR in seconds; upper limit for QT c = 0.44 sec).
Schematic representation of normal ECG trace (sinus rhythm), with waves, segments, and intervals labeled. In cardiology, the QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. Upper limit of normal QT interval, corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula, Fridericia's formula and subtracting 0.02 s from QT for every 10 bpm increase in heart rate. Up to 0.42 s (≤420 ms) is chosen as normal QTc of QT B and QT F in this diagram.
Calculating QT interval duration Count the number of squares from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Multiply this number by 0.04 second. The normal range is 0.36 to 0.44 second, or 9 to 11 small squares wide. 
1 normal PR interval. 2  0.12 to 0.20 s (3 - 5 small squares). 3  for short PR segment consider Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome (other causes-Duchenne muscular dystrophy, type II glycogen storage disease (Pompe's), HOCM). 4  for long PR interval see first degree heart block and 'trifasicular' block. 1 0.12 to 0.20 s (3 - 5 small squares). 2  for short PR segment consider Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome (other causes-Duchenne muscular dystrophy, type II glycogen storage disease (Pompe's), HOCM). 3
The P-R Interval. The first measurement is known as the P-R interval and is measured from the beginning of the upslope of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS wave. This measurement should be 0.12-0.20 seconds, or 3-5 small squares in duration. The second measurement is the width of the QRS which should be less than 3 small squares, or less than 0.12 seconds in duration. Image: Normal Intervals. 1  P-R interval = 0.12 - 0.20 sec (3 - 5 small squares). 2  QRS width = 0.08 - 0.12 sec (2 - 3 small squares). 3  Q-T interval 0.35 - 0.43 sec. 1 P-R interval = 0.12 - 0.20 sec (3 - 5 small squares). 2  QRS width = 0.08 - 0.12 sec (2 - 3 small squares). 3  Q-T interval 0.35 - 0.43 sec. * 4  The PR interval should really be referred to as the PQ interval; however it is commonly referred as the PR interval.
1 The normal QRS axis range (+90° to -30°); this implies that the QRS be mostly positive (upright) in leads II and I. 2  right of +60°. 3  Septal q waves should not be confused with the pathologic Q waves of myocardial infarction. 4  Precordial leads: (see Normal ECG). 5  Small r-waves begin in V1 or V2 and progress in size to V5. 
Prolonged QRS duration indicates abnormal conduction through the His-Purkinje system leading to longer period of depolarization. QT interval varies by heart rate, therefore, corrected QT interval (QTc) is used instead. A normal QTc should be less than 0.42 sec in men and less than 0.45 sec in women. The QRS axis in this ECG is 150 degrees: Heart Rhythm. A normal heart rhythm is when the origin of the impulse is from the sinus node (sinus rhythm) with normal AV conduction. Therefore, a normal heart rhythm is when the P wave axis is normal + Normal AV conduction (PR interval) + Normal heart rate for age.
