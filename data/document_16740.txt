It's available in tablet form and is also sold in combination with omeprazole (Prilosec) as the over-the-counter (OTC) drug Zegerid for acid reflux.
No. Sodium, or Na, is an element on the periodic table. Sodium bicarbonate is also known as baking soda and is a compound made of sodium, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. Sodium Chloride vs Sodium bicarbonate Sodium chloride is NaCl, Sodium bicarbonate is NaHCO3. It is a salt of Hydrochloric acid, It is a salt of Carbonic acid. It is Sali … ne in taste, It is slightly bitter in taste. It cannot act as a base, It mostly acts as a base.
Baking soda is a white crystalline powder (NaHCO 3) better known to chemists as sodium bicarbonate, bicarbonate of soda, sodium hydrogen carbonate, or sodium acid carbonate. A key step in the process occurs in the carbonating tower. Here, the saturated soda ash solution moves from the top of the tower downward. As it falls, the solution cools and reacts with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate crystals—baking soda.
Sodium bicarbonate is the chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3. Because it has long been known and is widely used, the salt has many other names including sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium bicarb, baking soda, bread soda, cooking soda, bicarb soda, saleratus or bicarbonate of soda. 
Summary: A saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate is reacted with hydrochloric acid to form carbon dioxide gas. Universal indicator can be used to show the change in pH of the solution or an inflating balloon can be used to demonstrate the associated work done by the evolving gas. 
Answer 3: Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate: each molecule of baking soda contains a sodium atom, a hydrogen atom, an oxygen atom, and a carbon dioxide molecule. Vinegar contains acetic acid, each molecule of which contains a hydrogen atom, and an acetate ion. Baking soda and vinegar react with each other because of an acid-base reaction. Baking soda is a bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) and vinegar is an acetic acid (HCH 3 COO). One of the products this reaction creates is carbon dioxide.
Descriptions. Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, is used to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, or acid indigestion by neutralizing excess stomach acid. When used for this purpose, it is said to belong to the group of medicines called antacids. It may be used to treat the symptoms of stomach or duodenal ulcers.

Sodium bicarbonate (IUPAC name: sodium hydrogen carbonate) is a chemical compound with the formula Na HCO3. Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite. It is a component of the mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral springs. NaHCO 3 is mainly prepared by the Solvay process, which is the reaction of sodium chloride, ammonia, and carbon dioxide in water. Calcium carbonate is used as the source of CO 2 and the resultant calcium oxide is used to recover the ammonia from the ammonium chloride. The product shows a low purity (75%).
