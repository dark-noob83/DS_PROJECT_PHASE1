It rises from a smooth plain 1,500 feet above sea level, to an elevation that varies between 2,200 and 2,400 feet above sea level (660m and 720m). What is known as the Turtle's Head at the western end of Turtle Mountain is the second highest point in all of Manitoba at 2,450 feet (735m). 
As a result of this heavier precipitation, the Turtle Mountains are forested. They cover an area of about a thousand square miles, half in North Dakota, half in Manitoba and this, along with river bottom land and the forested Pembina Hills area to the east, is one of the few wooded areas in the region. The entire elevated region is about nine miles long and six miles wide. The highest elevation in the area is 3,314 feet, 192 feet lower than the highest point in the state (White Butte). The term Killdeer presumably is a translation of a Sioux phrase Tah-kah-p-kuty (the place where they kill the deer).
Since the Turtle Mountains rise 600 to 800 feet above the surrounding area, and since ice 200 or 300 feet thick will flow under its own weight, glacial flow continued for awhile on either side of the Turtle Mountains. The entire elevated region is about nine miles long and six miles wide. The highest elevation in the area is 3,314 feet, 192 feet lower than the highest point in the state (White Butte). The term Killdeer presumably is a translation of a Sioux phrase Tah-kah-p-kuty (the place where they kill the deer).

The term Killdeer presumably is a translation of a Sioux phrase Tah-kah-p-kuty (the place where they kill the deer).
These glaciers shaped the topography of the Turtle Mountains. The receding glaciers created an elevated terrain of rolling “turtle back” hills and scooped-out lakes, resulting in an area of scenic beauty unequaled in the state or region. The Turtle Mountain Reservation is in the Manitoba Escarpment. The hills of the Turtle Mountains range from 200 to 600 feet above the surrounding plains and from 1700 feet to 2300 feet above sea level. The last ice age sculpted the northern half of the Turtle Mountains with hills of sand and gravel.
