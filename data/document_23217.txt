Audio. There are five different species of baboons. All of them live in Africa or Arabia. Baboons are some of the world's largest monkeys, and males of different species average from 33 to 82 pounds (15 to 37 kilograms). Baboon bodies are 20 to 40 inches (60 to 102 centimeters) long, not including substantial tails of varying lengths. Size relative to a 6-ft (2-m) man:
It is also important to realize that any deterrent that causes harm to a baboon (e.g. loss of a limb or eye) may increase that animal's reliance on easily obtainable food and therefore result in it increasing its raiding activity. This method causes pain to the animal and there is a risk of injuring a baboon, especially the eyes. A strike to an infant's head may cause serious injury. Also, the efficacy of this method may decrease over time due to habituation. Baboons may simply return later, when the bearer of the catapult is no longer present.
Tips. 1  Monkeys often enter homes through the kitchen in search of food. 2  Never show your teeth. 3  Long hair is dangerous. 4  Be the bigger primate. 5  Never tease or provoke a monkey/primate, they can read it as aggressive behavior and act on it. 6  Always keep your distance, they are wild animals and needs to be respected. 7  Avoid eye contact as this is a 8  ...

How it is supposed to work: These bins are designed to prevent baboons from opening them and accessing organic waste that they will eat. Well-designed and properly used baboon proof bins work very well. Through trial and error, baboons learn how to open poorly designed or improperly used bins. This method causes pain to the animal and there is a risk of injuring a baboon, especially the eyes. A strike to an infant's head may cause serious injury. Also, the efficacy of this method may decrease over time due to habituation. Baboons may simply return later, when the bearer of the catapult is no longer present.

What it is: Shoot and kill one baboon as a warning to the other baboons to stay off your property. How it is supposed to work: This idea assumes that baboons are able to make the association between one baboon being shot and a similar consequence for themselves if they enter the same property.

Also, the efficacy of this method may decrease over time due to habituation. Baboons may simply return later, when the bearer of the catapult is no longer present.
Baboons are known as the most vicious of the apes. This, as with the leopard and the cape buffalo, is not because of some innate lust to wreck mayhem on all sides. Rather; it is because the baboon defends itself so well, and the baboon has the most powerful jaws of all apes, with perhaps the exception of the gorilla. There are a good number of baboons which have learned just how to gross out tourists. In the game parks of Kenya, you may drive through the parks in your car, and the animals are roaming free and living a fairly normal existence.
