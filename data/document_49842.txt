Correcting an Excess Roth IRA Contribution. “Way back in January, I maxed out my Roth for the year. Income-wise it turned out to be a better year than I expected and now, barring an immediate layoff, my income for 2013 will be too high to actually be eligible for Roth contributions. I’ve read that it’s a 6% tax if I just leave the money there. Some taxpayers will find that, after recharacterizing the contribution as a traditional IRA contribution, they will then want to convert it to a Roth IRA as a part of a “back-door Roth” strategy.
Excess Contributions to Roth IRAs. Example: Suppose you contribute $5,500 to a Roth IRA early in 2014, expecting your modified AGI to be below the income limitation for Roth IRA contributions. At the end of the year you find that your modified AGI is higher than expected and your Roth IRA contribution limit is $3,500. You’re treated as if you originally contributed $3,500 to the Roth IRA and $2,000 to the traditional IRA. Note: Some people mistakenly believe a recharacterization can be used only as a way to undo a Roth conversion, but it can also be used to change the type of IRA to which a contribution was made.
For example, suppose you made a $3,000 annual contribution to a Roth IRA early in 2003, then got a larger bonus than you expected and found that your permitted contribution was only $1,800. Your excess contribution was $1,200. If you didn't correct the excess contribution for 2003, you had to pay $72 excess contribution tax (6% of $1,200). And if you left the problem uncorrected beyond the end of 2004, you owe another $72.
For example, say your contribution limit is $6,500 and you put in $5,500 in your traditional IRA and carry over $1,000 of traditional IRA contributions that were excess contributions in the prior year. Say you contributed $1,000 too much in the first year and that your contribution limit is $6,500 in the second year. If you contribute $5,500 or less in your second year, that excess will be absorbed by your remaining contribution limit.
Example: Samantha contributes $5,500 to her Roth IRA in 2013, but, due to unexpectedly high income, she turned out to be ineligible to make a Roth IRA contribution. In 2014, however, her income is significantly lower, and she is eligible to contribute the full $5,500. Some taxpayers will find that, after recharacterizing the contribution as a traditional IRA contribution, they will then want to convert it to a Roth IRA as a part of a “back-door Roth” strategy.
Example: Suppose you contributed $3,000 to a Roth IRA early in 2004, expecting your modified AGI to be less than $150,000 (married filing jointly). At the end of the year you find that your modified AGI is $152,500 and your Roth IRA contribution limit is $2,250. Before April 15, 2005 you have the trustee of your Roth IRA transfer $750 plus the earnings attributable to that $750 directly to a traditional IRA. Your excess contribution was $1,200. If you didn't correct the excess contribution for 2003, you had to pay $72 excess contribution tax (6% of $1,200). And if you left the problem uncorrected beyond the end of 2004, you owe another $72.
Contributing to a Traditional and a Roth IRA in the Same Year If an individual chooses to contribute to both a traditional and a Roth IRA for the same tax year, the combined contribution should not exceed $5,500/$6,500. He contributes $2,500 to his Traditional IRA and $4,500 to his Roth IRA. This is $500 in excess of the allowable limit. Because contributions are applied to Traditional IRAs before they are applied to Roth IRAs, the $500 excess is deemed to occur in the Roth IRA.
1 For 2004, the limit is $3,000 ($3,500 if 50 or older by the end of the year). 2  Your total annual contributions to traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs exceed your taxable compensation income for the year. Your excess contribution was $1,200. If you didn't correct the excess contribution for 2003, you had to pay $72 excess contribution tax (6% of $1,200). And if you left the problem uncorrected beyond the end of 2004, you owe another $72.
For example, suppose you made a $5,500 contribution to a Roth IRA early in 2014, then got a larger bonus than you expected and found that due to the income limitation your permitted contribution was only $4,300. Your excess contribution was $1,200. You’re treated as if you originally contributed $3,500 to the Roth IRA and $2,000 to the traditional IRA. Note: Some people mistakenly believe a recharacterization can be used only as a way to undo a Roth conversion, but it can also be used to change the type of IRA to which a contribution was made.
