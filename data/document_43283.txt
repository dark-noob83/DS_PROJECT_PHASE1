The Moringa Oleifera tree is a fast growing, drought resistant tree producing a tuberous taproot. In the wild it ranges in height from 5 to 12 metres with a straight trunk (10 - 30 cm thick) with corky whitish bark and an open, umbrella shaped crown. These branches are excellent for growing new trees: 1. Make a cutting at least 2.5 cm in diametre and at least 1.8 metres long. 2. Dig a hole 1m X 1m X 1m deep. 3. Place the cutting in this hole and fill with a mixture of 3 parts sand and one part compost. Pack firmly around the base of the cutting.
4 - Moringa can be grow as an annual. You can start them indoors, and put them outside when the weather is about 70° F. Follow the How-To link on the right hand side of this page, for Prune Moringa Trees, to get the most leaves from your Moringa trees. That helps, but will not keep them alive during a rough winter, when the ground freezes. 7 - You can take cuttings from your Moringa trees, too, to propagate them for the following year. Cut them at least 15 inches long, with a 1 inch to 2 inch woody diameter, and put them into soil in potting containers.
During its first year, a Moringa tree will grow up to five meters in height and produce flowers and fruit. Left alone, the tree can eventually reach 12 meters in height with a trunk 30cm wide; however, the tree can be annually cut back to one meter from the ground. Moringa Plant, Grow, Cultivation-GROWING MORINGA FROM CUTTINGS. Use hard wood, not green wood, for cuttings. Cuttings should be 45cm to 1.5m long and 10cm thick. Cuttings can be planted directly or planted in sacks in the nursery.
2. Decide where you would like to grow your Moringa tree. Keep in mind that Moringa trees can grow over 20 feet (6.1 m) tall, their first year. The average growth is about 15 feet (4.6 m), however, in optimum conditions, they can grow much taller. Because the branches will grow, on the average, to about three to four feet wide the first year, you will need to consider whether you want to plant your Moringa tree close to any existing structures. There are several varieties, but the seeds of Moringa oleifera and Moringa stenopetala are the easiest to obtain.

The Moringa plant is a fast-growing, drought resistant tree that can reach up to 3 meters in its first year. The Moringa tree is very easy to grow. Simply plant seeds or cuttings in a sunny spot. The moringa tree is a plant that grows mainly in semiarid, subtropical areas. Moringa Plant, Grow, Cultivation-GROWING MORINGA FROM CUTTINGS. Use hard wood, not green wood, for cuttings.

1 Pinch back every other new leaf growth, to force the tree to grow like a bush, and once they are about 2 feet (0.6 m) tall, cut the branches in half lengthwise, and pinch back the new leaf growth that will sprout out at the top of the Moringa tree. There are several varieties, but the seeds of Moringa oleifera and Moringa stenopetala are the easiest to obtain.

1 Compost or manure will help the tree grow better, even though Moringa trees can grow in poor soils. 2  Plant 3 to 5 seeds in each hole, 2 in. ( 3 5 cm) apart. 4  Plant the seeds no deeper than three times the width of the seed (approximately ½ in. or 1.5 cm -- the size of one's thumbnail). producing fruits each year, branches. need to be cut off so that fresh. growth may take place. These. branches are excellent for growing. new trees. 1  Make a cutting at least 1 (2.5cm) in diameter and at least six feet (1.8m) long. 2  Dig a hole 3 ft. (1m) x 3 ft. (1m) and 3 ft. (1m) deep.
