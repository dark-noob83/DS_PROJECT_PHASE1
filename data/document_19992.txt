Hi I'm 39 weeks and for the past day or so I've been feeling pretty noticeable contractions that are about 15-30 minutes apart, but are painless. Each of these contractions, however, can last as long as 5-10 minutes, during which my stomach tightens up and pressure increases on my pubic bone.
Also, just for future knowledge, how long are contractions at each stage supposed to last for so I can try and tell the difference. The pains I am feeling now feel like little period cramps and intensify when I've been on my feet or bending a lot and things.

Your contractions will last from the beginning of labor until the baby is born. The average length of labor and contractions is approximately eight to 14 hours. How long do contractions last, is answered differently with each pregnancy. With your second and third pregnancies, labor and contractions may not last as long.
So I've been timing my contractions for the last while and they are about 60 seconds long 5 - 7 minutes apart.
At the beginning, your contractions may be very irregular. One contraction may be 15 minutes apart from the next or as close as 5 minutes. The length of the contraction is probably 30 seconds to one minute in length. As the first stage of labor progresses, your contractions get closer and more regular.
When your contractions get closer together, you are farther along in the delivery phase of labor. At the beginning, the tightening or painful part of the contraction will last approximately 30 to 45 seconds, near the end the pain will be longer. A true contraction is usually at least 30 seconds long.
