Cellular Respiration: is the process that releases energy by breaking down food molecules in the presence of oxygen. Cellular Respiration = Aerobic Respiration. Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. Some of the energy released by breaking food down is stored as ATP, while some is released as heat.
