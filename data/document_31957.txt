Information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decision of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality depends on the size of the item or error judged in the particular circumstances of its omission or misstatement. Thus, materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which information must have if it is to be useful.. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has refrained from giving quantitative guidelines for determining materiality
A large and material expense to a small company might be small an immaterial to a large company because of their size and revenue. The main question that the materiality concept addresses is does the financial information make a difference to financial statement users. If not, the company doesn't have to worry about including it in their financial statements because it is immaterial.
ISA 450 presents in an explicit way the qualitative factors connected with materiality and helps auditors to adequately assess the significance of their findings that are under the threshold level. Researches conducted since that time indicates that the main determinant of materiality is the percentage effect (distortion) on net profit, as a financial qualitative factor. The oldest research was the study conducted by Woolsey (1954), an analysis by questionnaire.
Materiality Concept. Financial statements are prepared to help its users in making economic decisions. All such information which can be reasonably expected to affect decisions of the users of financial statements is material and this property of information is called materiality. Materiality is a key concept in accounting because it helps accountants and auditors in deciding which figures need separate reporting and what is the maximum amount above which errors or omissions should be avoided at all costs. Deciding whether a piece of information is material or not requires considerable judgment.

Researches conducted since that time indicates that the main determinant of materiality is the percentage effect (distortion) on net profit, as a financial qualitative factor. The oldest research was the study conducted by Woolsey (1954), an analysis by questionnaire.
The materiality concept is the universally accepted accounting principle that all material matters are to be disclosed. The materiality concept is the principle in accounting that trivial matters are to be disregarded, and all important matters are to be disclosed. Items that are large enough to matter are material items. Here, materiality refers to ... the magnitude of an omission or misstatement of accounting information that, in the light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would have been changed or influenced by the omission or misstatement. 1.
The materiality concept, also called the materiality constraint, states that financial information is material to the financial statements if it would change the opinion or view of a reasonable person. The main question that the materiality concept addresses is does the financial information make a difference to financial statement users. If not, the company doesn't have to worry about including it in their financial statements because it is immaterial.
Materiality also has a qualitative aspect. This refers to the notion that a misstatement or omission of information can be significant to the users of the financial statements due to the nature, rather than the size, thereof. An example is an important disclosure that is omitted from the financial statements. Materiality depends on the size of the item or error judged in the particular circumstances of its omission or misstatement. Thus, materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which information must have if it is to be useful..
Materiality is a concept or convention within auditing, accounting, and securities regulation relating to the importance/significance of an amount, transaction, or discrepancy. Materiality depends on the size of the item or error judged in the particular circumstances of its omission or misstatement. Thus, materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which information must have if it is to be useful..
Their main objective is to highlight those qualitative factors that in most cases can be ignored. Generally, these factors are financial (accounting) factors. In literature we can find four articles covering a broad review of research of those factors influencing materiality, especially the qualitative factors. Researches conducted since that time indicates that the main determinant of materiality is the percentage effect (distortion) on net profit, as a financial qualitative factor. The oldest research was the study conducted by Woolsey (1954), an analysis by questionnaire.
