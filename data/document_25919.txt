Example figuring amount to enclose 6 acres: 1) One acre = 43,560 sq. ft. 2) Six acres = 261,359 sq. ft. (43,560 x 6) 3) Square root of 261,359 = 511 (this is the length in feet of each side) 4) 511 x 4 = 2044 linear feet of fence to enclose 6 acres. Use the information below to help determine the amount of fence needed for your enclosure. Since one acre of land comprises 43,560 sq. ft., we can take the square root of 43,560 and find out that a square with 4 equal sides, each side measuring 209' would enclose that acre.

Fencing is sold in linear feet. Simply put, that is the amount of feet (12 inch increments) in a straight line. To figure how much fencing you will need to enclose an area, the linear footage must be determined. Fencing is sold in 6 foot or 8 foot panels. Chain link fencing comes in rolls from 25 feet to 100 feet. Posts for chain link fencing can be spread as far apart as 10 feet. Standard gates measure up to 5 feet wide. Divide the footage of fencing by six or eight (depending on the width of each panel of fencing). This is the total number of fence panels you will need. Any remaining footage smaller than a fence panel determines how many lineal feet of partial panels you will need. Add two to your total of fence panels.
