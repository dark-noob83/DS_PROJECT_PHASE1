4. How to Make Brine If you're not using a kosher turkey, brining it is a great option for extra-flavorful, moist meat. In a large pot, combine 5-1/2 oz. kosher salt (1 cup Diamond Crystal or 1/2 cup Morton's), 1/4 cup sugar, and 2 quarts cool water.
Buy a fresh turkey one to two days before you will be cooking it. Some labels can be helpful by including a sell by date. The sell by date is the last date the store can sell the turkey as fresh. The turkey will maintain optimal quality and safety one to two days after that date.

Last year my wife and I watched a Thanksgiving cooking show with Gordon Ramsey and he said you should let the turkey rest for as long as you cooked it.

Whatâ€™s the best way to thaw a frozen turkey and how long does it take? The safest and easiest way is to thaw the frozen turkey in the refrigerator. A good rule of thumb is to allow 24 hours for every 4 pounds of turkey. Depending on your refrigerator temperature, a 12-pound bird should thaw in 3 days.
Keep in mind that during the resting period, the turkey will keep cooking, and the internal temperature will rise by 5 to 10 degrees. Pull it out as soon as the temperature hits 165, or even a little lower. The amount of resting time depends on the size of the bird, but at least 20 minutes is needed.
