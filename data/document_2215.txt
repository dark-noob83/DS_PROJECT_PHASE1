The photosphere (meaning sphere of light) is the lowest layer of the Sun visible from Earth. This thin layer is the lowest level in the Sun's atmosphere.
The atmosphere of the sun is composed of several layers, mainly the photosphere, the chromosphere and the corona. It's in these outer layers that the sun's energy, which has bubbled up from the sun's interior layers, is detected as sunlight. The lowest layer of the sun's atmosphere is the photosphere. It is about 300 miles (500 kilometers) thick. This layer is where the sun's energy is released as light. Because of the distance from the sun to Earth, light reaches our planet in about eight minutes.
The Solar Photosphere The Sun is made up of layers of material, like a baseball or rubber band ball. The photosphere is the lowest layer of the solar atmosphere. It is essentially the solar surface that we see when we look at the Sun in white (i.e. regular, or visible) light.
