Turning. Turning is essential during the first 14 days of incubation and should be continued until 3 days prior to the eggs expected hatch day. If hand turning, always turn the eggs an uneven number of times a day, so the eggs do not spent two nights in a row in the same position.
So, how long does it take for fertilized chicken eggs to hatch? The answer to that is 21 days exactly, although you need to bear in mind that this can vary, depending on a number of circumstances.
Hatching: The eggs hatch on or very close to the 35th day. About 4 days prior to hatching the developing chick's “egg tooth”, a small hard and sharp calcium spike on the top of the bill, pierces the membrane separating the developing chick from the air bubble above the chick. This is called the internal pip.
Report Abuse. They can hatch anytime day or night. All of the eggs that will hatch will do so within a 24 hour period-even if the eggs were layed on different days. Did you count the days to the hatch date from when she actually started sitting on the eggs because that's when you should start counting. Not when she starts laying in the nest.
If for some reason the temperature has dropped below the correct temperature on a few occasions, you could find some of your eggs only hatching on day 22, 23, or even on day 24 or 25. Whereas fertilized chicken eggs usually take exactly 21 days to hatch, most duck eggs take 28 days, apart from Muscovy ducks. As a general rule of thumb, the eggs of Muscovy ducks take 35 days, but once again, it can vary slightly depending on conditions.
