1 You should provide at least 1 foot (0.3 m) of clearance for the person walking below. 2  Calculate according to the height of the ceiling. 3  For an 8-foot ceiling, a pendant lamp should hang about 12 to 20 inches (30.5 to 50.8 cm) below. 4  For each additional foot of ceiling height, add 3 inches (7.6 cm). Hang a lamp over the floor. 1  Plan for roughly 84 to 96 inches (213.4 to 243.8 cm) from the bottom of the light to the floor. 2 
1 For each additional foot of ceiling height, add 3 inches. 2  For example, for a 9-foot ceiling, the pendant should hang 15-23 inches below. 3  The pendant height can also be measured up from the surface below the light; provide a 30- to 36-inch clearance above tables and countertops. Hanging a Kitchen Pendant Light. While the decorative options for pendant lights are vast, installation is also a key factor to consider for pendant lighting. 1  Pendants should hang 12-20 inches below an 8-foot ceiling. 2  For each additional foot of ceiling height, add 3 inches. 3  For example, for a 9-foot ceiling, the pendant should hang 15-23 inches below
Hanging Around. Ideally, the bottom rims of your pendant lights should hang about 30 inches above the surface of your kitchen island counter. An alternate way to determine the proper height is to measure from the floor upward. With this method, the bottom rims of the lighting fixtures should be positioned 60 to 66 inches above the floor. If the ceilings in your kitchen are higher than 8 feet, light from the fixtures will be dispersed more evenly if you increase the height of the pendant lights 3 inches for every extra foot of ceiling height.
Part 2 of 3: Measuring the Proper Height. 1. Hang a lamp over a kitchen table or island. 1  Start with 28 to 34 inches (71.1 to 86.4 cm), measuring from the bottom of the hanging light and the surface of your table. 2  This range will be your base measurement. Hang a lamp over the floor. 1  Plan for roughly 84 to 96 inches (213.4 to 243.8 cm) from the bottom of the light to the floor. 2  You should provide at least 1 foot (0.3 m) of clearance for the person walking below.

Pendant lights are commonly hung over kitchen islands providing adequate task lighting while also providing an opportunity to enhance the kitchen design. When hanging a pendant light over a kitchen island, the pendant should be hung 30 to 40 inches above the island surface. Because kitchen islands are where family and guests gather, you should consider their interactions at the island when deciding on how low to hang your pendant. When hanging pendant fixtures in a corridor, the height of your ceiling will give you a good idea of the type of fixture you should purchase. If you have 8 foot ceilings, choose a pendant light where the overall length falls between 12 to 16 inches.
Next, decide how far above the island the lights should hang. The size of the pendant, how much light it sheds onto the surface, and the height of members of your family will all affect how high to hang the lights. On average, a pendant light should be 30 inches above the countertop. For taller people, hang your pendant lights higher than 30 inches from the countertop to raise them above eye level, as pendant lights should never impede a person's view of someone or something on the other side of the island.

Measure Up. The standard distance between a kitchen island and a pendant light placed above it is 30 to 36 inches. The exact distance can be customized to meet your individual needs but should be high enough that it does not obstruct the view of the tallest person to use the island. Pendant lights that hang down from the ceiling are often used above kitchen islands because they provide strong direct light for cooking tasks. The length of a pendant light, or the distance where it stops above the island, is adjustable by shortening the hanging chain or wire.
