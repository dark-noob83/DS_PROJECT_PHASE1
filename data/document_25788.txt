The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300 mg/L (200-2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. The toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 3 grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.
Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Paracetamol, however, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote decines sharply after this time. Symptoms of Paracetamol overdosage in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur
Serum concentrations of paracetamol following a 5 mg/kg dose did not reach the level required for efficacy, in line with the lack of antipyresis activity at this dose. At 10 mg/kg, the maximum temperature reduction was apparent after 2–3 hours at a serum concentration of approximately 9–11 μg/mL. Figure 3. Serum paracetamol concentrations in children after three different doses. Filled triangles, 5 mg/kg; open circle, 10mg/kg; closed circle, 20 mg/kg. It is mainly available as a liquid formulation for children in the UK in two strengths: 120 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL, (although a few brands offer variations on strength). The therapeutic dose of paracetamol is defined on the basis of mg paracetamol per kg bodyweight.
As shown in Figure 1, the absorption spectra of paracetamol, aspirin, and caffeine overlapped in the wavelength range of 220–320 nm. Therefore, double divisor-ratio spectra derivative method proposed for simultaneous determination of compounds in ternary samples.

It is commonly used to help with headaches, other minor aches and pains, and is a major ingredient in many cold medications. In combination with opioid analgesics, paracetamol is used in the management of more severe pain such as post-surgical and cancer pain. Though paracetamol is used to treat inflammatory pain, it is not classified as an NSAID because it exhibits only weak anti-inflammatory activity. While generally safe for use at recommended doses, even small overdoses can be fatal. Compared to other over-the-counter pain relievers, paracetamol is significantly more toxic in overdose but may be less toxic when used chronically at recommended doses.
The common adult dose is 500 mg to 1000 mg. The recommended maximum daily dose, for adults, is 4000 mg. In recommended doses, paracetamol is generally safe for children and infants, as well as for adults, although rare cases of acute liver injury have been linked to amounts lower than 2500 mg per day. While generally safe for use at recommended doses, even small overdoses can be fatal. Compared to other over-the-counter pain relievers, paracetamol is significantly more toxic in overdose but may be less toxic when used chronically at recommended doses.
2. The maximum ultraviolet absorption of aspirin was found at 230 and 278 nm in acidic (0.1 N HCl) and 225 and 276 nm in neutral (methanol) solvent systems, respectively. The obtained spectra and maximum absorption wavelength for aspirin in acidic solvent system was compared with the reference spectra of aspirin. 62 4.1.3 Ultraviolet visible spectrum of paracetamol The ultraviolet visible spectrum (200 - 325 nm) of parcetamol in acidic (0.1 N HCl), alkaline (0.1 N NaOH) and neutral (methanol) solvent systems are shown in Fig.
Food led to a decrease in the mean maximum concentration of paracetamol of 49% and individual data showed that five of the volunteers in the study had maximum concentrations below 5 mg ml -1. The time taken to reach maximum plasma aspirin concentration from the soluble aspirin preparation was not significantly affected by food (20 min fasted; 30 min fed), whereas the maximum plasma concentration of paracetamol was significantly delayed (45 min fasted; 75 min fed).
