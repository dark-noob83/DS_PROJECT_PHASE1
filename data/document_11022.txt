BEST ANSWER. Hannah Krause, , 15217. Kerry, utility costs can really vary widely depending on the size of the home, energy efficiency, number of people living in the home, and personal habits. The monthly cost of cable, for example, could vary from about $30 to $200 or more depending on what options you choose. For gas, electric, water & sewer, a rough starting point for preliminary budgeting purposes might be $250-300/month, assuming a small house and conservative energy use. 
Prices paid by Atlanta area consumers for utility (piped) gas, commonly referred to as natural gas, were $1.444 per therm, or 54.8 percent higher than the national average in July 2015 ($0.933 per therm). A year earlier, area consumers paid 45.7 percent more per therm for natural gas compared to the nation. The average cost of utility (piped) gas at $1.444 per therm was less than the $1.593 per therm spent last year. (Data in this report are not seasonally adjusted. Accordingly, month-to-month changes may reflect the impact of seasonal influences.).
Here, too, there are many factors that can alter utility costs. For example, the average water consumption for a family of four at 100 gallons per day can cost as low as $34 per month in Phoenix and as high a $65 per month in Boston. Likewise, energy costs can fluctuate based on consumption habits, location and size of a home
However, if you live in a really hot place, like Phoenix or Dallas, you’re going to be paying a lot more per month, for more months — $80-$90 a month (plus regular electricity costs), for eight months a year. So keep that in mind. Your silver lining is that you don’t have to worry much about heating costs. Total bill. If you skip the cable, your total utilities cost comes to roughly $200 a month. Keep in mind, though, that this is for the rental as a whole — if you have roommates, divide by the number of people living in the unit.
The corresponding monthly and annual costs for the above items as found in this study, and which pertain to the cost of owning a home, include: 1  Utilities, Fuels, and Public Services : $321.75 per month or $3,861 per year. 2  Household Operations : $92.92 per month or $1,115 per year. Finally, and to put things in perspective, we'd like to point out that a typical home cost $160,000. Adding the above numbers, we can conclude that owning a home costs the average American $1,459 per month or $17,500 each year.
You have to consider the size of your apartment and the general climate. An average electric bill may be as low as $30 per month or as high as $100. Gas may cost, on average, anywhere from $40 to $150 and can fluctuate depending on the season. The average bill for each falls between $10 and $30 a month, although you may be billed at a flat rate for both that can cost between $20 and $60. Although many apartments have an apartment complex trash can in which you can deposit your garbage, you’re still likely to be billed for pickup. If your complex follows average utility costs, you could expect to pay between $10 and $40 a month for trash pickup

For example, the average water consumption for a family of four at 100 gallons per day can cost as low as $34 per month in Phoenix and as high a $65 per month in Boston.
