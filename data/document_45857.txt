In the United States and Canada, a residual current device is also known as a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), ground fault interrupter (GFI) or an appliance leakage current interrupter (ALCI).
A ground fault circuit interrupter, called a GFCI or GFI, is an inexpensive electrical device that can either be installed in your electrical system or built into a power cord to protect you from severe electrical shocks.
Ground fault interrupters are designed to protect from electrical shock by interrupting a household circuit when there is a difference in the currents in the hot and neutral wires. Such a difference indicates that an abnormal diversion of current from the hot wire is occuring.
A ground-fault occurs when there is a break in the low-resistance grounding path from a tool or electrical system. The electrical current may then take an alternative path to the ground through the user, resulting in serious injuries or death. The ground-fault circuit interrupter, or GFCI, is a fast-acting circuit breaker designed to shut off electric power in the event of a ground-fault within as little as 1/40 of a second. It works by comparing the amount of current going to and returning from equipment along the circuit conductors.
Which of the following definitions describes a circuit breaker ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI)? (1 point) A. Includes an extension cord B. Replaces a circuit breaker on the main circuit.
A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) or Residual Current Device (RCD) is a device that shuts off an electric power circuit when it detects that current is flowing along an unintended path, such as through water or a person.
None of them really defines a GFCI. I'd also say that none of them is strictly true. A GFCI is basically a device that checks whether the current flowing through one side of a circuit is equal to the current flowing through the other side, and mechanically opens the circuit when they aren't equal.
