Therefore, if you feed your cat a 100g sachet of wet food, 60%-75% of that is water, equating to around 60ml-75ml of your cat’s daily water intake requirements, or enough to fulfil the needs of 1kg of your cat’s weight for the day.
So how much should a cat drink? A normal cat’s daily water requirement ranges from 5 to 10 fluid ounces per day (or an average of 60 ml/kg/day). Cats eating canned food will receive much of their daily water needs from its food, since canned food is about 70 to 80 percent water. In contrast, dry food is only 7 to 1
Canned diets usually contain about 75% moisture, so for every 100 grams of food fed, 75 grams (which equals 75 ml) is water. Dry foods, on the other hand, contain only about 10% moisture, so for every 100 grams of food fed, 10 ml if water. The weight of a standard, larger can of cat food is 5.5 ounces (156 grams).
Wet or canned food contains about 80% water where as dry food contains about 10%. A 4kg cat solely eating canned food may only need to drink about 30ml of water per day where as the same cat eating only dry food would need to drink more than 200ml of water per day.
If cats are given dry food only, they will require significantly more supplemental water to stay acceptably hydrated. Normally, a cat will require 2-4 ounces of fresh water in addition to its food. Dry food is only 10 percent water, while canned is approximately 80 percent water. So obviously your cat is going to drink a lot more water if you are providing dry food only.
In general, an adult cat should drink roughly the same amount of water (in milliliters) as the number of kilocalories eaten per day. Dry cat food contains 7 percent to 12 percent water, while canned food can measure up to 80 percent water.
Therefore, our kitty should be eating 0.52 cups per day. Dry food typically contains about 10% water so 0.52 cups of food would provide 0.052 cups of water or 12.3 mls. Subtracting that from our 261 mls per day leaves us with 249 mls (or about one cup) of water that the cat needs to drink from a bowl per day.
