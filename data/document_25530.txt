Fuel NO x. Fuel NO x is formed when the nitrogen in fuels combines with the excess oxygen in the air. Fuel NO x is a major problem in the burning of oil and coal as it can make up as much as 50% of total emissions when combusting oil and as much as 80% of total emissions when combusting coal.
NOx is shorthand for oxides of nitrogen, which are largely byproducts of infernal combustion. Inclusive of NO2, N2O, N2O5 and more. Naturally occurring NOx compounds are made high in the atmosphere, in the ozone layer (lower stratosphere), too. Whether or not they remain stable or decay to nitrogen, oxygen and/or ozone depends on how much water vapor is present there.
Thermal NO x. Thermal NO x is formed at very high temperatures, usually above 2200°F, and is a result of the oxidation of the diatomic nitrogen found in combustion air. Thermal NO x is the most produced form of NO x created during combustion.
NOx is a generic term for the mono-nitrogen oxides NO and NO 2 (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide). They are produced from the reaction among nitrogen, oxygen and even hydrocarbons (during combustion), especially at high temperatures.
NOx and SOx are the terms used to indicate the general oxides of nitrogen (NO, NO2, N2O2, etc.) and the general oxides of sulfur (SO2, SO3, etc.) when discussing air pollution … , rather than specify any one of the family or list them all.
Nitrogen oxides (NOX) formed during the combustion of coal are mainly nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), together commonly referred to as NOX. NOX formed during combustion is composed predominantly of NO (90-95%) and a lesser amount (5-10%) of NO2. A very small percentage of nitrous oxides (N2O) are also formed. The nitric oxide slowly oxidizes to nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere.
