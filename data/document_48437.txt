KidZone Spider Facts Spiders are Arachnids. Spiders belong to a group of animals called “arachnids”. Scorpions, mites, and ticks are also part of the arachnid family. Arachnids are creatures with two body segments, eight legs, no wings or antennae and are not able to chew.
However, the spiders' group is different from the insects' group. Spiders have eight legs instead of six. Spiders do not have antennae. The spider's head and thorax are joined. Spiders have simple eyes made up of just one lens where insects have compound eyes with many lenses.
Arachnids. Spiders are a special group within the arthropods called arachnids that also includes scorpions, ticks and mites.. They are like the other arthropods in that they have an outside skeleton made of chitin, they have jointed appendages and the three body regions of the head, thorax and abdomen.
Arachnids belong to an even larger group of animals called “arthropods” which also include insects and crustaceans (lobster, crabs, shrimp, and barnacles). This is the largest group in the animal kingdom! Approximately 80% of all animals are from this group…that would be over a million different species!
