Another belief is that when the Native American tribes were forced onto reservations the government also forced them to have dances for the public to come and see. Before each dance they were lead through the town in a parade, which is the beginning of the Grand Entry. Powwow singers are very important figures in the Native American culture. Without them there would be no dancing. The songs are of many varieties, from religious to war to social.
Following the veterans are other important guests of the Pow-Wow including tribal chiefs, Princesses, elders and the Pow-Wow organizers. Next in line are the men dancers. The men are followed by the women dancers. Once everyone is in the arena, the song ends and a song is sung to honor the flag and veterans. The MC works with the Arena Director to keep the Pow-Wow organized and running smoothly. These two individuals along with the committee work hard to bring the people together to dance and fellowship together in the circle. The Pow-Wow begins with the Grand Entry. This is the entry of all the people entering the arena.

A pow wow is often set up as a series of large circles. The center circle is the dance arena, outside of which is a larger circle consisting of the MC's table, drum groups, and sitting areas for dancers and their families. The arena director makes sure dancers are dancing during the pow wow and that the drum groups know what type of song to sing. If there are contests the arena director is ultimately responsible for providing judges, though he often has another assistant who is the head judge.

Written by Richard Archuleta. A pow wow is a gathering of Indian Nations in a common circle of friendship. Indian Country is made up of many tribal nations, bands, villages, and pueblos, each with their own traditional tribal beliefs and practices. A pow wow is the common fiber which draws Indian people together. It is a time for sharing with old friends and making new friends; a time for singing and dancing. It is a time for trading; trading craft goods and trading songs. A pow wow usually begins with a Grand Entry of the dancers. All participantsdance into the circle in their respective categories, led into the arena by a tribal elder or veteran carrying a staff of eagle feathers.
