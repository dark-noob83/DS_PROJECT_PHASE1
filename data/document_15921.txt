We returned from a shopping trip only to find that the store employee didn't remove one of the security tags. It was a 40 mile drive back to the mall so I decided to see if I could safely remove the tag without hacking up the tag or damaging the garment. I used some rare earth (Neodymium) magnets that I had.
Remove the item from the freezer, and lay it on a firm surface with the dome-shaped knob on the magnetic tag facing up. Stack the two magnets on top of one another, and hold them against the dome on the surface of the security tag. Use your hand to pull the pin underneath out, and remove the tag from your purchase.
It goes without saying: you should never shoplift. However, if you've purchased an item and brought it home only to realize that the cashier forgot to remove the security tag, you can remove it from your clothes without taking a trip all the way back to the store.

As an anti-theft measure, clothing stores tag certain items with security tags so you'll set off an alarm when you leave with the tag still on the garment or ruin it by spilling ink from the tag if you try to remove it yourself.

Best Answer: Go to the store with the receipt. They'll remove the security tag for you. If you try to remove it yourself, you may ruin your shoes by getting ink all over it or having some other disaster.
