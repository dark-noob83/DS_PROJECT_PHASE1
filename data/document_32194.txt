These symptoms often happen with high blood sugar and may mean you have diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Home blood or urine ketone tests: 1  Monitor a person who has diabetes, especially when that person is sick. 2  Monitor a person on a low-carbohydrate diet and/or high-fat diet. 3  Monitor a person who is not able to eat due to anorexia or fasting, who is vomiting a lot, and/or who has diarrhea. 4  Monitor a person who is sick.
Ketone bodies are acids made when your body begins using fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. When there is not enough insulin to get sugar from the blood and into the cells, the body turns to fat for energy. When fat is broken down, ketone bodies are made and can accumulate in the body. High levels of ketones are toxic to the body. The condition is called ketoacidosis.
But stored fat is broken down and ketones are made if your diet does not contain enough carbohydrate to supply the body with sugar (glucose) for energy or if your body can't use blood sugar (glucose) properly. Ketones can be tested in a laboratory. Home blood or urine ketone tests: 1  Monitor a person who has diabetes, especially when that person is sick. 2  Monitor a person on a low-carbohydrate diet and/or high-fat diet. 3  Monitor a person who is not able to eat due to anorexia or fasting, who is vomiting a lot, and/or who has diarrhea. 4  Monitor a person who is sick.
(757) 668-7000. Ketones in the urine mean that the body cells are using fat for energy instead of glucose. A large amount of ketones in the urine is a danger sign and can mean the start of a serious illness. Call your child's doctor or nurse educator if your child has a large amount of ketones in his/her urine. Things that can cause the urine ketone to be positive are: 1  too much food.
Checking for Ketones. Ketone is a chemical produced when there is a shortage of insulin in the blood and the body breaks down body fat for energy. Ketones in the urine is a sign that your body is using fat for energy instead of using glucose because not enough insulin is available to use glucose for energy. Small or trace amounts of ketones may mean that ketone buildup is starting. You should test again in a few hours. Moderate or large amounts are a danger sign. They upset the chemical balance of your blood and can poison the body.
People with high levels of blood sugar often have high ketone levels. If you have high blood sugar levels and type 1 or type 2 diabetes, it's important to check your ketone levels. People without diabetes can also have ketones in the urine if their body is using fat for fuel instead of glucose. When this happens, your body burns fat instead and produces substances called ketones. The ketones end up in your blood and urine. It's normal to have a small amount of ketones in your body. But high ketone levels could result in serious illness or death.

The ketones end up in your blood and urine. It's normal to have a small amount of ketones in your body. But high ketone levels could result in serious illness or death.
Ketones are produced when the body burns fat for energy or fuel. They are also produced when you lose weight or if there is not enough insulin to help your body use sugar for energy. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the blood. Since the body is unable to use glucose for energy, it breaks down fat instead.
