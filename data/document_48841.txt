The entire star of the show, however, is Howard Scott Warshaw's game version of Steven Spielberg's film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial for the Atari 2600, which was so widely derided that Atari decided to dump hundreds of thousands of unsold copies along with other titles in 1983. “E.T.” the Atari 2600 game that was so bad it is said to have ruined the entire video game industry in the 1980s, is now selling for more than $600 on eBay after being unearthed from the Alamogordo landfill in New Mexico. (Photo: Tech Times).E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, a game that was so terrible it is widely believed to have caused the demise of Atari and the entire video game industry in the 1980s, is now selling online on eBay and is fetching hundreds of dollars far more than its original selling price.
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (also referred to simply as E.T.) is a 1982 adventure video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600 video game console. It is based on the film of the same name, and was designed by Howard Scott Warshaw. 
I remember buying Atari games for $37.95 each. I paid a bit more at a store that would have them about 3-4 days before anyone else in St. Louis.A $1 a game is nothing. Even for games like Asteroids, Pac-Man and Missile command a $1 isn't bad. Sure there are a lot out there but still it is well worth it. You can spend a $1 for a bottle of soda that you will finish in a couple of minutes or a $1 for an Atari game that can bring you a lifetime of enjoyment. There is no comparison.
The Atari 2600 and 5200 were revolutionary home gaming consoles; over their years on the market -- the 2600 remained in production from 1977 to 1991 -- dozens of companies produced hundreds of games for these systems. The rarest Atari 2600 game is Air Raid, of which only 13 copies are known to exist. An intact copy sold in 2010 for over $30,000. Don't get too excited, though -- most 2600 games are worth less than $100, often significantly less.
Due to its age, and the bizarre state of the video game industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Atari 2600 has seen some of the cheapest and common, as well as some of the rarest and most valuable games ever released.
