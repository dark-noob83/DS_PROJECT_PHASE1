AKA: nerve impulse. The signal that travels along the length of a nerve fiber and ends in the release of neurotransmitters. Nerve impulses are the means by which information is transmitted along the neuron and throughout the nervous system. A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.
Definition of NERVE NET. : a network of neurons apparently continuous with one another and conducting impulses in all directions; also: a primitive nervous system (as in a jellyfish) consisting of such a network. See nerve net defined for kids.
nervous system ... Nerve impulse s propagate themselves along an axon. The action potential is repeatedly regenerated along the length of the axon. nerve impulse an electrochemical event that occurs within the neuron. nerve roots the 31 pairs of projections that extend out along each side of the spinal cord; the sites of axons of the sensory and motor neuron s.
Nerve impulse. Definition. noun. (1) The movement of action potential along a nerve fiber in response to a stimulus (such as touch, pain, heat or cold). (2) The relaying of a coded signal that travels along a nerve cell membrane to an effector, such as muscle, gland or another nerve cell. Supplement. A nerve impulse is the relaying of a coded signal from a nerve cell to an effector (a muscle cell, a gland cell or another nerve cell) in response to a stimulus. It is the means by which a nerve cell communicates with another cell.
For instance, in neuromuscular junction, the nerve impulse moves along the axon of a nerve cell to instruct a muscle cell to contract. Word origin: nerve + impulse. See also: action potential.
