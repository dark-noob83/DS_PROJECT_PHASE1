You all need to really research what you feed your birds. Seed diet alone will get you dead birds. Keets on a seed diets alone will live 4-6 years, with veggies 8 yrs. Keets on just a plain pelleted diet will live 15 yrs, pellets and veggies 20 years and with a variety of diets 25 yrs. I happen to have a english parakeet that is 28 years old. Never have been fed seed diet his whole life.

Budgies usually live 8-10 years if cared for well. Sometimes they will live to about 15 years. It is rare, but some budgies have lived more than 20 years. The most important thing is a healthy diet. A budgie on a seed-only diet will probably live only 4-5 years, at the most.
