The catalytic converter is made up of several materials. The catalyst core or substrate varies according to the vehicle. For example, in automotive catalytic converters, the core is usually a ceramic monolith with a honeycomb structure. When manufactured in large quantities, ceramic cores can be inexpensive.
Introduction to Catalytic Converters. A catalytic converter is a vehicle emissions control device that is used to convert toxic byproducts of combustion (occurring in the exhaust of an internal combustion engine) to less toxic substances by performing catalysed chemical reactions. The reactions tend to vary depending upon the type of catalyst installed.
The catalytic converter is made with trace amounts of platinum, palladium and rhodium, which speed chemical reactions and help clean emissions at very high temperatures. Selling stolen converters to scrap yards or recyclers, a thief can net a couple of hundred dollars apiece.
Transcript. DR RICHARD TILLEY. A catalytic converter is basically made from a kind of ceramic material, and on this ceramic material, we have small metal particles, and these metal particles are catalysts. So these metal particles are made from platinum.
In the catalytic converter, there are two different types of catalyst at work, a reduction catalyst and an oxidation catalyst. Both types consist of a ceramic structure coated with a metal catalyst, usually platinum, rhodium and/or palladium.
