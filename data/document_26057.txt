I've noticed through my studying that in the U.S. Tanks were built by the major auto manufacturers, Chrysler, Ford, GM. In Germany the tanks were all built in the heavy tractor factories and as a result the german tank production could not keep up with virtually any other major power country. (Meaning-Russia, U.S.) So what stopped Germany from using their auto production factories to produce tanks like the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.?
Then it got very good. Germany invaded Poland in 1939, and the world  almost every country except the U.S.  was at war. Agricultural exports dropped as German submarines, known as U-boats, were sinking U.S. ships to England and Europe.
Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that it was the soldiers within these tanks that bore the brunt of the Shermanâ€™s problems. Sherman tanks first saw action in North Africa in 1942. At the time they fared well against the German equivalent tank, the Panzer IV. It was for this reason that the Army thought the Sherman would be able to hold its own during the invasion of Normandy and into Europe.
Sherman tanks were not nearly as efficient or as armored as the primary German tank, the Panzer IV. This was a fact even before the upgrading of Panzer gun barrels and armor in 1943.
Five months after its combat demonstration to the British, in June 1916 the first production line tanks were ready, albeit too late for use at the start of that year's 'big push' - the Battle of the Somme, which began on 1 July 1916.
Experiencing WWII from the inside of a M4 Sherman tank was famously dangerous. Henry J. Earl retells his experience with the Sherman in a 1983 letter to Lt Colonel Haynes Dugan, one of the G-2 intelligence officers for the 3 rd Armored Division.
When World War 2 started the German army had nearly 1500 Panzer I tanks. They participated in the Blitzkrieg invasion of Poland in 1939, although it was known that they are not suitable for front line fighting because of their lack of firepower and very thin armor.
