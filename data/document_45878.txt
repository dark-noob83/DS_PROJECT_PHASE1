The first project from Uber Garage was to give Uber users the option to hire a regular taxi driver, or a crowd-sourced Uber driver. The startup announced a new carpooling service called UberPool at the start of August 2014, after a beta testing phase in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company also introduced uberX in 2012, a service option which allows local drivers to respond to notifications on the Uber app by driving customers in their own non-luxury cars. During 2013, Uber offered its first non-car option when it launched UBERChopper rides from New York City to the Hamptons for $3000 each.
Uber cofounder and CEO Travis Kalanick. Cody Pickens. When Uber cofounder and CEO Travis Kalanick was in sixth grade, he learned to code on a Commodore 64.

Since Uber's launch, several other companies have copied its business model, a trend that has come to be referred to as Uberification.

In 2014, it experimented with carpooling features and made other updates. The company also introduced uberX in 2012, a service option which allows local drivers to respond to notifications on the Uber app by driving customers in their own non-luxury cars. During 2013, Uber offered its first non-car option when it launched UBERChopper rides from New York City to the Hamptons for $3000 each.

(Later, Uber bought back the shares, which would now be worth hundreds of millions, for $1 million.)From there, the money came pouring in, including $10 million in funding in February of 2011 from Benchmark, which valued Uber at $60 million. Uber, Travis Kalanick’s smartphone-based car service, has been valued at $18.2 billion, but its C.E.O. still spends a lot of his time on the warpath. His enemies include the taxi industry, regulators around the world, his rivals, and even, on occasion, his customers.
