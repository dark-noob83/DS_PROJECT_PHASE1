Best Answer: Turtles do carry diseases. They carry other contagions, as well, but salmonella is the most common one. These illnesses are called zoonoses and are found in many species. Turtles can still make great pets if you know what you're getting into. Simple hygiene with regular soap and hot water can keep you and your kids from getting sick from this.
A: All animals carry germs. Some turtles do carry the disease salmonella. Since there is no way of knowing which turtles carry the salmonella disease, you must wash your hands after handling them. Since you may have children around your turtle, you must supervise your children so that they don’t put us in their mouth.
Yes, they can carry salmonella. This is much more common with baby turtles than it is with adult ones, but you should still wash your hands after touching the turtle, and for … heaven's sake, don't kiss it.
Salmonella isn't just a food-borne illness. Turtles and other reptiles carry Salmonella bacteria, which can be easily transmitted to people. A small turtle may seem harmless, giving parents a false sense that they're a safe pet for children. But they're not.
Turtles commonly carry bacteria called Salmonella on their outer skin and shell surfaces. People can get Salmonella by coming in contact with. 1  turtles or other reptiles (lizards, snakes). 2  amphibians (frogs, salamanders, newts). 3  the habitats of reptiles or amphibians, like cages, tanks and aquariums.
Reptiles, including turtles, and amphibians naturally carry the bacteria responsible for salmonella infections on their bodies. As a result, contact with the skin or shells of these animals can lead to health problems, particularly for vulnerable populations.
