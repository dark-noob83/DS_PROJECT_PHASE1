If current interest rates were to rise, giving newly issued bonds a yield of 10%, then the zero-coupon bond yielding 5.26% would not only be less attractive, it wouldn't be in demand at all.
Sooner or later, the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates, and this will affect you and every other investor in the United States. Regardless of when it happens, the Federal Reserve will begin increasing the federal funds rate from its current range of zero to 0.25%.

The higher coupon payment will cushion the impact of rising rates, which means the investor takes less of a hit on price.The 4 percent coupon bond might lose 15 percent in value if rates go up 1 percent, whereas the 6 percent coupon bond might only lose 10 percent in value, Cummings says.
Now the specter of rising interest rates is looming large, even though the Fed isn't expected to actually raise the federal funds rate until 2015. Overall, bonds have shed 3.4 percent of their value, as measured by the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which tracks a blend of corporate and government bonds.
So, if interest rates rise, each year a bond will mature that can then be reinvested in a bond paying a higher interest. On the other hand, if rates fall, only one bond is maturing that will have to be invested at the lower interest rate. The rest of the bonds are still paying the
