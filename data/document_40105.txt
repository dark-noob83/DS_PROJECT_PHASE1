The average body temperature of a cow is most likely 101.5 ° F (38.6 °C). A cow's body temperature must be maintained within narrow limits in order to sustain its physiological processes. According to the research, the range is found to be 100 to 104 °F (37.8 °C to 40.0 °C).
Body temperatures vary, even within humans. The body temperatures of mammals range from around 97° to over 103° Fahrenheit. Birds have average temperatures of around 105° Fahrenheit. The phi point between the freezing temperature (32° F) and the boiling temperature (212° F) of water is 100.8° F, or 38.2° Centigrade.
Like all mammals, cows are warm blooded and need to maintain a constant core body temperature. Normal rectal temperature for a cow is around 38°C (101°F). Within a range of environmental temperatures called the thermoneutral zone, animals do not have to expend any extra energy to maintain their
The normal body temperature for a buffalo is between 99.5 and 102.2  degrees Fahrenheit. The body temperature for an adult cow is 99.5  to 101.2
The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting cow is stated on average to be 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.6 degrees Celsius). Though the body temperature measured on an individual cow can vary, a healthy cow can maintain a fairly consistent body temperature that is around the mark of 101.5 °F (38.6 °C). The normal range of a cow body temperature varies due to many factors.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below
