An American football field is 160' x 360' including end zones. This is 53.33 yds x 120 yds. 1 yard = .9144 meters, so an American football field is 48.768m x 109.728m. The total size in square meters is 48.768x109.728 = 5,351.215 sq m. A Canadian football field is 195'x450' including end zones. This is 65 yds x 150 yds. 
If you run around the footaball field which is 120 yards long (10 yards with each endfield) and 53.3 yards wide, each lap will be 346.6 yards. So if you run around the outside of the enfield, it would take a little more than 5 laps to reach one mile. 
4. The next step is to locate second base. Measure from the back tip of home plate to a distance of 127 feet and 3 3/8 inches (see Table 2 for distance between bases for other leagues). Mark with a wooden stake. When installing base pads, this will be the center of second base. The top of the mound consists of a plateau that is 5 feet wide. 11. A regulation pitcher's mound is 10 inches high (compared to surface level of home plate). Miscalculation of the pitcher's mound height is probably the second most common error in setting up a baseball field.
Pitcher’s Mound. Regulation pitcher mound dimensions and location is described. • First of all, a pitcher’s mound, which is a 24 -by-6 inch pitching rubber, lies at the center of every baseball diamond. This mound, which has a diameter of 18 feet, must be 10-and-a-half inches above the height of home plate. 
77 Feet 9 Inches. Standard bases are 15 inches by 15 inches. If you are trying to find a base peg (anchor), subtract 6 to 7 inches from the baseline number above. For example: the base anchor for first base on a high school field will be roughly 89 feet 6 inches from the back of home plate. Softball uses a 16 foot diameter circle for the pitching area. Baseball uses a pitching mound. A major league mound is 18 feet in diameter and 10 inches higher than home plate. The pitching rubber is installed 18 inches back from the center of this mound.
Next, the infield turf area. Base paths are 60 feet long and are typically 3 feet wide. This means the grass area is a square that is 54 feet by 54 feet. So, the infield grass area is about 2900 square feet. So, the distance from the backstop to the homerun fence is about 215 feet. The area of the ball park is one fourth the area of a circle with a radius of 215. Area of a circle is pie X radius squared. So, you have A = 215 * 215 * 3.14. This is about 145,0
Use a little league field with a 60 foot length base path as an example. The homerun fence is 200 feet away from home plate. Home plate usually is at least 15 feet away from the backstop fence behind the plate. So, the distance from the backstop to the homerun fence is about 215 feet. The area of the ball park is one fourth the area of a circle with a radius of 215. Area of a circle is pie X radius squared. So, you have A = 215 * 215 * 3.14. This is about 145,000 square feet.
The catcher’s box is 1.3m x 2.4m. The distance from home plate to the outfield fence must be at least 98m along the left and right field foul lines and 122m at the centre outfield. A modified field is used for Little League and Under 14. The pitcher’s mound is 18.44m from home plate and located in the centre of the infield. It is a 5.5m mound of dirt no higher than 25.4cm. Near the centre of the mound is the pitching rubber, a rectangular slab measuring 61cm x 15cm.
The batter's boxes are 4 feet wide and 6 feet long. The batter's boxes are centered lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box 6 inches from the near edge of home plate. A baseball field, also called a ball field or a baseball diamond, is the field upon which the game of baseball is played.
The distance from home plate to the backstop is 52 feet 4 inches (15.95 m), a reduction of 20 feet (6.1 m) from the previous facility. The field is made up of Kentucky bluegrass, the same surface as the previous stadium, which is grown on a 1,300 acres (530 ha) farm in Bridgeton, New Jersey.
