I find most places that take the Nectar Card will ask if you have one when you come to pay so make sure you always have it in your purse or wallet. You can also collect points online with over 500 brands and, thankfully, they’re everyday brands you’ll actually use.
I think the main problem with this loyalty program is that you only earn points if you go via the Nectar card website first – for example, I can’t use my Nectar card in a TopShop store or if I go to the TopShop website directly.
