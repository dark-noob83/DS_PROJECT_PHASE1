The process of bringing Planet Earth and Earth to the screen took over 5 years. With a combined budget of $47 million, $15 million of which was earmarked for the film, it represented the most expensive production in the history of documentary filmmaking. Principal photography began in 2004 and was completed in 2006. Earth is a 2007 nature documentary film which depicts the diversity of wild habitats and creatures across the planet. The film begins in the Arctic in January of one year and moves south, finishing in Antarctica in the December of the same year.
But more disgusting. Planet Earth crew filmed that dramatic snow leopard hunting scene on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan when the world was hunting for Al Qaeda. The snow leopard scene is the result of three years' worth of effort by a total of eight crew members and 20 local trackers.

Most filmed animal hunts are actually many hunts edited together to complete a story. Planet Earth strived to film the entirety of an impala hunt by African wild dogs in the Pole to Pole segment.

Planet Earth was the second attempt by Roddenberry to create a weekly series set on a post-apocalyptic future Earth. The previous pilot was Genesis II, and it featured many of the concepts and characters later redeveloped in Planet Earth. There and in the Planet Earth scene, the heroes witness the effect of their own violence on children, forcing them to rethink the use of forceâ€”a very effective and intelligent pacifistic touch from Roddenberry.
