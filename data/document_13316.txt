Alcohol consumption inhibits the secretion of ADH and results in  increased urine output that can disrupt the body's fluid balance. In a nutshell, Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) causes the kidneys to retain water instead of excreting it. In your case, because the amount of ADH is increased, the amount of … water retained in the body is also increased. The increased water enters blood vessels and increases blood pressure.
Ethyl Alcohol prevents the secretion of Anti-diuretic hormone from the the posterior pituitary, resulting in water and sodium loss and subsequent diuresis. Any stimulant (things that increase your mental or physical capability such as caffeine's ability to make one energized and alert) or depressor (something that has a negative … mental or physical effect such as alcohol) will inhibit AdH secretion.
Alcohol ingestion inhibits the increased secretion of puberty–related hormones in the developing female Rhesus monkey. Endocrinology 141:1325–1331, 2000. EMANUELE, N.V.; LAPAGLIA, N.; STEINER, J.; et al. Effect of chronic ethanol exposure on female rat reproductive cyclicity and hormone secretion. Key words: reproductive effects of AODU (alcohol and other drug use); reproductive function; female; hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis; hormones; puberty; postmenopause; menstrual cycle; osteoporosis. Mild–to–moderate alcohol use affects female reproductive function at several stages of life.
ADH secretion by the pituitary is regulated by neural connections from the hypothalamus, which is believed to monitor either the volume of blood passing through it or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or body stress will raise ADH secretion and water will be retained. Alcohol inhibits ADH secretion. Failure of the pituitary to produce ADH results in diabetes insipidus. In pharmacological doses ADH acts as a vasoconstrictor. The structure and chemical synthesis of ADH was announced (1953) by Nobel laureate Vincent Du Vigneaud and others. Its principal action is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), known also as vasopressin, causes the kidneys to resorb water directly from the renal tubules, thus concentrating the salts and waste products in the liquid, which will eventually become urine.
The secretion of antidiuretic hormone is inhibited by both alcohol and caffeine. I'm trying to learn at what level (pituitary, where the actual secretion occurs) or the hypoth … alamus where ADH (vasopressin) is produced. 5 people found this useful. Any stimulant (things that increase your mental or physical capability such as caffeine's ability to make one energized and alert) or depressor (something that has a negative … mental or physical effect such as alcohol) will inhibit AdH secretion.

antidiuretic hormone (ănˌtēdĪyōrĕtˈĭk) [ key ], polypeptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. Its principal action is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), known also as vasopressin, causes the kidneys to resorb water directly from the renal tubules, thus concentrating the salts and waste products in the liquid, which will eventually become urine.
In your brain is a small gland called the pituitary gland. It is divided into two sections: the front; and the back. The back section is called the posterior pituitary. One of the hormones made by the posterior pituitary gland is called vasopressin, or anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). 
a. Secreted by hypothalamus, synthesized in placenta b. Establishes timing of birth, increases secretion of cortisol (needed for maturation of fetal lungs / production of surfactant) c. High levels of cortisol inhibit release of ACTH, ACTH cannot make it to adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids. Secreted by hypothalamus b. Stimulated c. Inhibited by inhibin and by prolactin, which suppresses arcuate nucleus function i. Arcuate nucleus function-small part of hypothalamus, regulation of hormone secretion from pituitary gland [ contains dopamine / GHRH neurons ].
The porter in the above excerpt also notes the effect of alcohol on urine excretion. Alcohol inhibits the pituitary secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which acts on the kidney to reabsorb water. Alcohol has two noticeable effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which influence sexual behavior and urinary excretion. Alcohol depresses the nerve centers in the hypothalamus that control sexual arousal and performance.
