The hematocrit is the proportion, by volume, of the blood that consists of red blood cells. The hematocrit (hct) is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.
Hematocrit (Hct) Levels. This is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood. Normal range for hematocrit is different between the sexes and is approximately 45% to 52% for men and 37% to 48% for women. This is usually measured by spinning down a sample of blood in a test tube, which causes the red blood cells to pack at the bottom of the tube.
There are normal Hematocrit levels accepted depending on the age of the individual and their gender as well. Note that the standard range varies among laboratories. 1  New born: 55 to 68 percent. 2  One week from birth: 47 to 65 percent. 3  One month from birth: 37 to 49 percent. 4  Three months: 30 to 36 percent.
Normal values for the hematocrit test vary according to age, sex, pregnancy, altitude where people live, and even vary slightly between various testing methods. The following are reported ranges of normal hematocrit levels: 1  Newborns: 55%-68%. 2  One (1) week of age: 47%-65%. 3  One (1) month of age: 37%-49%.
