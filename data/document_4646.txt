Smell depends on sensory receptors that respond to airborne chemicals. In humans, these chemoreceptors are located in the olfactory epithelium â€” a patch of tissue about the size of a postage stamp located high in the nasal cavity. The olfactory epithelium is made up of three kinds of cells: 1 bind to receptors on the cilia. 2  These are 7-pass transmembrane proteins. 3  Binding of the odorant activates a G protein coupled to the receptor on its cytoplasmic side. 4  This activates adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme embedded in the plasma membrane of the cilia.
Olfactory receptors expressed in the cell membranes of olfactory receptor neurons are responsible for the detection of odor molecules. Rather than binding specific ligands, olfactory receptors display affinity for a range of odor molecules, and conversely a single odorant molecule may bind to a number of olfactory receptors with varying affinities, which depend on physio-chemical properties of molecules like their molecular volumes.

Molecules from the air dissolve in this mucous and interact with filaments of the olfactory cells. Because odors are sensed only when gaseous molecules dissolve, all odor-causing materials must produce vapors. Materials that release virtually no vapor, such as ionic salts, are odorless. Just as there are different types of color blindness, there are a variety of anosmias. Scientists investigate which odoriferous substances cannot be detected by certain anosmic persons. These substances are then classified into a single primary odor category.
It is thought that there are hundreds of different olfactory receptors, each encoded by a different gene and each recognizing different odorants. Smell is a very direct sense. In order for you to smell something, molecules from that thing have to make it to your nose. Everything you smell, therefore, is giving off molecules -- whether it is bread in the bakery, onions, perfume, a piece of fruit or whatever. Esters are organic molecules. For example, the ester that gives a banana its smell is called isoamyl acetate, and the formula for it is CH 3 COOC 5 H 11. The primary smell of an orange comes from octyl acetate, or CH 3 COOC 8 H 17. Esters can now be made artificially, and that is where artificial flavors come from.
Odor concentration is an odor's pervasiveness. To measure odor sensation, an odor is diluted to certain amounts to reach a detection or recognition threshold. The detection threshold is the concentration of an odor in air when 50% of a population can distinguish between the odorous sample and an odor free blank. Common odors that people are used to, such as their own body odor, are less noticeable to individuals than external or uncommon odors. This is due to habituation; after continuous odor exposure, the sense of smell fatigues quickly, but recovers rapidly after the stimulus is removed.
An odor or odour or fragrance is caused by one or more volatilized chemical compounds, generally at a very low concentration, that humans or other animals perceive by the sense of olfaction. Common odors that people are used to, such as their own body odor, are less noticeable to individuals than external or uncommon odors. This is due to habituation; after continuous odor exposure, the sense of smell fatigues quickly, but recovers rapidly after the stimulus is removed.
Certain structural features of a molecule can be associated with a particular type of odor, although that odor may not be one of the primaries. A good example of such a feature is the mercapto group, SH. Most volatile materials that contain this group have strong odors. Just as there are different types of color blindness, there are a variety of anosmias. Scientists investigate which odoriferous substances cannot be detected by certain anosmic persons. These substances are then classified into a single primary odor category.
