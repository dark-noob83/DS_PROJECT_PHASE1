1 Cook the pork roast in the oven on 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). 2  Cooking time will be 35 minutes per lb. (0.45kg) of meat. 3  A pork roast with the bone in will cook faster than a boneless roast. 4  It will result in a crispier surface texture with less moisture. 1 Cooking time will be 35 minutes per lb.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Put the marinade and pork roast in the roasting pan, and discard the plastic bag. Roast until the temperature in the center of the roast is 155 degrees, testing with an instant-read thermometer. Start checking the temperature half an hour after you put the roast in the oven. Place the roast on a cutting board and cover with foil. Carryover cooking will raise the internal temperature to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Let the roast rest for 10 minutes while you strain the pan juices and bring them to a boil. Serve the pan juices on the side.
1 Cover tightly. 2  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F for 15 minutes. 3  Place the roast in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature down to 200 degrees F. 4  Roast for about 4 hours or until the meat is falling-apart tender (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast). 1 Place the roast in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature down to 200 degrees F. 2  Roast for about 4 hours or until the meat is falling-apart tender (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the roast). 3  Stir the salt and black pepper into the juice (do not omit the salt!). 4  Slice meat as desired
Continue cooking about 50-80 minutes or until the meat registers 145 degrees on a meat thermometer. Some roasts are long and thin and others are short and fat, consequently the cooking times will vary depending on the shape of your roast. The meat thermometer is the best way to judge the right amount of cooking time. Always position the pork roast in the pan so that fat side is on the top. Measure one tablespoon of olive oil in a small dish. Add 1 Tablespoon of dried spices to the oil. You can use rosemary, sage, thyme, or oregano; or a combination of these that equal 1 tablespoon.

1 If you want a darker crust to your pork tenderloin, brown it on all sides in a frying pan, about 10 or 12 minutes altogether, then put it in the hot oven to finish cooking. 2  Check the temperature with an instant-read thermometer after 15 minutes in the oven. Place the roast on a cutting board and cover with foil. Carryover cooking will raise the internal temperature to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Let the roast rest for 10 minutes while you strain the pan juices and bring them to a boil. Serve the pan juices on the side.
Remove the roast from the oven and set on a cutting board. Cover the meat with tin foil and let it rest for about 15 minutes before slicing it. The temperature of the roast will continue to rise about another 5 degrees. Always position the pork roast in the pan so that fat side is on the top. Measure one tablespoon of olive oil in a small dish. Add 1 Tablespoon of dried spices to the oil. You can use rosemary, sage, thyme, or oregano; or a combination of these that equal 1 tablespoon.
3. Heat the oven to 500 degrees for a raw roast, 375 for a pre-browned one. 4. Place the roasting pan in the oven; cook for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 300 degrees. 5. Cook for about 45 minutes, then start checking the roast's temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the roast when the internal temperature, measured as deep into the roast as you can get, reads 165 degrees. 6. At what temperature and for how long per pound do you cook a pork roast? My co-worker wants her daughter(13) to put the roast in the oven for her before she gets home, but she did't know at what temp and for how long to tell her to leave it in. She said it is a small 2 lb pork roast.
