The fruit is 1 to 2 inches in diameter, growing to about the size and shape of a walnut. The tomatillo has a flavor that is tart, tasting something like green apples, rather than sweet like its close relative the husk-tomato (or ground-cherry). Tomatillos are used many ways in Mexican cooking. Raw or cooked, they give sauces a rich, distinctive flavor. They are used fresh in salads, tacos, and sandwiches. For the highest quality fruit and best flavor, pick tomatillos while they are still deep green and when the husk has changed from green to tan
Preheat broiler. Remove husks from tomatillos and rinse under warm water to remove stickiness. Remove skin from onion, and cut into 4 wedges. Place fresh tomatillos, serranos (or bell pepper), jalapenos, onion, and garlic (with skin on) on rack of a broiler pan 1 to 2 inches from heat. The husk is inedible, so remove it before eating. Tomatillos will have a sticky coating, so you will need to wash them under water to remove the residue. Tomatillos contain a pectin-like substance and can be used to thicken soups or sauces when cooked. They can also be sliced and added to salads or fresh salsas.
Tomatillos bear small yellow flowers that bees love. The first round of flowers don't set fruit in my garden because bees don't get active here until late June. Tomatillos are edible at any stage but taste best when they begin to fill out or even split their papery husks -- I get my first ripe fruits in July. More compact and upright, these plants bear fruits the size of a large marble in a tight husk. As they ripen, the husk splits and the fruit turns eggplant purple. What it lacks in size, it makes up for in number -- yield (by weight) is equal to that of green tomatillos.
Fixes for No Tomatillo Fruit in Husk. Tomatillos are pollinated by bees and other insects that move from flower to flower. When temperatures or humidity are extremely high, the pollen adheres to the inside of the flower, making pollination difficult. You may also find empty husk on tomatillos when you have only planted one plant. Besides the environmental factors that cause empty husks, tomatillos are also susceptible to diseases that prevent the fruit from forming and growing properly. Advertisement.

By Bonnie L. Grant. Tomatillos are related to tomatoes, which are in the Nightshade family. They are similar in shape but are ripe when green, yellow or purple and have a husk around the fruit. The fruits are borne on warm season plants and from inside the husk. You can tell when to pick a tomatillo by watching for the husk to burst. Tomatillo harvesting is best when the fruits are green because they contain the most flavor. It is important to know how to harvest tomatillos to enhance continued fruiting. Choose fruits that have burst their husk and have no signs of disease, mold or insect damage.
Maturity Indices. The tomatillo or husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa) is a small, spherical and green or green-purple fruit surrounded by an enlarged calyx or “husk.” As the fruit matures, it fills the husk and can split it open by harvest. Tomatillos are the key ingredients in fresh and cooked green salsas and other Latin American dishes.
