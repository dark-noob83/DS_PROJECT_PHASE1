Symptoms of Dupuytren's Contracture. The first symptom for many patients is one or more lumps (nodules) under the skin in the palm of the hand. The lump may feel tender and sore at first, but this discomfort eventually goes away. The nodules cause tough bands of tissue to form under the skin in the palm.
In this article. Dupuytren’s contracture, also known as Dupuytren’s disease, is a hand deformity that causes the tissue beneath the surface of the hand to thicken and contract. Evidence of Dupuytren’s usually begins with a thickening of the palm.
Causes. A condition in which the hand is deformed by diseased palmar tissue, Dupuytren’s disease causes the fingers to bend towards the palm. In the early stages, a person with this disease may find a small nodule in the palm, usually found where the ring finger and small finger meet.
The cause of Dupuytren's contracture, also called Dupuytren's disease, is unknown, but certain biochemical factors that affect the palm's connective tissue may be involved. Injuries and overuse of the hand do not play a role.
DESCRIPTION. Dupuytren’s contracture is an abnormal thickening of the tissue just beneath the skin. This thickening occurs in the palm and can extend into the fingers. Firm pits, bumps and cords (thick lines) can develop and cause the fingers to bend into the palm (Figures 1 and 2).
