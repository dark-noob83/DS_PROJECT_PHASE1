Very strong winds are common in Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) area, and shore erosion by oceanic waves is therefore substantial. For example, in an extreme storm on January 8 and 9, 1990, the average wave height reached 14 m southeast of Surtsey, which means that the highest waves were approximately 20 m high. Marine erosion is therefore tremendous in Surtsey. The palagonite tuff in Surtsey is very dense with few fissures, similar to the outer Vestmannaeyjar. In the future, Surtsey will most likely resemble the island Bjarnarey, which is approximately 5000-6000 years old. See a slideshow of erosion and sedimentation in Surtsey (author: Sveinn.
Surtsey is a volcanic island and part of the Vestmannaeyjar submarine volcanic system. Vestmannaeyjar also produced the famous eruption of Heimaey (Eldfell). Surtsey is about 1.5 km in diameter and has an area of 2.8 square km. Surtsey is 33 km south of the main island of Iceland and 20 km southwest of Heimaey. The island is named for Surtur, a giant of fire in Icelandic mythology. Surtsey is a classic example of the growth of a new volcanic island. Episodic eruptions began on November 8, 1963 and ended on June 5, 1967. The volcano grew from the sea floor, at a depth of 130 m, to sea level by November 15
The southernmost of the islands is the famous emergent volcano of Surtsey, formed during an eruption that lasted from 1963 until 1967. The archipelago lies in the southernmost part of the Eastern Volcanic Zone of Iceland (also called Main Volcanic Zone) that runs roughly NE-SW across Iceland. Heimaey is the largest island of the Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) archipelago, south of the SSW coast of Iceland.
volcano number: 1702-01= (according to Volcanoes of the World, 1994 edition) summit elevation: 225 m (Helgafell cone) location: 63.43°N, 20.28°W. Heimaey is the largest island of the Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) archipelago, south of the SSW coast of Iceland. The distance of Heimaey from the nearest spot on the mainland is about 10 km

Surtsey is only the most famous, or one of the most famous, of the islands known to have emerged from below the sea surface in living memory. For example, on September 24, 2013, an earthquake caused the birth of a new mud island off Pakistan’s southern coast. 
The Surtsey Eruption 1963-1967. The Surtsey eruption is among the longest eruptions to have occurred in Iceland in historical times. The first sign of an eruption came early in the morning of November 14, 1963, at a site approximately 18 km southwest of Heimaey, the largest of the Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands). A total of 1.1 km³ of volcanic products arose from the Surtsey eruption, of which 60-70% were tephra and 30-40% lava. In many respects the Surtsey eruption is comparable to eruptions that led to the formation of hyaloclastite (palagonite) mountains in Iceland during the Ice Age.
The undersea vents that produced Surtsey are part of the Vestmannaeyjar submarine volcanic system, part of the fissure of the sea floor called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Vestmannaeyjar also produced the famous eruption of Eldfell on the island of Heimaey in 1973. The eruption lasted until 5 June 1967, when the island reached its maximum size of 2.7 km 2 (1.0 sq mi). Since then, wave erosion has caused the island to steadily diminish in size: as of 2002, its surface area was 1.4 km 2 (0.54 sq mi).
