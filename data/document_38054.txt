No! Strauss-Kahn tests the durability of the new Euro coin. In France, coins worth one, two and five cents will carry the portrait of Marianne, the female symbol of the French republic, while 10-, 20- and 50-cent pieces will feature a sower of seeds.

One euro is made up of 100 cents. Coins are minted in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents, and 1 and 2 euros. Like the euro banknotes, all coins – regardless of the issuing country – may be used anywhere in the euro area.
The euro coin series comprises eight different denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent, €1 and €2. The euro coins have a common side and a national side. The national side indicates the issuing country.
The design on the common side of the euro coins features a representation of Europe, as opposed to a map of Europe. The 1, 2 and 5 cents show Europe in the world. The 10, 20 and 50 cents illustrate the Union as a group of nations. The 1 and 2 euro coins illustrate a Europe without frontiers. Only islands of over 2500km2 and archipelagos of over 5000km2 were included in the design.
