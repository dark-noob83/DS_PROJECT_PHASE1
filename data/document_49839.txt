Qualities. Teflon® has a coefficient of friction against polished steel of 0.05 to 0.1, which is one of the lowest for any solid that has been measured. This makes it suitable for use in applications that require reduced friction between two solids, such as gears or sliding parts. This being said, Teflon should be resistant to scratches (by definition as, the most slippery substance that exists), but I'm sure that scratches are possible with enough force/area applied. Anon46420: I'm sure it's possible to apply another coat, but probably not for consumers.
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene that has numerous applications. The best known brand name of PTFE-based formulas is Teflon by DuPont Co., which discovered the compound. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of friction against any solid. PTFE is used as a non-stick coating for pans and other cookware. It is very non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals.
Posted on. (Answer #1). Teflon is a brand name of chemical compound of fluorine and carbon called polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The name teflon has now become so popular that it has acquired the position of generic name for this chemical. Teflon is a plastic material that is highly resistant against chemicals, corrosion, and oxidation.
The final cookware coating is a dried, durable nonstick material which delivers the easy clean and nonstick performance that you expect from your cookware coated with Teflon™ nonstick. Teflon™ is a registered trademark and a brand name owned by Chemours, and is used on a range of products. Teflon™ is not a specific chemical or product name. The Teflon™ brand represents a family of high-performance products that are used in a wide variety of industrial applications and consumer applications. Since the early 1960s, Teflon™ brand nonstick coatings have been used on cookware. Although consumers know the Teflon™ trademark for its nonstick properties in cookware applications, not all nonstick coated cookware contains or is made with Chemours™ Teflon™ nonstick coatings.
Teflon ® is a brand name for a man-made chemical known as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). It has been in commercial use since the 1940s. It has a wide variety of applications because it is extremely stable (it doesn't react with other chemicals) and can provide an almost frictionless surface. Because the routes by which people may be exposed to PFOA are not known, it is unclear what steps people might take to reduce their exposure. Currently, the EPA states: Consumer products made with fluoropolymers and fluorinated telomers, such as Teflon and other trademark products, are not PFOA.

Most people are familiar with it as a non-stick coating surface for pans and other cookware. It is also used in many other products, such as fabric protectors. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), also known as C8, is another man-made chemical. It is used in the process of making Teflon and similar chemicals (known as fluorotelomers), although it is burned off during the process and is not present in significant amounts in the final products. Because the routes by which people may be exposed to PFOA are not known, it is unclear what steps people might take to reduce their exposure. Currently, the EPA states: Consumer products made with fluoropolymers and fluorinated telomers, such as Teflon and other trademark products, are not PFOA.
Teflon. Material Notes This is the brand name for a number of fluorinated polymers. Teflon is polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE). This is a polymer with repeating chains of –(CF2-CF2)- in it. Teflon was first discovered by Roy J. Plunkett (1910-1994) in 1938 and introduced as a commercial product in 1946.
