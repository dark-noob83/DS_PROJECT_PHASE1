I had the pleasure of talking to the team about the role that language plays in the development of children's thinking. In my view, we don't think hard enough about what we mean by this term 'thinking'. And if we're not clear enough, the age-old question of how language is involved in cognition becomes very messy. It seems to me that there are two common usages of the term
Thought can refer to the ideas or arrangements of ideas that result from thinking, the act of producing thoughts, or the process of producing thoughts. Although thought is a fundamental human activity familiar to everyone, there is no generally accepted agreement as to what thought is or how it is created. Somehow, thoughts arise in the mind from the product of subconscious brain processing. Thinking allows humans to make sense of, interpret, represent or model the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires as it makes plans or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals.
Cognitive psychology focuses on the way humans process information, looking at how we treat information that comes in to the person (what behaviorists would call stimuli), and how this treatment leads to responses. The cognitive perspective applies a nomothetic approach to discover human cognitive processes, but have also adopted idiographic techniques through using case studies (e.g. KF, HM). Cognitive psychology is also a reductionist approach.
I would hold that this view of thinking is the one that makes the most sense to us, because it is the one that most closely matches our experience. In the Radiolab show, I suggest that we can get a handle on what thinking is by introspecting on this experience. In my view, we don't think hard enough about what we mean by this term 'thinking'. And if we're not clear enough, the age-old question of how language is involved in cognition becomes very messy.

Cognitive psychology is a pure science, based mainly on laboratory experiments. Behavior can be largely explained in terms of how the mind operates, i.e. the information processing approach. The mind works in a way similar to a computer: inputting, storing and retrieving data. The cognitive perspective applies a nomothetic approach to discover human cognitive processes, but have also adopted idiographic techniques through using case studies (e.g. KF, HM).
