Well in March 2008 I was scheduled for a Depo appointment but I missed it and every since then I have had my period but it wasn't regular, but now I think it has finally gotten regular. I was wondering how long does it take for you to become pregnant after the Depo is out of your system.
The DEPO will stay in your system for 3 months but you can become pregnant and conceive, before the 3 month time frame is up. One in a 100 women getting a Depo shot every 12 weeks will get pregnant in a year. After stopping it takes on average a further 9-10 months to get pregnant.
It depends on how long you were on Depo and how your body reacted to it, and possibly some other factor we're not aware of. It can take up to 18 months for the effects of Depo to fully wear off, but some women bounce right back within a month after when you were due for your shot. posted 10/25/2012 by bazil323.
Best Answer: it could take anywhere from 12-18 months to get the Depo completely out of your system and start having regular periods. Every woman is different, so I would consult with your doc. Source(s): Mr Quain Â· 7 years ago.
Depo provera is out of the system 14 weeks after the last dose (but you are told to have a repeat injection every 12 weeks).

I was on the Depo shot for 4 years when I decided I wanted another baby. I was told it would take 1 year to 18 months after stopping to get pregnant. My last injection of Depo was in April 2005 which wore off 12 weeks later.
