The type of muscle found in the walls of blood vessels is A. cardiac.B. smooth.C. striated.D. voluntary.E. skeletal. 11. Muscle tissue is characterized by its A. strength.B. durability.C. contractilityD. rigidity.E. avascularity.
However, cardiac and smooth muscle may be additionally regulated by the endocrine system. Skeletal Muscle Tissue Structure Skeletal muscle tissue is formed from skeletal muscle fibers (cells). The fibers are characterized by being (1) long, (2) parallel, (3) cylindrical, and (4) multinucleate. (5) The nuclei of the fiber are located at the fiber’s periphery.
Skeletal Muscle Tissue • Location Skeletal muscle tissue is organized by connective tissues into the skeletal muscles.• Functions Skeletal muscle tissue functions in the – (1) production of voluntary body movements and – (2) heat production.
Muscle tissue is enclosed in facia, which in turn is attached to other structures including ligament. There are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. Muscle tissue provides a) posture and body support b) locomotion and c) heat production.
There are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. a. skeletal muscle: multinucleated, striated; attached to bones producing locomotion, general support and posture; producing heat. Contraction is voluntary, and not long-sustained.
2. There are four primary types of tissues; they are. epithelial, cartilage, muscular and brain. connective, epithelial, skin and blood. epithelial, connective, muscular and nervous. glands, bone, lungs and kidneys. 3. Muscle tissue is characterized by its. strength. durability. contractility. rigidity. 4. A tissue specialized for energy storage and thermal insulation is. cartilaginous tissue. muscular tissue.
