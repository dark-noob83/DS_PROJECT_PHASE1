Pulse oximetry is a simple, cheap, and noninvasive procedure used to measure the level of oxygen (or oxygen saturation) in the blood. Oxygen saturation should always be above 95 percent. However, oxygen saturation may be lower if you have a respiratory disease or congenital heart disease.
Pulse oximetry is a quick, noninvasive method of measuring oxygen saturation in the blood. Risks associated with pulse oximetry are minimal and rare. Prolonged application of the probe may cause tissue breakdown at the application site. Skin irritation may result from the adhesive used in adhesive-containing probes.
2. Understand the reasons for the procedure. Pulse oximetry is used to assess oxygen saturation in the blood for a variety of reasons. It is often used in surgeries and other procedures that involve sedation (such as a bronchoscopy and to make any adjustments of supplemental oxygen.
Pulse oximetry is a procedure used to measure the oxygen level (or oxygen saturation) in the blood. It is considered to be a noninvasive, painless, general indicator of oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues (such as the finger, earlobe, or nose).
Pulse oximetry also is not a complete measure of circulatory sufficiency. If there is insufficient bloodflow or insufficient hemoglobin in the blood (anemia), tissues can suffer hypoxia despite high oxygen saturation in the blood that does arrive.
Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method for monitoring a person's O 2 saturation. In its most common (transmissive) application mode, a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a fingertip or earlobe, or in the case of an infant, across a foot.
Pulse oximetry technology utilizes the light absorptive characteristics of hemoglobin and the pulsating nature of blood flow in the arteries to aid in determining the oxygenation status in the body.
