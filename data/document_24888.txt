Most of the plankton in the ocean are plants. Phytoplankton produce their own food by lassoing the energy of the sun in a process called photosynthesis. So for sunlight to reach them, they need to be near the top layer of the ocean. So must zooplankton, which feed on the phytoplankton. Plankton have evolved many different ways to keep afloat.
Cyanobacteria are the only bacteria that contain chlorophyll A, a chemical required for oxygenic photosynthesis (the same process used by plants and algae) 1,14. This process uses carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to produce oxygen and glucose (sugars) for energy.
However, phytoplankton are not the only source of oxygen. Phytoplankton produce oxygen through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to produce their own food. During photosynthesis plants use the energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide from the air into sugar molecules. When they do this they consume water and also carbon dioxide, and they produce oxygen.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria, and some protistans use the energy from sunlight to produce sugar, which cellular respiration converts into ATP, the fuel used by all living things.
Phytoplankton receive energy through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process of making glucose using sunlight. Carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water combine, producing glucose sugars that the being can use for energy. Zooplankton however feed off phytoplankton and decaying matter. They are known as detrivores.
