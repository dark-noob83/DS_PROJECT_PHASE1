2. Pork tenderloin is one of the quickest-cooking cuts of meat. You can grill a tenderloin over direct heat in less than 10 minutes, plus 5 minutes resting time. 3. Cooking pork tenderloin lends itself to varied methods and presentations. Take the tenderloin out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Film an ovenproof skillet with oil and sear the tenderloin over medium-high heat to brown all sides, about 5 minutes in all. If you’re using a glaze, apply it now. Place skillet in the oven and roast 15 to 20 minutes, until internal temperature is 145F degrees. Remove from the oven, tent the pork with foil and let it rest about 5 minutes before serving
1 Place the tenderloin in a roasting pan. 2  Place the pan in the oven and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 3  Allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Marinate the tenderloin. A marinade is similar to a brine, but instead of water you soak the pork in a mixture of vinegar, oil and spices. Make a marinade with 1/2 cup olive oil (118 ml) and 1/2 cup (118 ml) vinegar.
1 Roast for 30 minutes. 2  Turn the pork over and roast for another 25 minutes. 3  The pork tenderloin is ready when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 4  Remove the pork from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Marinate the tenderloin. A marinade is similar to a brine, but instead of water you soak the pork in a mixture of vinegar, oil and spices.

To cook the pork roast correctly, make sure you note how much the meat weighs, it takes approximately 25 minutes per pound at 350 degrees. The internal temperature of the pork roast should between 145 and 160 degrees. Do not overcook the pork, it will become dry. Also make sure you allow the pork loin roast for about 10 minutes before serving. There is no need to cover the roast with foil or a lid while it is cooking; this is a dry roasting technique. 
Roast in 450 degrees F oven for about 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Continue to roast for 55 to 60 minutes or until instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the pork, but not in the stuffing, registers 150 to 155 degrees F and potatoes are fork tender. 
WIth a roast, you generally want to cook to an internal temperature, not a time. But, when you lay it out butterflied, it’s thinner and more of the meat is exposed to heat, so if you were to cook it at 350 degrees at a 1/2 hour/lb. a 6 lb roast would end up ruinously overdone. 
With a pork tenderloin: Season the meat, sear all sides in a very hot pan, and then finish in the oven at 350°F (175°C) degrees until the internal temp. hits 145°F (63°C). Then let it sit for 10 minutes, and cut 'er up. If you need it done faster, a higher oven temp will accomplish this, but may compromise quality. I always season my pork tenderloins, then pan-sear for a crispy brown outer crust, then put into the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes to one hour. At 45 minutes, I begin checking the internal temperature of the meat.
Pan roasting. Pan searing and then finishing in a moderate oven (about 350 F, 175 C although there is flexibility here if you have other dishes to finish) is certainly one very effective method for cooking a pork tenderloin, but any method that brings it to the desired temperature will work.
