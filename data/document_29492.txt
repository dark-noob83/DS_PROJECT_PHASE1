A prophage gene is a gene of a bacteriophage (virus that targets bacteria) that is inserted and integrated into the circular bacterial DNA chromosome or plasmid. Bacteriophage … s reproduce by inserting their genome into that of a bacterium and thus getting their genes read and viral proteins produced.
A prophage is a bacteriophage (often shortened to phage) genome inserted and integrated into the circular bacterial DNA chromosome or existing as an extrachromosomal plasmid. This is a latent form of a phage, in which the viral genes are present in the bacterium without causing disruption of the bacterial cell.
Medical Definition of PROPHAGE. : an intracellular form of a bacteriophage in which it is harmless to the host, is usually integrated into the hereditary material of the host, and reproduces when the host does. ADVERTISEMENT. noun pro·phage \ˈprō-ˌfāj, -ˌfaezh\. ˌfäzh
prophage. the latent stage of a bacteriophage in a lysogenic bacterium, in which the viral genome becomes inserted usually at a specific location within the host chromosome and is duplicated into each cell generation. 1  Facebook.
