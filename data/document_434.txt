Our answer is .1587. About 16% of the population has an IQ score lower than 85. What if the question was like this: In the United States, the average IQ is 100, with a standard deviation of 15.
Assume that the salaries of elementary school teachers in the United States are normally distributed with a mean of $32,000 and a standard deviation of $3000. If a teacher is selected at random, find the probability that he or she makes more than $36,000. You have one chance out of one quadrillion of scoring 8 standard deviations higher than the mean. iow, IF there were half a BILLION Botswanans in the world, which of course there are NOT, not a SINGLE one of them would have scored 784 and thus demonstrated an IQ of 132.
Statistical information from Guiding the Gifted Child, 2002. The mean, or average, IQ is 100. Standard deviations, in most cases, are 15 points. The majority of the population, 68.26%, falls within one standard deviation of the mean (IQ 85-115). T his is the intellectual ability range addressed by the standard school age/grade-based curriculum. 2.14% of the population is between the second and third standard deviation below the mean (IQ 55-70), and 2.14% is between the second and third standard deviation above the mean (IQ 130-145).
Based on millions of results for the most popular IQ tests in the United States, it is thought that the standard deviation of the test scores for the population as a whole is likely to be 16 points, although the standard deviation of IQ scores can vary from test to test. An IQ score of 113 points is at the 79% percentile, meaning that in the United States, this translates into the top 21% of the population. In other words, one in five people have the average IQ of a university student.
It compares people of the same age or age category and assumes that IQ is normally distributed, that the average (mean) is 100 and that the standard deviation is something like 15 (IQ tests sometimes differ in their standard deviations). About 95% of the sample will be within 2 standard deviations from the mean (3). With the standard deviation and a mean, you can calculate percentiles. Percentiles tell you the percent of people that have a score equal to or lower than a certain score.
(There would be about 360,000 such individuals in the United States, or about 400,000 in the United States and Canada.) Four Standard Deviations Above the Average (IQ = 182) Approximately 99.997% of our population has an IQ of 181 or below. Only 0.003% or about 1 in 30,000 possesses an IQ of 182 or above. (There would be about 9,000 such individuals in the United States, or about 10,000 in the United States and Canada.) Five Standard Deviations Above the Average (IQ = 212) Approximately 99.9997% of our population has an IQ of 211 or below. Only 0.0000287% or about 1 in 3,500,000 can boast an IQ of 212 or above. Only 2% of the population, or about 1 in every 50 (the entry level for Mensa), has an IQ of 135 or above. Three Standard Deviations Above the Average (IQ = 157) Approximately 99.87% of the public, has an IQ of 156 or below.
Only 16% of the population, or about 1 in every 6 has an IQ of 116 or above. Two Standard Deviations Above the Average (IQ = 135) Approximately 98% of the public has an IQ of 134 or below. Only 2% of the population, or about 1 in every 50 (the entry level for Mensa), has an IQ of 135 or above. Three Standard Deviations Above the Average (IQ = 157) Approximately 99.87% of the public, has an IQ of 156 or below.
1 68% of the population will have an IQ score which is one standard deviation away from the mean score of 100 (i.e. 2  IQ scores ranging from 84 to 116 points). 3  95.4% of the population will have an IQ score which is two standard deviations away from the mean (i.e. An IQ score of 113 points is at the 79% percentile, meaning that in the United States, this translates into the top 21% of the population. In other words, one in five people have the average IQ of a university student.
An IQ score of 115 means performance one standard deviation above the median, a score of 85 performance one standard deviation below the median, and so on. Lewis Terman and other early developers of IQ tests noticed that most child IQ scores come out to approximately the same number by either procedure. Like all current IQ tests, the Wechsler tests report a deviation IQ as the standard score for the full-scale IQ, with the norming sample median raw score defined as IQ 100 and a score one standard deviation higher defined as IQ 115 (and one deviation lower defined as IQ 85).
By the current deviation IQ definition of IQ test standard scores, about two-thirds of all test-takers obtain scores from 85 to 115, and about 5 percent of the population scores above 125. Like all current IQ tests, the Wechsler tests report a deviation IQ as the standard score for the full-scale IQ, with the norming sample median raw score defined as IQ 100 and a score one standard deviation higher defined as IQ 115 (and one deviation lower defined as IQ 85).
