If you like curries, you will probably recognize the smell and taste of fenugreek seeds – a mixture of pungency and bitterness, yet also sweet. In India, among myriad other uses, they’re also used in making imitation maple syrup.
Fenugreek can be used both as an herb and a spice, though their flavor is similar. The leaves (top) are available fresh, frozen, or dried. Fresh leaves are used as leafy greens in curries (especially with potatoes), or folded into fry-breads.
Fenugreek is used for kidney ailments, a vitamin deficiency disease called beriberi, mouth ulcers, boils, bronchitis, infection of the tissues beneath the surface of the skin (cellulitis), tuberculosis, chronic coughs, chapped lips, baldness, cancer, and lowering blood sugar in people with diabetes.
While both smell like caramel or maple syrup when heated, their taste is rather bitter, like burnt sugar. Fenugreek is most widely used in Indian cuisine, though it's also found in North African and Middle Eastern dishes. It's used in many curry mixes, dry rubs for meat, and some bread recipes.
Apart from the unique flavor and aroma, fenugreek seeds can also contribute a thick slippery texture to dishes, just like okra. The fenugreek being processed by that New Jersey plant was probably destined for artificial maple syrup or butterscotch syrup.
In foods, fenugreek is included as an ingredient in spice blends. It is also used as a flavoring agent in imitation maple syrup, foods, beverages, and tobacco. In manufacturing, fenugreek extracts are used in soaps and cosmetics. Fenugreek leaves are eaten in India as a vegetable.
