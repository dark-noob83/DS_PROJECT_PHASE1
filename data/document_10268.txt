FOREWORD Azalea and Rhododendron Culture Both azaleas and rhododendrons belong to the genus Rhododendron, which is in the Ericaceae or heath family. Other members of the heath family include heaths, heathers, blueberries, mountain lau-rel, and andromeda (Pieris).
Submit. Azalea plants are flowering shrubs part of the Rhododendron family. There are around 800 species and over 10,000 types of azaleas. Species azaleas are reproduced through seeds, but varieties do not reproduce true from a seed. They are propagated from stem cuttings creating a clone plant of the parent. All this selection in azalea plant types creates a variety of plant growing conditions, sizes, blossom colors and blooming times.
The variations are also used to identify different azalea varieties, in terms of their flower parts: corollathe petals or lobes, typically 5 and joined at the inner base of the flower. The upper petal is known as the dorsal or upper lobe. The two petals to the side of the upper lobe are known as the upper wings.
azalea variability Azaleas are either species or hybrids. A species is a population that interbreeds and is reproductively isolated from other populations. Seedlings from such isolated species populations look like the parents, or grow true from seed. Hybrids are crosses between o
Azaleas belong to the genus Rhododendron and most are native to eastern Asia (evergreen species) or North America (deciduous species). Many azalea types and hybrids exist. Table 1 lists some of the most reliable cultivars for Florida landscapes.
Actually members of the rhododendron family, native azaleas differ from the popular hybrid varieties primarily in their habitat, preferring more shade than sun. In the wild, native azaleas are more likely to be found growing as a forest understory shrub, standing out from the background only during its blooming period.
