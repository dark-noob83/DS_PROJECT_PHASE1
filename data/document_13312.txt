A microwave uses electricity for its main energy source. then transmits into waves of electricity with high frequency to produce heat.
A microwave oven is a common kitchen appliance used for heating or cooking food by utilizing electromagnetic radiation. Compact microwaves use between 500 and 800 watts during heating, while a regular sized microwave will use 850 to 1800 watts depending on the model.
A microwave oven uses microwaves. This is a kind of electromagnetic wave. The energy source for the microwave oven is AC (alternating current, electricity), available in many houses.
When microwaves are absorbed by food containing water, it causes the water molecules to vibrate. This produces heat. Microwaves do not use x-rays or gamma rays, and they do not make food radioactive. Microwave ovens can cook food, but do not otherwise change the chemical or molecular structure of it. Microwave ovens are designed so that the microwaves are contained within the oven itself.
A microwave is a form of energy that falls within the electromagnetic spectrum. That means that microwaves are in the same family as visible light, radio waves and gamma rays.
Microwave cooking can be more energy efficient than conventional cooking because foods cook faster and the energy heats only the food, not the whole oven compartment. Microwave cooking does not reduce the nutritional value of foods any more than conventional cooking.
yes its does because when the microwave is on and the plate is rotating,the light is actually heating the food. It is not the visible light that does the heating, that is prov â€¦ ided simply so you can see inside the oven.
