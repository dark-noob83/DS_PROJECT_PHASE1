Depending on the variety of brown sugar, molasses is either added back to refined white sugar or left intact with the sugar crystals during the refining process. Brown sugar is prized for its deep, rich flavor and color. Because molasses is hydroscopic, brown sugar and the baked goods made with it retain moisture well. Brown sugar also contains a slightly higher mineral content than regular refined white sugar due to the presence of molasses.
Brown cane sugar is a combination of sugar and molasses, refined without any added colorings, flavorings, or coatings. Formed using the traditional method of crystallization, each C&HÂ® brown sugar crystal is brown all the way through. If cane sugar is not specified on the label, the sugar may be beet sugar.
