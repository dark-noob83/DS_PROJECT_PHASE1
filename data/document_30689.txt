An epigastric hernia happens when a weakness in the abdominal muscle allows the tissues of the abdomen to protrude through the muscle. An epigastric hernia is usually present at birth, and may heal without treatment as the infant grows and the abdominal muscles strengthen.
You are here: An epigastric hernia is a small hole in the abdominal wall between the sternum and the umbilicus (belly button). An epigastric hernia occurs when part of the fat or intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. It appears as a soft swelling above the area of the navel (umbilicus).
An epigastric hernia is treated with surgery to repair the opening in the abdomen wall that runs between the breastbone and naval. Most epigastric hernia surgery can be scheduled; emergency surgery is rare. There are two types of hernia surgery-herniorrhaphy (one long incision) and laparoscopy (several small incisions). Having more than one epigastric hernia or severe symptoms can influence which surgery is used to treat your hernia.
Umbilical hernia is when fatty tissue or a part of the bowel pushes through the abdomen close to your belly button (navel). Epigastric hernia is when fatty tissue pushes through your abdomen, between the belly button and breastbone (sternum).
An epigastric hernia is typically small enough that only the peritoneum, or the lining of the abdominal cavity, pushes through the muscle wall. In severe cases, portions of an organ may move through the hole in the muscle.
An epigastric hernia (say eh-pih-GAS-trik HER-nee-uh) occurs when fat pushes through a weak part of the belly wall. It occurs in the middle of the belly between the breastbone and the belly button, or navel. Most of the time, these hernias are small. You can have more than one at a time. Epigastric hernias often have no symptoms. But they can cause pain in the upper belly. You may need surgery to repair an epigastric hernia. Talk with your doctor about your treatment choices.
