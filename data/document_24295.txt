According to the Wyoming Beef Council, a prime rib roast will be medium rare when it reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees F and medium when it reaches 150 degrees F. They say to remove the roast from the oven 5 to 10 degrees before it reaches the desired temperature. Your most important tool for knowing when your prime rib is done to perfection is with a good quality meat thermometer. The time to start monitoring the internal temperature of your prime rib is at least 45 minutes before you expect it to be done.
