ABOUT THE FIVE (OR SIX) MAIN BASIC TASTES. Scientists describe seven basic tastes: bitter, salty, sour, astringent, sweet, pungent (eg chili), and umami. There are however five basic tastes that the tongue is sensitive to: salt, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami, the taste of MSG.
Humans detect taste with taste receptor cells. These are clustered in taste buds and scattered in other areas of the body. Each taste bud has a pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. 1  salty. 2  sour. 3  sweet. 4  bitter. 5  umami.

In addition to signal transduction by taste receptor cells, it is also clear that the sense of smell profoundly affects the sensation of taste. Think about how tastes are blunted and sometimes different when your sense of smell is disrupted due to a cold.
Taste. There are about 10,000 taste buds on the upper surface of the tongue. Each bud contains about 25 sensory receptor cells, on which tiny taste hairs are exposed to drink and food dissolved in saliva. Buds sense the five basic tastes: bitter, sour, salty, sweet, and umami (a savoury, meaty taste).
