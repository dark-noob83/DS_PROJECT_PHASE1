Sodium silicate is the common name for compounds with the formula Na 2 (SiO 2) n O. A well-known member of this series is sodium metasilicate, Na 2 SiO 3. Also known as waterglass or liquid glass, these materials are available in aqueous solution and in solid form. Sodium silicate solution is used to inexpensively, quickly, and permanently disable automobile engines. Running an engine with about 2 liters of a sodium silicate solution instead of motor oil causes the solution to precipitate, catastrophically damaging the engine's bearings and pistons within a few minutes.
Sodium metasilicate is a member of the sodium compound family, according to the International Programme on Chemical Safety. A very basic compound, sodium metasilicate is used in a variety of industrial and household settings. Sodium metasilicate is produced by fusing sand with sodium carbonate at very high temperatures, notes the International Programme on Chemical Safety. This produces a clear, white or grayish-white crystal solution. Sodium is a base, and therefore has a high pH level
Toxicological summary for sodium metasilicate [6834-92-0] and its 01/2002 pentahydrate [10213-79-3] and nonahydrate [13517-24-3] The generic name sodium silicate has been used randomly for several silicate forms, including sodium metasilicate (Loweinheim and Moran, 1975; cited by FASEB, 1981).

Storage. Sodium metasilicate should be stored in a dry location. Do not remove the compound from its original container because if stored in an improperly labeled container, this could create confusion as to its contents and increase the risk of injury. Because it is corrosive, store out of reach of children and pets.

Pulp and Paper. One principal use of sodium metasilicate is in the pulp and paper industry. It is used in sizing and coating paper. It is also used, coupled with hydrogen peroxide, in the cellulose bleaching process, in which it acts as a buffer and stabilizing agent. Sodium metasilicate, Na₂SiO₃, can be synthesized with various degrees of hydration. This very alkaline substance is formed by combining and melting sodium carbonate with silicon dioxide, Na₂CO₃ + SiO₂ ' Na₂SiO₃ + CO₂'. Sodium metasilicate has hundreds of uses, many of them related to its sealant properties.
In industry, the various grades of sodium silicate are characterized by their SiO 2 :Na 2 O weight ratio (weight ratios can be converted to molar ratios by multiplication with 1.032), which can vary between 2:1 and 3.75:1. Grades with this ratio below 2.85:1 are termed alkaline. Sodium silicate solution is used to inexpensively, quickly, and permanently disable automobile engines. Running an engine with about 2 liters of a sodium silicate solution instead of motor oil causes the solution to precipitate, catastrophically damaging the engine's bearings and pistons within a few minutes.
