An ingrown hair is a hair that has grown into the skin rather than out of the skin as it would naturally. This occurs after shaving or waxing. The skin curls during regrowth and grows back into the skin.
Q: A: I had ingrown hairs around my bikini area-probably 1 or 2 a day-until I got laser hair removal about 1 year ago. I used Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Moisturizer with Alpha/Beta Hydroxy Acids and I don't have any scarring. It took about 1-2 months to properly fade away. Even after all those years of ingrown hairs.
Time Frame. Ingrown hairs will go away as soon as the hair is allowed to grow out naturally. This process could last anywhere from a few days to several weeks depending upon the severity of the ingrown hair. Warm compresses applied to the skin will help ease discomfort during this time.
Ingrown hairs can go away on their own most of the time but for it to happen you will probably be faced with weeks of little red bumpy things on your body.
