Equipment Costs. The cost of starting a laundromat includes the purchase price or lease price for coin-operated washing and drying machines. These may range between $150,000 to $450,000 depending on brand name, sophistication, size, and strength.
Other start-up costs include professional installation, furniture, business incorporation or formation costs, utilities installation and customer supplies, such as a detergent vending machine. Typically, start-up costs for a laundromat can run from about $200,000 to over $1,000,000, according to Entrepreneur magazine. After assessing your start-up costs, your budget should include allowances for regular future expenses, such as loan financing payments, rent and maintenance.
If you buy an existing laundromat, your start-up cost is primarily the amount you pay for the business, as it will already be stocked with the necessary equipment and hook-ups. If you choose to build your own laundromat, a 2,000 square-foot space will typically cost between $200,000 and $500,000.
Material and Personnel Costs. You have the option of either purchasing or leasing equipment for a laundry business. The price of commercial washing and drying equipment ranges from $150,000 to $450,000, depending on the sophistication of the equipment and the size of your laundromat.
A key decision in setting up a laundromat is the business model. The primary options include: a franchise, a turnkey business or starting from scratch. This how-to focuses on starting from scratch. Using this method, Entrepreneur magazine estimates start-up costs of $200,000 to $500,000.
Step 8. Choose your accessories. Optional items you might want to include in your start-up laundromat include a soda vending machine for between $3,000 and $4,000, a security system typically running between $6,000 and $10,000, a television set for between $200 and $500, or a wi-fi connection for about $40 to start.
