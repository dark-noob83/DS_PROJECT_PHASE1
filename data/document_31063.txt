Part of the Computing fundamentals glossary: Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not, in the compression of a file, all original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed.
Lossy format means that data was lost during conversion from original source, for example WAV to MP3 results in loss of audio data that most people can't hear, because they're â€¦ probably have a terrible monitor chain. MP3 is a lossy format. WAV is lossless.
The word lossy is used in digital audio to describe the type of compression used to store sound data. The algorithm used in a lossy audio format compresses sound data in a way that discards some information. This means that the encoded audio isn't identical to the original.
Lossy. Lossy file compression results in lost data and quality from the original version. Lossy compression is typically associated with image files, such as JPEGs, but can also be used for audio files, like MP3s or AAC files. The lossyness of an image file may show up as jagged edges or pixelated areas.
Lossless audio files typically require more storage space than lossy encoded ones. However this type of format is often favored by users wanting to backup original audio CDs -- a perfect copy can be restored in the event of loss or damage to the CD. Also Known As: lossless, lossless data compression.
This contrasts with lossy audio formats (MP3, WMA, etc.) which compress audio using various interpolation techniques -- this results in a digital audio file that isn't exactly the same of the original. Examples of lossless formats, include: 1  FLAC.
