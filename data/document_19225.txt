Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male parts of a flower to the female parts of a flower of the same species, which results in fertilization of plant ovaries and the production of seeds.
Well, it all begins in the flower. Flowering plants have several different parts that are important in pollination. Flowers have male parts called stamens that produce a sticky powder called pollen. Flowers also have a female part called the pistil. The top of the pistil is called the stigma, and is often sticky. Seeds are made at the base of the pistil, in the ovule.
1. Which parts of the flowers are important in pollination? Describe their role in the process. The pistil (stigma) and stamen (anther) are important in pollination. Stamen, the male reproductive parts produce pollen. Pollen grains develop in the anther, a sac at the top of the stamen. The pistil, the female reproductive parts, has a sticky tip that traps pollen.
Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther (male part) of a flower to the stigma (female part) of a flower. The transfer of compatible pollen results in fertilization and the formation of seeds. The seeds stimulate growth of the surrounding ovarian tissue or the flesh of a fruit.
