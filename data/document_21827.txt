Foreigners can buy commercial class land in Kenya. This type of land is for income or revenue-making purposes. Foreigners are allowed to acquire this and build on it. Agricultural land or farm lands cannot be acquired by foreign individuals.
In the last couple of years, many foreigners have been acquiring immovable property in Kenya. Generally, there is no restriction of foreigners, corporations or their subsidiaries and affiliates owning or leasing real estate in Kenya.
Foreigners can own property in Kenya in their name. The Constitution (2010), the Lands Act (6/2012) and the Land Registration Act (3/2012), subject to certain limitations, grant the right to any person, either individually or in association with others, to acquire and own land in Kenya.
In Kenya, local and foreigners are permitted to buy commercial and residential real estate/lands located within a town or municipality without any restrictions whatsoever provided that comply with the laid down procedures.
The land will be bought under the company s name. There are freehold and leasehold types of land. Mostly, land in Kenya is government-owned. This can be leased for 50 to 99 years. The first step to purchasing property in Kenya is to hire a real estate lawyer.
So where the land buying firm is foreign-owned, or where a non-Kenya citizen wishes to buy land that falls under the Act, the first step involves the incorporation of a private company with two Kenya citizen shareholders. The company then buys the land.
