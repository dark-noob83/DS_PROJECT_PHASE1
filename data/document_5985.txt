Passport. For U.S. citizens, a valid U.S. passport is required for entry to Colombia. If you have dual nationality in the U.S. and Colombia, you will need to use your Colombian passport to enter Colombia and your U.S. passport to re-enter the United States. Colombian authorities consider any person born in Colombia to be a Colombian citizen, even if you have never been documented this way.
Colombia tourist visa is not required for citizens of United States for a stay up to 90 days. Good news if tourist visa is the correct choice for the purpose of your trip to Colombia.
If you are a citizen from the United States, Canada, UK, Ireland, Germany, or Australia, and have a passport, and are not planning on staying more than 90 days then you will not need a visa to be issued before you travel to Colombia. You will receive a stamp in your passport when you arrive in Colombia.
Paperwork Requirements for Visas. The Colombian Embassy in the U.S. indicates that U.S. passport holders need to complete a visa application before traveling to Colombia. The visa application form is available online at the Colombian Embassy website.
Visa Requirements Return to top. U.S. Citizens (who are not also Colombian citizens) traveling to Colombia are required to carry a valid U.S. passport to enter and depart Colombia and a return/onward ticket. U.S. citizens do not need a visa for a tourist/business stay of 60 days or less. Stiff fines are imposed if passports are not stamped on arrival and/or if stays exceeding the authorized period of stay (generally 60-90 days) are not approved in advance by Colombian Immigration.
Visas. British nationals can enter Colombia for up to 90 days as a visitor without a visa at the discretion of the Colombian Immigration Officer on arrival. You may need to provide evidence of return or onward travel. Check the latest entry requirements with the Colombian Consulate General in London before you travel.
