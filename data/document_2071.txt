Jim Y. , Marietta, Ga. At Nissan, SV apparently is internal code for one or two steps above the base model.. The SV models in Nissan's lineup are a step up from the S version in price and standard equipment, and the S models are typically the lowest or second-lowest priced versions.
You can see how this plays out with the redesigned 2013 Nissan Altima, which comes in base 2.5 (denoting the engine size in liters), S, SV and SL trim (or price) levels.
Other Nissan models follow a similar pattern, though there are differences. For example, the Pathfinder and Murano come in S, SV and SL trim levels; the Pathfinder adds a top-shelf Platinum model; and the Murano has an LE version as its most-expensive offering.
The 2015 Nissan Altima sedan seats five and comes in seven trims, ranging from the base 2.5 to the top-of-the-line 3.5 SL. The Altima comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, a continuously variable transmission and front-wheel drive. A 3.5-liter V6 engine is available.
Models and Features. For 2014, the Altima is available in two model series. The Altima 2.5 models have a 4-cylinder engine while the Altima 3.5 models have a V-6 engine. Only the Altima 2.5 is offered in a base level of trim. Otherwise, both series share S, SV, and, SL trim level designations.
