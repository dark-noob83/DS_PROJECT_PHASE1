The global average human exposure to artificial radiation is 0.6 mSv/a, primarily from medical imaging. This medical component can range much higher, with an average of 3 mSv per year across the USA population. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to ambient radiation fields was 131 mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal committed dose from radon was 72 mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr). This unique case is over 80 times higher than the world average natural human exposure to radiation.
The total amount of radiation that a person is exposed to is called a dose. The dose rate is the amount of radiation a person is exposed to during a given period of time. For example, if the dose rate is 50 millirems per hour, then a person has been exposed to a total dose of 50 millirems of radiation in one hour. At this same dose rate, the total dose in one-half hour would be 25 millirems.
The maximum permissible exposure for a person under 18 working with radiation is one-tenth the adult limit or not to exceed 500 millirems per year above the 300+ millirems of natural sources, plus medical radiation. 25,000 millirems per year level was the federal occupational limit during World War II and until about 1950 for radiation workers and soldiers exposed to radiation. The occupational limit became 15,000 millirems per year around 1950. In 1957, the occupational limit was lowered to a maximum of 5,000 millirems per year.
Radon in indoor air results in a dose equivalent of about 200 millirem annually, on the average, but can be much higher or lower depending on the radon level in a person's home. Besides radon, the average dose equivalent from background radiation to residents of the United States is about 100 millirem per year. 
According to the chart, the average person safely absorbs about 3.65 millisieverts (or 0.00365 sieverts) of radiation annually, through simple activities like living in a brick or concrete building (70 microsieverts a year) or sleeping next to another person (0.05 microsieverts). 
All radiation, even low-level background radiation, can damage exposed parts of the human body. Scientists use the term rem to describe an amount of radiation to which a person is exposed. A millirem is 1/1000th of a rem. Every person living in the United States is exposed to about 360 millirems of radiation per year. For example, if the dose rate is 50 millirems per hour, then a person has been exposed to a total dose of 50 millirems of radiation in one hour. At this same dose rate, the total dose in one-half hour would be 25 millirems.
The average dose per person from all sources is about 620 mrems per year. It is not, however, uncommon for any of us to receive less or more than that in a given year (largely due to medical procedures we may undergo). 
The 1000 most exposed residents receive an average external effective radiation dose of 6 mSv per year, (0.6 rem/yr,) six times the ICRP recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources. They additionally receive a substantial internal dose from radon. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to ambient radiation fields was 131 mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal committed dose from radon was 72 mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr). This unique case is over 80 times higher than the world average natural human exposure to radiation.
This amount is beyond the average 300+ millirems of natural sources of radiation and any medical radiation a person has received. 25,000 millirems per year level was the federal occupational limit during World War II and until about 1950 for radiation workers and soldiers exposed to radiation. The occupational limit became 15,000 millirems per year around 1950. In 1957, the occupational limit was lowered to a maximum of 5,000 millirems per year.
The average exposure in the United States, from natural sources of radiation (mostly cosmic radiation and radon), is 300 millirems per year at sea level. Radiation exposure is slightly higher at higher elevations-thus the exposure in Denver averages 400 millirems per year. (A milliRem is 1/1000th of a Rem. 25,000 millirems per year level was the federal occupational limit during World War II and until about 1950 for radiation workers and soldiers exposed to radiation. The occupational limit became 15,000 millirems per year around 1950. In 1957, the occupational limit was lowered to a maximum of 5,0
