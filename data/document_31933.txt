Scientists have divided the interior of Earth into various layers, based on their composition. The crust, or outer portion, varies in depth from 5 to 25 miles (8 to 40 kilometers). Below the crust is the mantle, which extends to a depth of about 1,800 miles (2,900
The Earth's atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding the planet Earth and retained by the Earth's gravity. It contains roughly (by molar content/volume) 78.08% nitogen â€¦ , 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.038% carbon dioxide, trace amounts of other gases, and a variable amount (average around 1%) of water vapor. The  thickness of the atmosphere or the distance between the earth's  surface and the top of the atmosphere is not exactly measurable.  With increasing altitude the atmosphere fades slowly away into  space. Therefore it is not easy to tell exactly how high the  atmosphere rally is.
Layers of the Earth's Atmosphere. The earth's atmosphere is composed of distinct layers. The troposphere extends upward from the earth to a height of about 5 mi (8.1 km) at the poles, to about 7 mi (11.3 km) in mid-latitudes, and to about 10 mi (16.1 km) at the equator. The air in the troposphere is in constant motion, with both horizontal and vertical air currents (see wind).
The outer core surrounds the inner core. The outer core is the only liquid layer of the Earth. You could say that the outer core is basically a sea of iron and nickel. The outer core is 2100 miles and also is in an range of 200-300 kilometres thick. 7,200 to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,000 to 5,000 degrees Celsius). 
The Earth's Crust is like the skin of an apple. It is very thin in comparison to the other three layers. The crust is only about 3-5 miles (8 kilometers) thick under the oceans(oceanic crust) and about 25 miles (32 kilometers) thick under the continents (continental crust).

Most of the earth's atmosphere (80 to 90%) is found in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer where we live. This layer, where the earth's weather occurs, is within about 12 km (7 miles) of the earth's surface. The stratosphere goes up to about 53 km (29 miles). Gravity is the reason the atmosphere is more dense closer to the earth's surface.
Second, notice the distances from the earth's surface to (1) the boundaries between the layers and (2) the distance to the center of the Earth -- these are in kilometers or the abbreviation km . First note that the diagram above is NOT to scale, but a highly exaggerated cartoon.
