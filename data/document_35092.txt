Tin solders are widely used in the electronics industry. Image c/o: Erodov.com. Tin is a soft, silvery-white metal that is very light and easy to melt. Being so soft, tin is rarely used as a pure metal; instead, it is combined with other metals in order to make alloys that possess tin's numerous beneficial properties. These include a low toxicity level and a high resistance to corrosion.
One of the most common types of metal roofing, is 24 ga. or 26 ga. standing seam metal roofing. These are metal panels that come in various widths and are seamed together with a special tool. This is what you think of when you see a typical tin roof, but vertical seams can be done in many different styles and patterns.
White tin is the normal form of the metal and has many uses. Unfortunately, white tin will turn into gray tin if its temperature falls below 13.2Â°C. This change can be prevented if small amounts of antimony or bismuth are added to white tin. Tin resists corrosion and is used as a protective coating on other metals.
Tin is used to form many useful alloys. Bronze is an alloy of tin and copper. Tin and lead are alloyed to make pewter and solder. An alloy of tin and niobium is used to make superconductive wire. Type metal, fusible metal, bell metal and Babbitt metal are other examples of tin alloys. Tin salts can be sprayed onto glass to make electrically conductive coatings. These can then be used to make panel lighting and frost-free windshields.
The type of metal roofing that you can have installed on your Orlando home or business can come in several different profiles, colors and sizes. There are even some styles of metal roofing that are made to look like tile, slate or wood shake shingles and mimic other roofing materials.
