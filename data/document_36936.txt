Welcome to ITKE, danonyango! Moore's law, which was derived from a speech in 1965 by the founder of Intel Gordon Moore, refers to the number of microcomponents that can be placed in a microchip of ...
Prediction that the number of transistors (hence the processing power) that can be squeezed onto a silicon chip of a given size will double every 18 months. Stated by Gordon Moore (a cofounder of computer chip maker Intel and its former chairman) in 1965, it has proven to be amazingly accurate over the years.
DEFINITION of 'Moore's Law'. An observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965. He noticed that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention. Moore's law predicts that this trend will continue into the foreseeable future.
Moore's law. n. The prediction that the number of transistors that can be placed on an affordable integrated circuit will double during a specific time period, usually said to be every 18 months or every 2 years. [After Gordon.
(n.) The observation made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the integrated circuit was invented.
