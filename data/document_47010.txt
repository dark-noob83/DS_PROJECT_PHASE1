Primary Nutrients. Fertilizer contains three primary nutrients: Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. You can tell what percentage of nutrients is in your fertilizer by looking at the NPK number on the label of your chosen fertilizer. Nitrogen promotes growth and color. Phosphorous helps grass establish strong root systems and fight fungal diseases. Potassium aids in photosynthesis.
Starter fertilizers contain a higher percentage of phosphorous to promote healthy, strong roots. When seeding a lawn, you should never apply the fertilizer and seed together. This can cause an uneven distribution of the materials resulting in patchy areas or seedlings burned by excess fertilizer.
Soil typically does not have enough nutrients to support seed germination or grass growth. Apply the right fertilizer and work it into the soil just before planting grass seed to add nutrients to the soil and prevent burning up grass seed.
When your lawn doesn't need a big influx of lime to raise the pH, you don't have to wait after applying fertilizer before you apply the lime as part of your regular lawn maintenance. If you're not adding more than 50 pounds per 1,000 square feet, you can apply both on the same day -- just not at the same time.
A: Yeah, you can overseed and apply lime and fertilizer at the same time. Use a starter fertilizer, though (nothing too high in nitrogen), and go with pelleted lime (not the powdered kind that will leave you looking like Casper the Ghost afterward). Water well when you're done or do this right before a rain.
