Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver. Jaundice occurs when the liver doesn’t break down bilirubin properly. Jaundice arises for one of these reasons: 1  The liver is damaged and can’t break down bilirubin. Besides a liver problem, other possible reasons for dark colored urine include: 1  Dehydration – The darker the urine, the more dehydrated you might be. 2  Eating certain foods like rhubarb, aloe and fava beans. 3  B Vitamins – Although this typically results in bright orange urine.
Dark urine can be the result of a problem with the liver or bile ducts, especially if accompanied by lighter-than-normal stools. Dark urine and light stools are one of the ways to detect jaundice, when there is too much bilirubin in the body. Outwardly, jaundice is recognized as a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, but what we excrete is also revealing.

Haemolytic jaundice. His stools are dark. There is no bilirubin in his urine, but his urinary urobilinogen is increased. His blood shows increased levels of unconjugated prehepatic bilirubin (leading to high readings on the indirect van den Bergh test). His transaminases (GPT and GOT) are normal, and so is his alkaline phosphatase. When jaundice is due to an obstruction in the flow of bile: (1) The patient's stools are pale. (2) His urine is dark, and contains little or no urobilinogen. (3) His skin itches.
The main symptom of jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the white area of the eye and the skin. Urine is dark in colour. The conjunctiva of the eye are one of the first tissues to change color as bilirubin levels rise in jaundice. This is sometimes referred to as scleral icterus. Bilirubin is not usually found in the urine because unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, so, the combination of increased urine-urobilinogen with no bilirubin (since, unconjugated) in urine is suggestive of hemolytic jaundice. Laboratory findings include: 1  gut flora has not developed).
They also ask when urine started to look dark (which usually occurs before jaundice develops). People are asked about other symptoms, such as itching, fatigue, changes in stool, and abdominal pain. Doctors are particularly interested in symptoms that suggest a serious cause. If bilirubin levels are high, substances formed when bile is broken down may accumulate, causing itching all over the body. But jaundice itself causes few other symptoms in adults. However in newborns, high bilirubin levels (hyperbilirubinemia) can cause a form of brain damage called kernicterus.
Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes due to abnormally high levels of bilirubin (bile pigment) in the bloodstream. Urine is usually dark because of the bilirubin excreted through the kidneys. High levels of bilirubin may be attributed to inflammation, or other abnormalities of the liver cells, or blockage of the bile ducts. Sometimes, jaundice is caused by the breakdown of a large number of red blood cells, which can occur in newborns.
Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin is formed when hemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) is broken down as part of the normal process of recycling old or damaged red blood cells. If bilirubin levels are high, substances formed when bile is broken down may accumulate, causing itching all over the body. But jaundice itself causes few other symptoms in adults. However in newborns, high bilirubin levels (hyperbilirubinemia) can cause a form of brain damage called kernicterus.
Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that causes jaundice and dark yellow colored urine when present in increased amounts. Some people normally have higher bilirubin in their blood. This is known as Gilbert's disease. So their urine will naturally have more bilirubin. It is not usual for bilirubin to be present in the urine, which otherwise indicates a problem with either the liver or the red blood cells. The liver and red blood cells can both be affected by many temporary disease processes, including infections.
Jaundice is the medical term that describes yellowing of the skin and eyes. This condition forms when there is too much bilirubin in your system. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver. Normally, the liver gets rid of bilirubin along with old red blood cells.
Bilirubin is primarily a product of the breakdown of red blood cells by the liver. Elevated bilirubin in urine causes include a malfunction of the liver-resulting in the kidneys performing the filtration responsibilities and therefore causing the bilirubin to be removed through the urine. It is not usual for bilirubin to be present in the urine, which otherwise indicates a problem with either the liver or the red blood cells. The liver and red blood cells can both be affected by many temporary disease processes, including infections.
