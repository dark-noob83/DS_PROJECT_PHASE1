EPDM is an extremely durable synthetic rubber roofing membrane (ethylene propylene diene terpolymer) widely used in low-slope buildings in the United States and worldwide. Its two primary ingredients, ethylene and propylene, are derived from oil and natural gas.
Combining the benefits of EPDM and TPO (thermoplastic olefin), BriteTEK Roof Membrane provides a watertight roof with superior puncture and tear resistance, making it ideal for OEM and aftermarket applications. BriteTEK passes the ASTM 20-year accelerated aging test and resists uneven weathering and fading.
Synthetic Rubber (Thermoset) – This type of membrane roof is made of large, flat pieces of synthetic rubber or similar materials. These pieces are bonded together at the seams to form one continuous membrane. The finished roof’s thickness is usually between 30 and 60 mils(thousandths of an inch) (0.75 mm to 1.50 mm).
Membrane roofing is a type of roofing system designed to reduce the leaks and pooling associated with other roofing materials. This system is gradually replacing the traditional asphalt roof found on many homes and businesses. It is often used on roofs that are flat or very slightly sloped.
Membrane roofing is a type of roofing system for buildings and tanks. It is used on flat or nearly flat roofs to prevent leaks and move water off the roof. Membrane roofs are most commonly made from synthetic rubber, thermoplastic (PVC or similar material), or modified bitumen.
Modified bitumen systems are the most affordable type of membrane roofing, and the most common for residential applications. Rubber compounds and other modifiers are added to traditional asphalt roofing compounds, which is heated with a torch so that it melts and forms a tight seal over the roof.
