C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. This article discusses the blood test done to measure the amount of CRP in your blood.
Causes of Elevated Protein Levels. CRP levels increase when there is some degree of inflammation in the body. Positive CRP results may indicate cancer, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, connective tissue disease and pneumonia.

C-reactive protein (CRP). The liver produces a type of acute phase protein known as C-reactive protein (CRP) and the level of C-reactive protein increases in the blood when there is inflammation in the body. When there is tissue damage the concentration of CRP in the blood can double every six hours.
C-reactive protein is not normally found in the blood of healthy people. It appears after an injury, infection, or inflammation and disappears when the injury heals or the infection or inflammation goes away.
