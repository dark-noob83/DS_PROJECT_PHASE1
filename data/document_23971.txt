If we switch a C/10 standard charger on and off such that it is on for only 10% of the time, we would be continuously replacing any lost charge. We could do this by switching a C/10 charger on for one second off for nine seconds.
That depends on the output of your charger. It should state somewhere what its output is, but generally on dumb wall chargers the output is 300miliamps. To determine how long you should charge your battery, take the capacity of your battery (mah) and divide it by the output of your charger (ma). If your charger puts out 300ma, then 1600/300=5.33 hours. 1  0.
A charger that can charge a standard capacity AAA NiCD battery (180 mAh) in just one hour might take 8 hours to charge a high capacity NiMH (1500 mAh) battery. It's best to ignore such terms and make a rough calculation of how fast a charger can charge batteries.
A typical manufacturer recommends a 15 hour charge to fully charge a discharged battery. If your battery is only partially discharged, your can prorate the charge time. For instance, a battery that is one third discharged will fully charge in only 5 hours.
Further, if you want to calculate how long it will take for your. charger, the equation is mah/amps*.06 =. minutes to charge. For a 4500mah battery with 2 amp charger., 4500/2 * .06 = 135 minutes to charge. The reason standard data usb ports are also used (insread of making all usb ports charging-capable) is noise.
The “overnight” charger that comes with most rechargeable powered products charges at a rate of C/10 (the C rate is the hour capacity of the battery, i.e. a typical AA NiCd battery of 600mAh capacity has a C rate of 600mA, and a C/10 rate of 60mA). There is a very good reason why the manufacturer chose this rate.
