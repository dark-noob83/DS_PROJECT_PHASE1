Now the picture is not symmetric around the mean anymore. For a right skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median. Also notice that the tail of the distribution on the right hand (positive) side is longer than on the left hand side. From the box and whisker diagram we can also see that the median is closer to the first quartile than the third quartile.
For skewed distributions, it is quite common to have one tail of the distribution considerably longer or drawn out relative to the other tail. A skewed right distribution is one in which the tail is on the right side. A skewed left distribution is one in which the tail is on the left side. The above histogram is for a distribution that is skewed right. Skewed distributions bring a certain philosophical complexity to the very process of estimating a typical value for the distribution.
If the data set is skewed to the right, the mean is greater than the mode, and so subtracting the mode from the mean gives a positive number. A similar argument explains why data skewed to the left has negative skewness.
By skewed left, we mean that the left tail is long relative to the right tail. Similarly, skewed right means that the right tail is long relative to the left tail. If the data are multi-modal, then this may affect the sign of the skewness. Some measurements have a lower bound and are skewed right.
1 When a distribution is skewed to the right (blue dotted curve), the tail on the curve's right-hand side is longer than the tail on the left-hand side, and the mean is greater than the mode. 2  This situation is also called positive skewness.
1 This situation is also called negative skewness. 2  When a distribution is skewed to the right (blue dotted curve), the tail on the curve's right-hand side is longer than the tail on the left-hand side, and the mean is greater than the mode. 3  This situation is also called posi
