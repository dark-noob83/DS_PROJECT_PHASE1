The large muscle of the posterior part of the lower leg. It is the most superficial of the calf muscles. The gastrocnemius has 2 heads, one originating along the outside of the head and condyle of the femur and the other originating along the medial popliteal surface of the femur.
The Superficial Muscles of the Body. The muscles of the body create most of the exterior form of the body. These undulations in the surface are what artists have always sought to portray. The characteristic flexing of the muscles profoundly changes the outside structure of the figure because when one muscle moves, others follow.
Muscle layers of the anterior and lateral body wall : Muscle layers of the anterior and lateral body wall. Embryology: The muscles of the anterior and lateral body wall consist of three flat muscles and a pair of vertical muscles in the abdomen. In the thorax, all muscles are flat.
External abdominal oblique muscle. The external abdominal oblique muscle is the largest and most superficial of the 3 paired, flat abdominal muscles. It arises from the lower 8 ribs and interdigitations of the serratus anterior muscle.
This a large, fan shaped muscle, and is the most superficial muscle in the pectoral region. It also makes up most of the anterior wall of the axilla.
The transversus abdominis muscle is the deepest of the 3 paired, flat abdominal muscles. It originates on the internal surfaces of the 7th–12th costal cartilages, thoracolumbar fascia, anterior three fourths of the iliac crest, and lateral third of the inguinal ligament.
Pectoralis Major. This a large, fan shaped muscle, and is the most superficial muscle in the pectoral region. It also makes up most of the anterior wall of the axilla. The muscle has two heads – a clavicular head (attaches to the clavicle), and a sternocostal head (attaches to the sternum and ribs).
