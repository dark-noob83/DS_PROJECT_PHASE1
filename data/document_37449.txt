The Mauna Ulu eruption of Kīlauea began on May 24, 1969, and ended on July 22, 1974. At the time, Mauna Ulu was the longest flank eruption of any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. Lavas younger than 1,000 years cover 90 percent of the volcano. The oldest exposed lavas date back 2,800 and 2,100 years. The first well-documented eruption of Kīlauea occurred in 1823, and since that time the volcano has erupted repeatedly.
All of the earthquakes have been less than a 2.2 in seismic activity except for one magnitude 3.5 earthquake. This much activity has not occurred since the last time the volcano erupted for three weeks in 1984. Hawaii’s Mauna Loa also erupted in 1975, only nine years prior. During the last eruption, Mauna Loa’s lava came within four miles of the city of Hilo. After nearly three decades of being restful, the giant, active volcano is waking up. Over the past 13 months, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory recorded increasing levels of seismic activity in Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano.
Mauna Loa is an active volcano and is due for an eruption. Mauna Loa has erupted 15 times since 1900. These eruptions have lasted from a few hours to 145 days. Since 1950 Mauna Loa has erupted only twice, in 1975 and 1984. It erupted most recently in 1790 at La Perouse Bay. Hualalai is an active volcano. The resort town of Kailua is on the southwest flank of the volcano. Hualalai last erupted in 1801 and sent lava from a vent on its northeast rift down to the ocean.
Lava from the Pu'u O'o crater eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, active since 1983, meets the ocean and large littoral explosions from steam result. This photo was taken on July 16, 2008.

On Jan. 3, 1983, superheated gas and magma drilled through thick piles of ancient lava in Hawaii, forcing open a 4-mile-long (6.4 kilometers) fissure in Kilauea volcano's east rift zone. A fiery cone, called Pu'u 'O'o, soon rose out of the charred rain forest.
The summit eruption continues today with a lava lake deep within the vent and a plume of volcanic gases. Collapses within the vent and along its rim enlarged the summit vent from 115 feet (35 meters) in 2008 to more than 500 feet (150 meters) in diameter by the end of 2012. On Jan. 3, 1983, superheated gas and magma drilled through thick piles of ancient lava in Hawaii, forcing open a 4-mile-long (6.4 kilometers) fissure in Kilauea volcano's east rift zone. A fiery cone, called Pu'u 'O'o, soon rose out of the charred rain forest.
Hawaiian eruptions may occur along fissure vents, such as during the eruption of Mauna Loa Volcano in 1950, or at a central vent, such as during the 1959 eruption in Kīlauea Iki Crater, which created a lava fountain 580 meters (1,900 ft) high and formed a 38-meter cone named Pu ʻ u Pua ʻ i. Very little amounts of volcanic ash are produced. This type of eruption occurs most often at hotspot volcanoes such as Kīlauea and Iceland, though it can occur near subduction zones (e.g. Medicine Lake Volcano in California, United States) and rift zones.
Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano is between 300,000 and 600,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago. It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Lavas younger than 1,000 years cover 90 percent of the volcano. The oldest exposed lavas date back 2,800 and 2,100 years. The first well-documented eruption of Kīlauea occurred in 1823, and since that time the volcano has erupted repeatedly.
In fissure-type eruptions, lava spurts from a fissure on the volcano's rift zone and feeds lava streams that flow downslope. In central-vent eruptions, a fountain of lava can spurt to a height of 300 meters or more (heights of 1600 meters were reported for the 1986 eruption of Mount Mihara on Izu Ōshima, Japan). Very little amounts of volcanic ash are produced. This type of eruption occurs most often at hotspot volcanoes such as Kīlauea and Iceland, though it can occur near subduction zones (e.g. Medicine Lake Volcano in California, United States) and rift zones.
Lava from the Puu Oo cone of the Kilauea volcano reaches the Pacific Ocean on the southeastern coast of Hawaii Island in January 2013. Puu Oo has been erupting for more than 30 years. This eruption, on the volcano's east rift, began in January 1983.
