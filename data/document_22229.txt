Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, known as EDTA, is a chemical salt used to separate heavy metals from dyes and other substances. One form, known as calcium disodium EDTA, appears in foods and cosmetic products to prevent air from spoiling them by introducing unwanted oxygen into the products' molecular structures. Chelation Therapy Side Effects. Calcium disodium EDTA is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in chelation therapy, which removes heavy metals from the body, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.
Calcium Disodium may sound like a salt, but it is not, the proper name is the EDTA which is short for Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (we will not even try to tell you how to pronounce that). It is made from a concoction of poisons and chelation chemicals. When combined, ceftriaxone reacts with calcium disodium EDTA to produce calcium crystals in the lungs and kidneys, which can be life threatening. The calcium disodium EDTA may also result in the body absorbing more ceftriaxone than it should, which reduces the efficacy of the antibiotic in destroying bacteria.
1 Treating lead poisoning. 2  Administering EDTA intravenously and intramuscularly is effective for treating lead poisoning and brain damage caused by lead exposure. 3  The calcium disodium form of EDTA is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these uses. 1 For calcium deposits on the cornea of the eye: Healthcare providers use EDTA as part of a procedure. 2  For lead poisoning and also for high levels of calcium in the blood: Healthcare providers give EDTA intravenously (by IV). 3  For lead poisoning: Healthcare providers give EDTA in a shot (by injection).
To help combat low vitamin levels, calcium disodium EDTA is usually given with a vitamin booster. Other side effects include allergic reactions; dangerously low blood sugar, blood pressure, or blood calcium levels; kidney failure and seizures. Chelation Therapy Side Effects.

Calcium disodium EDTA is a white, odorless, crystalline powder, with a faint, salty taste. In the food industry, it is commonly used a preservative and sequestrant. Common Uses: Calcium disodium EDTA is widely used and is becoming one of the most common organic pollutants. 2. Besides its use as a food additive, it is used in the textile and paper industries.

Calcium disodium EDTA has been approved in the U.S. for use in chelation therapy. Chelation therapy helps to remove heavy metals from the body and is used to treat lead poisoning and radiation exposure. As a food additive, it helps to prevent colour or flavour deterioration.
