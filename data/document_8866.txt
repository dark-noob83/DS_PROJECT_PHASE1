The rise and fall of the sea is known as the tide. The tides are caused by the moon's gravitational pull on earth. So, when the moon is facing a certain side of the earth, it â€¦ literally pulls the water towards it. The daily cycle of the rising and falling of the sea level is called the tide.
(Answer #1). By sea level, we refer roughly to the height of the sea or ocean surface. Sea level increases when the volume of water in the ocean increases and vice versa. One of the chief environmental processes that control sea level is climatic change.

So, when the moon is facing a certain side of the earth, it literally pulls the water towards it. The daily cycle of the rising and falling of the sea level is called the tide. The tide rises and falls about 4 times in 24 hours and the period in between cycles when the tide is neither rising or falling is called the slack tide.
