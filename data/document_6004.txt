The WCS list of animals affected by climate change includes five completely different creatures: Bicknell’s Thrush, a species native to high-elevation regions of the Eastern US, is seeing major changes in its breeding habitat due to global climate change.
Climate Change-effects on animals, birdlife and plants. Our climate is changing, both naturally and due to human exploitation. There is already undeniable evidence that animals, birds and plants are being affected by climate change and global warming in both their distribution and behavior. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are severely reduced, climate change could cause a quarter of land animals, birdlife and plants to become extinct.
Contact |. Print |. A A. Scientists say animals are being affected by global warming as climate change, which has occurred naturally throughout history, has accelerated over the past century through increased CO2 emissions. If an animal can't respond to climate changes by migration or adaptation, extinction is the logical progression.
The “poster child” for global warming is the polar bear. But many other animals are already feeling the effects of global climate change on the oceans. Find out about the changing climate's impact on the earth’s population of sea turtles, right whales, penguins, seals, lobsters, and cod.
