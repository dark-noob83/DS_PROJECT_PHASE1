Dear Tax Talk, I am a U.S. citizen working for a U.N. agency in Thailand for the last two years and qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion. I had made several contributions to a Roth IRA in 2009, but I am learning all of a sudden that I cannot do this if claiming the foreign earned income exclusion. I am using a tax program and at the end of the program I am being instructed that I owe money and will continue to do so each and every year. You need to advise the IRA custodian of your problem and decide what is best as far as applying the contribution to the 2010 tax year or withdrawing the funds. Any earnings on the Roth should be included in your 2009 income tax return.
Learn what counts as compensation income that allows you to make IRA contributions. You canâ€™t make a regular (non-rollover) contribution to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA unless you or your spouse have qualifying income. This page explains what types of income count as qualifying income for this purpose. 1 In a regular IRA, your deduction is reduced if you participate in an employer retirement plan and your income exceeds certain limits, although your contribution is not reduced. 2  In a Roth IRA, your contribution is reduced if your income exceeds certain limits.
If you are married filing jointly, you can make a full contribution to a Roth IRA if your income is less than $181,000 ($181,000 - $191,000 for a partial contribution) in 2014 and $183,000 ($183,000 - $193,000 for a partial contribution) in 2015. As a single filer, you can make a full contribution to a Roth IRA if your income is less than $114,000 ($114,000 - $129,000 for a partial contribution) in 2014 and $116,000 ($116,000 - $131
Contribution Limits. If you are eligible for the foreign earned income exclusion and qualify to open a Roth IRA, your ability to contribute to your Roth may be reduced or eliminated if your MAGI exceeds certain limits set by the IRS. As of 2013, the maximum yearly amount you can contribute to a Roth is $5,500. Even if you qualify to exclude your overseas income under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion Act, you may still be able to fund a Roth IRA.
There are income limits for Roth IRAs. As a single filer, you can make a full contribution to a Roth IRA if your income is less than $114,000 ($114,000 - $129,000 for a partial contribution) in 2014 and $116,000 ($116,000 - $131,000 for a partial contribution) in 2015.
Individual Retirement Accounts. Contributions to your individual retirement accounts (IRAs) that are Traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs are generally limited to a certain annual dollar amount ($5,000 in 2012, or $6,000 if 50 or older) or your compensation that is includible in your gross income for the tax year. Example. You report your income on a calendar-year basis and you qualified for the foreign earned income exclusion under the bona fide residence test for 75 days in 2012. In 2012, you excluded $19,488 of your $25,000 in foreign earned income (75/366 of the $95,100 maximum exclusion for 2012).
You can make annual contributions to a Roth IRA, or you can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA by paying tax on the converted funds. I'm not a proponent of paying tax now for a conversion and in hindsight, many people that did pay tax on conversions now find that their IRA has declined in value. You need to advise the IRA custodian of your problem and decide what is best as far as applying the contribution to the 2010 tax year or withdrawing the funds. Any earnings on the Roth should be included in your 2009 income tax return.
