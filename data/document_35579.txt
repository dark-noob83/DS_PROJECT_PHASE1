[edit] Climbing perch. Climbing perch (family Anabantidae) are a diverse group of East Asian and African fish that live in oxygen poor water and are adapted to air breathing, indeed the fish suffocate without access to air. A specialized organ for air exchange called the labyrinth organ has evolved out of modified gill tissue.
The name “gourami” is also used for fish of the families Helostomatidae and Anabantidae. Just for interest sake, the plural “Gouramis” so commonly used among aquarists, is an example of a redundant plural. In its original language, ‘Gourami’ is already plural.
Therefore it is likely any fish that could survive in brackish water, in shallow water or on land even for a short time could get plenty of food that was easy to take. This could apply to carnivores or herbivores and could have been a factor in fish evolving to live on land.
