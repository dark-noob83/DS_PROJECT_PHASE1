The tear drain consists of two small openings called the puncta, one in your upper and the other in your lower eyelid. Each of these openings lead into a small tube called a canaliculus which, in turn, empties into the tear sac at the inside corner of your eye along your nose.
The functional purpose of the lacrimal excretory system is to drain tears from the eye into the nasal cavity. Stagnation of tears in a pathologically closed lacrimal drainage system can result in dacryocystitis. Acquired dacryocystitis can be acute or chronic.
The nasolacrimal drainage system serves as a conduit for tear flow from the external eye to the nasal cavity. It consists of the puncta, canaliculi, lacrimal sac, and nasolacrimal duct (see the image below). Overview of the nasolacrimal apparatus.
Embryology. The nasolacrimal drainage system serves as a conduit for tear flow from the external eye to the nasal cavity. It consists of the puncta, canaliculi, lacrimal sac, and nasolacrimal duct (see the image below). Overview of the nasolacrimal apparatus.
1 The lacrimal gland produces tears which enter into the duct that drain the tears from the eye into the nose. 2  The most common symptoms are If one has a plugged up tear duct, not only will tears spill over the eyelids and ru n down the face, but the stagnant tears within the system can become infected.
Pathophysiology. Tears are produced in the lacrimal gland and drain through the upper and lower puncta into the canaliculi and then into the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct (see Figure: Anatomy of the lacrimal system. ). Obstruction of tear drainage can lead to stasis and infection.
Blinking also pumps tears into the puncta and by capillary action they are drawn into the lacrimal sac which travels through the tear duct and drains into your nose. If the tear duct is blocked or the capillary action of the tears is not working, your tears back up and spill over your eyelids as if you are crying.
