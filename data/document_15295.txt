Hybridization can be done or occur in both plants and animals. For example, mule is a very common example as a hybrid animal, which is produced through the breeding of a male donkey and a female horse. In this example, horse and donkey have 64 and 62 chromosome pairs respectively, but mule has only 63.
Hybridization is widely used in breeding. Depending on the purpose of hybridization, there may be “combination” breeding to combine the desirable traits of the parental forms and “transgressive” breeding to obtain and select genotypes that are superior to parents in the bred trait.
As breeding and hybridization are important aspects in protecting species, it is useful to know the difference between hybridization and inbreeding. Hybridization and inbreeding are two different types of selective breeding processes. Both processes involve plants and animals with different genetic qualities.

Hybridization is the process of interbreeding between individuals of different species (interspecific hybridization) or genetically divergent individuals from the same species (intraspecific hybridization). Offspring produced by hybridization may be fertile, partially fertile, or sterile.
In genetics, the process of crossing genetically different individual parents from two species to produce a fertile offspring is referred to as hybridization. The new fertile offspring is known as a hybrid. The hybrids are very important in the process of geographical isolation and speciation.
Hybridization. the crossing of organisms differing in heredity—that is, in one or more pairs of alleles (conditions of genes) and consequently in one or more pairs of traits and properties. The crossing of individuals belonging to different species or even to less closely related taxonomic categories is called distant h
Hybridization and Artificial Selection. Breeders commonly use artificial selection to produce new breeds from the variable offspring of hybrid crosses.
