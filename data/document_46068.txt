In calculating net present values that were used in our cost-per-ton estimates, we used adiscount rate of 7 percent, consistent with the 7 percent rate reflected in the cost-per-ton analysesfor other recent mobile source programs. 
Escalation RatesDiscussion and Sample Costs. Based on installed capacity of the plant. Larger plants benefit from economies of scale with reduced unit prices.â€¢ypically $2,300 - $2,900 per ton for plants over 4,000 tons and $3,000 - $3,500 per ton for plants below 4,000 tons. 
It is equivalent to the consumption of one ton of ice per day and originated during the transition from stored natural ice to mechanical refrigeration. A refrigeration ton is approximately equivalent to 12,000 BTU / h or 3.517 kW. Air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment capacity in the U.S. is often specified in tons (of refrigeration). Many manufacturers also specify capacity in BTU / h, especially when specifying the performance of smaller equipment. (Redirected from Refrigeration ton). A ton of refrigeration (commonly abbreviated as TR) is a unit of power used in some countries (especially in North America) to describe the heat-extraction capacity of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.
A 50 HP compressor with R-22 refrigerant may have a 50-ton capacity rating at warm RSWtemperatures; however, this decreases very rapidly as operating temperature drops. When used forfreezing this same compressor may only provide 7 1 / 2 -tons refrigeration capacity. 
All costs and emissionreductions are discounted to the year of sale of the boats at a rate of 7 percent. Table 7.1-16presents the cost per ton with and without consideration of the significant fuel savings that willresult from evaporative emission control assuming a 7 percent discount rate. The cost per tonresults assuming a 3 percent discount rate are presented in Table 7.1-17. Therefore, we have alsocalculated the overall cost-effectiveness of today's rule based on a 3 percent rate to facilitatecomparison of the cost-per-ton of this rule with future proposed rules which might use the 3percent rate.
A water-chiller refrigeration ton is defined as: 1 ton of refrigeration = 1 TONScond = 12000 Btu/h = 200 Btu/min = 3025.9 k Calories/h = 12661 kJ/h = 3.517 kW. A ton is the amount of heat removed by an air conditioning system that would melt 1 ton (2000 lbs.) of ice in 24 hours: 288000 BTU/24 hr = 12000 BTU/hr. A cooling tower ton is defined as: 1 cooling tower ton = 1 TONSevap = 1 TONScond x 1.25 = 15000 Btu/h = 3782 k Calories/h = 15826 kJ/h. The equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 Btu/h due to the heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor.
At $100 per ton the costdifference is lowered to $664 per trailer. At$80 per ton, the liquid carbon dioxide unit totaloperating cost is $350 lower than the cost ofowning and operating a mechanical transportrefrigeration unit. At S60 per ton the total costfor operating the carbon dioxide unit isestimated at $1,363 lower than a comparablemechanical refrigeration unit. Had the carbon dioxide price been $80 per ton for the entire year, total cost wouldhave been $358 less per trailer than for themechanical unit.
Therefore: 1 Refrigeration Ton = 2000 Pounds x 144 BTU per Pound / 24 hours = 12,000 BTU's per Hour The idea of Refrigeration Ton made it easier to sell equipment. The machine's capability could be compared to a quantity of ice. Melting ice at 32 degrees Fahrenheit requires 144 BTU's per pound to become liquid at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The Refrigeration Ton was defined as the heat absorbed by one ton of ice (2000 pounds) causing it to melt completely by the end of one day (24 hours).
One ton of refrigeration is equal to heat extraction @ of 200 BTUs per minute, 12,000 Btu per hour or 3025.9 Kcal/hr. This is based on the latent heat of fusion for ice which is 144 Btu per pound. The temperature difference between inlet and outlet water (EWT-LWT) is normally in the range 10 - 15 C. The water consumption-the make up water-of a cooling tower is about 0.2-0.3 liter per minute per ton of refrigeration. Cooling towers use the principle of evaporative cooling in order to cool water.
