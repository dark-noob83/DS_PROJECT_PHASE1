Diatoms may occur in such large numbers and be well preserved enough to form sediments composed almost entirely of diatom frustules (diatomites), these deposits are of economic benefit being used in filters, paints, toothpaste, and many other applications.
Pete Sweigard 0 Comment. This false-coloured scanning electron micrograph (SEM) shows a diatom frustule. Diatoms are unicellular organisms and a major group of algae. Diatoms are encased within a hard cell wall made from silica, which is known as a frustule and is composed of two halves. Frustules have a variety of patterns, pores, spines and ridges, which are used to determine genera and species.
The diatoms live in glass houses (frustules), and are often dominant both in the oceans and estuaries (along with dinoflagellates) and in freshwater lakes and streams. On a global scale they have been estimated to produce ~ 50% of all photosynthesis.
Diatoms. The cell walls of diatoms are made of silica formed into their characteristic pillbox shape. Diatoms are composed of two valves or frustules, one on top of the other, within which the living matter of the diatom is found. Diatoms are either found singly where each individual lives in a single box, or found in chains.
