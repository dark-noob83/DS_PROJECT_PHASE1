Because nickel does not easily oxidize, or rust, the metal was adapted as an electroplating material in the 1850s. Electroplating is a process in which metal ions in a chemical solution are attracted to a solid metal electrode. As the ions bind to the surface of the metal they form a uniform, thin coating. The world's 24th most abundant element, nickel is a transition metal, meaning it occupies the middle of the periodic table of elements. This indicates it has chemical properties that enable it to form multiple chemical compounds, some of which are toxic.
Vegetables usually contain more nickel than do other food items; high levels have been found in legumes, spinach, lettuce and nuts. Certain products, such as baking powder and cocoa powder, have been found to contain excessive amounts of nickel, perhaps related to nickel leaching during the manufacturing process. 
If intra-oral signs and symptoms are present and a diagnosis of nickel hypersensitivity is established, the nickel titanium archwire should be removed and replaced with a stainless steel archwire which is low in nickel content or preferably a titanium molybdenum alloy (TMA), which does not contain nickel. Extraoral orthodontic appliances such as the outer bows of headgears contain nickel and may also elicit a response on the skin. The sensitisation and allergy to nickel is an increasing concern in orthodontics, especially with the increased prevalence of nickel containing jewellery and oral piercings.
If it is guaranteed by the supplier to be free of nickel, you can enjoy it for years to come. Surgical Stainless Steel. Although Surgical Stainless Steel does not cause a reaction in many people, it does in fact contain 8% to 12% nickel. This nickel is chemically bound to the other metal that is there, so that, in theory, it does not leech out into the skin. You may or may not have any problems with wearing Surgical Stainless Steel.
