So, for the purpose of this discussion we will consider the needs and costs of installing a 15 square foot hydraulic elevator of average design, in a pre-existing home, which would adhere to the average pricing of $15,000 to $16,000 for the project.
The costs associated with selling an existing home and relocating to a new home can be quite exorbitant, but this is a common solution for millions of people with mobility issues who can no longer manage the stairs in their home. Instead of leaving their home, however, they could opt for the installation of an elevator. According to Jay Romano, in the New York Times, the average cost of a residential elevator installation is $15,000. This sort of elevator would be able to manage weights of 500 to 1,000 pounds and rise around 50 feet in total distance.
The average cost for a basic two-stop home elevator in a new home is $21,000 to $25,000, experts say. Three stops run from $28,000 to $30,000 and costs increase for customized cabs, as the residential cars are called. Adding an elevator within an existing home can easily double the expense.
On average, a two-stop elevator in an existing home should cost between $42,000 and $50,000, while a three-stop unit costs $56,000 to $60,000.
A basic three-stop elevator costs slightly more, with an average price between $28,000 and $30,000. A 2014 article in San Antonio Express-News estimates the cost of a simple two-story elevator in new construction starting at $20,000, with each additional stop or floor adding $1,500 to $2,000 to the base price.
On average, it will cost $20,000 to add an elevator into the home. This may seem like a substantial amount of money, but it covers a range of different steps from the purchase of the elevator to the extensive amount of installation required as well as the necessary steps to ensure that the elevator is secure.
Designing in an elevator to new home or a renovation is worth the trouble, whether you install an elevator at the onset, or wait until your own need arises. We have had an elevator for 15 years allowing wheelchair access to 2/3 of our floors.
