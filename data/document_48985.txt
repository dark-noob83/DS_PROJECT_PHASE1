Special Pay Overview. In addition to military basic pay, benefits, and allowances, members of the armed forces may also receive special pays and incentive pays depending on their career field or location. Special pays include hardship duty pay, foreign language pay, sea pay, special assignment pay, and flight pay. Unlike military allowances, special pay is taxable unless the member is earning the pay while in a designated combat zone.

Many military members qualify for special pays and incentives that are part of the service's recruitment and retention efforts.
