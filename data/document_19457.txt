Canada Geese usually migrate between the U.S and Canada. Their migratory season varies depending on the subspecies and the circumstances happening in their respective environment.
In fact a lot of Canada geese in Toronto do not migrate as they subsist quite largely on the garbage people throw throughout the four winter months and return to their standard diet on grasses during the early spring.
Geese migrate first and foremost as a matter of survival for their species and also as a way to cope for living on environments that are unfit for them to live in the whole year round. The survival of these animals will highly depend on moving to living conditions that are more hospitable.
Canada geese migrate to find food. In Canada, when the grass is frozen over, the geese fly elsewhere. They fly in a V shape so every geese can get to their destination safely. … They don't use magnetism or the sun to get to the destination, they use landmarks learnt by their parents or flock. Hope this helps :).
