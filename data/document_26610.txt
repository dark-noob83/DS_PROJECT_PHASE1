Late payments are black marks that normally stay on a credit report for 7 years. That's true of most negative information like foreclosures, Chapter 13 bankruptcies, charge-offs and paid tax liens; a Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays around for 10 years and unpaid tax liens can linger indefinitely.
It does depend on the type of negative information but here is a breakdown of how long different types of negative information will remain on your credit report: 1  Late Payments: 7 years. 2  Bankruptcy: 7 years for completed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and 10 years for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

Time Frame. A 30-day late payment notation is a negative item for your credit. Like most negative items, the 30-day late payment will only remain on your credit report for seven years. After seven years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act dictates that the credit bureaus must delete it from your record.

A late payment can stay on your credit report for up to seven years. This is the standard time limit for most items. Only a bankruptcy can stay longer -- up to 10 years in some cases. But for late payments, seven is the magic number. You can think of your credit reports as a record of your previous debt payments.
