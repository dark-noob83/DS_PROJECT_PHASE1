TEXOMA -- As college costs approach the $40,000 a year mark and total student debt reach the one-trillion dollar mark, parents may have to work with their college students to help pay tuition.
College prices in the U.S. have again increased faster than the rate of inflation, extending a decades-long pattern of higher-education costs. Tuition and fees at private nonprofit colleges climbed 3.7 percent on average to $31,231 this academic year, according to a report today by the College Board.
Finding a Solution to the Rising Cost of Education. On average, the annual cost of tuition, room, and board at a public university in the United States is $13,000; private colleges’ annual costs average $32,000. A 2012 Pew Research Center Survey said Americans don't think students get enough value for the money they pay for college.
For the current academic year, the average published in-state tuition at public, four-year colleges and universities is $8,893, and the average net price is about $3,120, according to three College Board reports on trends in higher education.
The tuition and fees results are based on data from 3,105 institutions that responded to a survey, the College Board said. Costs didn’t rise for about 12 percent of full-time students at four-year public colleges, up from 4 percent a decade ago, according to the College Board.
Tuition at the average public university increased eight percent in the last year and is expected to grow. While the national average of yearly tuition for a private colleges is about $30,000 to $40,000 a year, there's still some private college student with the financial support of parents.
Question: What are the trends in the cost of college education? Response: For the 2012–13 academic year, annual current dollar prices for undergraduate tuition, room, and board were estimated to be $15,022 at public institutions, $39,173 at private nonprofit institutions, and $23,158 at private for-profit institutions.
