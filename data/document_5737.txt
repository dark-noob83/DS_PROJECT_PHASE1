I'm looking for a part time job, I'm 15 and was wondering how much per hour I would get in Melbourne Australia. In Victoria the minimum wage is $15 an hour, so that's what you'll be paid. Since you're only 15 I would expect you to only be allowed to work four hours a day.

My boyfriend is a team member at KFC 21 and he only gets £4.60 an hour the pay is absolutely crap. Compared to mine at asda is 6.02 so you can see how low paid KFC is. This sounds ridiculous but i workl at KFC and don't actually know my rate of pay. I'm a part timer, nothing special not a team leader or anything just a regular employee at KFC.
