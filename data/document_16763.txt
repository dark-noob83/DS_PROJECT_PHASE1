1 Polyunsaturated fat. 2  This is a type of fat found mostly in plant-based foods and oils. 3  Evidence shows that eating foods rich in polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease. 4  PUFAs may also help decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes. 5  Omega-3 fatty acids. 1 Monounsaturated fat. 2  This is a type of fat found in a variety of foods and oils. 3  Studies show that eating foods rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease.

over 55 years. Building Blocks of Nutrition: Fats, Lipids and Oils Share Elson Haas M. MD © Classification and Biochemistry Digestion and Metabolism Functions Requirements, Deficiency, and Excess Dietary Fat and Disease Fats, or lipids, are the third main class of the macronutrients needed in human nutrition. The lipids are found primarily in meats and dairy foods, at least, these are the most visible sources, but most foods contain some fat. Some of the richer vegetable sources of dietary fat are nuts and seeds, soybeans, olives, peanuts, and avocados, and these contain the needed or essential fatty acids (EFAs). Fats are an important component of our diet, and at least a minimum intake is essential. Fats are important in transporting other nutrients, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K—the “fat-soluble vitamins.” Fats are also an essential component of the cell membrane, and internal fatty tissues protect the vital organs from trauma and temperature change by providing padding and insulation.
Lipids are a group of naturally occurring molecules that include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, phospholipids, and others. Sterol lipids, such as cholesterol and its derivatives, are an important component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules.
Some fats are found in foods from plants and animals and are known as dietary fat. Dietary fat is a macronutrient that provides energy for your body. Fat is essential to your health because it supports a number of your body's functions. Some vitamins, for instance, must have fat to dissolve and nourish your body. 1 Monounsaturated fat. 2  This is a type of fat found in a variety of foods and oils. 3  Studies show that eating foods rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease.
Lipids: Fatty Acids, Sterols, and Triglycerides Explained. Call it fat or lipids, these terms can get confusing. But it is important to be able to differentiate them when talking about this category of nutrition. Dietary fat is a critical macronutrient, in addition to carbohydrates and protein, and there are many varieties that interact differently in the body. Fatty acids are the small pieces or molecules that make up the fat in our bodies and the fat we eat in our diet. Fatty acids are simply chains of carbon and hydrogen that can join together to form larger molecules such as triglycerides, sterols, saturated and unsaturated fats which will interact in our bodies.
