Chromosomes and Evolution Evidence. Chromosomes, or the higher order structures that contain genes, are also analyzed to support the theory of evolution. Scientists compare chromosomes among species or other large groups of living organisms and “tally up” the differences.
DNA is thus especially important in the study of evolution. The amount of difference in DNA is a test of the difference between one species and another – and thus how closely or distantly related they are.
DNA molecules are complex molecules which contain the assembly instructions for every living creature. Certain aspects of DNA have been interpreted as evidence for Darwinian evolution. DNA evidence for evolution includes mutations, genetic similarities among species, so-called Junk DNA and Pseudogenes. Here we will look at these evidences and briefly make note of some of the criticism levied against them by opponents of Darwin s theory.
Evolution home. Similarities Among Living Organisms. One type of evidence for evolution (evidence that organisms are related, descended from a few common ancestors, and change to adapt to their environments) is that organisms are similar to each other, but not exactly the same. Similar organisms have differences that help them adapt to their environments.
The debate over DNA evidence for evolution rages on. Too much remains unknown at this current stage. Hopefully, as time goes on and we learn more about DNA we will be in a better position to know whether or not DNA truly supports Darwin s theory of evolution.
