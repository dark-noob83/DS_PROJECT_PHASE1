A kilogram-force (kgf) , also called kilopond (kp), is a gravitational metric unit of force. It is equal to the force exerted by one kilogram of mass in a standard gravitational field.
The unit is exactly equal to kilogram force per square centimetre (kgf/cm² or kg/cm²). A kilopond is a force equal to the weight of 1 kg being pulled by an acceleration of 9.80665 m/s² (standard gravity). A square centimetre represents the area over which the force is distributed.
Kilogram-force is a force measurement unit. The kilogram-force is a metric unit of force (kgf). The kilogram-force is equal to a mass of one kilogram multiplied by the standard acceleration due to gravity on Earth, which is defined as exactly 9.80665 meter per second². Then one (1) kilogram-force is equal to 1 kg × 9.80665 meter per second² = 9.80665 kilogram × meter per second² = 9.80665 newton (1N).
KGF is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family and has been found to stimulate hair growth. Cells that respond to KGF do so because they have receptors on the cell membrane that recognize the growth factor, normally produced by cells near or far from the target cell.
Therefore, one kilogram-force is by definition equal to 9.80665 N. A kilogram-force is a convenient unit because its value is equal to the weight of an object with a mass of 1 kg and it is easy to imagine what is, e.g., a 10 kgf force. A newton (N) is the SI derived unit of force.
The SI unit of force is the newton (N), which is the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared, or kg·m·s⁻². The corresponding CGS unit is the dyne, the force required to accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared, or g·cm·s⁻².
