1 Generally an individual, or a business owned by an individual (like a sole proprietorship), can sue for up to $10,000. 2  Generally, a corporation, LLC or other business can use small claims court for disputes up to $5,000. 3  Certain kinds of actions have different limitations on the amount of the claim.
Can you get what you want? The small claims court is a “court of limited jurisdiction.” This means that the court cannot award more than $7,500,even if your claim is worth more.
