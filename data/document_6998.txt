Radon is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is formed as natural deposits of uranium throughout the earth's crust decay. As radon decay products are inh … aled, they can alter the cells in the lungs. These alterations can increase the potential for getting lung cancer. Radon is a naturally occurring element. It is a noble gas, and is highly unreactive. Radon is a poisonous gas and is the second most common reason people have lung cancer (beh … ind smoking). Most radon comes from beneath the ground and as it rises up it can permeate through someone's home.
They are present in any environment where radon is found and, like radon, cannot be detected by human senses. The earth is the source of all radon gas in our atmosphere. Uranium is a natural part of the earth's crust. Therefore, radium and radon are also naturally present (as noted above). Since uranium and radium concentrations vary throughout the earth's crust, radon concentrations will also vary. As a noble gas, radon is colorless, odorless and chemically inert and cannot be detected by human senses. Also, since radon is not chemically reactive with most materials, it will move freely as a gas.
No. Radon is a colorless, radioactive, inert gaseous element formed by the radioactive decay of radium. It is used as a radiation source in radiotherapy and to produce … neutrons for research. Its most stable isotope is Rn 222 with a half-life of 3.82 days. Radon is a naturally occurring element. It is a noble gas, and is highly unreactive.

Radon is a chemical element with symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, occurring naturally as a decay product of radium. Its most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Radon is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions. Three other radon isotopes have a half-life of over an hour: 211 Rn, 210 Rn and 224 Rn. The 220 Rn isotope is a natural decay product of the most stable thorium isotope (232 Th), and is commonly referred to as thoron. It has a half-life of 55.6 seconds and also emits alpha radiation.

It doesn't want to hook up with other atoms and loan or borrow electrons. It just doesn't want to burn, and combustion is a chemical reaction.

1-800-220-3675. Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the natural radioactive decay of radium, which is a natural decay product of uranium. Scientifically, “radon” is known to be radon-222, the most abundant isotope of the element radon. As a noble gas, radon is colorless, odorless and chemically inert and cannot be detected by human senses. Also, since radon is not chemically reactive with most materials, it will move freely as a gas. Radon has a radiological half-life of 3.8 days, and can move substantial distances from its point of origin.
