Taking a vitamin D-3 supplement has the potential to trigger an allergic reaction in some people. This occurs when your body mistakenly recognizes the vitamin D-3 as a potentially harmful chemical and mounts an immune response against it.

The most common skin disorders that a vitamin D allergy can cause include hives and eczema, according to Drugs.com. Both allergic skin conditions are extremely itchy and cause inflammation and irritation in the skin. Hives may indicate a severe allergic reaction and needs to be evaluated by a physician.
Allergic Reaction Symptoms. Allergic reaction symptoms that can develop from a vitamin allergy include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, chest congestion, asthma, fatigue, headaches, itchiness, runny nose, nasal congestion, skin rashes, sneezing, sniffling, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
If you are allergic to vitamin D, symptoms will develop no matter how much or how little of the supplement you take. Allergic reaction symptoms can cause a severe allergic reaction, causing dizziness, lightheadedness, facial swelling and hives.
Warning. A severe allergic reaction to vitamin D supplements can lead to anaphylaxis, according to Drugs.com. If you develop common anaphylactic shock symptoms, call 911. These symptoms may include chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, facial swelling, hives and dizziness.
