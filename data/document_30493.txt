An example of an  autotroph is algae. A heterotroph is an organism that receives its  food from other sources. It is a multicellular or unicellular  organism. Organisms that are consumers or decomposers are  heterotrophs. A parasite is also a heterotroph. A parasite feeds  off other organisms for its food. An example of a parasite is a  deet tick. An example of a decomposing heterotroph is an earthworm.
Amoeba is a heterotroph i.e they absorb their food directly from the external environment. Some are parasites. Amoeba eat algae, bacteria, plant cells and also protozoans. Amoebas engulf their food.
Plants are autotrophs.   Amoeba proteus is a free-living heterotroph, which feeds on other microscopic organisms such as ciliates and algae. These are ingested (taken into the cell) by pseudopodia, or false feet.
This is characteristic of all animals and fungi, some protists (for example Trypanosona, Paramecium, Amoeba), many bacteria, (for example pseudomonas) and some non green plants (for example Parasitic plants like cuscuta) they take readymade organic food from other dead or living plants and animals.
Best Answer: Euglena are the unicellular organism. All euglena have chloroplasts and can make their own food by photosynthesis. They are not completely autotrophic though, euglena can also absorb food from their environment. Paramecium are unicellular organism. Paramecium are heterotrophic and feed on bacteria. Amoeba
