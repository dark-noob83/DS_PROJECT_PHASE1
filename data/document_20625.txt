Many people don't like to waste food, but there is only so much you can do with large amounts of nacho cheese sauce. Thankfully, you can freeze this sauce for later use and thaw it again later when needed.
Freezing cheese is possible for many cheese varieties. Freezing cheese can help prevent a large block of cheese from going moldy before its finished and is a good way to store all those cheeses you snapped up in a sale.
Teese Vegan Nacho Sauce is a mildly spiced heat and serve creamy sauce, perfect for nachos, enchiladas, or any south-of-the-border-inspired dish. Our nacho sauce has a taste and texture thatâ€™s incredibly similar to a dairy based nacho cheese sauce.
Best Answer: Cheese does freeze well, HOWEVER typical nacho cheese is not exactly cheese. It is mostly other products. I am not knocking it! It is delicious, but you will have separation issues among the content between the oils and other ingredients. All is not lost though.
A better idea is to find a friend to share it with. Or if you know someone with children ask them if they would want the rest for a movie night with their children and a nachos and cheese sauce snack-this way none is wasted and you have done a good deed.
If not closed correctly, air can come in contact with the cheese and cause freezer burn. Place the cheese sauce in your freezer. If your freezer has a quick-freeze shelf, this can use to help speed up the process, though it isn't necessary. Thaw your nacho cheese sauce by taking it out of the freezer the day before you plan to use it. Place the sauce in your fridge and wait until it thaws. This can take several hours to a day depending on the amount of cheese. The sauce may appear oddly colored, but this is normal.
