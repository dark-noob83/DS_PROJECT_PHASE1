Average costing method in periodic inventory system: When average costing method is used in a periodic inventory system, the cost of goods sold and the cost of ending inventory is computed using weighted average unit cost. Weighted average unit cost is computed using the following formula : Cost of goods sold: 2,500 units × $10.5118 = $26,280 Cost of ending inventory: 900 units × $10.5118 = $9,460. When average costing method is used in a perpetual inventory system, an average unit cost figure is computed each time a purchase is made.
To continue the example above under the average cost method, a company would assign an average cost of $19.50 -- the sum of 20 and 19 divided by 2 -- to all 20 widgets sold. When the number of inventory items purchased at the oldest cost is sold, the next oldest cost is assigned to sales. For example, if a company buys 10 widgets at $20 each, then buys 10 more at $19 each, the company would assign the $20 cost to the first 10 widgets it sells, then begin to assign the $19 cost.
Weighted Average Cost is a method of calculating Ending Inventory cost. It is also known as WAVCOs. It takes Cost of Goods Available for Sale and divides it by the number of units available for sale (number of goods from Beginning Inventory + Purchases /production). This gives a Weighted Average Cost per Unit. A physical count is then performed on the ending inventory to determine the number of goods left
By Chizoba Morah AAA |. A: The main difference between weighted average cost accounting, LIFO, and FIFO methods of accounting is the difference in which each method calculates inventory and cost of goods sold. The weighted average cost method uses the average of the costs of the goods to assign costs. In other words, weighted average uses the formula: Total cost of items in inventory available for sale divided by total number of units available for sale. In contrast, FIFO (first in, first out) accounting means that the costs assigned to goods are the costs for the first goods bought. 
If the company uses weighted average method for inventory valuation, the value of inventory as on March 31, 2005 is: a. $11967 b. $12000 c. $12500 …. Inventory Ledger Account Exercise. Below is the records of receipts and issues of a certain material in a factory for the month ending 30th September, 2008. The value of our closing inventories in this example would be calculated as follows: Using the First-In-First-Out method, our closing inventory comes to $1,100. This equates to a cost of $1.10 per lollypop ($1,100/1,000 lollypops).
When using the weighted average method, divide the cost of goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale, which yields the weighted-average cost per unit. In this calculation, the cost of goods available for sale is the sum of beginning inventory and net purchases. The total of all purchased or beginning inventory units is 450 (150 beginning inventory + 300 purchased). The weighted average cost per unit is therefore $257.78 ($116,000 ÷ 450 units.). The ending inventory valuation is $45,112 (175 units × $257.78 weighted average cost), while the cost of goods sold valuation is $70,890 (275 units × $257.78 weighted average cost). The sum of these two amounts (less a rounding error) equals the $116,000 total actual cost of all purchases and beginning inventory
Average Cost (AVCO) Method. Average cost method (AVCO) calculates the cost of ending inventory and cost of goods sold for a period on the basis of weighted average cost per unit of inventory. Weighted average cost per unit is calculated using the following formula: It is then multiplied with number of units sold and number of units in ending inventory to arrive at cost of goods sold and value of ending inventory respectively. In perpetual inventory system, we have to calculate the weighted average cost per unit before each sale transaction.
Like FIFO and LIFO methods, AVCO is also applied differently in periodic inventory system and perpetual inventory system. In periodic inventory system, weighted average cost per unit is calculated for the entire class of inventory. It is then multiplied with number of units sold and number of units in ending inventory to arrive at cost of goods sold and value of ending inventory respectively. In perpetual inventory system, we have to calculate the weighted average cost per unit before each sale transaction.
Using the weighted average cost method, our closing inventory amounts to $1,059. This equates to a cost of $1.06 per lollypop ($1,059/1,000 lollypops). Oddly enough, the LIFO method is the preferred inventory valuation method in the United States but is disallowed in non-US countries. The value of our closing inventories in this example would be calculated as follows: Using the First-In-First-Out method, our closing inventory comes to $1,100. This equates to a cost of $1.10 per lollypop ($1,100
