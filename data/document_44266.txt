I have spent many years in the car business working in many different car sales capacities and in my travels I have visited with numerous professional car salesmen and women. I have discovered that there is no such thing as average when it comes to a car salesman salary or how much do car salesmen make. . If we break this down a little further the bottom 10% of car salesmen (car saleswomen included) are earning about $18,000 a year and the top 10% are earning about $75,000 a year or more.
An example of a sliding scale percentage pay plan is as follows. Sell 6 cars get 20% commission, sell 9 cars get 25%, sell 12 car get 30%, sell 15 cars get 35% and sell 18 or more and get 40%. You can clearly see how this sliding scale auto sales commission pay plan rewards the top sellers in a dealership.
Some dealerships will offer a guaranteed car salesman salary to new car salesmen as an incentive to come on board.. This is becoming quite a bit more common. This guarantee is usually between $2,000 and $2,500 a month and is typically for the first 90 days. Minis. With new cars for instance, more often than not a car salesman will be paid a mini. A mini is a flat amount paid to salesmen when the commission amount is below the set mini.. Most dealers will have a mini of $100.
According to a recent national survey, the average commission for car salesmen is $250 per vehicle sold. The average selling price per vehicle is about $1,000 over the invoice cost. And the average number of cars sold is 8 to 10 vehicles per salesman per month. 
Most dealers will have a pack on top of that (a non-commission profit paid directly to the dealer) which varies, but usually falls in the $500 range. In this scenario the car salesman is starting with a base cost of $10,500. Minis. With new cars for instance, more often than not a car salesman will be paid a mini. A mini is a flat amount paid to salesmen when the commission amount is below the set mini.. Most dealers will have a mini of $100.
Profits Vary Significantly. Determining an average commission on a per car basis does not take into account the wide range of profits a dealer can earn on a car sale. Small, inexpensive cars may have a profit of $500 or $600 if sold at the full sticker price, guaranteeing a mini commission to the salesman. Since the price a dealer actually pays for a car is a little less than the invoice price, the profit was probably $1,600 to $1,800 per car. This means that, using the AutoNation numbers, the average new car commission was $400 to $500.
Car salesmen must have good communication skills and knowledge of car models to match the best vehicle with a potential buyer.

For example, car salesmen in California earn an average salary of $67,000, while those working in Florida earn an average salary of $62,000. The cost of living is 39 percent higher in Los Angeles than it is in Tampa, according to Sperling's. Advancement. Car salesmen may advance to the position of an automobile dealership manager.

Salesman are paid a commission based on the dealer's sales profit. The profit is typically defined as the difference between the selling price and the invoice price of the car. The most common car sales commission rates are 25 or 30 percent of the profit. So using a 25 percent commission plan, if a car sells for $1,000 over invoice, the salesman makes $250. Since the price a dealer actually pays for a car is a little less than the invoice price, the profit was probably $1,600 to $1,800 per car.
