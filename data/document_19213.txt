After the first trimester, my OB increased my metformin dose (due to a family history of diabetes) and I have been told to continue on with it for the duration of my pregnancy (I'm 34 weeks now).
The recommended starting dose of metformin is 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once a day (in people 17 and older), given with meals. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2000 mg in children (10 to 16 years of age) and 2550 mg in adults.

Metformin Dosing and Protocol. Metformin is taken in a dose that the woman can tolerate. Most people can tolerate 500 mg three times daily, if they build up to that dose gradually. 1  We start metformin at 500 mg once daily, increase to 500 mg twice a day after one week, then to 500 mg 3 times daily after another week.
