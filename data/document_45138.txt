Triassic Period Facts. The Triassic Period was the first period of the Mesozoic Era. A lot happened to Earth and its life-forms during the Triassic but the most celebrated event was the evolution of dinosaurs. The Triassic Period was the first period of the Mesozoic Era, and ran from 248 to 200 million years ago. A lot happened to Earth and its life-forms during the Triassic but the most celebrated event was the evolution of dinosaurs. These remarkable creatures emerged around 230 MYA and dominated the planet throughout the Mesozoic Era.
The Mesozoic Era is divided into three periods: the Triassic Period, the Jurassic Period, , and the Cretaceous Period. The Triassic began around 248 million years ago, after the mass extinction that brought an end to the Permian Period. It lasted about 42 million years. Reptiles Inherit The Earth. The Triassic Period is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. The great extinction at the end of the Permian period had brought the end to 90% of the living species on Earth. The Triassic was a time of growing new species to repopulate the planet.
The Triassic Period was the first period of the Mesozoic Era and occurred between 251 million and 199 million years ago. It followed the great mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period and was a time when life outside of the oceans began to diversify. By the mid-Triassic, the ichthyosaurs were dominant in the oceans. One genus, Shonisaurus, measured more than 50 feet long (15 meters) and probably weighed close to 30 tons (27 metric tons). Plesiosaurs were also present but not as large as those of the Jurassic Period.
Introduction. The Triassic Period is the first phase of the Mesozoic era and spanned for an interval of 35 million years from 250-205 million years ago.
