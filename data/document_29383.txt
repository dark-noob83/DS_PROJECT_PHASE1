Most registered nurses hold a diplomoa from a hospital nursing school, a two-year associate's degree or a bachelor's of science in nursing.

RNs working in specialty hospitals also reported higher than average earnings, about $74,310 per year. Those employed at physician's offices and outpatient clinics averaged between $72,000 and $73,000 per year, while general hospitals -- the largest employer of registered nurses -- paid an average of $69,810 a year.
