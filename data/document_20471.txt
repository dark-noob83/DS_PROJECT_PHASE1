A good score for the PSAT Exam is one that enables you to become a National Merit Scholar. The cutoff score varies from year to year and from state to state. To become a National Merit Semifinalist (NMSF), you must score in the top 0.5% in your state on the PSAT. As a general rule, if you score a 217 or better on the PSAT, you should be a strong contender for becoming a National Merit Semifinalist.
Approximately 1.5 million high school students take the PSAT each year. Of those, 50,000 (3.3%) are Commended Scholars, and 16,000 (1.1%) are chosen as National Merit Scholar Semifinalists. There is a nationwide cutoff for Commended Scholars, but Semifinalists are chosen according to state-by-state cutoffs.
The mean of state minimum semifinalist PSAT 2016 scores is 212.67, up slightly from 2015 but down from the 2014 average of 214.1. The 2016 average score converts to an SAT score of ~1425, up from ~1422 in 2015.
