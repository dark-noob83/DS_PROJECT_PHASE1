This mixture is just like any other wax available in the market. But it has an added advantage; it is totally natural with no chemicals like paraffin wax. Thus it does not damage the skin at all during body hair removal. Apply it on your body in a thick layer and pull out hair with waxing strips. 2. Sugaring With Cane Juice: Another recipe for 'sugaring' for hair removal is to boil 4 portion sugarcane juice with 2 portions of lemon juice in it.
Paraffin wax used in therapy has a melt point of approximately 119-121 degrees F. Candle waxes can vary from soy wax and soy wax blends at 100 degrees, which allow for the oils to be used in massage, to higher melt paraffin waxes at 150-170 degrees. Canning wax used for preserving preserves or food is also 150-170 degrees. At approximately 140 degrees a person will be scorched when immersing in water; this temperature rises to 150 degrees when immersing in wax (because of the “glove” barrier).
By Treatment Area. Waxing for hair removal can be performed on most areas of the face and body. Treatment area options with hair removal waxing may be different for at-home kits than for professional wax jobs, simply for the difficulty that can come with waxing oneself.
The first step in making paraffin wax is to remove the oil (de-oiling or de-waxing) from the slack wax. The oil is separated through crystallization. Most commonly, the slack wax is heated, mixed with one or more solvents such as a ketone and then cooled. Paraffin wax is an excellent electrical insulator, with a resistivity of between 10 13 and 10 17 ohm metre. This is better than nearly all other materials except some plastics (notably Teflon). It is an effective neutron moderator and was used in James Chadwick 's 1932 experiments to identify the neutron
Many people favor professional salon waxing treatments when they are in need of hair removal in a hurry. Waxing hair removal, or hot wax hair removal, is a non-invasive, temporary solution to unwanted hair on the face and body. Hair removal wax is generally a combination of natural waxes, like beeswax or paraffin wax, and added resins and oils. The wax is applied directly to skin in a thin layer, and in the direction of natural hair growth. Waxing for hair removal can be performed on most areas of the face and body. Treatment area options with hair removal waxing may be different for at-home kits than for professional wax jobs, simply for the difficulty that can come with waxing oneself.
Properties [edit]. Paraffin wax is mostly found as a white, odorless, tasteless, waxy solid, with a typical melting point between about 46 and 68 °C (115 and 154 °F), and a density of around 900 kg/m 3. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in ether, benzene, and certain esters. Paraffin wax is an excellent electrical insulator, with a resistivity of between 10 13 and 10 17 ohm metre.

As a child, you probably even used it to decorate Easter eggs. It's wax. Wax plays a starring role in beauty treatments as well -- it's a popular way to remove unwanted body hair from legs, arms, chests, eyebrows and bikini lines. But you may not know that wax has another cosmetic use: the paraffin wax bath. Paraffin wax is a mineral wax derived from petroleum [source: Cosmetics Info ]. 
Read This Later. Paraffin wax is a petroleum-based wax that stores heat exceptionally well and has great hydrating effects on skin. The wax melts at a temperature of around 116°-147°F, and is applied to hands either by way of a dip in a paraffin bath or through individual bags with single-size doses of wax. Scrape and wipe out the remaining paraffin wax in the unit. A blow dryer can help soften stubborn pieces of hardened wax to make them easier to remove. 6. Clean the inside and outside of the unit with an all-purpose cleaner or sanitizer, and thoroughly dry the unit.
