Best Answer. Why that is an outrage! Only an idiot would write such a thing! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Ned Kelly may look like an idiot, Ned kelly may sound like and idiot, and Ned Kelly may acti like an idiot...but don't let that fool you...Ned Kelly really is an idiot.
Oh...I want to add that when he said LOL he meant laugh out loud. it means he's nervous and has never done it before, that's why he's writing a letter rather than saying it to your face. baby girl because he's trying to hide that fact!
Basically, in the case of the flirty “lol” it means she’s really glad you are talking to her, not that you’re the next Kathy Griffin. 2) When “lol” means “Please compliment me…now”. This “lol” is sneaky and you have about 30 seconds to react in the way She needs you to react before she totally freaks out.
What does it mean when a guy writes you a letter and says he wants to get to know you a little better but puts lol after it and also calls you baby girl in the letter?
Lol = lots of love... I use this when I write something which might offend the reader of the email... when I write the lol behind it, it means it´s not that bad as you might … think... but it hasn´t got anything to do with love :-)))   It can also mean laugh out loud... I say it after I say something mean, but it's really a joke. 2 people found this useful.
Split and merge into it. Answer by Randomdude01. Lol could mean lot of love, love or lust, leather or lace. You would have to ask him what he means by lol. As for the baby girl thing, who does he think he is your daddy. I think this boy wants to move a little fast then what he states in the letter.
