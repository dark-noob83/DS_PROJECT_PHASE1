CT scan for cervical cancer. A CT scan reveals a detailed, 3D image of the cervix and abdomen. After a physical exam has been performed, we use a CT scan to locate a tumor before surgery. We also use a CT scan to determine tumor size, what other organs might be affected and whether lymph nodes are enlarged. Understanding the extent of the disease helps us formulate the right treatment plan before moving forward with treatment. Contact Us.

Other tests. Your doctor might want you to have a scan to stage your cancer and check for cancer spread. An MRI scan uses magnetism to build up a picture of the body. A CT scan is a type of computerised X-ray. You may have a PET-CT scan, which combines a CT scan and a scan that uses a low dose of radioactive liquid to highlight areas of possible cancer. You may have blood tests to check your general health. You may also have a chest X-ray to check for signs of cancer in the lungs. They are usually done to check for cancer spread within the pelvis or to other parts of the body. A CT scan is a type of computerised X-ray. It can show the size of your primary cancer and enlarged lymph nodes that may contain cancer.
Computed tomography (CT) scan (also known as a computed axial tomography scan, or CAT scan) is one of the most commonly used tools for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. A CT scan is an X-ray procedure that uses a computer to produce three-dimensional, cross-sectional images of inside the body. We also use a CT scan to determine tumor size, what other organs might be affected and whether lymph nodes are enlarged.

CT scans can help tell if your cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the abdomen and pelvis. They can also be used to see if the cancer has spread to the liver, lungs, or elsewhere in the body. A CT scanner has been described as a large donut, with a narrow table in the middle opening. Several types of biopsies can be used to diagnose cervical pre-cancers and cancers. If the biopsy can completely remove all of the abnormal tissue, it might be the only treatment needed. Colposcopic biopsy. For this type of biopsy, first the cervix is examined with a colposcope to find the abnormal areas.
Report Abuse. Yes a CT does scan for abnormalties in the area the doctor has ordered it for. After the scan is complete a radiologist reads the CT and his/her findings are sent to your doctor. I have added a link below that explains more in detail what a pelvic ct can detect. Also, I included a link to see what kinds of tests may be ordered to help diagnose cervical cancer. Hope this helps. Best Answer: A CT doesnâ€™t find anything it takes a picture and a doctor reads it and reports their findings. Ideally cervical cancer would never be seen this way it should be found on pap smear when it is still too small to be seen on CT.
MRI or CT scan. Your doctor might want you to have a scan to stage your cancer and check for cancer spread. An MRI scan uses magnetism to build up a picture of the body. It can be better than X-ray at showing the soft tissues of the body. They are usually done to check for cancer spread within the pelvis or to other parts of the body. A CT scan is a type of computerised X-ray. It can show the size of your primary cancer and enlarged lymph nodes that may contain cancer.
If your doctor finds that you have cervical cancer, certain imaging studies may be done. These include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. These studies can show whether the cancer has spread beyond the cervix. Several types of biopsies can be used to diagnose cervical pre-cancers and cancers. If the biopsy can completely remove all of the abnormal tissue, it might be the only treatment needed. Colposcopic biopsy. For this type of biopsy, first the cervix is examined with a colposcope to find the abnormal areas.
Cervical cancer can arise from abnormal cells located in the cervix. Most cervical cancers are a result of a previous infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is spread through sexual intercourse. Your doctor may perform a pap smear or a colposcopy to help diagnose your condition. If cancer is detected, your doctor may use body CT, body MRI, chest x-ray or PET scan to help determine whether the cancer has spread. Depending on its extent, surgery, radiation therapy, cryotherapy or chemotherapy may be performed. 
PET/CT scan for cervical cancer. In addition to standard imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI, your doctor may order a PET/CT scan as part of the evaluation for cervical cancer. A PET/CT scan can detect the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes and to other organs, such as the lungs or liver. Contact Us.
