They do expire – here is an overview of when: For starters, the IRS has 10 years to pursue you for the unpaid taxes that caused the lien to be filed. The 10 years starts on the date you began owing the IRS money. After the 10 year collection timeframe expires, so does the IRS tax lien.

If the IRS timely refiles the tax lien, it is treated as continuation of the initial lien.
Natural Expiration. Under the statute of limitations, the IRS can only maintain the lien for 10 years from the date you began owing them money if returns are filed on time.

So I will spend the rest of this paper discussing the normal expiration of a standard NFTL-the basic 10-year period.
