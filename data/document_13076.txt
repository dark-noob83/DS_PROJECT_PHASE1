A cup of coffee tends to have much more caffeine than a cup of tea. Tea (including black tea, green tea, white tea, oolong tea, etc.) tends to have about 15-70mg of caffeine per 8 oz. cup, whereas the same size cup of coffee tends to have about 80-135mg of caffeine. You cannot generalize about one type of tea (black, green, etc.) containing more or less caffeine.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: There is actually more caffeine in the tea plant than in coffee beans. However by the time it is harvested, processed and made there is more caffeine in a prepared cup of coffee than in tea. Tea has 50mg per serving and coffee starts at 85mg. Some people don't respond to caffeine so you may not be getting a boost because of that.
Nick, London UK Tea leaves have more caffeine than coffee beans before they are brewed. Prepared, however, tea is diluted quite a bit more than most coffees. Each will vary depending on how strong you like it, though.

The brewing method for tea (and to some degree for coffee) can have a large effect on the caffeine content. For tea, using more leaf, and steeping for longer times, can result in a much higher caffeine content in the finished cup.
