Edmunds data tells the story: Since 2002, the average car loan term has slowly crept past five years, and is now inching past six-and-a-half years. In 2014, 62 percent of the auto loans were for terms over 60 months. And nearly 20 percent of the loans were for 73- to 84-month terms.
The term is generally 12 months. Short term loans are at a higher interest rate than a long term loan, capitalizing on the length of your loan. A lender will use the situation that you do not have credit in order to offer the higher interest rate.
A type of loan that has an extended time period for repayment usually lasting between three and 30 years. Car loans and home mortgages are examples of long-term loans. â€œ You should always shop around for the best rate any time you are going to take on a long-term loan.
Bank term loans usually carry fixed maturities and interest rates as well as a monthly or quarterly repayment schedule. The long-term loan usually has a maturity of 3-10 years although long-term bank loans can stretch out as far as 20 years depending on its purpose. Long-term bank loans are always supported by a company's collateral, usually in the form of the company's assets.
A loan term may be easy to identify. For example, a 30 year fixed rate mortgage has a term of 30 years. Auto loans often have 5 or 6 year terms. However, loans can last for any number of years -- as long or short as a lender and borrower are willing to agree on.
Intermediate term loans usually have a term to maturity of 1 - 3 years. They are used to fund assets that aren't long-term in nature such as computer systems that may have an economic life of only around 3 years.
The interest rates on a long-term loan are usually a few points lower than the interest rates on a short-term loan in a normal economy. If you are aware of the prime rate of interest, you can add a few points to that and come up with something close to the interest rate the bank will charge on your loan.
