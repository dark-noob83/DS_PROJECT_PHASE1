1 Update Aug 2015: You may have heard whispers about Machu Picchu closing in April 2016. 2  In fact, the two mountain peaks at Machu Picchu will be closed to the public during this period, but not Machu Picchu itself. In general, therefore, feel free to ignore all Machu Picchu closure rumors â€” just keep an eye on the weather and pick a month to visit Machu Picchu that suits you style. 1 
Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca site located on a ridge between the Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu mountains in Peru. It sits 7,970 feet (2,430 meters) above sea level on the eastern slope of the Andes and overlooks the Urubamba River hundreds of feet below. 
Answer: Machu Picchu is currently open to the public. In fact, the archaeological site of Machu Picchu is normally open 365 days a year from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm. Important: There will be a temporary closure of both the Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu mountains in April 2016. Unlike Machu Picchu, the Inca Trail does close for one month each year. The Inca Trail closes for maintenance during the whole of February (typically the wettest and therefore least popular month of the year) and reopens on March 1.
It is also important to note that the mountains will not be closed at the same time to minimize the disruption caused. Huayna Picchu will be closed from 1-15 April 2016, and Machu Picchu mountain will be closed from 16-30 April. However the closure of one path will obviously put extra strain on the other.
In April 2016 the 2 mountains of Machu Picchu will be closed to visitors while important maintenance work is done, the high amount of traffic on these paths making the work impossible under normal circumstances. Huayna Picchu will be closed from 1-15 April 2016, and Machu Picchu mountain will be closed from 16-30 April. However the closure of one path will obviously put extra strain on the other.
