Under the conditions of metamorphism the calcite in the limestone recrystallizes to form a rock that is a mass of interlocking calcite crystals. A related rock, dolomitic marble, is produced when dolostone is subjected to heat and pressure. Photo Gallery: The Many Uses of Marble. Most marble forms at convergent plate boundaries where large areas of Earth's crust are exposed to regional metamorphism.
Examples of this rock type include conglomerate and limestone. Metamorphic. Metamorphic rocks are formed under the surface of the earth from the metamorphosis (change) that occurs due to intense heat and pressure (squeezing). The three main types, or classes, of rock are sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous and the differences among them have to do with how they are formed. Sedimentary. Sedimentary rocks are formed from particles of sand, shells, pebbles, and other fragments of material.
Marble is a metamorphic rock which is a product of natural exposure deep underground to intense heat and pressure on limestone or dolostone, both sedimentary rocks. The minera â€¦ ls calcite or dolomite that are present in the limestone or dolostone are recrystallized, causing them to be larger and interlocked. Marble forms when calcium-rich rock like limestone is exposed to high heat and pressure. 9 people found this useful. Edit.

Some marble also forms by contact metamorphism when a hot magma body heats adjacent limestone or dolostone. Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris. During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes. In the early stages of the limestone-to-marble transformation the calcite crystals in the rock are very small. A related rock, dolomitic marble, is produced when dolostone is subjected to heat and pressure. Photo Gallery: The Many Uses of Marble. Most marble forms at convergent plate boundaries where large areas of Earth's crust are exposed to regional metamorphism.
Gneiss is a common example of this type of rock. 4. Lineation-Lineation is a foliation produced by elongate minerals such as actinolite, hornblende or tremolite arranged subparallel to each other, producing a single direction, or lineation, of mineral grains in the rock. Metamorphic grade The grade of metamorphism refers to the intensity of the changes that have produced the metamorphic rock. A low grade metamorphic rock often resembles the original rock from which it was formed. In high grade metamorphic rocks the original character is sometimes totally obscured.
Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism.

Examples of this rock type include gneiss and marble. Igneous. Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock deep within the earth) cools and hardens. Sometimes the magma cools inside the earth, and other times it erupts onto the surface from volcanoes (in this case, it is called lava). The three main types, or classes, of rock are sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous and the differences among them have to do with how they are formed. Sedimentary. Sedimentary rocks are formed from particles of sand, shells, pebbles, and other fragments of material.
