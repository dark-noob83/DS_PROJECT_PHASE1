If you’re new to raw food and haven’t the first clue where to start, or you’ve been dabbling for a while and can’t seem to make it work for you, this page is for you.
Raw food is, technically speaking, food that has not been heated above 48 degrees centigrade (117 degrees Fahrenheit). This usually means uncooked foods, or more specifically, foods in their natural state – nothing more, nothing less.
A raw foods diet is made up of fresh, whole, unrefined, living, plant-based foods: fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, and seeds, which are consumed in their natural state, without cooking or steaming.
Your oven gets a rest on this diet. You'll mostly be eating raw fruits, vegetables, and grains. The idea is that heating food destroys its nutrients and natural enzymes, which is bad because enzymes boost digestion and fight chronic disease.
I've been thinking I need to eat more raw foods (because they're so fiber-full) Is anyone on a raw food diet? What does it actually mean? More salads, vegetables, and fruit?
The best way to begin is by increasing the amount of raw food you eat, while decreasing the amount of cooked food. For example, you can replace cooked grains and milk (cereal, toast, etc.) for breakfast with fruit that is in season, such as melon in summer or grapefruit or oranges in winter.
By default this will mean foods that are safe to eat raw, which are the obvious foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds – but there are a whole array of raw foods both within these particular food groups and also many more outside of them that could very well be new to you.
Best Answer: Yup. It just means you eat your food raw. Not only do you eat food raw, but you also adhere to a vegan diet. You would not eat meat, dairy, poultry, fish, honey, or use any animal byproducts. You eat your food completely raw or you only warm it-I think it can't be heated past 115 degrees Fahrenheit.
