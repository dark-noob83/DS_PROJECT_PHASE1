I tapered off of Zoloft from 150mg -100mg, then 100mg to 50mg, then 50mg to 25mg, then 25mg to 0. Doing each one week at a time. It was bad. If I had to do it again I would have tapered by 25mg amounts for longer intervals. For example, 150 mg to 125 mg for 2-4 weeks, then 125 mg to 100 mg for 2-4 weeks, and so on. I was on 100mg of zoloft for the last 3 years and 50mg for two years prior to that. I started to taper off about 6 months ago from 100 to 50. That took about 2-3 months until I was functioning OKâ€¦ then I dropped it down to 50mg every other day, then every 3rd day, then about 8 weeks ago I went to zero.
