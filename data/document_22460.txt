is a system of three equations in the three variables x, y, z. A solution to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. 
1 It has one or two variables. 2  No variable in a linear equation is raised to a power greater than 1 or used as the denominator of a fraction. 3  When you find pairs of values that make the linear equation true and plot those pairs on a coordinate grid, all of the points for any one equation lie on the same line. A linear equation looks like any other equation. It is made up of two expressions set equal to each other. A linear equation is special because: 1 
Systems of Linear Equations: Definitions (page 1 of 7). Sections: Definitions, Solving by graphing, Substitition, Elimination/addition, Gaussian elimination. A system of equations is a set or collection of equations that you deal with all together at once. Linear equations (ones that graph as straight lines) are simpler than non-linear equations, and the simplest linear system is one with two equations and two variables. Think back to linear equations. For instance, consider the linear equation y = 3x – 5
Definition of Linear Equation. Linear equation is an equation of the form Ax + By = C, where A ≠ 0 and B ≠ 0. The graph of a linear equation is a straight line
Definition of LINEAR EQUATION. : an equation of the first degree in any number of variables. See linear equation defined for kids. ADVERTISEMENT
n. An algebraic equation, such as y = 2 x + 7 or 3 x + 2 y-z = 4, in which the highest degree term in the variable or variables is of the first degree. The graph of such an equation is a straight line if there are two variables
Graph sample of linear equations. A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable. Linear equations can have one or more variables. Linear equations occur abundantly in most subareas of mathematics and especially in applied mathematics. Linear equations do not include exponents. This article considers the case of a single equation for which one searches the real solutions. All its content applies for complex solutions and, more generally for linear equations with coefficients and solutions in any field.
More typically, we will write a solution in a form like $x_1=12$, $x_2=-7$, $x_3=2$ to mean that $s_1=12$, $s_2=-7$, $s_3=2$ in the notation of Definition SSLE. To discuss all of the possible solutions to a system of linear equations, we now define the set of all solutions.
