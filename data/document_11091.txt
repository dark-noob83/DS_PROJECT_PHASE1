Squalene is converted to cholesterol. Pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis. Synthesis of cholesterol begins with the transport of acetyl-CoA from within the mitochondria to the cytosol. The rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis occurs at the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reducatase, HMGR, catalyzed step. CYP metabolism of cholesterol yields several oxysterols that function as biologically active molecules such as in the activation of the liver X receptors (LXRs) and SREBP (see the next section). CYP3A4: CYP3A4 is also known as glucocorticoid-inducible P450 and nifedipine oxidase.
Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life, each cell synthesizes it through a complex process beginning with mevalonate pathway and ending with the 19 step conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a lipid molecule and is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of all animal (not plant or bacterial) cell membranes that is required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity.
cholesterol metabolism, the sum of the anabolic and catabolic processes in the synthesis and degradation of cholesterol in the body. Serum cholesterol level is increased when it is ingested and is quickly absorbed. Cholesterol is also synthesized in the liver and can be synthesized by most other body tissues. 
In addition to its importance within cells, cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals. It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a lipid molecule and is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of all animal (not plant or bacterial) cell membranes that is required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity.
The liver is central to the regulation of cholesterol levels in the body. Not only does it synthesize cholesterol for export to other cells, but it also removes cholesterol from the body by converting it to bile salts and putting it into the bile where it can be eliminated in the feces. 1 Two types of lipoproteins are triglyceride-rich: the chylomicrons and VLDL. 2  Chylomicrons are synthesized by enterocytes from lipids absorbed in the small intestine. 3  VLDL is synthesized in the liver. 4  The function of these lipoproteins is to deliver energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) to cells in the body (pink pathway).
Biosynthesis of Cholesterol. Slightly less than half of the cholesterol in the body derives from biosynthesis de novo. Biosynthesis in the liver accounts for approximately 10%, and in the intestines approximately 15%, of the amount produced each day. CYP metabolism of cholesterol yields several oxysterols that function as biologically active molecules such as in the activation of the liver X receptors (LXRs) and SREBP (see the next section). CYP3A4: CYP3A4 is also known as glucocorticoid-inducible P450 and nifedipine oxidase.
Endogenous pathway for lipid metabolism: 1  VLDL is formed in the liver from triglycerides and cholesterol esters. 2  These can be hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase to form IDL or VLDL remnants. 3  VLDL remnants are cleared from the circulation or incorporated into LDL. 1 VLDL is formed in the liver from triglycerides and cholesterol esters. 2  These can be hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase to form IDL or VLDL remnants. 3  VLDL remnants are cleared from the circulation or incorporated into LDL. 4  LDL particles contain a core of cholesterol esters and a smaller amount of triglyceride.
Cholesterol is oxidized by the liver into a variety of bile acids. These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine, taurine, glucuronic acid, or sulfate. A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a lipid molecule and is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of all animal (not plant or bacterial) cell membranes that is required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity.
