The San Diego County Water Authority has committed to purchasing the plant's entire output for 30 years — a deal that was crucial for Poseidon's financing — for about $2,100 to $2,300 per acre-foot, plus inflation. An acre-foot is 325,851 gallons, or about a year's usage for one or two five-member families. The county agency, therefore, will be paying at least $110 million a year, whether it needs the plant's water or not. San Diego water bills are projected to rise by an average of $5 to $7 a month to cover the cost.
By then, with the drought over, water from traditional sources was again about two-thirds cheaper than the $3,000 per acre-foot it cost to produce the plant's water. An acre-foot is equivalent to one acre covered by water 1 foot deep, enough to supply two families of four for a year.
The Water Authority teamed with Poseidon to secure financing for the desalination plant and the pipeline via tax-exempt construction bonds. Financing closed in December 2012 at a favorable interest rate, bringing financing costs $200 million below the Water Authority’s projections.
The plant cost $21.1 million and has a capacity of 7.5 million gallons per day. It is the city's first drought-proof source of water. By 2004, there were more than 100 desalination plants in Texas, all of them treating either brackish groundwater or surface water.
But that dash of independence comes at a cost. The water authority is locked into a 30-year deal with the plant's developer, Poseidon Water, to purchase desalted water for about $2,000 an acre foot in 2012 dollars.
That cost gap has narrowed, however. With better screens and technology that helps the plants power themselves by recycling the energy used to suck in water-in a way, like a hybrid car regenerates power from its own motion-the typical cost of running desalination plants can dip below $2,000 an acre-foot.
Another large plant, with a potential price tag of $400 million, could begin construction in Monterey County by 2018. It would be near the only desalination plant in California that fills the needs of an entire municipality-the one that has been supplying water to Sand City, population 334, since 2010.
