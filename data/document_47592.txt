But, anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal. For the first few years after menstruation begins, longer cycles are common. A woman's cycle tends to shorten and become more regular with age. Most of the time, periods will be in the range of 21 to 35 days apart. Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and these changes may occur over several years. The time when your body begins its move into menopause is called the menopausal transition. This can last anywhere from 2 to 8 years.
If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is released in what is known as menstruation. A number of problems with menstruation may occur. A lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not occurred in 90 days. Periods also stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding. Menstruation, also known as a period or monthly, is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms prior to
1 Your periods become very irregular after having had regular, monthly cycles. 2  Your period occurs more often than every 21 days or less often than every 35 days. 3  You are bleeding for more than 7 days. 4  You are bleeding more heavily than usual or using more than 1 pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours. Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and these changes may occur over several years. The time when your body begins its move into menopause is called the menopausal transition. This can last anywhere from 2 to 8 years.
The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 31 days in adults (an average of 28 days). Menstruation stops occurring after menopause which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is about the same length in most individuals (mean 14/13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days).
Menstruation (men-STRAY-shuhn) is a woman's monthly bleeding. When you menstruate, your body sheds the lining of the uterus (womb). Menstrual blood flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from 3 to 5 days. 1 Menstruation is a monthly shedding of a female's uteral lining; it lasts about 3 to 5 days (average) and contains blood and tissue that exits her body through the cervix and vagina â€“ the first day of menstruation is the first day of your period.
A cycle is counted from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young teens. The rise and fall of levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle. Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and these changes may occur over several years. The time when your body begins its move into menopause is called the menopausal transition. This can last anywhere from 2 to 8 years.
The menstrual cycle, which is counted from the first day of one period to the first day of the next, isn't the same for every woman. Menstrual flow might occur every 21 to 35 days and last two to seven days. For the first few years after menstruation begins, long cycles are common. 
On Day 1 of your cycle, the thickened lining (endometrium) of the uterus begins to shed. You know this as menstrual bleeding from the vagina. A normal menstrual period can last 4 to 6 days. Most of your menstrual blood loss happens during the first 3 days. This is also when you might have cramping pain in your pelvis, legs, and back. Cramps can range from mild to severe. The cramping is your uterus contracting, helping the endometrium shed. The menstrual cycle is measured from the first day of menstrual bleeding, Day 1, up to Day 1 of your next menstrual bleeding. Although 28 days is the average cycle length, it is normal to have a cycle that is shorter or longer. 1  A teen's cycles may be long (up to 45 days), growing shorter over several years.

Ovulation can occur when you experience mid-cycle or ovulatory bleeding. Keep in mind that while you cannot technically ovulate while on a period, because sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days after sex, pregnancy could occur from intercourse that takes place during a period. Therefore, she cannot get pregnant more than once during a cycle. Multiple ovulation can occur and is when two or more eggs are released in a single cycle. Both eggs are released during one 24 hour period and are responsible for the birth of fraternal twins.
