The France country code is 33, and you omit the initial zero or provider’s number when calling from outside the country. Telephone téléphone (portable mobile or cell phone to) you numbers will start with 07 from (2010’they re currently). 06
33 = This is France's country code. 6 55 55 55 55 = The phone number, with the first zero removed. So remember, when calling a French number from within France, you keep the first zero of the ten-digit number, and when calling a French number from the US, you can drop it.
