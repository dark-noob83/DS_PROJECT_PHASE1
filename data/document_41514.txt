ISTJ stands for Introversion, Sensing, Thinking and Judging, which are the ways in which you prefer to energize, perceive information, make decisions and live your life. The MBTI is based on Jung's personality theory. He believed there are four pairs of opposite preferences.
As an ISTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things rationally and logically. ISTJs are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and peaceful living.
ISTJ in a Nutshell. ISTJs are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do. Reliable and dutiful, ISTJs want to uphold tradition and follow regulations.
The ISTJ is extremely dependable on following through with things which he or she has promised. For this reason, they sometimes get more and more work piled on them. Because the ISTJ has such a strong sense of duty, they may have a difficult time saying no when they are given more work than they can reasonably handle.
A person with an ISTJ personality is more Introverted and Sensing, and is inclined towards the Thinking and Judging ends of the spectrum. Introversion refers to the way a person relates to the world and directs his energy. ISTJs tend to spend their time with only a small group of friends.
