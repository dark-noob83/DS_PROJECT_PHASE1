Report Abuse. For just feeding, I spend about $2.50 a horse per day on average. Hard keepers will definately cost more, those not on feed less. This doesn't include supplements and daily dewormer for the horses in conditioning. Figure it out that I spend $75 a horse per month on average.. It costs me $250.00 per month if I average out vet bills and farrier. I have a 13 hand POA, a 14 hand Mustang and a 15.2 hand Paint horse. I already have all my tack but periodically need to invest in fencing or other things around the barn. Those bills would be above the figure I quoted in the beginning of this post.

And keep in mind that you need to be able to dish out $10000 or more fast in case of an emergency, such as colic surgery.
