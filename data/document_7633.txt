How much electricity does an American home use? In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh. 
4. Multiply the unit's kWh/day by the number of days you'd use it during the period you'd like to calculate. So to estimate an appliance's energy use in kWh per month, multiply its kWh/day by 31 (or 28, 29 or 30 depending on how many days there are in the month you want to measure). To continue the earlier example of the window fan, if energy costs 17 cents/kWh in your area, running the fan as estimated earlier for one year will cost you approximately 1.25 (kWh per day) * 365 (days--the time period) * .17 (cost of energy/kWh) = about $77.56 per year if you use the fan every day.
An average central ac will use 3000 to 5000 watts of power every hour for around 9 hours a day during the hotter months. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a central air conditioner using 3500 Watts for 3 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. 
Divide the result by 1,000 to convert watts to kilowatts. So for example, if your large window fan is rated at 250 watts and you use it 5 hours a day, its kWh use per day is 250 (watts) * 5 (hours used per day) / 1,000 (to change watts into kilowatts) = 1.25 kWh per day. To continue the earlier example of the window fan, if energy costs 17 cents/kWh in your area, running the fan as estimated earlier for one year will cost you approximately 1.25 (kWh per day) * 365 (days--the time period) * .17 (cost of energy/kWh) = about $77.56 per year if you use the fan every day.
But if you try to power the same sized house in Vermont, where the average solar insolation per year is around 4 kWh/meters squared/day, you’ll need 80 square meters (861 sq ft) of 15% efficient solar panels and 57 square meters (615 sq ft) of the 21% efficient ones. — Aaron Johnson. So let’s put some numbers to the question: Imagine that your house uses 48 kWh of electricity per day (about average). If you live in Arizona, where the average solar insolation per year is around 6 kWh/meters squared/day, you’ll need 53 square meters (574 sq ft) of 15% efficient solar panels.
(Then divide by 1000 to get the kilowatt-hours, which is how your utility charges you.) Example: 100-watt bulb x 2 hours 1000 = 0.2 kWh. Trivia. The average U.S. household uses 920 kWh a month. (Dept. of Energy). The U.S. as a whole used nearly 4 trillion kWh in 2009. (DoE) About 37% was residential use. 
Best Answer: The average household in America consumes 10,656 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, according to the Department of Energy. Dividing that by 365 gives about 29. But that is just an average. I would say my house is fairly typical, and my average monthly electricity consumption ins 1000kWh. Using a value of 720 hours/month this gives 1.39 kW per month of 0.046 kW per day. Every one else answered in terms pf kWh per day, but you asked about kW.
A fridge will use anywhere from 100 to 400 watts depending on size, an average modern fridge will use 180 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a refrigerator using 180 Watts for 24 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. Cost Per Hour: Price (kWh): Enter the cost you are paying on average per a kilowatt hour, average price in North America is 10 cents. If you are using an old fridge we highly recommend you upgrade to a more efficient modern model, advances in the past 15-20 years have reduced the energy use of refrigeration.
