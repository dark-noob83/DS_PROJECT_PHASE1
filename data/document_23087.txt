The phylum Chordata is a taxonomic group. All animals which have a  spine, or backbone, are classified in the phylum Chordata. There  are three subphylums in Chordata: Uroch â€¦ ordata (tunicates),  Cephalachordata (lancelets), and Vertebrata (vertebrates).
The phylum Chordata is divided into three subphylums: Urochordata (tunicates), Cephalachordata (lancelets), and Vertebrata (vertebrates). The first two phyla are very small containing only about 2,000 species total.
Chordates are animals with backbones. Animal groups in the chordate phylum include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Animals with backbones are the most highly evolved groups of animals, the most complex and complicated. They have interior skeletons and have bilateral symmetry.
Animals of the phylum chordata include vertebrates and several closely related invertebrates. All chordates have the following characteristics at some point in their lives : 1.notochord-cartilaginous rod running underneath, and supporting, the nerve cord. In vertebrates, it develops into the vertebral column.
The phylum Chordata contains all animals that possess, at some point during their lives, a hollow nerve cord and a notochord, a flexible rod between the nerve cord and the digestive track.
