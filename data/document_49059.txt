A. Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk. 1  Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL).
1 Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. 2  High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with a increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. 3  Extremely high triglyceride levels (greater than 500mg/dl) may cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk. 1  Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL).

For simplification triglycerides are simply fats (or lipids). Studies have shown that high triglyceride levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(2) American Heart Association states as late as 6 Sep 2011, that a triglycerides normal level is below 150 mg/dl.(3) But this is not so. Recent studies show that values considered normal for triglyceride levels (150 to 200) may not be safe (1). In this article you will find out about what are these supposedly normal levels and the study that shows otherwise. Below you will also find out the NEW table of normal triglyceride levels.
Triglyceride Ranges. A triglyceride level less than 150 mg/dL is considered ideal for adults, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. A triglyceride level of 150 to 200 mg/dL is borderline high. A triglyceride result of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, and levels of 500 mg/dL or more are very high. The normal range for triglyceride level for adults is less than 150 mg/dL
Triglycerides are one of the types of fat in the body and your level can be measured with a blood test. The test is more accurate if it is done after fasting from food and drinks for 9 to 12 hours. The normal range for triglyceride level for adults is less than 150 mg/dL. A triglyceride level less than 150 mg/dL is considered ideal for adults, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. A triglyceride level of 150 to 200 mg/dL is borderline high. A triglyceride result of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, and levels of 500 mg/dL or more are very high
The National Cholesterol Education Program sets guidelines for triglyceride levels: Normal triglycerides means there are less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline high triglycerides = 150 to 199 mg/dL. High triglycerides = 200 to 499 mg/dL. Very high triglycerides = 500 mg/dL or higher. High triglyceride levels may lead to heart disease, especially in people with low levels of good cholesterol and high levels of bad cholesterol, and in people with type 2 diabetes. Experts disagree, though, on just how bad of an effect high triglyceride levels by themselves have on the heart.

Test Results. If your blood triglyceride levels are normal, your test results will be less than 150 milligrams per deciliter. The range for borderline high triglycerides is 150 to 199 milligrams per deciliter. The range for high is 200 to 499 milligrams per deciliter. Any level above 499 is considered very high.
