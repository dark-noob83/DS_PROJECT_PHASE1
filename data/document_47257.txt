EVERY DEGREE COUNTS Temperature is key to fermentation success 2 Yeast face a number of synergistic stress factors in ethanol production (Figure 1). Maintaining an ideal temperature range during the fermentation process is a diﬃcult task that all ethanol plant operators face, especially in the hotter months (Figure 2). The optimum temperature range for yeast fermentation is between 90˚F-95˚F (32˚C-35˚C). Every degree above this range depresses fermentation. While elevated temperature is problematic in all phases of ethanol production, it is speciﬁcally hazardous during the later stages of fermentation. 
Report Abuse. Yeast multiplies best at a temperature of 30-35*C, or 86.5-95*F. Yeast is not an enzyme, it is a living unicellular organism belonging to the kingdom Fungi. Enzymes are not living; they are catalysts to speed up reactions, and are produced by pretty much all living organisms, including yeast. Report Abuse. yeast grows optimally around 30-35 degrees Celsius. If you get much above 40 it won't grow at all. Below 30 its grow slows down dramatically and when you get below about 10 it really doesn't grow much at all.
95° F (35° C) Temperature for liquids used to dissolve compressed yeasts. 80° F90° F (27° C32° C) Optimum temperature range for yeast to grow and reproduce at dough fermentation stage. 70° F80° F (21° C27°C) Recommended water temperature for bread machines. 40° F (4° C) Recommended refrigerator temperature. Used directly from the fridge, yeast is too cold to work properly. 300° F400° F (150° C205° C) Surface temperature of a browning crust. 200° F (100° C) Interior temperature of a loaf of just-baked bread. 130° F140° F (55° C60° C) Yeast cells die (thermal death point). 120° F130° F (49° C55° C) Water temperature for activating yeast designed to be mixed with the dry ingredients in a recipe. 105° F115° F (41° C46° C) Temperature of water for dry yeast reconstituted with water and sugar
For active dry yeast, the water temperature should be between 105 and 110 degrees for proofing. While 95 degrees is the best temperature for yeast to multiply, that’s not quite warm enough for proofing active dry yeast. It needs the extra warmth to dissolve and become active. At cooler temperatures, the yeast doesn’t wake up as well, and it can release a substance that can interfere with gluten formation
Water at just above the 100-degree mark will stop feeling cool to the touch and will feel comfortably warm-not at all hot. At that temperature, your yeast should be perfectly happy. It might not be optimum, but it will work. Yum.

As a general observation, the fermentation rate increases with a rise in temperature up to a maximum of perhaps 100 to 105 F (38 to 41 C). The rates of carbon dioxide generation of dough without added sugar over a 3-hr period at various temperatures within the range of 81.5 to 95 F (28 to 35 C) are shown in Graph 1. Yeast enzymes are generally inhibited at this temperature. Table 5 below (derived from Pyler) correlates the effects gas production and temperature in liquid ferments. As can be seen, gas production increases as the temperature rises to 100 F (38 C).
Once the dough or ferment temperature exceeds about 105 F (41 C), the fermentation rate declines. Yeast enzymes are generally inhibited at this temperature. Table 5 below (derived from Pyler) correlates the effects gas production and temperature in liquid ferments. As can be seen, gas production increases as the temperature rises to 100 F (38 C). It then declines at higher temperatur
A human with a body temperature of 38.6*C (101.5*F) would be diagnosed with a fever. Yeast enzymes happen to function best at a temperature below the average healthy human body temperature. So now you know a little bit about enzymes. Report Abuse. yeast grows optimally around 30-35 degrees Celsius. If you get much above 40 it won't grow at all.

I am doing a report on yeast and how temperature effects it. I just wanted to know what temperature yeast grows best in, and why it grows best in that specific temperature. 2 following. 2 answers 2. Report Abuse. yeast grows optimally around 30-35 degrees Celsius. If you get much above 40 it won't grow at all. Below 30 its grow slows down dramatically and when you get below about 10 it really doesn't grow much at all.
