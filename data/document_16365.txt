The FDIC and NCUA insure IRA funds deposited in savings accounts and certificates of deposit. They also insure money market deposit accounts where the interest you get is based on money market rates but your deposit is never at risk. The federal deposit insurance limit as of 2012 was $250,000. If you have two or more IRA accounts at a particular institution, the limit applies to the collective total on deposit there. If you have IRA deposit accounts at two or more financial institutions, the total on deposit at each of those institutions is insured to the $250,000 limit.

For instance, if you had $100,000 deposited in a Roth IRA account and $125,000 deposited in a traditional IRA account at the same institution, they would be treated as one IRA deposit account containing $225,000. Since this is under the $250,000 limit per institution, your funds are protected. If you have two or more IRA accounts at a particular institution, the limit applies to the collective total on deposit there. If you have IRA deposit accounts at two or more financial institutions, the total on deposit at each of those institutions is insured to the $250,000 limit.
