Postmaturity is the condition of a baby that has not yet been born after 42 weeks of gestation, two weeks beyond the normal 40. Post-term, postmaturity, prolonged pregnancy, and post-dates pregnancy all refer to postmature birth. 
Reviewed by Laura J. Martin, MD. May 23, 2011 -- Babies born between 39 and 41 weeks of pregnancy fare better than infants born during weeks 37 or 38, a study shows. A term birth is considered 37 to 41 weeks, but the new study suggests it is more of a continuum. The findings appear in Obstetrics & Gynecology. Previously it was thought that infant mortality risk was similar for babies born between 37 and 41 weeks. But the new study shows that this risk is increased when babies are born between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation, and that this risk decreases with each additional week of pregnancy.
Premature baby. The normal length for a pregnancy is between 37 and 42 weeks. If a baby is born before the 37th week, or 259 days of gestation, the baby will be considered a premature baby. Typical length: 12-14in (30-35cm). At 35-37 weeks: The baby will look similar to a full-term baby but will be thin and with some hair; the baby will still need help staying warm and with feeding and breathing. Typical weight: 3.5-7lb (1.6-3.4kg). Typical length: 15-18in (38-45cm).
A: Although pregnancy is generally 40 weeks long, babies born at 37 weeks are considered full-term (at that point, they're developed enough that they shouldn't have any age-related health issues). 
The overall risk of newborn death remains small, but it doubles for infants born before 37 weeks, compared to infants born at 40 weeks. In 2006, infant mortality was 1.9 deaths for every 1,000 live birth when babies were born at 40 weeks. Previously it was thought that infant mortality risk was similar for babies born between 37 and 41 weeks. But the new study shows that this risk is increased when babies are born between 37 and 39 weeks of gestation, and that this risk decreases with each additional week of pregnancy.
What is considered the normal weight for a newborn? The normal weight of a baby who reaches full term between 37 and 40 weeks is 2.7–4.1kg (6 – 9 lbs), with an average weight of 3.5kg (7.7 lbs). A baby who weighs less than 2.5kg (5.5 lbs) is considered to have a low birth weight. About half of all twins and 90% of all triplets are born prematurely, before 37 weeks, and have a low birth weight of under 2.5kg. A baby who weighs more than 4kg (8.8lbs) at birth may be referred to as macrosomia, which means the baby is larger than normal.
The term newborn for a baby is considered the first few hours, days or very few weeks. Generally upto a month. A baby over a month is considered by monthly age, then by years and etc. How many weeks in a year? There are 7 days a week, and 365 days a year, we find out the scale by. 365 days/year x 1 week / 7 days. Then we will figure out that there is 365/7 weeks/year (quite bad) There is 12 month per year as well.
