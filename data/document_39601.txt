Best Answer: Depends on what state. In our community in California, it's about $75,000/yr starting salary the last I heard. I think part-time is about $50/$75 per hr for teaching a class. For supervising a lab, I think it's either $35 or $50/hr.
I am assuming they get paid $50-100 an hour. The part time professors are young and do not have much experience. My ESS 100 professor works as a full time fitness trainer for the military and they even provide free housing for her but she wants some more money so she decided to teach at my community college part time.
Salaries for full-time community college professors can vary based on education level. Professors with a doctorate degree earn more than those with a master’s or bachelor’s degree. At Grays Harbor College in Washington state, for example, this amounted to a difference of approximately $10,000, as of publication.
