PowerShell-Computer Definition. A comprehensive command line interface and scripting language for Windows. Introduced in 2006, PowerShell is a major upgrade from the Windows command line, which uses DOS commands (see command line).
The $me variable was initially an Int32, but Windows PowerShell changed it to a String when the value Don was added. Windows PowerShell can change the type of a variable as needed, provided the variable hasn't already been explicitly set to a specific type.

Like any scripting language, Windows PowerShell lets you create functions. You can make functions as simple or as complex as necessary. In this lesson, you'll learn how to create your own functions, including how to incorporate named parameters and how to give those parameters default values.
In Windows PowerShell, variable names always start with a dollar sign ($) and can contain a mix of letters, numbers, symbols, or even spaces (though if you use spaces, you need to enclose the variable in braces, such as ${My Variable} = Hello).
Because in this case the value is a string of characters, Windows PowerShell will use the String data type to store the value. In .NET Framework terms, that's the System.String class, which has perhaps the most built-in functionality of any variable type.
When you call a function in PowerShell, you can include parameter values with the function's name. If those values aren't associated with a named parameter, they're automatically saved to the $args array.
Like any scripting language, Windows PowerShell lets you create functions that you can reference within PowerShell statements. A function is basically a named block of code. When you call the function name, the script block within that function runs.
Advertisement. Windows PowerShell is a command-shell environment that supports object-oriented scripting based on the Microsoft .NET Framework. At its heart is the PowerShell cmdlet, a lightweight command that performs a specific action and, in the process, returns a .NET object.
