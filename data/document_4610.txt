Because the brow position is related at least in part to the activity of the forehead muscle, relaxing it with botox could cause the brow to drop and make the eyelids look heavy. If that is the case then it will last as long as the botox, about 3 months. The good news is that it is temporary regardless of the cause..
A droopy eyelid can happen with a unqualified injector, it doesn't usually happen between the eyebrows more in the mid to outer area of the eyebrow. The doctors inject just under the eyebrow in that area and it creates an eyebrow lift but if they do it wrong it can create a drooping eyebrow.
The eyelid drooping can and usually does last for the entire time the botox usually lasted in your system in the past. So if your last botox treatment lasted for 3 months then the droopy eye will probably last about the same amount of time worst case.
Since Botox is not permanent, the ptosis will resolve over time, even without treatment. While Botox usually lasts approximately 4 months, if left untreated ptosis does not typically last that long. Proper treatment for correction is with Iopidine (apraclonidine) 0.5% drops.
2. Use eye drops. Since a droopy eyebrow actually manifests itself more as a droopy eyelid in most patients, placing a few drops of Apraclonidine 0.5% will relax Muller’s muscle and allow elevation of the eyelid to “correct” the droopy look.
What to do about a droopy brow or eyelid. The effect of the Botox will last about three to four months. That is a long time to go around looking droopy on one side, but there are some options available to improve the situation.
Eye ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid or brow, is a potential side effect of Botox treatment. It is among the most common side effects associated with botulinum injections, although it should not occur frequently with proper injection technique. It is beneficial for patients and providers to know the proper antidote.
