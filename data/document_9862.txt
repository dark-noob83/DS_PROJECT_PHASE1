The relationship of gage to wire size is, for a lot of people, counterintuitive. The larger the gage number, the smaller the wire. What's more, the relationship isn't linear, but logarithmic. Two 16 AWG wires, combined, amount to a 13 AWG conductor. If you're familiar with decibels (dB), this will make good sense.
AWG stands for American Wire Gauge, and it is a standard used for denoting. wire conductor diameter. The system is counter-intuitive, so the lower the. AWG, the thicker the conductor. Actually the system is even more counter-intuitive than that. Once you get. to wires thicker than 0 AWG, you do not use negative numbers.
American Wire Gauge (AWG) is a U.S. standard set of non-ferrous wire conductor sizes. The gauge means the diameter. Non-ferrous includes copper and also aluminum and other materials, but is most frequently applied to copper household electrical wiring and telephone wiring.

When the gauge number increases, the wire diameter decreases. Stranded wire which is commonly used in audio visual applications has an AWG which is determined by the total cross-sectional area of the conductor, which determines its current capacity and electrical resistance.
American Wire Gauge (AWG) is the standard grading used on speaker wire. Used since 1857, it indicates the diameter of round, solid or stranded electrically conducting wire. The diameter of each gauge is a factor in determining itsâ€™ current capacity.
