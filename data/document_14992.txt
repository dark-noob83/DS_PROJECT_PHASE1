Chutney comes from the Indian word chatni, a word that is thought to mean crushed. It is a relish that is made of a variety of fruits, spices, and other ingredients and served with curry dishes in India. Originally, the ingredients were ground to a paste with a mortar and pestle. The chutney was normally eaten freshly made, so it did not need to have the addition of vinegar or citrus for preservation.
CHUTNEY ORIGINS. The original chutney of India (Hindi: chatni) was usually a relish made from fresh fruits and spices. During the colonial era the British took it home (along with curry dishes) to their Island, and thence to their other colonial possessions, including South Africa and the Caribbean Islands.
