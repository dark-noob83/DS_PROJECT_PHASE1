In cold temperatures the wind also makes a difference, and in calm conditions at -29°C a well clothed person is in little danger, but if there is a light wind of 10mph it gives the same effect as a temperature of -44°C when exposed flesh can freeze in a minute or so.
As for heat: A sauna can reach temperatures of close to 200 degrees, but since the air is around 10% humidity, it actually feels comfortable and has many healing properties. But if the air is 90% humidity, then the safe temperature is more like around 110 degrees.
No. A fever is when the core body temperature rises above 37.5°C, and in Fahrenheit that is anything over 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is considered normal. However, body t … emperature naturally varies from person to person. It can also vary according to the time of day and activity of a person.
Sweating is the main built in mechanism for removing excess heat from the human body. According to my biology book, in (100%) humid conditions humans cannot survive in heats of above around 45C, but in a dry environment can survive in heats of over 100C just through sweating.
In the cold it really depends how well clothed you are! In Antarctics, temperatures regularly get to -60°C, and people can survive here if they have very good technical clothing that keeps their core body temperature within the normal range of 36.5-38°C.
I'm not sure but I believe once an external temperature above 212 degrees is reached a human will begin to die because of their internal fluids simply starting to boil, remember we are 70-90% water.. The coldest temperature your body can get before shutting down and going into hypothermic shock is 89 degrees.
Death by cold is harder to delimit. A person usually expires when their body temperature drops to 70 degrees F (21 degrees C), but how long this takes to happen depends on how used to the cold a person is, and whether a mysterious, latent form of hibernation sets in, which has been known to happen.
Question: What is the coldest and hottest temperature a human can survive in, and what happens to the human body in those temperatures?
