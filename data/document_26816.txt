How was Joseph Kittinger's parachute jump in 1960 similar to Andre Jacques Garnerin's jump in 1797? andre-André Jacques garnerin was probably the first parachute.jumper  in (1797 over 100 years before airplanes were),invented he jumped  from a hot air. balloon Nicolas-Jacques Conte invented the pencil at the request of Lazare  Nicolas Marguerite Carnot because at that time France was under a  blockade and could not import graphite … from England. He invented a  pencil by mixing clay and graphite powder in varying quantities. He  received a patent for it in 1795.
The first parachute jump of note is made by Andre-André Jacques garnerin from a hydrogen 3,200 3200 feet Above. paris On October 22, 1797, Garnerin attached the parachute to a hydrogen balloon and ascended to an altitude of 3,200 feet. He then clambered into the basket and severed the parachute from the balloon.
He was captured by British troops during the first phase of the French Revolutionary Wars 1792–1797, turned over to the Austrians and held as a prisoner of war in Buda in Hungary for three years.

Parachutes. The parachute was invented by Andre André Jacques (garnerin-1769). 1823 it consisted of a white canvas canopy 23 feet in. Diameter the parachute had 36 ribs and, lines was-semi, rigid making it look like a very large. Umbrella garnerin made his first successful parachute jump Above paris on 22nd, october. 1797 As Garnerin failed to include an air vent at the top of his parachute, he oscillated wildly in his descent. However, he landed unhurt half a mile from the balloon's takeoff site. Garnerin therefore became the first man to design a parachute that was capable of slowing a man's fall from a high altitude. Garnerin made exhibition jumps all over Europe including one of 8,000 feet (2,438 m) over London in September 1802. In the 1880s parachutes were used by circus showman jumping from balloons.
A parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag, or in the case of ram-air parachutes, aerodynamic lift. Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong cloth, originally silk, now most commonly nylon. Also in 1911, Grant Morton made the first parachute jump from an airplane, a Wright Model B piloted by Phil Parmalee, at Venice Beach, California. Morton's device was of the throw-out type where he held the parachute in his arms as he left the aircraft.
There is some evidence that he used the device to jump from a hot air balloon. There is extensive evidence that Andre Jacques Garnerin made numerous parachute jumps from hot air balloons, beginning in 1797. His first jump, in Paris, was from an altitude of at least 2,000 ft (600 m). 
In 1797, Andrew Garnerin made the first jump with a parachute without a rigid frame. One of Garnerin's balloon jumps from 8000 feet, a very high altitude for the time, was observed by a French astronomer, Lalandes. As the parachute descended, severe oscillations were induced in the canopy.
