In this diagram you see a tRNA that has the anticodon UUU which is complementary to the codon AAA. The codon AAA specifies the amino acid phenylalanine. You also see the tRNA with the anticodon CCC which is complementary to the codon GGG. The codon GGG specifies the amino acid glycine.
Definition of ANTICODON. : a triplet of nucleotide bases in transfer RNA that identifies the amino acid carried and binds to a complementary codon in messenger RNA during protein synthesis at a ribosome.
A codon is the triplet sequence in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript which specifies a corresponding amino acid (or a start or stop command). An anticodon is the corresponding triplet sequence on the transfer RNA (tRNA) which brings in the specific amino acid to the ribosome during translation. The anticodon is complementary to the codon, that is, if the codon is AUU, then the anticodon is UAA. There are no T (Thymine) nitrogen bases in mRNA.
a sequence of three nucleotides found in transfer RNA. Each anticodon pairs complementarily with a specific codon of messenger RNA during protein synthesis and specifies a particular amino acid in the protein. See also genetic code, transcription, translation.
anticodon. a triplet of nucleotides in transfer RNA that is complementary to the codon in messenger RNA that specifies the amino acid. Anticodon. The three nucleotides (shaded) on a transfer RNA bind to a complementary messenger RNA codon. From Dorland's, 2000.
