So in conclusion: while R itself is mostly written in C (with hefty chunks in R and Fortran), R packages are mostly written in R (with hefty chunks written in C/C++). librestats: How Much of R is Written in R Part 2: Contributed Packages.

For comparison, about 50% of R is written in C, and just under 30% in Fortran â€” for the current 2.13.1 release, at least. Of course, these ratios have changed over time with each release of R, as this analysis of the R codebase from Ohloh shows:
On of the nice things about R is that a lot if it is written in the R language. That means, as an R user, if you want to see how R calculates a certain statistic, or you want to modify an existing function for your own use, you can just look at the R code by typing the name of the functions.
The librestats blog did an analysis of the latest R source code distribution, and found that 22% of the R's lines of code are in R. For comparison, about 50% of R is written in C, and just under 30% in Fortran -- for the current 2.13.1 release, at least.
Introduction to R. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.
