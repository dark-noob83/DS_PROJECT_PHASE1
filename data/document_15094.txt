A veteran’s date of eligibility for VA Disability Back Pay is determined in one of two ways. First, if the veteran submits his VA Disability Claim within one year of his date of separation, his date of eligibility for VA Disability Back Pay is his date of separation. The exact rate of this VA Disability Back Pay will not be the total the condition should receive at 30%, but the difference between the 20% amount and the 30% amount.
So if the veterans received $100/month for the 20% rating but should have received $150/month for the 30% rating, the VA Disability Back Pay will be $50/month (150 – 100 = 50) times the number of months the change applies. The exact rate of this VA Disability Back Pay will not be the total the condition should receive at 30%, but the difference between the 20% amount and the 30% amount.
The letter is dated June 20, 2011. My payment Start Date is May 1, 2010. I called the VA and spoke to a rep. She was very helpful, and described everything to me. She told me I would be getting back pay, how long does that take to receive back pay, and can I expect my regular payments to begin on the 1st of July. Should I expect my regular 50% check on or around the 1st, or should I just expect the back pay for now.Or should I expect both checks Hope this question makes sense
Retired 1 May, 2011, received award letter 22 June, 2011. Waited for money on 1 July, 2011, nothing.

I was just received 100% va disability. How long does it take to get back pay? My letter from Va, says back pay will be with the first Va pay. I have had 2 va disability checks, but on backpay.
