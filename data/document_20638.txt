A judge is most likely to dismiss a case with prejudice if the defendant shows up in court and the plaintiff did not file a written request for postponement before the court date.
by FreeAdvice staff. Whenever you are involved in a small claims court case, it is your obligation and responsibility to show up to court. This is true whether you are the plaintiff (the one suing) or whether you are the defendant (the one being sued).
The defendant usually will prefer to have the judge decide the case, because if the case is simply dismissed (called a dismissal without prejudice), the plaintiff can refile it. If a plaintiff does not show up at the hearing and did not request a postponement, it's likely the judge will dismiss the case.
In a criminal case the prosecutor (from the District Attorney's office) is the plaintiff. The person charged with a crime is the defendant. In a civil case the plaintiff is the one filing the case against a defendant. In a civil case if the plaintiff does not show up without a good reason the case could be dismissed.
Occasionally, the plaintiff fails to show up to a scheduled small claims court hearing. In this situation, the judge normally will either dismiss the case or decide it based on the defendant's evidence, especially if the defendant filed a defendant's claim.
To get a dismissal vacated, ask the small claims court clerk for the rules and forms you should use. If the judge enters a default judgment for the defendant, the plaintiff cannot appeal the judgment but may appeal the judge's decision to give the defendant a default judgment.
