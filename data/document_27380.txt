It can, however, be fulled even more, which is why wool fabrics have to be handled carefully in the wash. Anywhere from five to 20 percent of the volume of the fabric may be lost during the fulling process. After fulling, the wet fabric must be stretched or “blocked” on a rack.
Fulled fabric. Fulled fabric is a kind of felted wool, the surface of the wool is slightly felted so that the right side looks the same as the wrong side. The quality is smooth, but sturdy, and has a perfect wearing ease. You usually sew jackets from it without lining, which are perfect for autumn and any transitional season.
The term fabric is commonly used to describe data or storage area networks (SANs). Increasingly, however, vendors are using the term to describe the servers, high-speed connections and switches that make up a cloud computing platform. See also: switching fabric, Windows Azure Fabric Controller.
It is also clear how much more the heavily fulled fabric has shrunk. Current wisdom dictates that if you are going to do significant wool fulling the cloth must be very loosely constructed, whether you are weaving or knitting. This fabric, however, was actually woven quite densely.
