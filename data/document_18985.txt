The states were grouped into regions that share similar characteristics. However, there are some areas in each region that different from each other because our country is made up of many different landforms, a natural feature on our Earth's surface. For example, in the West we see mountains, fertile valleys, shining lakes, and islands. There are many different types of landforms. 1 The Appalachian Mountains begin to flatten towards the east and form into the Atlantic Coastal Plain. 2  To the west, there are plains leading into the Gulf of Mexico from Louisiana and Mississippi. 3  You can also find the Mississippi Rivers and Red Rivers flowing through the region.
The second type of region is the functional region. A functional region is defined by its internal organization, which usually centers on some focal point. This could be a city, a school in an educational district, a shopping center in a large market area, or a large company that employs a sizeable number of workers. Regions can vary greatly in size. A region may be as small as a backyard or as large as a continent. For instance, a salesman making business calls in an unfamiliar town will need to learn about a relatively small geographic region.

Regions can vary greatly in size. A region may be as small as a backyard or as large as a continent. For instance, a salesman making business calls in an unfamiliar town will need to learn about a relatively small geographic region.

The region is tied by a central point by transportation or communications systems or by economic or functional associations. Formal: Also called homogeneous region.

Is place where people believes exists as part of their cultural identity.
In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography. A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrant

In geography, regions are areas broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography).

The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past.

Geographers have defined two kinds of regions uniform and functional. A uniform region is distinguished by some characteristic such as climate, soil, landforms, language, religion, and social customs that is common throughout the region. Regions can vary greatly in size. A region may be as small as a backyard or as large as a continent. For instance, a salesman making business calls in an unfamiliar town will need to learn about a relatively small geographic region.
