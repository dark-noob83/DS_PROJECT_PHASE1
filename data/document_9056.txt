Red flag: If your child isn't toddling by 14 or 15 months, bring it up with her doctor. This is still within the normal range of development, but now's a good time to check for anything that may be delaying the milestone. 16 to 18 months. With help, your toddler can walk up and down stairs.
Most babies learn to crawl between age 7 and 10 months. This is not to say that your baby may not start crawling sooner than this, but on average babies start crawling around 7-10 months. If your baby spends time on the floor and gets lots of tummy time, he may master the skill of crawling sooner.
Most babies take their first steps sometime between 9 and 12 months and are walking well by the time they're 14 or 15 months old. Don't worry if your child takes a little longer, though. Some perfectly normal children don't walk until they're 16 or 17
The normal age range when a child starts walking is 9 to 15 months, and most children start walking just after the age of one-between 13 to 14 months. So if your 14 month child cannot walk, but can crawl, sit, stand, there is no cause for concern.
Theres is no set age for a baby to start walking. It is usually between 9-15 months. With my twins one started walking a week before she turned one and the other a week after she turned one. Every baby is different and will learn in there own time.
If your child isn't walking but a younger baby is, don't fret; it's perfectly normal. Although some babies walk before their birthdays, many don't start for a few months. You should not become concerned unless your baby is not walking by 18 months.
JustMommies / Babies / Baby Development. Most babies start to walk around 13 months, but your baby may start walking as early as 9 or 10 months or as late as 15 or 16 months. Some babies go from cruising the furniture to walking rather quickly and other babies learn to walk at a little slower pace.
