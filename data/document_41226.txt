With the above figures of 0.5 liters/breath, 15 breath per minute, and 67.2 years in a lifetime we can calculate our total breathing volume: There are 60 x 24 X 365.25 minutes in a year. This is 525,960 minutes. To calculate all the breaths you take in a lifetime we have to know a couple of things. First of all we have to know the size (volume) of an average breath. Secondly we have to know how frequent we breathe (number of breaths per minute). And finally we have to decide how long you are going to live.
1. Record the average breaths per minute for the Rbreather.n breaths/min x 0.5 liters of air = liters/min This value represents the amount of air consumed in one minute and is referred to as the respiratory minute volume. 2. 3. Calculate the amount of air needed for one person to breathe each day. liters/hr x hrs/day = liters/day 4. Calculate the amount of air needed for one person to breathe for one year. Work this one on your own. liters/yr 5.
The average tidal volume for a person at rest is approximately 50 mL. Count the number of times a person breathes in 1 minute. One breath would be an inhalation plus an exhalation. Multiply the tidal volume times the number of breaths in a minute to find the minute volume. For instance, if a person's tidal volume is 50 mL and he breathes 15 times in a minute, multiply 50 times 15 to get a minute volume of 750 mL per minute. 
Not a great way to get any real clear conclusions. How much air we take in is primarily in the relationship of lung volume, breathing rate, balance. How much we get into our cells is another matter as chemistry alters that. Most people breathe at 12 breaths per minute. 
Typical resting adult respiratory rates are 10–20 breaths per minute with 1/3 of the breath time in inspiration. According to Wikipedia: The average pair of human lungs can hold about 6 liters of air, but only a small amount of this capacity is used during normal breathing. Instead I used an average human lung tidal volume of 500 ml at a breath rate between 10 and 20 breaths per minute with 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day.
Answer by Joshua Peauril. Confidence votes 45. The average exchange of air per breath is 500 ml for men and 390 mL for women and the average breathing rate is about 12 times per minute. That's about 6 litres a minute, 0.360 m3/hr for men and 4 litres a minute, 0.240 m3/hr for women. The average respiratory rate varies by by age: As a consequence the actual tidal respiration volume for any individual would have to be calculated. Answer: A person breathes about 100 litres (0.1 m3) of air every hour.
An average person will breathe 0.5 (liters/breath) x 15 (breaths/minute) x 35,344,512 (minutes/lifetime), which equals 265,083,840 liters/lifetime. More or less 265 million liters of air. We have calculated that we breathe about 265 million liters of air in a life time. To calculate all the breaths you take in a lifetime we have to know a couple of things. First of all we have to know the size (volume) of an average breath. Secondly we have to know how frequent we breathe (number of breaths per minute). And finally we have to decide how long you are going to live.
Respiratory minute volume (or minute ventilation or expired minute volume) is the volume of gas inhaled (inhaled minute volume) or exhaled (exhaled minute volume) from a person's lungs per minute. It is an important parameter in respiratory medicine due to its relationship with blood carbon dioxide levels. A normal minute volume while resting is about 5–8 liters per minute in humans. Minute volume generally decreases when at rest, and increases with exercise. For example, during light activities minute volume may be around 12 litres.
