2. Dosage (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg). With the drug Viibryd, most people end up “titrating” their way up to the 40 mg dose. They start at 10 mg, then after a couple weeks bump up to 20 mg, then finally make the final jump to 40 mg. 
Initial Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. The recommended dose for VIIBRYD is 40 mg once daily. VIIBRYD should be titrated, starting with an initial dose of 10 mg once daily for 7 days, followed by 20 mg once daily for an additional 7 days, and then an increase to 40 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is recommended on the basis of age (see Figure 2. Of the 2177 patients in clinical studies with VIIBRYD, 37 (1.7%) were 65 years of age or older, and 272 (12.5%) were 55 to 64 years of age.
In reply to Re: 80 mg of Viibryd, my story and what's NEW! JTDC, posted by SLS on October 24, 2011, at 8:27:59. When I was not getting enough relief on the 40 mg we slowly went up to 60 and then 80 mg. I have very difficult to treat depression. 
VIIBRYD should be titrated, starting with an initial dose of 10 mg once daily for 7 days, followed by 20 mg once daily for an additional 7 days, and then an increase to 40 mg once daily. VIIBRYD should be taken with food. During coadministration with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), the VIIBRYD dose should be reduced to 20 mg for patients with intolerable adverse events. The VIIBRYD dose should be readjusted to the original level when CYP3A4 inhibitors are discontinued [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ].
I took 20 mg of lexapro for a week with 10 mg of Viibryd. I was actually able to get up and go to work and be social! mind you i was having anxiety every morning on just lexapro and the same when i was on Cymbalta. Which is i had more side effects with Cymbalta. I’m not sure if you should drink at all on Viibryd. I was given sample packs of the Viibryd, the pack began with pills of 10mg which progressed into the 20mg, followed by the 40mgs; when starting the antidepressant they have you step up your dosage every 10 days until you hit the 40mg, except the first three 10mg pills are to be cut in half so you start at 5mg.
Reduce the VIIBRYD dose to 20 mg if co-administered with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). During coadministration with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), the VIIBRYD dose should be reduced to 20 mg for patients with intolerable adverse events. The VIIBRYD dose should be readjusted to the original level when CYP3A4 inhibitors are discontinued [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ].
The recommended dose for Viibryd is 40 mg once daily. Patients taking Viibryd will start with an initial dose of 10 mg once daily for 7 days, followed by 20 mg once daily for an additional 7 days, and then an increase to 40 mg once daily.
The usual dose of Viibryd for treating major depression is 40 mg once daily. It is recommended that people start Viibryd at 10 mg once daily for the first seven days. The dose may then be increased to 20 mg once daily for seven additional days, and then to 40 mg once daily. Your healthcare provider will monitor your symptoms and determine how long you should continue treatment with Viibryd.
Viibryd (vilazodone), with a normal dose range of 10-40 mg. per day, facilitates the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A, a mechanism of action it shares with the anxiolytic medication Buspar (busiprone) as well as the atypical antipsychotic medication Abilify (aripipraxole). 
If you are starting depression treatment with Viibryd, it is recommended to begin at a lower dosage (usually 10 mg) each day for the first seven days of treatment. The dose may then be increased to 20 mg once daily for seven additional days, and then to 40 mg once daily. Your healthcare provider will monitor your symptoms and determine how long you should continue treatment with Viibryd.
