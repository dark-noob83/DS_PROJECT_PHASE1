“The Tabernacle its construction and furnishings”, Part 7“Then he made the courtyard on its south side; the hangings (curtains) of the court were of fine woven linen, one hundred cubits long. There were twenty pillars for them, with twenty copper sockets.
Tabernacle: The Temple of Time The Tabernacle curtains are 1260 x 2 square cubits, and the paneling is 360 x 2 square cubits! (This article is my reply to an interesting letter received Dec. 30, 2002.) March 10, 2003 Greetings!
The overall dimensions of the entire construction, which included the outside linen hangings, were 100 cubits by 50 cubits (Exodus 27:9-13) with the inner tabernacle being 30 cubits long and 10 cubits wide.
This also tells us that the height of the courtyard curtains were 5 cubits or 7 1/2 feet high. The dimensions of the Tabernacle are figured out by the board sizes given to us. Exodus 26:16 says, Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board..
Prophetic Defined. Outer Court 300 cubits/ 450' perimeter or 5000 square cubit/ 11,250 square feet Width + length + height= 1500 cubits Possibly, Prophetic of Moses to Jesus--1500 years.
The tabernacle proper was made of 48 acacia wood frames, which were traditionally referred to as boards or planks, these frames were ten cubits (15ft.) long and one and a half cubits (27) wide and one cubit (18) thick. For a long time the frames were thought of as being solid boards.
Prophetic Tabernacle measurements: Outer Court 300 cubits/ 450' perimeter or 5000 square cubit/ 11,250 square feet Width + length + height= 1500 cubits Possibly, Prophetic of Moses to Jesus--1500 years.
Exodus 26:16 tells us the height of the walls in the Tabernacle, Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board.. A cubit equals 18 inches, so the height of the walls would be 15 feet.
