Schwann cells are the supporting cells of the PNS. Like oligodendrocytes schwann cells wrap themselves around nerve axons, but the difference is that a single schwann cell makes up a single segment of an axon's myelin sheath. Oligodendrocytes on the other hand, wrap themselves around numerous axons at once.
Schwann cell unit-a single Schwann cell and all of the axons lying in troughs indenting its surface. Schwann cells-cells of ectodermal (neural crest) origin that compose a continuous envelope around each nerve fiber of peripheral nerves.
Answer by California77. Confidence votes 86. Schwann cells are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS.) They have two major functions, they produce the myelin sheath which covers the schwan cell, which helps to repair and regenerate nerves that have been damaged.
The major function of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells is the formation of myelin. Myelin acts as an insulator of axonal segments and is a prerequisite for the high velocity of nerve conduction, of up to 200 m/second. The association of glial cells with axons is also found in invertebrates.
noun, plural: Schwann cells. A glial cell that wraps around the nerve fiber in the peripheral nervous system, and forms the myelin sheaths of peripheral axons. Supplement. Schwann cells form a fatty material called myelin to insulate the axons in the peripheral nervous system. This method decreases membrane capacitance in the axon, thus, allowing saltatory conduction. Non-myelinating Schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival.
Schwann cell. n. Any of the cells that cover the nerve fibers in the peripheral nervous system and form the myelin sheath. Also called neurilemma, neurilemma cell.
