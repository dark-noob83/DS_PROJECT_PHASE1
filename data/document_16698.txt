After the liver glycogen is used, the body is forced to use fat and then, much later, protein. These energy systems exist, and scientists are getting better at understanding them. However, it is hard to believe that this overall scheme is actually how energy systems really work. I have have tried to think of how this energy model would work in a fell race or orienteering event. As you set off, the muscles use up the ATP/CP supplies quickly. Then, for the next couple of minutes, the anaerobic system provides energy before running out. Finally, the aerobic system comes in and the body has to match pace with the available, reduced, energy supply
ATP-PC. This is the simplest energy system. It is the anaerobic energy system that utilizes ATP stored in the muscle to create energy. Phosphocreatine is then used to rephosphorylate ADP into ATP using creatine kinase. This newly formed ATP can then be used to create more energy
The traditional model for energy systems within running is that there are three main energy systems. These are ATP/CP (adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine); oxygen-independent glycolysis (normally referred to as anaerobic) and aerobic. This is a significant simplification.

Several energy sources or substrates are available which can be used to power the production of ATP. One of these substrates, like existing ATP, is stored inside the cell and is called creatine phosphate. Creatine Phosphate. Creatine phosphate is readily available to the cells and rapidly produces ATP. Understanding energy systems underpins the study of exercise and the effect it has on the human body. Bioenergetics... or the study of energy flow through living systems is usually one of the first chapters in any good exercise physiology text. But the current model of human energy systems is being challenged...
Since this process does not need oxygen to resynthesize ATP, it is anaerobic, or oxygen-independent. As the fastest way to resynthesize ATP, the phosphagen system is the predominant energy system used for all-out exercise lasting up to about 10 seconds. However, since there is a limited amount of stored CP and ATP in skeletal muscles, fatigue occurs rapidly. 2
Aerobic Respiration, meaning 'with oxygen' which is used for long-term, steady paced exercise and day-to-day activities and Anaerobic Respiration or 'without oxygen' which produces fast bursts of energy for short, powerful bursts. The Anaerobic system can be divided into two further systems, ATP-PC and Lactic acid. All energy systems work together, but the intensity and type of activity will determine which system is predominant. 1  Aerobic system. 2  Anaerobic system. 3  ATP-PC system. 4  Lactic Acid System.
Energy System 1: Ready fuel for immediate energy. The Immediate Energy system, or ATP-PC, is the system the body uses to generate immediate energy. The energy source, phosphocreatine (PC), is stored within the tissues of the body. When exercise is done and energy is expended, PC is used to replenish ATP. Basically, the PC functions like a reserve to help rebuild ATP in an almost instantaneous manner.
The normally accepted view is that the energy systems are used almost one after the other. The ATP/CP system turns on when the first vigorous movement occurs. There is ATP stored in the muscles, enough to last around 2-4 seconds. This creates ADP when used. I have have tried to think of how this energy model would work in a fell race or orienteering event. As you set off, the muscles use up the ATP/CP supplies quickly. Then, for the next couple of minutes, the anaerobic system provides energy before running out. Finally, the aerobic system comes in and the body has to match pace with the available, reduced, energy supply
ATP = ADP + P +Energy. The human body is also capable of resynthesising ATP to allow it to continue producing energy. To do this it must use energy to reverse the equation shown above. This is known as an endothermic reaction as it requires energy. The breakdown of ATP is called exothermic as it produces energy. The Anaerobic system can be divided into two further systems, ATP-PC and Lactic acid. All energy systems work together, but the intensity and type of activity will determine which system is predominant. 1  Aerobic system. 2  Anaerobic system. 3  ATP-PC system. 4  Lactic Acid System.
