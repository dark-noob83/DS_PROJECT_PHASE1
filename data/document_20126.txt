What size flag should is appropriate for my flagpole? The size of flag is dependant on the size of the flagpole. For porch mount flagpoles the 3 x 5 Ft flag is the most common. For in-ground flagpoles the general rule of thumb is that the height of the flag should be 1/5th the height of the flagpole. For example take a 25 ft high pole – 1/5th of the 25 ft leaves 5 ft. So that would carry a 5 x 8 ft flag. Please be aware of the size of flag that is recommended for your
Determining Flag Size. The length of the flag should be at least one quarter the height of the pole. For example, a 40-foot pole requires a 6'x10' or larger flag. This guide applies to poles 20 feet tall and larger. Most residential flags are 3'x5' or 4'x6'. Most small industrial and commercial buildings fly either a 5'x8' or 6'x10' flag. Major industrial, municipal and government buildings require 8' x 12' or larger flags. However, the size of the pole ultimately restricts the maximum allowable flag size.
Flags to use with residential flagpoles. Flag size 3’x5’ is the most popular size flag for residential display. The size is appropriate for display with a pole and mounting bracket on your home or with a ground set flagpole 18 to 20 feet tall. Some prefer a slightly smaller size, 2-1/2’x4. When one flag is displayed, the horizontal length of the flag should be approximately 1/4 to 1/3 the height of the flagpole. This guideline applies to commercially manufactured ground set flagpoles 20’ and taller. When multiple flags are displayed, the second flag is normally one size smaller than the main flag.
Furthermore, flagpoles have limits to the size of flag which can be safely flown. For instance, a flagpole of 20 feet can only fly a five by eight foot flag safely. A flag of this size will obviously not be seen as far away as a 12 by 18 foot flag which can be safely flown on a 60 foot pole.
Standard Flag and Flagpole Size Ratios. For a flagpole 15 ft high, the minimum flag size has to be 2.5 ft x 4 ft and the maximum is 4 ft x 6 ft. For a 20 ft flagpole, the minimum flag size is 3 ft x 5 ft and the maximum is 5 ft x 8 ft. The 3 ft x 5 ft and 5 ft x 8 ft flags are also suitable for 25 ft flagpole dimensions. The 30 ft flagpole should be fitted with a flag at least 4 ft x 6 ft or a maximum of 6 ft x 10 ft. For 70 ft flagpole dimensions, the minimum flag size is 10 ft x 15 ft and the maximum flag dimensions are 15 ft x 25 ft. For an 80 ft flagpole, the minimum size is 10 ft x 19 ft and the maximum is 20 ft x 30 ft.
The next consideration after choosing your flagpole design is to determine the mounting height. This can be specified solely on the required aesthetics of the particular job, or can be determined by the size of the flag wished to be flown. 
If the flagpole is 50 ft, the minimum flag size is 6 ft x 10 ft, while the maximum is 10 ft x 15 ft. For a 60 ft high flagpole, the flag has to be at least 8 ft x 12 ft and the maximum size is 12 ft x 18 ft. For 70 ft flagpole dimensions, the minimum flag size is 10 ft x 15 ft and the maximum flag dimensions are 15 ft x 25 ft. For an 80 ft flagpole, the minimum size is 10 ft x 19 ft and the maximum is 20 ft x 30 ft.
