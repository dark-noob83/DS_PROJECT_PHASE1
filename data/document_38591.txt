The lipid bilayer is important for maintaining the shape of a cell and for selective permeability. Therefore, it is vital for the survival and function of the cell. This article explains what the lipid bilayer is and how its structure contributes to cell viability.
4. Some cells that usually obtain energy from aerobic cellular respiration can use fermentation when oxygen is not available. There are bacteria and fungi that, in the absence of oxygen, use their anaerobic metabolic capability for energy supply. Muscle cells also use fermentation when oxygen is scarce.
Cellular respiration is the process in which an organism breaks down fuel (usually glucose, but glycogen, protein, and/or lipids may be used) to capture energy in a usable form (ATP). When a phosphate is passed from ATP to another molecule, that molecule gains energy; this is an endergonic (energy storage) reaction. Likewise, when that phosphate is removed, both energy and heat are given off (an exergonic reaction), and the molecule contains less energy than before.
1 It determines what enters and leaves the cell. 2  The cell membrane is composed of a double layer of lipid molecules in which proteins float. 3  The proteins function as membrane channels, carrier molecules, receptor molecules, enzymes, and structural components of the membrane.
most cells convert the chemical energy of carbohydrates to the chemical energy of ATP by aerobic respiration or fermentation. Aerobic respiration and fermentation pathways start in cytoplasm, with glycolysis. Fermentation is anaerobic and ends in cytoplasm.
(C) produce biologically useful energy in the form of ATP. (D) produce molecules that can be used in the electron transport system. (E) create larger complex molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids C ATP is the “energy currency” of cells. The primary function of cellular respiration is to produce ATP.
