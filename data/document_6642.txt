2. snot-nasal mucus. mucous secretion, mucus-protective secretion of the mucus membranes; in the gut it lubricates the passage of food and protects the epithelial cells; in the nose and throat and lungs it can make it difficult for bacteria to penetrate the body through the epithelium. Translations.
Simply put, snot is mucus that is produced by a special membrane in the nose. The purpose of snot is to trap dust particles, germs and pollen that are inhaled and to prevent them from getting into the lungs. When the inhaled particle and the surrounding mucus that surrounds it dry and solidify, you get what most people call bogeys (or boogers in the USA).
When you have cold you have snot why well the reason for that is because when you breath in the air sometimes the air contains bad germs but your hairs in your nose traps it b … ut sometimes the germs can go in you respiratory system. The germs start growing in your nose, throat and lungs.
Snot is the slang term of nasal mucus. Mucus is the slippery secretion that is produced by nasal mucous membranes. These secretions typically contain water, glycoproteins, some inorganic salt, and antibodies or immunoglobulins that try to stop germs by killing them.
When a person is exposed to germs, pollen, or dust for example, snot is actually produced by the nasal mucous membranes as a form of defense mechanism against possible illness or disease.
But aside from the nose, mucus is also produced in other parts of the body particularly in “mucus membranes” located in the intestines, the stomach, and the eyes among various other parts. Much of the function of mucus in various parts of the body is to ward off infectious organisms like bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
