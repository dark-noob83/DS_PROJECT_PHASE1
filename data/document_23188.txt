The average life expectancy of a new washing machine is 11 years. Consumer Reports recommends replacing any appliance that's more than eight years old, unless it's a high-end model and has a particular appeal to you. Others suggest replacing any top-loading washer manufactured in 1999 or earlier.

Each load is considered one cycle, so for a washer to last 14 years, it must be able to handle about 5,100 cycles. Of course, machines that cost less may only be rated at 4,000 cycles, while high-end machines may be rated at 8,000 cycles or higher. If possible, always check the cycle rating before you buy.
