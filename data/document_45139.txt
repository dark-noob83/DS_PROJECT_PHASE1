How much total … energy a 60 watt light bulb consumes, which is the amount of electricity that has to be paid-for, is measured in watt•hours (that's watts times hours). So a 60 watt bulb consumes 60 watt•hours in one hour, or 60 Wh x 24 hr/day = 1440 Wh per day. That is the same as 1.44 kilowatt•hours (kWh), so, if you look up what your electricity supplier charges for 1 kWh you can figure out how much it would cost you in money. There is no such thing as a 'watt per day'. A watt is an instantaneous measurement of the rate at which you are using energy. To find the 'wattage' of a standard tumble dryer, check its nameplate data.
Understanding Wattage. Wattage refers to electrical power, or the flow of electricity that goes through a circuit. In other words, watts measures how much electrical energy is traveling through a circuit per second. You can also understand wattage, or power, in terms of joules (a unit of energy) per second. 
No appliance that you can plug into a domestic wall socket will exceed 3100 watts as that is the limit. Your tumble dryer will probably be in the region of 2500 to 3000 watts as already stated. The guy who said 4000 to 5000 is off his trolley. Bazza · 6 years ago. 
Clothes dryers use quite a bit energy because they need to spin and produce heat. The energy use of a dryer varies between 1800 watts and 5000 watts, a typical dryer will use around 3000 watts. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a clothes dryer using 3000 Watts for 0.25 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh. This is the same as running the dryer twice for 52.5 minutes a week. Cost Per Hour:
This means that it costs about $0.70 every morning to run your dryer for an hour. One month would run your electric bill up $21. Of course there are alternatives to dryers, but they aren’t as convenient. For example, a good drying rack can be picked up at many local retailers for between $25 and $50. A drying rack is one alternative. The dryer is one of the higher users of electricity in a home. It can consume up to about 5,000 watts, but let’s say it uses only about 3,500 watts on “medium.”. 1  3,500 watts / 1,000 watts = 3.5 kilowatts (3 kW). 2  3.5 kW X 1 hour = 3.5 kWh. 3  One kWh costs about $0.20. 4  $0.20 X 3.5 kW = $0.7
The combination of power that is needed and the length of time that it is needed results in an energy usage, in watt-hours or kilowatt-hours. For example, a cellular telephone charger has a power rating of 10 watts. If you charge your phone for 1 hour, that charger has used 10 watt-hours. 
Electricity Usage. The amount of energy used by each appliance depends on how much power it draws when in operation and how much of the time it is used. The power usage is measured in watts and kilowatts (a kilowatt =1000 watts), and the amount of energy that it consumes in watt-hours or kilowatt hours (kWh). A single bar electric fire often uses electricity at the rate of one kilowatt (kW) per hour. So, in an hour an electric fire will use one kilowatt hour (kWh)
A watt is a unit of energy per second. A typical handheld hair dryer uses about 300 to 1800 watts. If you use an 1800-watt dryer for an hour, you will have used 1800 watt-hour … s, or 1.8 kilowatt-hours. There is no such thing as a 'watt per day'. A watt is an instantaneous measurement of the rate at which you are using energy. To find the 'wattage' of a standard tumble dryer, check its nameplate data.
