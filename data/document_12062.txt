The formula that I have found to be most accurate is: edible meat will equal very close to 1/3 of the field dressed weight of the animal. If your average deer field dresses at 120 lbs, expect right around 40 lbs of boned meat from that animal. I agree with CIH that only you can say how long that 40 lbs of meat will last.
How much venison is on an average deer? An average field-dressed deer carcass is about 60 percent usable cuts of meat and about 40 percent head, hooves and hide. The smaller the deer, the smaller the percentage of meat. The average deer taken by a Missouri hunter weighs about 110 pounds field dressed (live weight about 145 pounds). Deer this size yield 60 to 70 pounds of meat. 
1 The price of venison can range anywhere from $5 to $90 per pound if purchased from a local butcher or game farm. 2  The factors that affect the difference in the price of venison also include the part of the body from which the meat was taken. The price of venison differs depending on the store where it was purchased. Since venison comes from different animals, the price can be also different depending on which animal was killed to get the meat. 1 
1 Each part of the deer that they sell will include the bones, and they are sold for anywhere from $5 to $36 per pound depending on the type of meat. 2  This company requires a minimum order of $75. 3  Venison can be made into different types of processed meat such as salami. The price of venison differs depending on the store where it was purchased. Since venison comes from different animals, the price can be also different depending on which animal was killed to get the meat. 1  The price of venison can range anywhere from $5 to $90 per pound if purchased from a local butcher or game farm.
Field dressed is defined as removing the viscera and feet. A field dressing mule deer weighs 70.4% of live weight on average. Field dressed bucks average between 102 – 207 lbs and the boneless meat weighs 49 – 99 lbs. You can see in the table that does are considerably lighter than bucks and range between 85 – 130 lbs field dressed
1 On average, processing the deer itself is going to cost anywhere from $65 to $165. 2  This will not include processing it into premium cuts such as a hamburger, jerky, etc. 1 Lunch meat such as Bologna can cost $0.95 to $2 per pound. 2  For example, Edgeley Meat located in Edgeley, North Dakota, charges $79 for the skinning, boning, cutting and wrapping, as well as $1.49 a pound for fry sausage and $1.59 a pound for smoked sausage.
you can expect about half the live weignt of deer in edible meat. So if you get a deer that weighs 200 pounds alive, you will loose about 100 pounds in guts, hide, bones, head, and other inedible parts. What you will put in the freezer will be about 100 pounds of meat. This is not a hard and fast rule, just a pretty good estimate. If your average deer field dresses at 120 lbs, expect right around 40 lbs of boned meat from that animal. I agree with CIH that only you can say how long that 40 lbs of meat will last.
Let's say a hunter kills a mature buck, and it weighs 165 pounds field-dressed. Using the above equation, we estimate its carcass will weigh 124 pounds, and it will ideally yield 83.08 pounds of boneless meat. The deer's realistic meat yield is about 58.15 pounds. Because waste can vary between deer, we suggest using the realistic figure as a gauge. In the above example, the buck's realistic meat yield would range form 58 to 68 pounds
You likely won't see big differences in meat yields until you can compare a mature buck with the rest of the meat-pole crowd. The typical Northern fawn, which includes button bucks, weighs about 55 to 75 pounds field dressed, while a healthy doe fawn weighs 45 to 65 pounds field dressed. Using the above equation, we estimate its carcass will weigh 124 pounds, and it will ideally yield 83.08 pounds of boneless meat. The deer's realistic meat yield is about 58.15 pounds.
1 Exotic Meat Market sells this type of meat as well as venison sausages and regular meat of varying types. 2  They sell venison salami for anywhere from $30 to $150 depending on how much the product weighs. 3  Regular cuts such as venison tenderloin is sold for anywhere from $80 to $90 with an average weight of 2 lbs. The price of venison differs depending on the store where it was purchased.
