A map of early human migrations. Homo sapiens seem to have appeared in East Africa around 200,000 years ago. The oldest individuals found left their marks in the Omo remains (195,000 years ago) and the Homo sapiens idaltu (160,000 years ago), that was found at the Middle Awash site in Ethiopia. The expansion of modern human population is thought to have begun 45,000 years ago, and may have taken 15,000-20,000 years for Europe to be colonized. During this time the Neanderthals were slowly being displaced.
Modern Man (Homo sapiens sapiens) arrived relatively recently in Europe (~40,000 years ago) compared to colonization that occurred in South East Asia and Australia which date back more than 55,000 years ago. So when modern humans decided to look west rather than east while pondering their future in a cold Central Asia they would have found Europe already occupied by Homo neanderthalensis, who had separated from the main evolutionary line some 500
Early human migrations and expansions of archaic and modern humans across continents began 2 million years ago with the migration out of Africa of Homo erectus. This was followed by the migrations of other pre-modern humans including H. heidelbergensis, the likely ancestor of both modern humans and Neanderthals. The expansion of modern human population is thought to have begun 45,000 years ago, and may have taken 15,000-20,000 years for Europe to be colonized. During this time the Neanderthals were slowly being displaced.
Modern Human beings evolved in Africa from a variety of hominid species over a few million years. The first humans to leave the African continent were Homo erectus (upright man), who migrated northeast about 2 million years ago when present day deserts were grassland. So when modern humans decided to look west rather than east while pondering their future in a cold Central Asia they would have found Europe already occupied by Homo neanderthalensis, who had separated from the main evolutionary line some 500,000 years ago.
A+E Networks. The Black Death arrived in Europe by sea in October 1347 when 12 Genoese trading ships docked at the Sicilian port of Messina after a long journey through the Black Sea. 
View. comments. The first modern humans to arrive in Europe and Asia migrated north out of Egypt around 55,000 years ago, according to new genetic research. The study has answered a long standing question about the route early Homo sapiens took when spreading from the African continent. 1 Scientists have proposed two routes for how Homo sapiens spread out of Africa between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago-through Egypt or Ethiopia. 2  The researchers found people living in Europe and Asia are more closely related to those living in Egypt than they are to those from Ethiopia.
These findings might give some support to the claim that modern humans from Africa arrived at southern China about 100,000 years BP (Zhiren Cave, Zhirendong, Chongzuo City: 100,000 years BP; and the Liujiang hominid (Liujiang County): controversially dated at 139,000â€“111,000 years BP). The expansion of modern human population is thought to have begun 45,000 years ago, and may have taken 15,000-20,000 years for Europe to be colonized. During this time the Neanderthals were slowly being displaced.
From the Near East, some of these people went east to South Asia by 50,000 years ago, and on to Australia by 46,000 years ago at the latest, when for the first time H. sapiens reached territory never reached by H. erectus. The expansion of modern human population is thought to have begun 45,000 years ago, and may have taken 15,000-20,000 years for Europe to be colonized. During this time the Neanderthals were slowly being displaced.
Modern humans and Neandertals existed side-by-side in Europe for example for perhaps 15,000 years before the earlier species became extinct. Our modern ancestors probably first left Africa about 100,000 years ago when water levels were low enough to allow easy passage across the mouth of the Red Sea. So when modern humans decided to look west rather than east while pondering their future in a cold Central Asia they would have found Europe already occupied by Homo neanderthalensis, who had separated from the main evolutionary line some 500,000 years ago.
All people today are classified as Homo sapiens. Our species of humans first began to evolve nearly 200,000 years ago in association with technologies not unlike those of the early Neandertals. It is now clear that early Homo sapiens, or modern humans, did not come after the Neandertals but were their contemporaries. The first fossils of early modern humans to be identified were found in 1868 at the 27,000-23,000 year old Cro-Magnon rock shelter site near the village of Les Eyzies in southwestern France. They were subsequently named the Cro-Magnon people. They were very similar in appearance to modern Europeans.
