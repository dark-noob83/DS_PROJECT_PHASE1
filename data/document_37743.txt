1 People with typhoid fever carry the Salmonella Typhi bacteria in their blood and intestines and shed the bacteria in their faeces. 2  For individuals travelling to a country where typhoid is common, a vaccination is recommended. Salmonella Typhimurium. 1  Salmonella Typhimurium can cause infections in humans and animals. 2  It is often associated with animals and animal products that are eaten. 3  Salmonella Typhimurium can be transferred to humans through raw or undercooked infected food including meat and eggs.
There are two species of Salmonella, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica is further divided into six subspecies and over 2500 serovars. Salmonellae are found worldwide in both cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals, and in the environment. Salmonella can be found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, especially reptiles. Salmonella on the skin of reptiles or amphibians can be passed to people who handle the animals. Food and water can also be contaminated with the bacteria if it comes in contact with the feces of infected people or animals.
There are many different kinds of Salmonella bacteria. Salmonella serotype Typhimurium [PDF - 15 pages] and Salmonella serotype Enteritidis [PDF - 15 pages] are the most common in the United States. Salmonella infections are more common in the summer than winter. Learn more about Salmonella serotypes
Salmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) is a rod-shaped, flagellated, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the genus Salmonella. A number of its serovars are serious human pathogens. Most of the human pathogenic Salmonella serovars belong to the S. enterica subsp. enterica subspecies. These serogroups include Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Paratyphi, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Choleraesuis.
Salmonella was discovered in 1884 by American scientist, Dr. Daniel Salmon. Salmonella enterica are rod shaped (baccillus) bacteria. They are commonly found in raw meat, chicken, contaminated water, and even egg shells. Upon entering the host such as an animal, it stays in its intestinal tract. Three variasions of Salmonella enterica are Typhi, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium. 
Salmonella is a bacteria that makes people sick. It was discovered by an American scientist named Dr. Salmon, and has been known to cause illness for over 125 years. Most people infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps between 12 and 72 hours after infection. Salmonella serotype Typhimurium [PDF - 15 pages] and Salmonella serotype Enteritidis [PDF - 15 pages] are the most common in the United States. Salmonella infections are more common in the summer than winter.
Salmonella Typhimurium. Salmonella typhimurium is a gram negative bacteria. Commonly associated with disease, it is an organism that primarily is found in the intestinal tract. Since it requires a lower pH and a warm temperature to thrive, it will remain dormant in nature and only can reproduce inside of a host. The Salmonella bacteria have a lipopolysaccharide membrane which is a protective measure against the environment. Inside the membrane, there is a substance called Lipid A which is a toxin in some circumstances. Animals have an enzyme in their intestines which breaks down the Lipid A and makes it harmless to them.

1 When the poultry are slaughtered for their meat, the Salmonella bacteria are transferred from their gut to the meat, and can also be passed from the bird’s ovaries to their eggs. 2  Salmonella Typhimurium causes gastroenteritis (inflammation of the gut) leading to diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal cramps. Salmonella Typhimurium. 1  Salmonella Typhimurium can cause infections in humans and animals. 2  It is often associated with animals and animal products that are eaten. 3  Salmonella Typhimurium can be transferred to humans through raw or undercooked infected food including meat and eggs.
Typhoid fever is an illness caused by Salmonella Typhi bacteria. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and/or intestinal tract.
