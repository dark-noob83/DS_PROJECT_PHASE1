1 If there is not a back seat in the vehicle (e.g., a truck) or if other restrained children are in the back seat, Georgia law permits a child under the age of 8 to sit in front if restrained in the proper car seat or booster and the child weighs at least 40 pounds.
Car seats were invented in 1962 but became mandatory years later. The specific date is difficult to pin down but the general consensus is that the law was passed in the 1970s … .
Tennessee was the first state to make car seats mandatory in 1978, by 1988 the rest of the states had adopted it.
Car seats also have gone through quite a makeover in 25 years. In the 1970s, when federal safety standards were first set for car seats, the only requirements were that car seats had to be seatbelted in the car and the child harnessed in the seat; no crash testing was included in certification.
It was 25 years ago (the 1990 model year) when shoulder belts became required in the rear passenger seats of new cars, which provided much better safety for older children who were suffering from “seatbelt syndrome” as a result of being restrained in a lap belt alone.
Mandatory Seatbelts   According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, in July 1984, New York State passed the first mandatory seatbelt law in the nation, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and New Mexico.
The first U.S. patent for a safety belt was issued in 1885, but they were considered optional items by manufacturers until 1963, when front seat lap belts were mandated. Most drivers in that era used rope or aircraft harnesses to hold themselves in place while racing.
