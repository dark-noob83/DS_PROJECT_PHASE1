Dutch Warmblood. OVERVIEW. The Dutch Warmblood is a cross between two indigenous Dutch breeds: the Gelderlander and the Groningen. Developed and promoted as one of Europe's greatest post war competition breeds, the Dutch Warmblood has indeed proven itself in competition.
Breeds of Livestock-Dutch Warmblood Horse. The Dutch Warmblood is a warmblood sport horse breed. Warmblood simply distinguishes this type of horse from the cold bloods (draft horses) and the hot bloods (Thoroughbreds and Arabs).
Let's begin by discussing what is not a Warmblood. A Warmblood is not a cross of a coldblood, i.e., a draft, on a hotblood. The usual cross in the United States is a Percheron or a Shire or a Belgian or a Clydesdale on a Thoroughbred or an Arabian or a Saddlebred.
A good definition of a warmblood might be: A Warmblood is a horse with at least 5 generations of recognized sport horse bloodlines and that has been inspected and registered by world-recognized breeding associations to excel in the sports of dressage and/or show jumping.
This is a tough one, because the term has begun to be loosely tossed around in North America. I can tell you for sure that a warmblood is NOT a cross between a hot blood and a cold blood. Don t let anyone tell you different. There are only two types of hot-blooded horses in the world. These are the Thoroughbred and the Arabian. Draft horses are considered cold-blooded. Many people in the United States have been lead to believe that if you cross any hot-blooded horse and any cold-blooded horse, you get a warmblood.
Typically a TB x Draft cross breed is considered only as a Draft crossbred. However, there is now an American Warmblood Registry. The horse has to be approved by a Registry Inspector with an in-hand exhibition and is quite expensive to have done.
