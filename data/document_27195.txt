The Preamble to the Constitution is an introductory, succinct statement of the principles at work in the full text.
Empowered with the sovereign authority of the people by the framers and the consent of the legislatures of the states, it is the source of all government powers, and also provides important limitations on the government that protect the fundamental rights of United States citizens.
Before We Begin: 'Preamble' Defined. Let's start with a bit of preamble to this term's definition. Before its Latin root was devised, ancient authors often used the Greek prologos (prologue) to describe introductory material, especially in writing comedies.
Ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America: This last phrase of the Preamble is a powerful statement saying that the people made this document, and the people give the country its power.
The Preamble is the opening statement to the United States Constitution. The preamble explains the reasons why the Framers of the Constitution made our government a republic. By doing this, the founding fathers replaced the Articles of Confederation.
