The incremental annual cost of the intervention was $54,839, equivalent to $217.62 per HIV-1 infection averted and $10.33 per DALY saved (based on Tanzanian life expectancy) or $9.45 per DALY saved (based on the assumptions of the World Development Report). The HIV seroconversion rate was 1.16% in the intervention communities and 1.86% in the comparison communities--a difference in HIV incidence of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.09) and a reduction of about 40%. The total annual cost of the intervention was US$59,060 ($0.39 per person served).
The average annual per patient cost of HIV treatment and care in the US was $19,912, investigators report in the online edition of AIDS. The analysis was based on 2006 figures. Costs were highest for those with a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mm 3. This was due to the high cost of inpatient care. Antiretroviral therapy cost an average of $9360 per year for each patient with a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mm 3. This compared to average annual costs of between $11,800 and $12,313 for those with higher CD4 cell counts. Antiretroviral therapy was most expensive for those with the highest
Nov. 2, 2006 - People with HIV can get 24 extra years of life from modern treatments -- at a total cost of $618,900 in 2004 dollars. That finding comes from a Cornell/Johns Hopkins/Harvard/Boston University research team that analyzed the costs and benefits of modern HIV treatment. 
Theestimated total annual cost (in billion Rupees) of HIV:AIDS in India under low, mediumand high assumptions was 6.73, 20.16 and 59.19, respectively. Cost of treatment of AIDSand loss in productivity were the two major components of the cost. A discount rate of 5% was used. The cost of HIV infections include (i) loss ofproductivity among HIV patients due to sickness and death, (ii) productivity loss due tocaregivers of AIDS patients, and (iii) cost of management of AIDS patients.
The cost of STD treatment was $10.15 per case. An estimated 252 HIV-1 infections were averted each year. The incremental annual cost of the program was $54,839, equivalent to $217.62 per HIV infection averted and $10.33 per disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) saved. The HIV seroconversion rate was 1.16% in the intervention communities and 1.86% in the comparison communities--a difference in HIV incidence of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.09) and a reduction of about 40%. The total annual cost of the intervention was US$59,060 ($0.39 per person served).
Total annual per patient cost for an individual with a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mm 3 averaged $40,678. This compared to $16,614 for those with a CD4 cell count above 500 cells/mm 3. Antiretroviral therapy cost an average of $9360 per year for each patient with a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mm 3. This compared to average annual costs of between $11,800 and $12,313 for those with higher CD4 cell counts. Antiretroviral therapy was most expensive for those with the highest CD4 cell counts.
An estimated 252 HIV-1 infections were averted each year. The total annual cost of the intervention was US$59,060 (1993 prices), equivalent to $0.39 per head of population served. The cost for STD case treated was $10.15, of which the drug cost was $2.11. The HIV seroconversion rate was 1.16% in the intervention communities and 1.86% in the comparison communities--a difference in HIV incidence of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.09) and a reduction of about 40%. The total annual cost of the intervention was US$59,060 ($0.39 per person served).
Though the number of new infections per year in Chicago is down approximately 40% from 2000-2009, the number of people living with HIV is increasing. People are living longer as a result of more effective treatments, causing the number of deaths from HIV/AIDS each year to be lower than the number of new infections. Demographics. 1  As of 2012, there were an estimated 34,375 people diagnosed with HIV. 2  An additional 6,051 people were living with HIV but unaware of their status. 3  An estimated total of 40,729 people are living with HIV in Illinois (including the undiagnosed).
Cost effectiveness. 1  Estimated lifetime cost of treatment for one person with HIV is $379,668 (in 2010 dollars). 2  Estimated average annual cost for HIV treatment is $23,000 (in 2010 dollars).
