The answer is returned as a number of kilometers per liter, Imperial gallon or US gallon, liters or gallons per 100 kilometers, kilometers since your last fill, based on your entries, and optionally, the direct fuel expense per kilometer and your approximate cost for the current fill.
STEP 4: Divide the number of litres it took to fill the tank by the distance travelled and multiply this value by 100. The result is the vehicle’s fuel consumption for that driving period. Example: 56 litres ÷ 800km = 0.07. 0.07 x 100 = 7.0 litres (ℓ) per 100 km. Therefore, the fuel consumption for that driving period would be 7ℓ/100km What is your vehicle costing you to run?
Multiply the total amount of fuel per month you burn by the cost of a gallon or liter of gasoline to get your monthly fuel costs. If gas costs $4 per gallon ($1.05 per liter), you spend $128 per month on fuel, or 17 cents per mile (10 cents per km). Ad.
Operating Costs for New & Used Vehicles. Operating costs are variable, depending on how much you drive, the type of driving, and of course the price of fuel. The average Canadian drives 20,000 km a year. The information below is pre-populated but to get a more accurate result, enter your own best estimates.
On your next fill-up divide the cost ofyour fill-up by the distance you have driven. This is your gas cost per kilometre. Forexample, if it costs you $50.00 to refuel and you drove 500 kilometres since yourlast fill-up, your gas cost per kilometre is 10 cents.
2. Divide vehicle operation costs, $293.83 per month in our hypothetical scenario, by the distance you drive per month, 750 miles (1,207 km) in our example, to calculate the cost per mile. The cost per mile for this hypothetical driver and vehicle is 39.17 cents per mile or 24 cents per kilometer.
