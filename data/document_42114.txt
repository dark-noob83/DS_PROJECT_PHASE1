DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms.
DNA is often said to have a sugar and phosphate backbone.. Each rung of the ladder is made of two nitrogenous bases linked together in the middle. The length of a DNA molecule is often measured in base pairs, or bpthat is, the number of rungs in the ladder.
DNA contains monomers called nucleotides, which is made up of a phosphate group, a deoxyribose sugar, … and a nitrogenous base. These nucleotides connect together to form the double-stranded structure, called the double helix. The double helix structure was founded by Watson & Cricke. 4 people found this useful.
