These foods ferment as they spoil, so check for off flavor. Since thawed fruits suffer in appearance, flavor and texture from refreezing, you may want to make them into jam instead. You can cook and eat thawed but still cold food mixtures like casseroles, pot pies, frozen dinners, or pizzas but do not refreeze them. Do not refreeze ice cream and similar frozen desserts. You can safely refreeze breads, cookies and similar bakery items.
Thawing and refreezing impacts the yeast and the ability for the dough to rise. I would take it out, thaw it, and use it as something else. If you are using one half for making bread, use the other half to make cinnamon rolls.
Yes, place bread in the freezer in the original package. When ready to thaw remove and allow to thaw naturally. I suggest placing in a cool dry place (not in the refrigerator). I do this frequently with bread.
Refreezing food is not dangerous, the danger is that food can spoil before it’s refrozen or after it‘s thawed again before being cooked and eaten. Freezing food does not kill bacteria, so once thawed bacteria continues to multiple at the same exponential rate it was multiplying at before being frozen.
Occasionally, frozen foods are partially or completely thawed because of delays in getting them into the freezer, a power outage, or a change of plans for cooking the food. The basis for safety in refreezing foods is the temperature at which you held thawed foods, and how long you held them after thawing.
Once food is thawed in the refrigerator, it is safe to refreeze it without cooking, although there may be a loss of quality due to the moisture lost through thawing. After cooking raw foods which were previously frozen, it is safe to freeze the cooked foods. If previously cooked foods are thawed in the refrigerator, you may refreeze the unused portion. Freeze leftovers within 3-4 days.
