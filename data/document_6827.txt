In contrast, fibers from natural sources are provided by nature in ready-made form. Natural fibers include the protein fibers such as wool and silk, the cellulose fibers such as cotton and linen, and the mineral fiber asbestos. Plant fibers can be further on classified as: 1  Fibre occurring on the seed (raw cotton, java cotton). 2  Phloem fiber (flax, ramie, hemp, jute). 
A cellulose molecule may be from several hundred to over 10,000 glucose units long. Cellulose is similar in form to complex carbohydrates like starch and glycogen. These polysaccharides are also made from multiple subunits of glucose. The difference between cellulose and other complex carbohydrate molecules is how the glucose molecules are linked together. In addition, cellulose is a straight chain polymer, and each cellulose molecule is long and rod-like.
Cel-Pak Class 1 Cellulose Insulation-SPECIFICATIONS-National Fiber's Cel-Pak is a high quality, cellulose insulation for dense pack wall and ceiling applications. It is also installed as loose fill in flat attic areas in new construction and retrofit. Cel-Pak is a premium, all-borate cellulose insulation. It is made almost exclusively from over-issue news, which is the highest quality newsprint available. Our paper provides the best quality and fiber length for superior insulation.
Some animals, particularly ruminants and termites, can digest cellulose with the help of symbiotic micro-organisms that live in their guts, such as Trichonympha. In humans, cellulose acts as a hydrophilic bulking agent for feces and is often referred to as a  dietary fiber . Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth.
Cellulose is an organic compound with the formula (C 6H 10O 5) n, a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of β(1→4) linked D-glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The cellulose content of cotton fiber is 90%, that of wood is 40–50% and that of dried hemp is approximately 45%. Cellulose is mainly used to produce paperboard and paper
Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic string used as a component of composite materials, or, when matted into sheets, used to make products such as paper, papyrus, or felt. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. Natural fibers include those produced by plants, animals, and geological processes and can be classified according to their origin: 1  Vegetable fibers are generally based on arrangements of cellulose, often with lignin: examples include cotton, hemp, jute, flax, ramie, sisal, bagasse, and banana.
Processed grains lose much of their fiber content. Fiber can be either soluble or insoluble. The form of cellulose used in foods is soluble fiber. It is important to eat other food sources containing insoluble fiber, such as wheat bran, vegetables and whole grain, to gain the maximum contribution of fiber to health. Adult males should consume at least 38 grams of fiber daily; adult women should consume at least 25 grams. If you are over 50, you may require less fiber in your diet. Chances are, you do not consume this much fiber on a daily basis. Cellulose is added to foods, in part, to aid in increasing your fiber intake.
The natural cellulosic fibres include cotton, flax, hemp, jute, and ramie. Cellulose is a polymeric sugar polysaccharide) made up of repeating 1,4-8-an hydro glucose units connected to each other by 8-ether linkages. The natural cellulosic fibers include cotton, flax, hemp, jute, and ramie. The major man-made cellulosic fiber is rayon, a fiber produced by regeneration of dissolved forms of cellulose.
Cellulose is a fibrous material of plant Origin and the basis of all natural and man-made cellulosic fibers. The natural cellulosic fibers include cotton, flax, hemp, jute, and ramie. The major man-made cellulosic fiber is rayon, a fiber produced by regeneration of dissolved forms of cellulose.
The main applications of cellulose fibers are in textile industry, as chemical filter, and fiber-reinforcement composite, due to their similar properties to engineered fibers, being another option for biocomposites and polymer composites. The difference between cellulose and other complex carbohydrate molecules is how the glucose molecules are linked together. In addition, cellulose is a straight chain polymer, and each cellulose molecule is long and rod-like.
