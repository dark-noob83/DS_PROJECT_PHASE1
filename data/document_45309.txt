In the current mortgage market you’ll need a deposit of at least 5% of a property’s value to get a mortgage. A lender would then lend you 95% of the property’s value. So, if you wanted to buy a £150,000 property you would need to save up at least £7,500 and borrow £142,500.
For Interest only mortgages you can only borrow up to a maximum of 75% of the property's value and the maximum term for an interest only mortgage is 25 years.
Pumping more of your savings into your mortgage can get you a better rate. Mortgage and remortgage rates are priced in LTV bands-and the bigger deposit/equity you have, the lower the interest rate will be. Mortgage lenders have different prices for loan-to-value bands at 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%. The impact of a lower LTV can save you a huge amount of cash (see table).
You can take out an interest only mortgage for up to 25 years and a capital repayment mortgage for up to 30 years. This is also subject to our maximum age policy, which is 65 for an interest only mortgage and 75 for capital repayment. Please enter how long you want to pay the mortgage over.
The size of your mortgage deposit will make a real difference to the best mortgage deal you can find, and even whether you can get a mortgage at all. We explain how much deposit you need to save, and how to get the best mortgage for you.
The cheapest mortgage deals on the market will typically require you to have a 40% deposit or more, so on a £150,000 property this would mean a deposit of £60,000. However, saving up a 40% deposit is unrealistic for many people.
When you apply for a mortgage, lenders calculate how much they ll lend based on both your income and your outgoings so the more you re committed to spend each month, the less you can borrow. This calculator provides useful guidance, but it should be seen as giving a rule-of-thumb result only.
If you earn £40,000 and your partner earns £30,000, for example, the range given is between £210,000 and £297,500. Whether you can borrow just £210,000 or as much as £297,500 will depend on a number of factors, including the lender you apply to and whether you have other debts, such as a car loan.
Our mortgage calculator is an easy way to get an estimate of how much you could borrow and how much your monthly payment could be based on our current product range, which can change at any time. It is for illustrative purposes only and is not a mortgage offer.
