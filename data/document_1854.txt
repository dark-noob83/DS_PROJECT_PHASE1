cost per unit of output while there is no available average cost of a wind turbine there is at least for large turbines an average cost per megawatt in 2015 it was about $ 2 million per megawatt the seatitan 10mw therefore although not priced at the time could cost in the neighborhood of $ 20 million only very large industrial wind turbines have megawatt costs that approach $ 100 they cost far more than an individual homeowner could likely afford even if there were someplace to put such a large and noisy unit industrial wind turbines can be heard more than a mile away from their sources
note to illustrate the eia understatement of transmission cost if the us investment in transmission were $ 7000 million in 2007 without having to integrate wind and solar energy then $ 8902 $ 7000 $ 1902 was invested to integrate wind and solar energy almost all for wind energy various big wind promoters maintain the cost of wind energy is competitive with other sources of energy as shown below this is hardly the case they often point to power purchase agreements ppas between wind turbine owners and utilities to sell at 5 to 6 c kwh as proof of market price parity
this is a per megawatt cost of about $ 3 million to $ 8 million at the bottom end of the price scale the aleko wg450a wind turbine generator with a 450 watt 24 volt capacity was selling for $ 402 in 2015 micro turbines are largely for hobby purposes only very large industrial wind turbines have megawatt costs that approach $ 100 they cost far more than an individual homeowner could likely afford even if there were someplace to put such a large and noisy unit industrial wind turbines can be heard more than a mile away from their sources
home or farm scale wind turbines wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $ 3000 to $ 8000 per kilowatt of capacity a 10 kilowatt machine the size needed to power a large home might have an installed cost of $ 50000 $ 80000 or more wind turbines have significant economies of scale smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project
total costs for installing a commercial scale wind turbine will vary significantly depending on the number of turbines ordered cost of financing when the turbine purchase agreement was executed construction contracts the location of the project and other factors wind turbines have significant economies of scale smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project
us installed wind turbine capacity was 11575 mw at end 2006 and 16907 mw at end 2007 for an increase of 5332 mw at a capital cost of about $ 9598 million i e the transmission cost adder is about 1902 9598 19 8 % various big wind promoters maintain the cost of wind energy is competitive with other sources of energy as shown below this is hardly the case they often point to power purchase agreements ppas between wind turbine owners and utilities to sell at 5 to 6 c kwh as proof of market price parity
a general rule of thumb as of early 2013 is that commercial scale wind projects cost from $ 1 2 to $ 2 2 million per mw of nameplate capacity installed in moderately windy areas such as much of the midwest look for a wind project to deliver energy for 6 cents or less per kwh 
the costs for a utility scale wind turbine range from about $ 1 3 million to $ 2 2 million per mw of nameplate capacity installed most of the commercial scale turbines installed today are 2 mw in size and cost roughly $ 3 $ 4 million installed wind turbines have significant economies of scale smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy producing capacity oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project
assuming a realistic 20 year life of a wind turbine increases the levelized cost to $ 93 mwh the eia uses 30 years the nrel uses 20 years no wind turbine manufacturer claims 30 years various big wind promoters maintain the cost of wind energy is competitive with other sources of energy as shown below this is hardly the case they often point to power purchase agreements ppas between wind turbine owners and utilities to sell at 5 to 6 c kwh as proof of market price parity
depending on which factors are included estimates for the cost of wind power vary wildly lazard claims the cost of wind power ranges from $ 37 to $ 81 per megawatt hour while michael giberson at the center for energy commerce at texas tech university suggests it s closer to $ 149 all estimates for wind power include the cost of purchasing capital and paying for operations and maintenance o m of wind turbines for the studies we examined capital costs ranged from $ 48 to $ 88 per megawatt hour while o m costs ranged from $ 9 8 to $ 2
