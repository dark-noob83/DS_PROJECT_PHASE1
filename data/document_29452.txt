Structure. The ribosome is made up of two parts, called subunits. The larger of the two subunits is where the amino acids get added to the growing protein chain. The small subunit is where the mRNA binds and is decoded. Each of the subunits is made up of both protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) components.
Ribosomes from different types of cells have the same basic structure but vary in size. Thus, all ribosomes are composed of two subunits. Each subunit contains a characteristic set of rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and ribosomal proteins. In the case of the eukaryotic ribosome, the two subunits are called the 40S (Svedberg unit) and the 60S subunits.
1 In eukaryotes the ribosome, an 80S ribosome, is made of a 40S small subunit + a 60S large subunit. 2  In prokaryotes the ribosome is 70S and made of a 50S large subunit + a 30S small subunit. 3  Eukaryotic chloroplasts and mitochondria contain prokaryote-like 70S ribosomes.
It consists of two subunits denoted 30S (small subunit) and 50S (large). When joined, the ribosome has a sedimentation coefficient of 70S as opposed to 80S due to tertiary structure. The subunits' shape and arrangement are illustrated below.
Figure 2: Large (red) and small (blue) subunit fit together. Ribosomes consist of two major subunits—the small ribosomal subunit reads the mRNA, while the large subunit joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of proteins.
In prokaryotes, the large ribosomal subunit contains two rRNAs—one large one and one small one—and approximately thirty-one proteins. In eukaryotes, the large subunit is composed of three rRNAs—one large one and two different small ones—and approximately forty-ni
