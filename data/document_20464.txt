If I forget to take my Suboxone for a day will I feel sick? SUBOXONE works best when taken every 24 hours; however, due to the long half life of Suboxone it may last longer than 24 hours, so you may not get sick. If you miss your dose, try to take it as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for your next dose.
I jumped at 1mg and had some pretty severe withdrawal for a while. Im told that the withdrawal lasts so long coming off suboxone due to the long half life-- It stays in your system for a while after you take your last dose. I wont lie to you-it may be really tough the first 2 weeks.
Buprenorphine withdrawal can start in the hours or days after you take your last dose. Generally, it is recommended that you gradually reduce your doses of buprenorphine over the period of 2-3 weeks before complete cessation so that the withdrawal symptoms are not as severe. Although the physical withdrawal symptoms resolve after a period of 7-10 days, the psychological withdrawal symptoms can last for months or longer. Symptoms of benprenorphine withdrawal include leg restlessness, nausea, and sweating, yawning, pain, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and cold or flu-like symptoms.
HK171. I took my last dose of suboxone 5 days ago. Symptoms started on day 2...similar to the symptoms that I experienced coming off of Percocet, oxycontin, dilauded, etc, but not as bad. Still, I've missed two days of work, can't sleep, muscles are achy...feels like my bones are growing and my skin is shrinking. I was on 24 mg for 11 months and tapered out to 2mg before stopping. Day 2 also started the fun for me as well in contrast to what my doctor advised me. It took 7 days before I could lay still in bed and get 5 hours of sleep.
My Suboxone withdrawal experience (currently day 4) was not as hard as all the blogs and message boards suggest. I think its important to tell you that I’m 6’3″, 205lbs male that started on 12mg daily 8 months ago to .5 mg last Friday(last dose). Suboxone (Buprenorphine) is a medication that is primarily used to help individuals that are struggling with opiate addiction. This substance works as a semi-synthetic opioid agonist on the Mu receptor of the brain.
Could someone please help me. I was wondering when I would start to feel withdrawal symptoms from suboxone and how bad they will be. I have been taking 8mgs a day for about 4 months. My doc tapered me off this week. 2 days @ 6mg, 2 days @4mgs, 2 days @ 2mgs and today nothing. I feel the same.

Suboxone takes about 2-5 days for the worst part of the symptoms to go away, and a couple weeks for mild symptoms to deminish. It kinda sucks cuz I'm actually goin through it … right now. Today is my third day and i decided to snort about .25 mg to take away the chills. 
You would need to start taking suboxone at the first signs of withdrawal I have been on sub for over a year. I love it. Just as most posts state...sub will give you a ceiling high.. You will be high while you're taking the sub, no matter how much of a tolerance you will build. 
Suboxone withdrawal begins shortly after a patient stops usage of the drug suddenly. Symptoms of withdrawal can begin within 36 hours of the last dose taken and may last for as long as two to three weeks.
