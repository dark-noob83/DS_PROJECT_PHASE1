Curcumin is the active ingredient that comes from turmeric. Turmeric is a plant that is in the same family as ginger. The rhizomes (root stalks) of turmeric are used in cooking, particularly in curries. In traditional Asian medicine, turmeric is used to treat various conditions. Curcumin is extracted from turmeric for medicinal purposes.
Curcumin belongs to a family of chemicals known as curcuminoids, which are polyphenolic compounds that have a bright yellow color. The distinctive color of turmeric is due to the high levels of curcumin it contains. Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties, reports an article published in 2007 in the medical journal Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology.
The plant turmeric (Curcuma longa) is very well known in India. The root is harvested, cleaned, dried, and powdered to be used as a spice (turmeric gives curry its beautiful golden yellow color) and as a medicine.
