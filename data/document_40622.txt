Muscle cells without a doubt! Muscle cells require energy and mitochondria make the ATP which is the energy we need to survive. Skin cells make the skin which protects our bodies. They do NOT require energy other than for normal cell cycle functions like division. This means that muscle cells have more mitochondria than skin cells because they require more energy. The mitochondria in the second layer of skin cells would not be in action for some time. However, there is a period in which the mitochondria in the skin cells are working more vigorously; when you have a wound.
Muscles cells have more mitochondria because that is where fermentation takes plcae more often. Skin cells do not use mitochondria that often, muscle cells work and they need all there energy from glucolysis that comes from the mitochondria. The mitochondria in the second layer of skin cells would not be in action for some time. However, there is a period in which the mitochondria in the skin cells are working more vigorously; when you have a wound.
Best Answer: because the mitochondria is the 'power house' of a cell, the more energy the cell needs the more mitochondria there will be. and because most of the time the muscle cells are doing alot of work(contracting and relaxing) more energy will be needed there than the skin which doesnt have a hectic job. · just now. Report Abuse. Mitochondria are the power plants of cells. Muscles require a great deal more energy than that of skin, muscle is how we move our limbs, and that is where most of our energy is exerted through movement, hence the need for so many mitochondria.
Mitochondria provide the energy a cell needs in order to function. Muscle cells require much more energy than the rest of the body, so the muscles contain more mitochondria. Mitochondria is the part of cells that generate energy by turning nutrients and oxygen into fuel for the body. Muscle cells need this ability more because they are constantly … working; fat cells do not need it as much.

Mitochondria are called the power-houses of the cell, because this is where cellular respiration occurs (where the energy is made). Muscle cells perform much more work than … cheek cells do, and so require more mitochondria.
