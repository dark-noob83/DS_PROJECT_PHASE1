Cells, for kids who are curious about how our bodies do what they do, spells out these important tasks in fun and fascinating detail; they’ll learn about the major differences between plant and animal cells, as well as get a close-up look at the “organs” that power each one.
There are lots of different types of cells. Each type of cell is different and performs a different function. In the human body, we have nerve cells which can be as long as from our feet to our spinal cord. Nerve cells help to transport messages around the body.

View full description. Cells, for kids, lays out all the basic facts about these microscopic structures out of which our bodies are made, covering everything from their internal “organs” to the way they determine every single human characteristic.
Inside a cell are tiny organs called organelles. The word organelle is a big word that means small organ. These organelles function to provide for the needs of the cell. They work to bring in food supplies, get rid of waste, protect the cell, repair the cell, and help it grow and reproduce.
