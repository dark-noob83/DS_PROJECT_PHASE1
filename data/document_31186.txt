Guess what airline I'm on??? Here is what a Copa Airlines Boeing 737-700 looks like on the inside. It is identical to Continental Airlines!!!! I'm in Clase Ejecutiva. That is what Copa calls Business Class.The only that that is different is the lack of LiveTV and the Copa Saftey Card and Magazine. I will also show you the Copa-In Flight Magazine.

Copa Airlines is a nice airline. Fast and easy check in online, securty priority line, nice lounge at JFK, boarding on time, comfortable seating on Boeing 737, lots of legroom. On the way to Panama there was no IFE, on the way back a new aircraft with new seats, great. FA very attentive. Food is bad on Copa Airlines, flight attendants not always polite, 50% of the time they will not provide a blanket, they do give headphones every time. Overall is a decent airline but I'd rather fly another airline the next time.
I am beyond disgusted, upset, and disappointed with COPA Airlines. In particular, the office in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. My brother, from Brazil, purchased tickets for me and my husband to fly from New Orleans to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The same day, I called Copa Airlines to add my infant son to our reservation.
