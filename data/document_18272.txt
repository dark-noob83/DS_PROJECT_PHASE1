Excitation is normally used to describe the current supplied to the field winding of a motor. A motor has a rotating armature with a coil that rotates in the magnetic field pr … oduced by a fixed field coil.
Excitation Contraction Coupling. A process fundamental to muscle physiology whereby an electrical stimulus or action potential triggers a myocyte to depolarize and contract. This mechanical muscle contraction response is regulated by entry of calcium ions into the cell.
excitation. 1. irritation or stimulation. 2. the addition of energy, such as excitation of a molecule by absorption of photons. direct excitation electrostimulation of a muscle by placing the electrode on the muscle itself. indirect excitation electrostimulation of a muscle by placing the electrode on its nerve.
excitation. n. 1. the act or process of exciting or state of being excited. 2. a means of exciting or cause of excitement. 3. (Electrical Engineering).
• EXCITATION (noun). The noun EXCITATION has 3 senses: 1. the state of being emotionally aroused and worked up. 2. the neural or electrical arousal of an organ or muscle or gland. 3. something that agitates and arouses. Familiarity information: EXCITATION used as a noun is uncommon.
excitation. an act of irritation or stimulation; a condition of being excited or of responding to a stimulus; the addition of energy, as the excitation of a molecule by absorption of photons. anomalous atrioventricular excitation Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
