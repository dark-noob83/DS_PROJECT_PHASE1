A standard, electric water heater with a 40 â€“ 50 gallon tank can run anywhere from $150-$1,500, and a gas water heater can run $300 - $600, depending on its energy efficiency. In addition to the cost of the heater, there are also installation fees that run between $200 and $400.
Never paid a dime in repair or servicing of the water heater in 15 years of services. The GE unit was a 9 year parts and labor warranty model that cost $187 ($250.00 installed) in 1999. Today, the new unit, a Premier unit with a 6 year parts and labor warranty and 6 years free service costs me $1312.00.
That's good news for homeowners because water heating amounts to nearly 20 percent of a home's energy costs. The new standards apply to gas (50 percent of U.S. households), electric (41 percent), and oil residential tank water heaters.
