Prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelle. Prokaryotes include two groups: bacteria and another group called archaea. Having organelles is a big deal for a cell.
All living things are made up of a cell or cells, and all cells are either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. A eukaryotic cell is a complex cell with a nucleus and many organelles. Eukaryotic cells are the building blocks of all animals, plants and fungi. Prokaryotic cells are very simple cells with fewer structures than eukaryotic cells; one primary difference is that they lack a nucleus.
The nucleus is an organelle that is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope separates the contents of the nucleus from the rest of the cell. Eukaryotic cells also have a cell membrane (plasma membrane), cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and various cellular organelles.
In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells may contain several other types of organelles, which may include mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Each of these organelles performs a specific function critical to the cell's survival.
Examples of organelles found in plant cells and animal cells include: Prokaryotic cells have a structure that is less complex than eukaryotic cells. They do not have a nucleus or region where the DNA is bound by a membrane. Prokaryotic DNA is coiled up in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. Like eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells contain a plasma membrane, cell wall, and cytoplasm. Unlike eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells do not contain membrane-bound organelles.
Prokaryotic cells do not contain the extensive network of organelles found in eukaryotic cells. The nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum are all absent in prokaryotic cells. Instead, the enzymes in organelles of eukaryotic cells are attached to the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell.
