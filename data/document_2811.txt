Location. The Tundra is located in the northern regions of North America, Europe, Asia, as well as a few regions of Antarctica. The Tundra is the second largest vegetation zone in Canada. It can be divided clearly into three different sections: the High Arctic Tundra, the Low Arctic Tundra and the Alpine Tundra.
A climate zone results from the climate conditions of an area: its temperature, humidity, amount and type of precipitation, and the season. A climate zone is reflected in a region's natural vegetation.
Latitude & Climate Zones. Latitude provides the location of a place north or south of the equator and is expressed by angular measurements ranging from 0° at the equator to 90° at the poles. Different latitudes on Earth receive different amounts of sunlight, and are a key factor in determining a region’s climate.
The subpolar climate is found between the humid continental and the polar tundra climates (Figure 17.22). This climate is dominated by long, very cold winters with very little precipitation. Continental polar air masses form when air stagnates in this zone.
A polar climate zone is a region that is characterized by a lack of  warm summers. Every month in a polar climate has a mean temperature  of less than 10 degrees Celsius.

Polar climate This very cold climate is found in thepolar regions of the world and on thehighest mountains. Temperatures canrange from 10°C in the summer to–40°C in the winter. Not much rainfall(less than 250 mm).
The polar climate zone is located between about 67°N latitude and the North Pole-this latitude zone receives less sunlight than the other two latitude zones.
