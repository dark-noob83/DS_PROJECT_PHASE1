As an example of interest rates, suppose you go into your bank to borrow $1000 for a new bicycle and the bank quotes you a 5% interest rate on your loan. If you borrow this amount for one year, the interest you would pay on top of paying back the $1000 would be $50 (simple interest: $1000 x 0.05).
By Joseph Nguyen AAA |. A: The main difference between yields and interest rates is that each term refers to different financial instruments. Yield commonly refers to the dividend, interest or return the investor receives from a security like a stock or bond, and is usually reported as an annual figure. Interest rate generally refers to the interest charged by a lender such as a bank on a loan, and is typically expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR).
Compound interest is incurred whenever a loan or investment charges or pays interest on the previous interest, added to the principal of the transaction. For example, a loan of $1,000 at 1 percent monthly interest will incur $10 in interest the first month.
1 Coupon yield is the annual interest rate established when the bond is issued. 2  It's the same as the coupon rate and is the amount of income you collect on a bond, expressed as a percentage of your original investment.
Annual percentage rate can be reported in one of two ways: a simple APR is determined by multiplying the interest rate by the number of payment periods. For example: 1% * 12 = 12% simple APR. But in the prior example, the actual APR is 12.68 percent, once yield calculations are measured.
The formula for yield is (1 + Interest rate) ^ Compounding Periods - 1. The caret means &amp;ldquo;to the power of,&amp;rdquo; and refers to multiplying the first number by itself that many times: 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8. The loan in the prior example has a yield of (1 + 0.01) ^ 12 - 1 = 1.01^12 - 1 = 1.1268 - 1 = 12.68%.
In the yield curve above, interest rates (and also the yield) increase as the maturity or holding period increases—yield on a 30-day T-bill is 2.55 percent, compared to 4.80 percent for a 20-year Treasury bond—but not by much.
