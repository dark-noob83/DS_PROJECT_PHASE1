There are around 900 native languages spoken by the 5-10 million people of New Guinea and its neighboring islands. That is roughly 1/6 of all languages being spoken by far less than 1% of the world's people. Note: If the 15 major variants of Arabic are considered one language, Arabic is the 6th most common language in the world having 198-201,000,000 native speakers with substantial numbers in at least 46 countries.

The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages Click here to see the full data from Comrie (1998), Weber (1997), and the Summer Institute for Linguistics (SIL) 1999 Ethnologue Survey as well as charts comparing the number of speakers of each language and the number of countries using each language. The following list is from George Weber s article Top Languages: The World s 10 Most Influential Languages in Language Today (Vol. 2, Dec 1997): (number of native speakers in parentheses). 1  Mandarin Chinese (1.1 billion). 2  English (330 million). 3  Spanish (300 million). 4  Hindi/Urdu (250 million)
My guess is English, but the question is tricky. Non-native speakers does NOT mean every single speaker of English born outside of the UK, North America and Australia. There are many different Englishes, including the English spoken as a first or dual language by natives of India, the Philippines and other places.
The following languages are listed as having 50 million or more native speakers in the 2015 edition of Ethnologue, a language reference published by SIL International. Speaker totals are generally not reliable, as they add together estimates from different dates. For number by native speakers, see List of languages by number of native speakers. A number of sources have compiled lists of languages by their number of speakers. However, all such lists should be used with caution. 1  First, it is difficult to define exactly what constitutes a language as opposed to a dialect
The world’s most spoken language by total speakers. Encyclopaedia Britannica suggests the following list, which seemingly combines native speakers with non-native speakers: 1  English (1,000 million). 2  Mandarin (1,000 million). 3  Hindi/Urdu (900 milllion). 4  Spanish (450 million). 5  Russian/Belarusian (320 million). This information, based on number of native speakers, comes from Ethnologue, a widely-respected encyclopaedia of the world’s living languages. At the time of the last update, there were 7105 living languages, but that figure is likely to have decreased since then as languages become extinct.
The majority of the languages in the world are unwritten and many of them are disappearing. About 1/2 of the world's languages are no longer spoken by children. This is the first step in the extinction of a language. About 2,000 languages now have less than 1,000 speakers.

There are about 200 languages that have a million or more native speakers. Mandarin Chinese is the most common, being spoken by around 874,000,000 people as a native language. English is a distant third with approximately 341,000,000 native speakers.
