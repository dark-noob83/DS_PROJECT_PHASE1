First and foremost in understanding the use of nucleases in genome editing is the understanding of DNA double stranded break (DSB) repair mechanisms. Two of the known DSB repair pathways that are essentially functional in all organisms are the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology directed repair (HDR). Genome editing with engineered nucleases will likely contribute to many fields of life sciences from studying gene functions in plants and animals to gene therapy in humans.
It is commonly practiced in genetic analysis that in order to understand the function of a gene or a protein function one interferes with it in a sequence-specific way and monitors its effects on the organism. Genome editing with engineered nucleases will likely contribute to many fields of life sciences from studying gene functions in plants and animals to gene therapy in humans.
Genome editing, or genome editing with engineered nucleases (GEEN) is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases, or molecular scissors.. Genome editing with engineered nucleases will likely contribute to many fields of life sciences from studying gene functions in plants and animals to gene therapy in humans.
Genome Editing-making specific changes at targeted genomic sites-is fundamentally important to researchers in biology and medicine. Two genome editing technologies have emerged that exploit bacterial systems for plant pathogenesis or adaptive immunity: TALEN (. 
Indels can disrupt a gene by causing frame shifts, and, therefore, gene knockouts. Genome Editing tools can also be used for non-permanent changes in gene expression, by adapting them as fusions to either transcriptional activators or repressors. For genome editing, the S. pyogenes Cas9 nuclease is inactive until it binds to a single guide RNA (sgRNA). An sgRNA contains a 20 nucleotide genomic sequence. The Cas9-sgRNA complex recognizes this sequence in the genome when it is immediately followed by a 5’ N-G-G 3’ “PAM” site.
Though genome editing with CRISPR is just a little over a year old, it is already reinventing genetic research. In particular, it gives scientists the ability to quickly and simultaneously make multiple genetic changes to a cell. Now there is hope in the form of new genome-engineering tools, particularly one called CRISPR. This technology could allow researchers to perform microsurgery on genes, precisely and easily changing a DNA sequence at exact locations on a chromosome.
genome editing. This factsheet is also available as a pdf (with images not included below). The term genome editing comprises a range of molecular techniques that allow targeted changes to be made to the genomes of organisms. Also referred to as genome engineering or site-directed mutagenesis, genome editing can: 1  modify genetic information within an organism’s genome to create new characteristics
The new genome-editing tool called CRISPR, which researchers in China used to genetically modify monkeys, is a precise and relatively easy way to alter DNA at specific locations on chromosomes. 
Genome editing is the process of editing an organisms DNA by altering, removing or adding nucleotides to the genome. This process is accomplished through the use of engineered nucleases that can make a double stranded “cut” or a single stranded “nick” in an organism’s DNA. Genome editing has been a heavily studied field for a number of years with an ultimate goal of specificity to limit off target effects. The first engineered nuclease technology, Zinc Finger, was presented in a 1991 publication by Pavletich and Pabo in the journal Science.
GM and genome editing are different tools to make genetic changes, and very similar genetic changes can be introduced using a variety of techniques. What's important is the effect a genetic change makes to the plant. Genome editing is somewhat different in that it leads to modification of the existing copy of a plant gene ‘in situ’ (in its normal genomic location). Both GM and GE are complex entities with many different methods, vectors etc.
