Save. Not all bacteria and fungi are bad. In fact, most bacteria are harmless, and some are even beneficial. Likewise, there are certain fungi, particularly yeasts, that are useful to people and can help promote good health. Many of these good bacteria and fungi aid in digestion. Others are used in food and medicine.
They have no membrane-bound organelles and can adapt to their environment very quickly. They are found on all continents of the Earth, including Antarctica, and they can be found in some of the most extreme conditions on Earth, such as in hot water springs and near hydrothermal vents deep below the oceans. 2. Listeria monocytogenes-Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium. It is anaerobic. The most common infection that these bacteria cause is Listeriosis. Symptoms of this infection are headaches, nausea and vomiting; however, if the infection spreads to the nervous system, it can cause meningitis.
Some strains, however, can cause food poisoning in humans, leading to bloody diarrhea and, in certain cases, kidney failure. The majority of E. coli infections are found to be associated with eating undercooked beef. 6. Streptococcus-Strptococcus is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria that is spherical in shape. 2. Listeria monocytogenes-Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium. It is anaerobic. The most common infection that these bacteria cause is Listeriosis. Symptoms of this infection are headaches, nausea and vomiting; however, if the infection spreads to the nervous system, it can cause meningitis.
You cannot escape bacteria, they are everywhere! The good thing is that very few bacteria are harmful, but bad bacteria aren’t much fun. Bad bacteria like Pat O’Gen make you sick, while other bad bacteria spoil your food and water, making it unsafe. Bad bacteria love when you or your environment is unhygienic or dirty.
Harmful bacteria: 1  E. Coli can also be harmful if food or water is contaminated with it and then eaten. 2  Listeriosis can cause individuals to become very ill and can even be potentially deadly. 3  Salmonella is very dangerous and lives in the intestinal tracts of humans. (Answer #1). Helpful bacteria: 1  E. Coli are found in the intestines of humans and aid in digestion. 2  Streptomyces is used in making antibiotics. 3  Rhizobium are helpful bacteria found in the soil.
Bacteria are the plural of bacterium, which are microscopic one-celled organisms. They are found everywhere and can be harmful, as in infections; or they can be beneficial, as in fermentation or decomposition. Five types of bacteria are: Coccus, Bacillus, Spirillum, Rickettsia, and Mycoplasma. Here are examples of bacteria that do not have a cell wall and may be rod shaped or spherical (Mycoplasma): 1  M. buccale. 2  M. faucium. 3  M. fermentans. 4  M. gallisepticum. 5  M. genitalium. 6  M. haemofelis.
Bacterial diseases include any type of illness caused by bacteria. Bacteria are a type of microorganism, which are tiny forms of life that can only be seen with a microscope. Other types of microorganisms include viruses, some fungi, and some parasites. Millions of bacteria normally live on the skin, in the intestines, and on the genitalia.
Harmful bacteria: 1  E. Coli can also be harmful if food or water is contaminated with it and then eaten. 2  Listeriosis can cause individuals to become very ill and can even be potentially deadly. 3  Examples of where it can be found are in shellfish, cold cuts, and unpasteurized milk. (Answer #1). Helpful bacteria: 1  E. Coli are found in the intestines of humans and aid in digestion. 2  Streptomyces is used in making antibiotics. 3  Rhizobium are helpful bacteria found in the soil.
They are used in combination with other bacteria to produce acidophiles-type yogurt. They are also used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. 8. Bifidobacterium animalis-Bifidobacterium animalis is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium. It is anaerobic and found in the intestines of humans and other animals. 2. Listeria monocytogenes-Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium. It is anaerobic. The most common infection that these bacteria cause is Listeriosis. Symptoms of this infection are headaches, nausea and vomiting; however, if the infection spreads to the nervous system, it can cause meningitis.
1. Staphylococcus aureus-Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive coccus (rounded shape) that is anaerobic. Staphylococcus aureus is also known as the golden cluster seed, golden staph and the seed gold. Staphylococcus bacteria are present in the nasal passages of humans and can be found on the skin and hair. 2. Listeria monocytogenes-Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium. It is anaerobic. The most common infection that these bacteria cause is Listeriosis. Symptoms of this infection are headaches, nausea and vomiting; however, if the infection spreads to the nervous system, it can cause meningitis.
