Best Answer: I work at CarMax. We get $150 per car, $100 for a warranty and $50 if you sell your car to CarMax. There is always some type of spiff every month like $10 test drives, $50 extra for a car or for warranty, etc. We do not get any special bonuses for selling X amount of cars per month or anything like that. From what I understand, CARMAX pays a flat $150 per unit. That is all I know, and I assume that there is more to it than that. IE bonuses and spiffs for selling x amount of units or $xxx for each warranty that you sell. It seems absurd that a sales person could sell 20 cars in a month and only make $3000.
