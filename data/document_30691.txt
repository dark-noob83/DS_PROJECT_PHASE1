CBS also acquired the rights to the championship games for 1964 and 1965 for $1.8 million per game, on April 17, 1964. On December 29, 1965, CBS acquired the rights to the NFL regular season games in 1966 and 1967, with an option to extend the contract through 1968, for $18.8 million per year (in sharp contrast to the $14.1 million per year it paid for the rights in 1964).
