Second-Order Neurons. their cell bodies reside in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord or in meduallry nuclei, and they transmit impulses to the thalamas or to the cerebellum where they synapse.
Lower motor neuron nuclei are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. They contain predominantly motor nuclei consisting of α, β and γ motor neurons and are found at all levels of the spinal cord--they are root cells.
(axons remain within gray matter). The gray matter horns are actually profiles of gray columns. Columns of neuron cell bodies, when transected, appear as clusters of neuron cell body profiles within gray matter. The cell body clusters are called nuclei.
Visceral Efferent Nuclei contain cell bodies of preganglionic efferent neurons. Axons of the neurons synapse within autonomic ganglia and the adrenal medulla. Preganglionic neurons are activated by descending pathways from autonomic premotor centers and by local reflexes.
Nerve Anatomy. Inspection of the entire diagram shows that these nerves contain axons forming two-neuron chains. The cell bodies of the first or preganglionic neurons (orange circles) are located within the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord in the lateral grey horns.
The anterior horn cells are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord and thus are technically part of the CNS. In contrast to the motor system, the cell bodies of the afferent sensory fibers lie outside the spinal cord, in posterior root ganglia.
Second-order neuron cell bodies reside in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Second-order neurons conduct impulses to the spinal cord or brain stem, where they synapse. Second-order neuron cell bodies reside in a ganglion.
