Get fancy, black & white, and Icelandic with Of Monsters and Men in their striking video for Empire.. Comments. Of Monsters and Men.
Of Monsters and Men released their new music video off of their latest album, Beneath the Skin. Captured in black and white, the music video is flawlessly stunning. It is artistic and romantic and reminds you of 1920s glamour.
I want to make videos with stories about women that we don’t usually see. The track is intimate and has a music video that perfectly goes alongside it. Check out the music video for “Empire” here: Camille is a 20-something, college graduate from the University of San Francisco. Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, you will most likely find her wandering around local bookstores, going to a concert or just enjoying the sights.
