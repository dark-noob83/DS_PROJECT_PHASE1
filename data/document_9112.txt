For example, since the credit is equal to 20 percent of the tuition and fees you pay, even if you borrow $2,000 to pay for the tuition on a course, your credit will equal $400. You can view this as a discount on your student loan if you take that $400 to pay down some of your student loan debt.
1 From Luis: I heard that if your student loan is in default and they are intercepting your taxes, It goes towards interest of the loan. 2  Getting your loan out of default you can then get the intercepted (money) back.
by Cynthia Lawson. If you are in default on your student loan, the student loan creditor, or the collection agency for the student loan creditor can seek to garnish your wages or take your tax refund to offset the loan amount.
Federal tax refunds can be taken first for unpaid child support, then for debts owed to federal agencies (like to the Department of Education for student loans), to the IRS for back taxes, or to Social Security for benefit overpayments.
If your federal student loans are in default, the Department of Education can refer your account to the Department of Treasury for collection by an offset of your federal (and in some cases state) tax returns. The Department of Treasury can withhold the entire amount of your refund to satisfy the debt that is owed.
Yes, if you have defaulted on a student loan your taxes can in fact be taken by the government to repay the loan. Please note that they will also charge additional interest as well as penalties.
Most federal student loans are considered to be in default when payments are 270 days or more past due. Once your student loan hits default status, the federal government can and will go to extreme lengths to reclaim its money.
Tax refund offsets are one of the governmentâ€™s powerful tools to collect federal student loans. The government may take your income tax refund if you are in default. A number of states also have laws that authorize state guaranty agencies to take state income tax refunds.
