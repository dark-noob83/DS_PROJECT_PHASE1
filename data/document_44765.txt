In recent years, Saskatchewan's agricultural and mineral resources have come into new demand, and it has entered a new period of strong economic growth. The current estimate of the Regina CMA population, as of 1 July 2014, according to Statistics Canada is 237,800. The  Regina Cyclone  was a tornado that devastated the city on 30 June 1912 and remains the deadliest tornado in Canadian history, with a total of 28 fatalities, the population of the city having been 30,213 in 1911.
The town of Shaunavon is located in southwest Saskatchewan at the junction of Highways 37 and 13. It is 110 kilometres from Swift Current, 163 kilometres from the Alberta border and 74 kilometres from the Montana border. Shaunavon was established in 1913 along the Canadian Pacific Railway line. The left-wing slant of the area, like most of Saskatchewan’s provincial politics, has seen a shift to the right. The election of the PCs’ Jack Goohsen in 1995 marked a new political beginning for the region. Goohsen resigned his seat in 1999 after being found guilty of soliciting sex from an underage prostitute.
Looking at differences between men and women, for the 2011 general election women participated at a higher rate (59.6%) than men (57.3%), and this was true across all age groups up to age 64, where men started participating more than women. Figure 7 shows how voter turnout varies by province and territory compared to the 58.5% adjusted national figure for the 2011 federal general election. Prince Edward Island saw by far the highest turnout at 74.0%, while only the Northwest Territories and Nunavut had turnout below 50%, at 47.4% and 39.4%, respectively.
With less than 10% of Saskatchewan’s population directly involved in agriculture by 2001, and with agricultural commodities accounting for less than 20% of provincial GDP, it was clear that Saskatchewan’s economy was now tied to the harvest more by sentiment than by reality. It is perhaps not surprising, given the crucial contribution of women to pioneer society and the strength of women’s organizations, that Saskatchewan in 1916 became the second province to grant women the vote and the third to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol.
Figure 5 shows turnout rates for 2011 broken down by both age group and gender. For the 2011 general election, the participation rate across all age groups was 57.3% for men and 59.6% for women. Women voted at higher rates than men in all age groups up to age 64, after which it was the reverse. Figure 7 shows how voter turnout varies by province and territory compared to the 58.5% adjusted national figure for the 2011 federal general election. Prince Edward Island saw by far the highest turnout at 74.0%, while only the Northwest Territories and Nunavut had turnout below 50%, at 47.4% and 39.4%, respectively.
According to the 2011 Canadian Census, the population of Regina is 193,100, a 7.7% increase from 2006. The population density is 1,327.6 people per square km. The median age is 37.1 years old (48.5 for women and 38.5 for men), which is lower than the median age of Canada at 40.6 years old.

Saskatchewan's 2001 population of 978,933 is about 3 percent of the national population. Saskatchewan's population density is the lowest among the four provinces of western Canada. As of 2001, 29 percent of all residents were under 19 years of age. The median age increased from 32.6 years in 1991 to 36.7 years in 2001. That was still younger than the national average of 37.6 years, however. Saskatchewan was established as a province in 1905, with Regina as its capital. The early years of the 20th century were prosperous ones for the new province. Between 1885 and 1911, the population of the region grew from approximately 32,000 to 493,000.
