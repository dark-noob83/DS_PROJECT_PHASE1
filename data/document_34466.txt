The Texas flag is known as the Lone Star Flag (giving rise to the state's nickname The Lone Star State). This flag was introduced to the Congress of the Republic of Texas on December 28, 1838, by Senator William H. Wharton and was adopted on January 25, 1839 as the final national flag of the Republic of Texas. When Texas became the 28th state of the Union on December 29, 1845, its national flag became the state flag. 
The official seal of the state has a five-pointed star, encircled by olive and live oak branches and the words The State of Texas. Texas remained a republic for almost 10 years until it became part of the United States in 1845. The Texas flag is the official symbol of the Lone Star State because of its single bright star gracing the red, white and blue banner. The colors in the flag symbolize bravery (red), purity and liberty (white), and loyalty (blue).

The Lone Star Flag of Texas. The Texas state flag is the 1839 National flag of the Republic of Texas, which features the famous Lone Star (also seen on the Great Seal of Texas and the U.S. mint's commemorative quarter for Texas). The red, white, and blue of the state flag of Texas represent bravery, purity and loyalty. Six different national flags have flown over Texas representing the countries which have ruled it (France, Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the Confederate States of America, and the United States of America).
The first official national flag of Texas, adopted on December 10, 1836, was blue with a central yellow star. The present state flag was originally adopted on January 25, 1839, as the second national flag of the Republic of Texas. The state flag of Texas is similar to the Chile National Flag. The flag of Texas was designed and adopted on 25 January 1839, whereas Chile's flag was adopted much earlier on 18 October 1817.
The first national flag, the Stars and Bars, is the flag most commonly used in the Six Flags of Texas today. It was adopted by the provisional government, and first raised in Montgomery, Alabama on March 4, 1861. 
Pledge to the Texas Flag. A pledge to the Texas flag was adopted by the 43rd Legislature. It contained a phrase, Flag of 1836, which inadvertently referred to the David G. Burnet flag instead of the Lone Star Flag adopted in 1839.
The Lone Star Flag described above was not the first official flag of the Republic of Texas. A flag consisting of a blue field with a large central gold star was adopted by the first Texas Congress, December 10, 1836. The design was suggested by President David G. Burnet and it is sometimes called the Burnet flag.. It was the flag of the Republic from 1836-1839.
