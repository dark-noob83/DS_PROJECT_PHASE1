Like humans, dogs also gradually lose their baby teeth. Puppies, like new-born babies, are born without teeth. Canines will not grow their first baby teeth till they reach about six to eight weeks of age. Dogs normally grow as many as 28 teeth, which are commonly referred to as the baby teeth or the deciduous teeth.
Adult teeth start to form at 4 months of age.. Puppies are born without teeth and get their puppy teeth between the 6 and 8th week of life and grow 28 teeth (called deciduous or baby teeth). The first teeth to emerge are the incisors at 2 to 3 weeks followed by the canines and the premolars. Puppies do not have molars.

Puppies do not have to grind much food, so they do not have molars. Puppy teeth begin to shed and be replaced by permanent adult teeth at about four months of age.
