radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy for thyroid cancer it uses a radioactive form of iodine called iodine 131 i 131 the radioactive iodine circulates throughout your body in your bloodstream thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in your body the radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells
treatment with radioactive iodine is used most frequently for thyroid cancers that have spread to the lymph nodes and other parts of the body though its potential benefit in patients with small tumors that can be completely removed by surgery is not clear because almost all iodine in your bloodstream gets taken up by the thyroid gland radioactive iodine i 131 can be used to destroy the thyroid gland and thyroid cancer cells in lymph nodes or other parts of the body for this procedure the radioactive iodine is taken into the body either in liquid or capsule form
ki potassium iodide is a salt of stable not radioactive iodine that can help block radioactive iodine from being absorbed by the thyroid gland thus protecting this gland from radiation injury the thyroid gland is the part of the body that is most sensitive to radioactive iodine 
what radioactive iodine is radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy the treatment uses a radioactive form of iodine called iodine 131 i 131 the radioactive iodine circulates throughout your body in your bloodstream thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in your body the radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells i
radioactive iodine 131 i is a radioactive isotope that is administered orally in a liquid or capsule form the majority of radioactive iodine is taken up by your remaining thyroid cells since the thyroid normally uses iodine to make thyroid hormone 
any of the radionuclides of iodine the most commonly used of which is beta and gamma emitting 131i with a half life of 8 days it is used clinically as an implant for treating thyroid cancer and hyperactivity and for scintigraphy of other organs iodine 125 a radioisotope of iodine having a half life of 60 14 days and emitting gamma rays used as a label in radioimmunoassays and other in vitro tests and also for thyroid imaging symbol 125 i iodine 131 a radioactive isotope of iodine having a half life of 8 04 days and emitting beta particles and
guide radioactive iodine is a medicine that you take one time after you swallow it it is taken up by your thyroid gland depending on the dosage used the radioactivity in the iodine destroys most or all of the tissue in your thyroid gland but it does not harm any other parts of your body
