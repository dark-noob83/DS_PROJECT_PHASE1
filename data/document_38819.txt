1 Your net worth: Basic umbrella insurance policies begin at $1 million. 2  Ideally, your policy should be equal to or greater than your net worth. 3  If you need to determine the amount of assets you have, consult a lawyer or financial advisor.
Most insurers first require you to have $300,000 or $500,000 in liability coverage on your car and home. For example, if you have $500,000 in liability insurance on your auto policy and a $1-million umbrella policy, you’ll have a total of $1.5 million in liability coverage. If you’re looking for extra cash to afford the umbrella policy, Howard recommends raising your auto-and homeowners-insurance deductibles.
Assessment: You are higher risk than average. Get an umbrella policy with liability coverage of at least $1 million if not $2 million given you’re in the growth phase of your career. Also get comprehensive auto insurance that covers the damage of your car and liability of around $500,000 per accident.
Get an umbrella policy with liability coverage between $2 million to $3 million. Weight the value of peace of mind vs. the increase in monthly premiums for higher coverage. Make a decision what the likelihood is that you will be sued for your entire net worth.
You can certainly go without an umbrella policy, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you have a net worth beyond your auto or homeowners liability coverage. My auto insurance liability covers $500,000 per accident.
Freedman recommends getting more than $1 million in umbrella coverage if you earn more than $100,000 per year or have more than $1 million in assets. “Our clients get liability-insurance limits that are at least as much as their net worth,” he says. Daniel Morris, a CPA in San Jose, recommends at least a $2-million umbrella policy for most people, or a policy for $3 million to $5 million if you have rental property.
