The atmosphere consists of 4 layers: the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Figure A shows the placement of the different layers of the atmosphere and how the temperature changes with height as you go from the ground up to space. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. 
Above 120 miles (200 km) above sea level, temperatures in the thermosphere can vary between 600° and 2000°C (1100 and 3600°F). The actual temperature range is highly depe … ndent on solar activity. A longer answer The thermosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere above the mesosphere. The thermosphere extends from 50 to 55 miles (80-90 km) above sea level, with the upper limit undefined. 
The layer of atmosphere above the mesosphere, which extends from 50 to 55 miles (80-90 km) above the sea level with the upper limit undefined. The temperature in this region initially rises rapidly with heights up to about 120 miles (200 km) and thereafter increases more slowly or not at all. the layer of the upper atmosphere located between the mesopause—that is, the upper boundary of the mesosphere—and the base of the exosphere. On the average, the thermosphere extends from a height of about 80 km to a height of about 500 km; these limits vary by ±10–20 percent.
They are, in ascending order, the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere and the thermosphere. THE TROPOSPHERE. This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, and varies in height in different spans of the world from roughly 28,000 feet above sea level at the poles to 54,000 feet at the equator. Within the troposphere the pressure, density and temperature all decrease rapidly with height. THE MESOSPHERE. The mesosphere is characterized by a marked increase in temperature. At a height of about 150,000 feet, the temperature reaches 10 C. The rise in temperature is due to the presence of a layer of ozone which absorbs more of the sun's radiation.
The atmospheric shell extending from the top of the mesosphere to outer space; it is a region of more or less steadily increasing temperature with height, starting at 40 to 50 miles (70 to 80 kilometers); the thermosphere includes, therefore, the exosphere and most or all of the ionosphere. the layer of the upper atmosphere located between the mesopause—that is, the upper boundary of the mesosphere—and the base of the exosphere. On the average, the thermosphere extends from a height of about 80 km to a height of about 500 km; these limits vary by ±10–20 percent.
The thermosphere is characterized by a positive temperature gradient, which is equal to zero at the mesopause, has a maximum value between 100 and 200 km, and again becomes equal to zero near the base of the exosphere, where the atmosphere becomes practically isothermal. the layer of the upper atmosphere located between the mesopause—that is, the upper boundary of the mesosphere—and the base of the exosphere. On the average, the thermosphere extends from a height of about 80 km to a height of about 500 km; these limits vary by ±10–20 percent.
The spectacular auroras form in the upper regions of the thermosphere. Within the thermosphere is a region known as the ionosphere, which extends from about 50 miles to 250 miles above the earth's surface. Within this region, free electron density is very great and distance from Sea Level affects radio communication. THE MESOSPHERE. The mesosphere is characterized by a marked increase in temperature. At a height of about 150,000 feet, the temperature reaches 10 C. The rise in temperature is due to the presence of a layer of ozone which absorbs more of the sun's radiation.
The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft). The exosphere merges with the emptiness of outer space, where there is no atmosphere. The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15 × 10 kg, three quarters of which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.
Thermosphere. the layer of the upper atmosphere located between the mesopause—that is, the upper boundary of the mesosphere—and the base of the exosphere. On the average, the thermosphere extends from a height of about 80 km to a height of about 500 km; these limits vary by ±10–20 percent.
The thermosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere. The thermosphere is directly above the mesosphere and below the exosphere. It extends from about 90 km (56 miles) to between 500 and 1,000 km (311 to ...more. At first, the temperature gets warmer very quickly as you go upward in the thermosphere. After that, the temperature doesn't change much as you go higher. However, the hottest temperature changes between day and night. It also depends on how active the Sun is during its 11-year sunspot cycle.
