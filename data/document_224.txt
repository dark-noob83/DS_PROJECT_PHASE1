For instance, with 5 percent financing over three years, a $22,000 sedan ends up costing a total of $23,737. If you double that length to six years and keep the same interest rate, the amount owed is $25,510. By doubling the length of the loan, you'll pay more than twice as much in interest: $3,510 in interest payments versus $1,737. There is, however, an acceptable limit to how long a vehicle loan should be
Among these buyers, the average price of the car is just over $26,000. This means that one-third of the cars you see on the road are dragging a $475 payment behind them. The car dealer won’t tell you that your awesome new car loses about 25% of its value the instant you drive it off the lot. Think about it this way: If you were to invest that $475 (remember, this is the average car payment in the U.S.) into a good mutual fund with a 12% rate of return, you would have over $100,000 in 10 years! At 20 years, you would have made $470,000.

But not all of us are hitting the showrooms with that frequency. Mike in Maine, for example, wants to know how long his car will keep going. I’m driving a 1993 Toyota Camry with over 235,000 miles. I have spent about $2,000 in maintenance on the car since 1996, when I bought it with 64k on the odometer. The car runs fine and drives fine
A shorter-term loan pays off the car faster and helps you pay less in overall interest costs, she said. The flip side of that is that a short-term loan — say, three years — comes with monthly payments that are more expensive: For a $22,000 car financed at 5 percent, you'll pay around $659 a month over three years. If you double that length to six years and keep the same interest rate, the amount owed is $25,510. By doubling the length of the loan, you'll pay more than twice as much in interest: $3,510 in interest payments versus $1,737.
