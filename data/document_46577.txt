By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Definition: Electron capture is a type of radioactive decay where the nucleus of an atom absorbs a K or L shell electron and converts a proton into a neutron. This process reduces the atomic number by 1 and emits gamma radiation and a neutrino. The decay scheme for electron capture is:
Electron capture (K-electron capture, also K-capture, or L-electron capture, L-capture) is a process in which the proton-rich nucleus of an electrically neutral atom absorbs an inner atomic electron, usually from the K or L electron shell.
Electron capture is the last type of naturally occuring decay that we will study. However, people have long sought to be able to change the nucleus.
Another type of nuclear decay reaction is electron capture. The electrons involved in electron capture come from an atom's own electron cloud. It is like an electron crashes into the nucleus and causes a decay reaction.
All other decays shoot something out of the nucleus. In electron capture, something ENTERS the nucleus. These points present a simplified view of what electron capture is: 1) An electron from the closest energy level falls into the nucleus, which causes a proton to become a neutron. 2) A neutrino is emitted from
