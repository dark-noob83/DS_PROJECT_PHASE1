Prokaryotic fission, which is binary fission, is a form of asexual reproduction and cell division used by all prokaryotes (bacteria and archaebacteria) and some organelles within eukaryotic organisms (e.g., mitochondria). The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods, ribosomes, and plasmids, these are brand new organisms. In biology, fission is the division of a cell (or body, population, or species) into two or more parts and the regeneration of those parts into separate cells (bodies, populations, or species).
Chapter 17: Cell Division 581 Cell Division in Unicellular Organisms Cell division and reproduction are the same thing in all single-celled organisms. However, the process of cell divisionin prokaryotes and in single-celled eukaryotes differs.is the form of asexual reproductionoccurring in prokaryotes. Genetically, the daughter cells are exactly like the parent cell. Since all prokaryoticorganisms are single-celled, cell division and reproduction by binary fission are the same process for them.In single-celled eukaryotic organisms, however, reproduction bycell division involves mitosis and cytokinesis.
Binary fission occurs under favourable environmental conditions. Binary fission is the division of one cell into two similar cells. This is the simplest method of asexual reproduction. It occurs in unicellular organisms like bacteria, yeast, Euglena, Amoeba and Paramecium. In some organisms (e.g., Leishmania, which causes kala-azar) binary fission takes place in definite orientation due to their specific body structure. The type of reproduction that takes place without the process of gamete (sex cell) formation is called asexual reproduction. Advertisements: This type of reproduction takes place commonly in lower plants and animals, where the body is not very complex.
Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such as the archaebacteria, eubacteria, and protists. Organisms, both prokaryotes (the archaea and the bacteria), and eukaryotes (such as protists and unicellular fungi), reproduce asexually through binary fission; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction. Another type of fission is multiple fission that is advantageous to the plant life cycle
* when offspring are produced from a single parent, it is called asexual reproduction * the offspring are identical to the parent! By cell division, one cell divides to become two. This process is used by some organisms, such as protozoans, to reproduce. In other, multicellular organisms, this process is used to grow in size or to replace tissues. * when offspring are produced from two parents, it is called sexual reproduction * the offspring is a combination of the two parents. REMEMBER CYTOLOGY--the study of cells. the nucleus ...

Fragmentation in multicellular or colonial organisms is a form of asexual reproduction or cloning where an organism is split into fragments. Each of these fragments develop into mature, fully grown individuals that are clones of the original organism. The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA rods, ribosomes, and plasmids, these are brand new organisms. In biology, fission is the division of a cell (or body, population, or species) into two or more parts and the regeneration of those parts into separate cells (bodies, populations, or species).
Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring from a single parent cell. The process of mitosis is associated with asexual reproduction and the growth and repair of cells in sexually reproducing organisms. Reproduction and development are necessary for the continuation of any species. Asexual reproduction is sometimes called cloning. Cloning is the production of identical genetic copies. All forms of asexual reproduction are variations of the cell division process of mitosis. Mitosis is associated with asexual reproduction, as well as growth and repair
