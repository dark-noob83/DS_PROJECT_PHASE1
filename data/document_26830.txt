People would often refer to the size of a football field as something that is equivalent to one acre. This actually not a very accurate representation of how big an acre is. Technically speaking, if you include the two end zones of a football field, an acre will be about seventy-six percent of this. Now, if you take out both end zones, you will have a size that is closer to that of an acre, about ninety-six percent closer. In yards, these dimensions are about 120 by 53.3. These measurements for the length of the football field already include ten yards each for the two end zones. The goal posts for the American Football field should be at least thirty feet in height while the crossbar should be at least ten feet high.

The length of the Football/Soccer field for international adult matches is in the range 110-120 yards (100-110 m) and the width is in the range 70-80 yards (64-75 m), while American football fields are 120 yards (109.7 m) long, that's including the 10 yard (9.1m) for the goal area on. Most international matches are 120x 80 yds. A football field is 120x 53.3 yds. Therefore the answer varies depending on the soccer venue.

Both are about the same length, though soccer is about 20 yards wider. And there's a lot more running in soccer. Soccer is played by two teams of 11 players each. The field for international matches is in the range of 110-120 yards long and 70-80 yards wide. The length must always be greater than the width. American football has 11 players per side. The field is 120 yards long (100 yards of playing field with two 10 yard end zones) and 53 1/3 yards wide. I would love to play soccer, but I'm still trying to break the 10-minute barrier on the treadmill. 
The Answer: Yes. Often an acre of land is compared to a football field. In reality, an acre is equal to about 76% of a football field, when you consider both end zones. A football field (including the two end zones) is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide for a total of 57,600 square feet. When you take away the two 30-foot-long end zones at each end, the field is 48,000 square feet, making an acre about 91% of the field.
