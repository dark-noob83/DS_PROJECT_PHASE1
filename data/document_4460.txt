A pollinator is different from a pollenizer, which is a plant that is a source of pollen for the pollination process. Main articles: pollination syndromes and list of crop plants pollinated by bees. Wild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are visited by a large number of pollinator species.
Anthecology is the scientific study of pollination. Insect pollinators include bees, (honey bees, solitary species, bumblebees); pollen wasps (Masarinae); ants; a variety of flies including bee flies and hoverflies; lepidopterans, both butterflies and moths; and flower beetles.

Wild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are visited by a large number of pollinator species.
In contrast, cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther in a flower in one plant to the stigma in a separate flower in another plant. Cross-pollination, therefore, necessarily involves two flowers and two plants. Types of Pollinators: Abiotic vs. Biotic. Various types of pollination have also been identified based on the vectors of pollen grains or agents of pollination. These pollinators are described under two main classifications: (1) abiotic, i.e, nonliving pollinators, and (2) biotic, i.e., living pollinators.
Pollination is a process in which pollen is transferred to the female reproductive organs of seed plants, thereby enabling fertilization and reproduction through growth of the pollen tube and eventual release of sperm. The receptive part of the carpel is called a stigma in the flowers of angiosperms. The receptive part of the gymnosperm ovule is called the micropyle. Pollination is a necessary step in the reproduction of flowering plants, resulting in the production of offspring that are genetically diverse.
Biotic pollen vectors are animals, usually insects, but also reptiles, birds, mammals, and sundry others, that routinely transport pollen and play a role in pollination. This is usually as a result of their activities when visiting plants for feeding, breeding or shelter. The receptive part of the carpel is called a stigma in the flowers of angiosperms. The receptive part of the gymnosperm ovule is called the micropyle. Pollination is a necessary step in the reproduction of flowering plants, resulting in the production of offspring that are genetically diverse.
This wasp is a specialist pollinator of Penstemon, which is the flower it is visiting, or rather sleeping in here. Photo by Dr. Jim Cane, USDA ARS Bee Biology and Systematics Laboratory, Logan, Utah. Pollination is the act of transferring pollen grains from the male anther of a flower to the female stigma. The goal of every living organism, including plants, is to create offspring for the next generation. One of the ways that plants can produce offspring is by making seeds
The pollination process as an interaction between flower and pollen vector was first addressed in the 18th century by Christian Konrad Sprengel. It is important in horticulture and agriculture, because fruiting is dependent on fertilization: the result of pollination. The receptive part of the carpel is called a stigma in the flowers of angiosperms. The receptive part of the gymnosperm ovule is called the micropyle. Pollination is a necessary step in the reproduction of flowering plants, resulting in the production of offspring that are genetically diverse.
A pollinator is the biotic agent (vector) that moves pollen from the male anthers of a flower to the female stigma of a flower to accomplish fertilization or 'syngamy' of the female gametes in the ovule of the flower by the male gametes from the pollen grain.

Wild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are visited by a large number of pollinator species.
Plants can be: 1  Self-pollinating-the plant can fertilize itself; or, 2  Cross-pollinating-the plant needs a vector (a pollinator or the wind) to get the pollen to another flower of the same species. Pollination is the act of transferring pollen grains from the male anther of a flower to the female stigma. The goal of every living organism, including plants, is to create offspring for the next generation.
The transfer of pollen from a stamen to a pistil; fertilization in flowering plants. It takes place through self-pollination or cross-pollination. Please note that this answer â€¦ refers specifically to the pollination of angiosperms and gymnosperms. Self-pollination: Please see the related link below. Cross-pollination: The process in which the pollen from the anther of the male flower of a plant comes into contact with the ovary of a female flower from another plant, resulting in
