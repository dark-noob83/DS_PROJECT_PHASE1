Solar Panels. The solar panels themselves usually account for about 30% of total costs. Residential solar panels with a combined capacity of 3-8kW typically cost between $4,000-$16,000. The best solar panels are not necessarily the most expensive. We decided to pull together all aspects of this question, and write the best resource on the costs of solar panels you will find on the entire Internet. Residential solar systems are typically sized from 3 to 8kW and end up costing between $15,000 and $40,000.
The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.72/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. “Common residential system prices ranged from less than $3.00/W to just above $7.00/W,” the Solar Energy Industries Association writes. 
13 Cost of Solar Panels & Cost of Solar Power Charts &Graphs. 1. The average cost of solar panels has gone from $76.67/watt in 1977 to just $0.613/watt today (the second figure is according to PVinsights, and is even lower than the 2013 projected price in the chart below).
The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.93/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. Credit: Cost of Solar. Studies have found that the average solar homeowner will save about $20,000 over 20 years from going solar. In three of the four most populous states in the country, that 20-year total is actually $30,000. In Hawaii, it’s up above $60,000! And that’s just the average
1 Simplistic estimation of FITs income – For a solar panel installation under a FITs scheme of $0.35c per kWh you will receive on average 1650 kwh x 0.35$/kwh = approx. 2  $580 per year per kW installed. i.e. a 5kw home solar panels system will generate 5x$580 = $2900 per year. 1 Overall (Average) Solar panels cost (from recently updated figures in 2013) ranges between $1750 – $2500 per Kw of installed capacity (average Solar panel cost per kw). 2  This figure includes purchasing the equipment and cost for solar panel installation.
So what is the current cost of residential solar power? As of early 2015, it’s approximately $3.00 per installed watt. The average sized solar panel system is 5,000 watts, so this brings the total cost to $15,000. That 15k figure is just an average amount. Systems can cost more or less mostly depending upon a homeowner’s energy usage.
The effective rate for solar power spread across the life of a system is $0.08/kWh. The average cost for conventional energy is $0.12/kWh and rising. The price for solar panel installation will be continued to be updated on this page. The average sized solar panel system is 5,000 watts, so this brings the total cost to $15,000. That 15k figure is just an average amount. Systems can cost more or less mostly depending upon a homeowner’s energy usage.
