Glucophage is a drug that is used to treat diabetes. It has a half life of 4 to 8 hours, which means that about 4 to 8 hours after you take it, only half of the dose is left in your system. Depending on how your body metabolizes this drug, it is typically gone from your system in one to two days.

It has a half-life of 6.2-17.6 hours. It is not metabolized, but secreted in the urine. The mechanism of action is thought to be due to increasing the binding of insulin to its receptor, which means it improves tissue sensitivity to insulin.
Metformin takes longer to bring down your sugar levels than changing your diet. I'm Type 1, but was diagnosed as T2 originally and put on metformin. Numbers were down in 2 days because of my diet change... when I eventually came off the metformin, no change in my numbers because I wasn't insulin resistant...
Hello... I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around Feb 2012. I was on metformin 500mg 2 times a day for 6 months. My recent A1c reading is 5.7 and now my gp has taken me off of metformin to see if my glucose levels could be maintained by just my diet/exercise.
