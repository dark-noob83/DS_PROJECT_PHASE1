As you can see, one side shows a fraction, written in numerals. The other side shows a fraction circle. The fractions in the set are 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/6 and 5/6. Just about any game you can play with a normal set of dominoes, you can play with this set. Since there are 49 dominoes in this set instead of 28, you can have larger groups of kids involved in the fraction activity. On the other hand, smaller groups will work just as well as they do for ordinary dominoes.
Set 3 This set is aimed at Years 5 and 6. There are 24 dominoes in the set each with one fraction as a picture and one in numeric form. The complete set of 24 will make a loop. Many of the pictures in this set feature equivalent fractions. However, all numeric fractions are in their lowest terms. This is illustrated in the examples on the left.
