The most recent published industry source (August 1999) on tantalum product prices indicated that theaverage selling prices per pound tantalum content for some tantalum products were as follows: capacitor-gradepowder, $135 to $260; capacitor wire, $180 to $270; and vacuum-grade metal for superalloys, $75 to $100. 
I think it's gotten close to $50 per kilo. I'm invested in a stock SRSR Sarissa Resources Inc. and I've heard $22-23 per pound batted around the last few months. The metals websites with the prices are too expensive for me to get a membership, so I just read around to see what shows up in articles from time to time. 
The overallaverage unit price for the sales, about $6.40 per pound ofcontained columbium, was somewhat less than that quotedfor ferrocolumbium, $6.88 per pound of containedcolumbium.In 1998, the leading Brazilian columbium producer initiatedplans to raise its ferrocolumbium production capacity byabout 50% by 2000. In 1979, the increase in demand for“high-purity” ferrocolumbium in superalloys was significant.This increased columbium demand affected the prices forhigh-purity ferrocolumbium and for columbite, but had no realimpact on the price for standard ferrocolumbium.
The more pure the, more expensive, and the more you are willing to buy, the cheaper it is per a pound. 50 people found this useful. 1  An Overview of the Element Niobium If you like chemistry, you are most likely interested in the many chemical elements that form the periodic table of the elements.

1 Houston, 7 October (Argus) — US ferrous scrap prices have dropped by $50 per gross ton in most regions of the country as mill demand for scrap nosedived. 2  A few large producers are now pushing for decreases of up to $60/gt below prior month settlements. 1 Houston, 8 October (Argus) — Aluminum producer Alcoa's profit slumped by more than 300pc in the third quarter as its primary metals division reported a loss. 2  Alcoa's profit slipped to $44mn in the latest quarter from $149mn the same period last year, the company said today.
The average cost of niobium is $25 to $30 per pound. Niobium or columbium is the chemical element with the symbol `Nb’ and the atomic number 41. A rare, soft, grey, ductile transition metal, niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to tantalum and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish. Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron. Niobium is mostly used in alloys and although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1% of niobium, that small percentage is enough to improve the strength of the steel.
