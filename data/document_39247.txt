To make funds available as quickly as possible, get them deposited: use remote check deposit when available, and deposit checks early in the day to make that day's cut-off time. Your bank will often tell you that your deposits will be held for 5 days or so, but in many cases the funds will come available more quickly.
Check Clearing Times. The exact time it takes for a check to clear depends on bank policies and the nature of the deposit. Most national banks promise that deposited checks will clear and post to your account either the same day or the next business day. If the account is less than 30 days old, the check may take a few extra days to clear.
Clearing Checks You Write. You might wonder how long it takes a check to clear after you write it, and there's no great answer (it depends on several factors). It usually takes a few days for the checks you write to hit your account, but that timeline is compressing rapidly since the Check 21 law passed.
When banks clear checks, the money is taken from a checking account and sent to the check recipient. Depending on your perspective, this process might be painfully slow or a little too fast -- most people are in a hurry for deposits to clear, while hoping for a few extra days if they wrote the check.
The first $200 of your total deposits will be available immediately on the business day of the deposit. Deposits of $5,000 or less usually clear within 3 business days. Deposits of more than $5,000 usually take 4 business days to clear.
Before 2003, banks faced some legal impediments that could delay check clearing. Now, thanks to the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, banks are allowed to immediately and efficiently clear checks using a substitute check system. Most national banks clear checks within a few business days.
