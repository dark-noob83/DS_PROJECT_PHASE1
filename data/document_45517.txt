Loss of myelin leads to a varietyof symptoms If the myelin sheath surrounding nervefibres is damaged or destroyed,transmission of nerve impulses isslowed or blocked. The impulse nowhas to flow continuously along thewhole nerve fibre â€“ a process that ismuch slower than jumping from nodeto node.
Each neuron is made up of a cell body and an axon (the extension of the cell body that carries messages). Most of the axons in the central nervous system are wrapped in myelin, a substance rich in lipids (fatty substances) and proteins.
Schwann cells make myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS: nerves) and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS: brain and spinal cord). In the PNS, one Schwann cell forms a single myelin sheath (Figure 1A).
The myelin sheath is a protective covering that surrounds fibres called axons, the long thin projections that extend from the main body of a nerve cell or neuron. This sheath is composed of protein and lipids.
Myelin Function. By Sally Robertson, BSc. The myelin sheath is a protective covering that surrounds fibres called axons, the long thin projections that extend from the main body of a nerve cell or neuron. This sheath is composed of protein and lipids.
Myelin is an insulating layer, or sheath, that forms around nerves, including those in the brain and spinal cord. It is made up of protein and fatty substances. The purpose of the myelin sheath is to allow electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells.
Myelin is a substance which encloses the axons of neurons, providing electrical insulation that helps the nervous system function. The importance of this substance is most evident in the types of diseases that develop when it is damaged or destroyed.
