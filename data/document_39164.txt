Spirometry. Spirometry is the first and most commonly done lung function test. It measures how much and how quickly you can move air out of your lungs. For this test, you breathe into a mouthpiece attached to a recording device (spirometer).
The instrument used to measure lung capacity and volume is called a spirometer. The record obtained from this device is called a spirogram.
Spirometry is a test that can help diagnose various lung conditions, most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Spirometry is also used to monitor the severity of some other lung conditions, and their response to treatment.
A spirometer can be used to determine how well the lungs receive, hold, and utilise air. They are also used to monitor and determine the severity of a lung disease and to determine whether the lung disease is restrictive (decreased airflow) or obstructive (disruption of airflow).
Windmill-type spirometer. Wedge spirometer. Ultrasonic spirometer. The instrument used to measure lung capacity and volume is called a spirometer. The record obtained from this device is called a spirogram. A spirometer is an apparatus for measuring the volume of air inspired and expired by the lungs.
Spirometry is the most common of the lung function tests. These tests look at how well your lungs work. Spirometry shows how well you breathe in and out. Breathing in and out can be affected by lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis.
Breathing can be hard after you've had surgery, when you have a lung disease like COPD, or if you're on bed rest. You may find that you can only take small, shallow breaths. Breathing this way makes it harder to get air into your lungs and can cause fluid and mucus to build up in your lungs.
