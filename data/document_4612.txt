Nitrates open (dilate) the arteries to the heart. This increases blood flow to the heart, relieving angina symptoms such as chest pain or pressure. Nitrates also dilate veins throughout the body so that they can hold more blood. This reduces the amount of blood going back to the heart, reducing the heart's workload.
Nitrates are medications used for treating or preventing chest pain (angina) caused by heart disease, usually of the arteries in the heart. Nitrates are vasodilators (dilators of blood vessels that increase their diameter) that allow blood to flow more easily.
