COLUMBUS, Ohio-Equestrian Indian tribes on the American Plains in the late 1800s were the tallest people in the world, suggesting that they were surprisingly well-nourished given disease and their lifestyle, a new study found. What these height data show is the ingenuity and adaptability of the equestrian Plains tribes in the face of remarkable stress from disease and hardship, Steckel said. The average adult male Plains Indian stood 172.6 centimeters tall -- about 5 feet 8 inches. The next tallest people in the world at that time were Australian men, who averaged 172 centimeters.

The Native Americans were a vast number of people, in different tribes, in different environments. When Europeans first came here, they encountered agricultural people who got plenty of protein from the ocean, bays and rivers. Don't know measurements, but I've read that the Native Americans in the Northeast were taller and of better health than the European peasants at the time.
