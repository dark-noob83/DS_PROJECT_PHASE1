What Is a Felony? In criminal law, a felony is a category of crimes that are often classified as the most serious types of offenses, and they can be either violent or non-violent.
The main difference between a felony and a misdemeanor is the severity of the crime. What is considered to be a severe crime will vary from society to society and, sometimes, from state to state. Both felonies and misdemeanors can be committed against people, property, or the state.
Felony crimes are usually classified in contrast with misdemeanor crimes. Misdemeanors are less serious crimes that usually result in a small fine and/or jail time of less than one year in a jail facility rather than a prison facility. Thus the question of what is a felony usually revolves around the length of imprisonment that may result from the commission of a crime.
