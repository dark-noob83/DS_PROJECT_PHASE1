If you are talking about the alcohol, it takes and hour for you body to dissolve (for lack of a better word) 1 beer, shot, or glass of wine. So two drinks, two hours, ect. ect … . The EtG, a widely-used urine alcohol test is unreliable. Unfortunately, is sensitive for several days after any exposure to alcohol products.
It is those BAC readings that can be used to interpret how long does alcohol stay in your system.

Depends on how fast you metabolize alcohol and how big the glass is, but usually a human will metabolize it at the rate of 1 oz. per hour. Assuming the wine is a standard 12% … ABV, then for a normal glass I'd say about 1 to 11/2 hour.
Confidence votes 16.4K. On average it takes the body 3 hours to metabolize one ounce of wine. Therefore, a standard five ounce glass of wine will be in your system for approximately 15 hours. It takes about an hour for the body to metabolize one standard drink (five ounces of dinner wine).
Alcohol is metabolized at a different rate in each person, but there are some factors that play a role in how long alcohol stays in your system. The body can metabolize about one drink per hour, which is the equivalent of the following: 1  One can of beer or a 12-ounce glass. 2  Five ounces of wine.
If you drink a large (250ml) glass of wine, your body takes about three hours to break down the alcohol. If you drink one pint of beer, your body takes about two hours to break it down. One pint of strong lager is equivalent to three units, so this will take longer.
No, alcohol is usually not detected for long in a blood test. Usually, blood tests are given to see how much alcohol is in your system AT THAT MOMENT. So, the wine last week will not show up in the blood test before treatment.
However, 20 drinks is a negligible amount of alcohol in your system and even this amount of alcohol in your bloodstream is not detectable after 24 hours. Check out the BAC calculator above to calculate different drink combinations within a 24 hour period.
