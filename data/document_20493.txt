The molt can last from 3 months and occasionally for up to 5 months depending on the condition of the bird at the start of molt. A good tonic added to the drinking water will help speed this along. 40 people found this useful.
There were many crawfish (all the same size) in the tank at the pet store where we purchased him (Captain Kirk, the explorer), but I've been told that there is still a crawfish there from his bunch and it is humongous-like 5 times the size of our crayfish.
How Often Do Crawfish Molt? in the Crayfish-Crawfish forums, part of the Freshwater Invertebrates category. Right now though, I am a bit concerned about our crayfish. He has not molted for quite some time now and I was wondering if there was a fixed cycle or something.
Since then (about 5 months), the crayfish has molted 3 additional times, all overnight. It's now up to about 7 inches, and hasn't molted in about 3 months. I found that when it had a supply of live fish to eat (darn!), he molted quite frequently. Since I've moved the cray into it's own 10G, he hasn't molted at all.

The increase in crawfish size during molting, and the length of time between molts, can vary greatly and are affected by factors such as water temperature, water quality, food quality and quantity, population density, oxygen levels and to a lesser extent by genetic influences.
