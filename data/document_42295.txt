The bottom number, called the diastolic pressure, is the measurement as the heart relaxes between beats. Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension
Normal limits. Normal pulse rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Heart rate slowly decreases with age, due to changes in the heart muscle as it ages. Therefore, the resting heart rate of the elderly will usually be slower than that of a younger adult. Your pulse is the surge you feel each time your heart beats and pushes your blood along your artery. The number of surges you count in a minute is your pulse rate, or your heart
Tachycardia. Historically, tachycardia has been defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, although there is a current push to lower that to between 80 and 89 for the elderly. Cardiologists agree that tachycardia is a strong indicator of heart disease, high blood pressure, clogged arteries and heart failure. Your pulse is the surge you feel each time your heart beats and pushes your blood along your artery. The number of surges you count in a minute is your pulse rate, or your heartbeats per minute.
For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the personâ€™s physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA. Heart rate, also known as pulse, is the number of times a person's heart beats per minute. A normal heart rate depends on the individual, age, body size, heart conditions, whether the person is sitting or moving, medication use and even air temperature. Even emotions can have an impact on heart rate.
The pulse rate is a measurement of the heart rate, or the number of times the heart beats per minute. As the heart pushes blood through the arteries, the arteries expand and contract with the flow of the blood. Taking a pulse not only measures the heart rate, but also can indicate the following: Heart rhythm. Strength of the pulse. The normal pulse for healthy adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. The pulse rate may fluctuate and increase with exercise, illness, injury, and emotions. Females ages 12 and older, in general, tend to have faster heart rates than do males

Your pulse is your heart rate, or the number of times your heart beats in one minute. 2 Pulse rates vary from person to person. Your pulse is lower when you are at rest and increases when you exercise (more oxygen-rich blood is needed by the body when you exercise). 1 A normal adult resting heart beat is between 60-100 heartbeats per minute. 2  Some experienced athletes may see their resting heartrate fall below 60 beats per minute. 3  Tachycardia refers to the heart beating too fast at rest-over 10
A heart that beats more than 100 times per minute is a condition known as tachycardia and is most prevalent in the elderly. According to medrounds.org, 88 percent of those over the age of 70 have experienced a type of fast heart rate called sinus tachycardia. Photo Credit Jupiterimages/BananaStock/Getty Images. A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. A person who is very athletic, however, may have a heart rate as low as 4
