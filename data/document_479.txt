porifera means pore bearing sponges are covered with tiny pores on the outside called ostia 2 ostia lead to an internal system of canals which leads to one or more larger holes called oscula which are the openings to the out side ostia are surrounded by donut shaped cells called porocytes the life of a sponge elephant ear sponge 2006 richard ling the word sponge for most of us relates to the scrubbing sponge or a bath sponge it is easy to forget that there is much more to sponges than the scrubbing and bath the sponges are living animals that live in the water
sponges are classified in the phylum porifera a word that comes from the latin words porus pore and ferre bear meaning pore bearer this is a reference to the numerous holes pores on the sponge s surface sponges do not have tissues or organs like some animals do but they have specialized cells to perform necessary functions these cells each have a job some are in charge of digestion some reproduction some bringing in water so the sponge can filter feed and some for getting rid of wastes
sponges are the simplest form of multi cellular animals they are very diverse and come in a large variety of colours shapes and structural complexities they range in heights of 1 200cm and in diameters of 1 150cm they have partially differentiated tissues and not true tissues sponges don t have internal organs they don t have muscles a nervous system or a circulatory system their walls are lined with many small pores called ostia that allow water flow into the sponge the structure of a sponge is simple one end is attached to a solid such as a rock while the other end called the osculum is open to the environment sponges are able to get microorganisms such as algae and bacteria for food through openings
unlike the cells of most other animals the cells of sponges do not form into various organs like kidney liver or nerves sponge cells are totipotent dawkins 2004 the totipotent cells could give rise to reproductive cells or other types of cells of the organism the life of a sponge elephant ear sponge 2006 richard ling the word sponge for most of us relates to the scrubbing sponge or a bath sponge it is easy to forget that there is much more to sponges than the scrubbing and bath the sponges are living animals that live in the water
the skeleton or structure of sponges is formed by spicules which are made of silica a glass like material or calcareous calcium or calcium carbonate materials and spongin a protein that supports the spicules sponge species may be most readily identified by examining their spicules under a microscope sponges do not have tissues or organs like some animals do but they have specialized cells to perform necessary functions these cells each have a job some are in charge of digestion some reproduction some bringing in water so the sponge can filter feed and some for getting rid of wastes
porifera the cells sponges have a cellular grade of organization they do not possess any structures that can be considered organs for instance sponges do not have stomachs or kidneys instead sponge cells of various types are responsible for bodily functions the day to day activities that sustain life many of the most common types of cells are illustrated below in a cartoon view of the wall of a poriferan
the phylum porifera consists of the sponges to make it into the porifera phylum an animal must have no true tissue some contain spicules a skeletal element and all contain choanocysts a type of cell which move water through the porous bodies of poriferas porifera also have totipotent cells which have the cabalitity of changing into whatever type of cell is needed by the organism 
reproduction by sponges is by both sexual and asexual means asexual reproduction is by means of external buds some species also form internal buds called gemmules which can survive extremely unfavorable conditions that cause the rest of the sponge to die sexual reproduction takes place in the mesohyl other characteristics of sponges include a system of pores also called ostia and canals through which water passes water movement is driven by the beating of flagellae which are located on specialized cells called choanocytes collar cells
