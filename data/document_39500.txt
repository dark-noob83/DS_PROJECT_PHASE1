The store wants to determine the optimal order size and total inventory cost for this brand of carpet given an estimated annual demand of 10,000 yards of carpet, an annual carrying cost of $0.75 per yard, and an ordering cost of $150. The total annual ordering cost is computed by multiplying the cost per order, designated as Co, times the number of orders per year. Since annual demand, D, is assumed to be known and to be constant, the number of orders will be D/Q, where Q is the order size and.
ABC Ltd. is engaged in sale of footballs. Its cost per order is $400 and its carrying cost unit is $10 per unit per annum. The company has a demand for 20,000 units per year. Calculate the order size, total orders required during a year, total carrying cost and total ordering cost for the year. EOQ = SQRT(2 × 20,000 × 400/10) = 1,265 units. Annual demand is 20,000 units so the company will have to place 16 orders (= annual demand of 20,000 divided by order size of 1,265). Total ordering cost is hence $64,000 ($400 multiplied by 16). Average inventory held is 632.5 ((0+1,265)/2) which means total carrying costs of $6,325 (i.e. 632.5 × $10)
The total inventory cost for a year for a business is simply the sum of the carrying cost and the ordering cost. The total inventory cost formula is below, and the total inventory cost calculator can be found on this website. C=Carrying cost per unit of inventory. Q=Inventory order size (quantity). The cost of carrying inventory can be calculated by multiplying the cost of carrying a unit of inventory by the average number of units carried, usually for a year. If inventory is used at a steady pace, and restocked when empty, then the average number of units held would be the order size divided by 2.
Calculate the numerator: 2 Annual Usage in units (100 units) Order Cost ($500) = $100,000. Divide the numerator ($100,000) by the Annual Carrying Cost per Unit ($100). This equals 1,000 units. Take the square root of 1,000 units. A simple way to find the square root is to raise a number to the 1/2 power.
We can determine the ordering cost by calculating the number of orders in a year, and multiply this by the cost of each order. To determine the number of orders we simply divide the total demand (D) of units per year by Q, the size of each inventory order. The cost of carrying inventory can be calculated by multiplying the cost of carrying a unit of inventory by the average number of units carried, usually for a year. If inventory is used at a steady pace, and restocked when empty, then the average number of units held would be the order size divided by 2.
Current Inventory $: Input your current total inventory (dollars). Carrying Cost of Inventory %: Input your annual carrying cost percentage. Carrying costs are typically between 24% to 48% per year. If you don’t know your Inventory Carrying Cost, the following will assist you in calculating it
Total Inventory Cost. Total Inventory cost is the total cost associated with ordering and carrying inventory, not including the actual cost of the inventory itself. It is important for companies to understand what factors influence the total cost they pay, so as to be able to minimize it. 
The cost of holding an item in inventoy for a year is Fc and the average amount of inventery in stock is Q/2 (halfway between empty and full), thus the carrying cost is Fc*Q/2. The sum gives you the formula for total inventory ordering and carrying costs. This formula assumes there is no discount for ordering items in bulk. Example: A business has an annual demand of 10,000 for a particular item. They order the item in batches of 1,000 and each order placement has a fixed cost of $120. The cost to hold an item in inventory is $0.80. Since we know D = 10000, Q = 1000, Fo = 120, and Fc = 0.8, we can compute the total cost:
