Obturator nerve. The obturator nerve begins at the medial border of the psoas major muscle. It travels through the obturator foramen (an opening in the pelvic bone) before entering the thigh, where it branches into two parts, an anterior branch and posterior branch.
Obturator nerve is the nerve that supplies muscles to thigh’s medial side and rises from lumbar plexus with root value ± and ventral segmentation belonging to L2 3 4. It travels deep into medial margin of psoas major and then goes further deep into external iliac vessels.
The obturator nerve can be damaged through injury to the nerve itself or to surrounding muscle tissue. This type of injury can occur during household or car accidents and it can also happen accidentally during abdominal surgery. A damaged obturator nerve can cause pain, numbness, and weakness of the thigh.
The obturator nerve is supplied by L2-L4 nerve roots and innervates the medial thigh and hip joint. The motor portion innervates a portion of the adductors while the sensory supplies the medial thigh. Because if its deeper location, it is more difficult to assess and diagnose.
obturator nerve. n. A nerve that arises from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves in the psoas muscle, enters the thigh through the obturator canal, and supplies the muscles and skin on the medial side of the thigh.
The obturator nerve is formed by the anterior divisions of the second, third and fourth lumbar nerves. It descends through the fibres of the p soas major muscle and emerges from its medial border, running posteriorly to the common iliac arteries and laterally along the pelvic wall to the obturator foramen.
