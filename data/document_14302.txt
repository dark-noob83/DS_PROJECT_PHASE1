Glucose is the primary source of energy for human and also animal cells. It is actually a type of sugar, which transverses through the blood stream. The body gets its supply of glucose when carbohydrates are consumed. The levels of glucose in the body are regulated by insulin and glucagon.
Glucose. Glucose is a carbohydrate, and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism. Glucose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates. Glucose is also sometimes called dextrose. Corn syrup is primarily glucose.
Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store glucose for future use. Insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia).
Glucose is a simple sugar that provides the body with its primary source of energy. This type of sugar comes from digesting carbohydrates into a chemical that the body can easily convert to energy.
Glucose is the source of energy for all of our body functions, especially the brain. The only energy the brain can use is from glucose. Glucose is also the primary source of energy for muscles, backed up by other sources if it runs out. Proteins, for example, are for building the tissues that use glucose.
Blood sugar or blood glucose are shortened terms for blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level. Most mammals maintain their blood glucose levels at between 3.6 and 5.8 mM (mmol/l). The average human blood glucose level is approximately 90 mg/dl, which is equivalent to 5

The sugar is made from the food we eat. The human body regulates blood glucose levels so that they are neither too high nor too low-maintaining a condition of stability or equilibrium in the blood's internal environment (homeostasis) is necessary for our bodies to function.
