Trout Life Cycle. Trout can live for about seven years. Most trout are born, grow up, lay eggs and die in lakes or streams. Some trout, though, become very large migratory fish and travel more in their seven years than some people do in a lifetime. In this way, they are similar to their salmon relatives.
The common size that many anglers catch from heavily fished streams or lakes is 150 to 250 mm (6 to 10 in), but in areas of little fishing, they can get as large as 400 mm (15 in). Those that live along the shores of Lake Superior reach 600 mm (24 in). The state angling record is 3 kg (6 lbs.
The adult trout may be as small as 13 to 18 in (33 to 46 cm) with a weight of 1.0 to 2.5 pounds (0.45 to 1.1 kg). However, individual fish may be much larger, from 10 pounds u â€¦ p to 30 pounds (4.5 to 13.5 kg) with a length of up to 36 inches (92 cm). The record for a rainbow trout (steelhead) is 48 pounds (22 kg).

How Long Do They Live? In Lake Superior, steelhead used to exceed 750 mm (30 in) and 6.8 kg (15 lbs), but now most angler catch ones 600-700 cm (24-28 in) and 1.4-3.6 kg (3-8 lbs). Inland rainbows are considerably smaller fish, 375 mm (15 in) long and 2.5 kg (5.5lbs) are lunkers. Most rainbows live for 3-4 years.
Brook trout have few aquatic predators because few piscivorous (fish-eating) fish live where they do. Larger trout, especially brown trout, eat smaller brook trout. They are more likely to be eaten by such fish-eating birds as herons, and kingfishers. Otters and snapping turtles also prey upon them.
