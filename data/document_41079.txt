It is our hope that new generations of psychologists and social scientists will be fluent in Darwinian principles and modern evolutionary biology and that just as Darwin predicted, “psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. At the end of his classic treatise in 1859, On the Origin of Species, Darwin envisioned that in the distant future, the field of psychology would be based on a new foundation—that of evolutionary theory. A century and a half later, it’s clear that his vision proved prescient (Buss, 2009).
EP is a synthesis of modern evolutionary theory, studies of behaviour inspired by evolutionary theory, and cognitive psychology. It proposes an integrative perspective for psychology, and as such, it aspires to become the first real unifying paradigm of psychology (Buss, 1995a, 1995b; La Cerra & Kurzban, 1995). Evolutionary Psychology (EP) is an emerging integrative approach to the study of Human Nature, founded upon evolutionary biological theory and cognitive science.
Evolutionary psychology is based on the theory that human physiology and psychology are the result of genes. Evolutionary psychologists assume that genes contain instructions for building and operating an organism and that these instructions are passed from one generation to the next via genes. The evolutionary psychology response to critics has been covered in books by Segerstrale (segerstråle), 2000 defenders of The: Truth The battle For science in The Sociobiology debate And, Beyond (barkow), 2005 missing The: Revolution darwinism For Social, scientists And (alcock), 2001 The triumph Of. s
It is also a sociocultural phenomenon, but as culture is a product of Human Nature, culture is also a biological phenomenon. Thus psychology is a life science, and is approached in an anti-dualistic manner. The theory of evolution is therefore essential to studying psychology. Evolutionary Psychology (EP) is an emerging integrative approach to the study of Human Nature, founded upon evolutionary biological theory and cognitive science.
One aspect of evolutionary psychology is finding traits that have been shown to be universal in humans. Many critics have pointed out that many traits considered universal at some stage or another by evolutionary psychologists often turn out to be dependent on cultural and particular historical circumstances.

A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION: At the core of evolutionary psychology is the belief that all humans on the planet have innate areas in their brains which have specific knowledge that help them adapt to local environments. These areas are highly specialized, and only activate when the information is needed. As defined by Tooby and Cosmides: Evolutionary psychology is simply psychology that is informed by the additional knowledge that evolutionary biology has to offer, in the expectation that understanding the process that designed the human mind will advance the discovery of its architecture..
In commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his seminal work On the Origin of Species, this edition of Psychological Science Agenda includes a special section on evolutionary theory and psychology. At the end of his classic treatise in 1859, On the Origin of Species, Darwin envisioned that in the distant future, the field of psychology would be based on a new foundation—that of evolutionary theory. A century and a half later, it’s clear that his vision proved prescient (Buss, 2009).
In this broad sense, evolutionary psychology is a general field of inquiry that includes such diverse approaches as human behavioral ecology, memetics, dual-inheritance theory, and Evolutionary Psychology in the narrow sense. Evolutionary Psychology. In its broad sense, the term evolutionary psychology stands for any attempt to adopt an evolutionary perspective on human behavior by supplementing psychology with the central tenets of evolutionary biology.
Moral psychology, broadly construed, deals with issues relating to motivation of moral action. More specifically, it concerns how we see or fail to see moral issues, why we act or fail to act morally, and whether and to what extent we are responsible for our actions. The feminist contribution to moral psychology has been at least three-fold. First, some feminists emphasize the role of emotion in action; in particular, they stress the motive of care in prompting action.
Feminist moral psychology deals with what feminists, in particular, have contributed to the field of moral psychology, or the ways in which their approach to these issues is motivated by feminist concerns, especially in connection to understanding and attempting to end women's oppression. The feminist contribution to moral psychology has been at least three-fold. First, some feminists emphasize the role of emotion in action; in particular, they stress the motive of care in prompting action.
