The “Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010” addresses sodium intake in detail. The average daily sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 milligrams per day, an excessive amount that raises blood pressure and poses health risks. In general, Americans should limit daily sodium consumption to 2,300 milligrams, but this is an upper safe limit, not a recommended daily allowance. Even active people who lose lots of sodium through sweating require no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day. The FDA urges Americans to limit dietary sodium. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that individuals consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, and that certain groups limit intake to 1,500 milligrams per day.
The minimum requirement of sodium for normal body function is about 500 mg/day. The recommendation for sodium intake is less than 2,300 mg/day for adults. This equals about one teaspoon of table salt. Most people consume far too much sodium through processed foods and table salt, therefore, this recommendation is set at an upper limit. 
Most Americans will benefit from a lower sodium diet. Look for foods that have fewer than 200 milligrams of sodium per serving. Look for low sodium on the food label; this means the food has fewer than 140 milligrams of sodium per serving. Eat more fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium. Aim for 2,300 milligrams of sodium or less per day. Evidence shows that consuming too much sodium can raise blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can also lead to heart disease, kidney disease and congestive heart failure.
Most Canadians consume far more sodium than is needed. The recommended amount per day is between 1500 mg (considered adequate intake) and 2300 mg (upper amount) for people 9 -50 years of age. For people over 50 years of age, an adequate intake drops to 1300 mg per day until 70 and then 1200 mg over 70 years of age.
A. 1  Eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. 2  Consume foods that are rich in potassium. 3  Potassium can help blunt the effects of sodium on blood pressure. 4  The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. 1 Potassium can help blunt the effects of sodium on blood pressure. 2  The recommended intake of potassium for adolescents and adults is 4,700 mg/day. 3  Potassium-rich foods include leafy, green vegetables and fruits from vines. 4  Flavor food with pepper and other herbs and spices instead of salt. 5  Choose unsalted snacks.
What Do the 2010 Guidelines Say About Sodium? The problem of eating too much sodium is covered in the report: n The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommend that Americans aged 2 and up reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day. 
Recommended intake of sodium. It is recommended that people over the age of one year eat between 1000-1500 mg sodium per day. This is referred to as the Adequate Intake (AI) . People aged 14 and over should not eat more than 2300 mg sodium per day. This is referred to the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). A sodium intake above 2300 mg per day is likely to pose a health risk. 
1 The Nutrition Facts Label lists the Percent Daily Value (%DV) of sodium in one serving of a food. 2  The %DV for sodium is based on 100% of the recommended amount of sodium, which is less than 2400 milligrams (mg) per day. 1 Read the Nutrition Facts Label to see how much sodium is in the foods you are considering. 2  All Americans should consume less than 100% of the Daily Value or less than 2400 mg of sodium each day.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans also recommend meeting the potassium recommendation (4,700 mg per day). Higher potassium intake can help lower blood pressure. Foods that are high in potassium and low in sodium include bananas, potatoes, yogurt, and dry beans, among others. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 [PDF-2.9M] recommend that everyone age 2 and up should consume less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium each day. Some groups of people should further limit sodium intake to 1,500 mg per day, including: 1  Adults age 51 or older. 2  All African Americans.
