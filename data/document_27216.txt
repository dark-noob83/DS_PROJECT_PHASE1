, adenovirus does not measurably precipitate at concentrations of domiphen bromide below 0.05%. Therefore, addition of domiphen bromide at levels between 0.03 and 0.05% will result in selective precipitation of DNA. For the particular stream properties used here, addition at 0.04% is suitable for all serotypes. A first step in a purification process of the present invention is a host cell lysis step, which provides for maximum release of adenovirus particles from the cells as well as providing for an opportunity to potentially inactivate adventitious agents.

Catalog No.S4186. Domiphen bromide is a quaternary ammonium antiseptic with actions as a cationic surfactant. In vitro. Recombinant 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol synthase (IspD) is sensitive to Domiphen Bromide (DMB), as observed through an IspD activity assay. The inhibitory effect of DMB on IspD is confirmed by both the newly-established high-throughput screening system and traditional enzyme kinetic assays

A preferred host cell is a host cell line which supports infection and replication of an E1 and/or and E1/E3 deleted recombinant adenovirus. As disclosed herein, such a replication-incompetent virus (such an Ad5gag, as exemplified herein) requires a helper cell line which complements the Ad5 E1 deletion. A first step in a purification process of the present invention is a host cell lysis step, which provides for maximum release of adenovirus particles from the cells as well as providing for an opportunity to potentially inactivate adventitious agents.
Patents. A process for purifying virus particles, especially recombinant adenovirus vector particles, is presented. The process relies on various combinations of cell lysis, detergent-based precipitation of host cell contaminants away from the virus, depth filtration or centrifugation, ultrafiltration, nuclease...
