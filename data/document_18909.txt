In essence, FabricPath is a form of link-layer routing. FabricPath-enabled switches differ from their conventional Ethernet counterparts in two ways: They compute layer-2 paths using control messages carried over IS-IS, the routing protocol, and they encapsulate incoming Ethernet frames with a FabricPath header. 
FabricPath is based on the TRILL standard – with a few Cisco bonuses – which builds on the concept of “what if we could route a layer 2 packet instead of switching it.” Under the covers of FabricPath it uses the ISIS protocol, a MAC encapsulation, and routing tables to achieve all of the magic. Originally I was worried about having to learn a completely new protocol, but the truth is that most of us already know all of the concepts that make FabricPath work. Think about routing to the access layer and why we like that design. 1  Routing protocols truly eliminate spanning tree.
When you go to set up a server in the data center it usually requires planning and coordination between independent teams such as the network, server, storage, and application teams. Because it is an optimization of Classical Ethernet, vPC still requires Spanning Tree Protocol on top of it to address certain scenarios. • Cisco FabricPath can be extended easily without degrading operations. Adding a switch or a link in a Cisco FabricPath fabric does not result in a single frame loss.
Currently FabricPath is available only on the F1-Series module of the Nexus 7000 series. FabricPath is derived from IT Standard TRILL technology with a lot of extra enhanced features. Its switching allows multipath forwarding at the Layer 2 without the use of spanning-tree. FabricPath uses layer 2 ISIS based protocol for its control plane. 
Today there are some key differentiators between Cisco’s proprietary FabricPath technology, and what our competitors could bring with TRILL. What it amounts to is that ours is ready for deployment, and the standard still has some functional gaps.

Build a Highly Scalable, Agile Network. Cisco FabricPath is a Cisco NX-OS software innovation combining the plug-and-play simplicity of Ethernet with the reliability and scalability of Layer 3 routing. Using FabricPath, you can build highly scalable Layer 2 multipath networks without the Spanning Tree Protocol. Such networks are particularly suitable for large virtualization deployments, private clouds, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments

However, the concept of Trees in fabricpath also exists, tree's are used for the distribution of multidestination traffic, that is traffic that is not a single destination, so perfect examples of this would be multicast, unknown unicast and other flooding types.
Comments. Cisco 's FabricPath data center Ethernet technology is designed to combine traditional, Spanning Tree-based Ethernet with a next-generation architecture that uses a link-state protocol to allow for multiple active paths. Use of a link-state protocol. Using or replacing Spanning Tree with a link-state protocol is intended to overcome the limitations of Spanning Tree in data center and cloud environments-chiefly, the inability to use multiple active parallel paths in an Ethernet network.
