Generally, the correlation of temperature results are as follows: 1  The average normal oral temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) . 2  A rectal temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 3  An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 1 An ear (tympanic) temperature is 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. 2  An armpit (axillary) temperature is usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) lower than an oral temperature. 3  A forehead (temporal) scanner
1 Before taking your baby's axillary temperature, make sure the area under the arm is dry. 2  Insert the end of the thermometer under your baby's arm and hold his/her arm snugly against his/her body. 3  Wait five minutes or until the electronic thermometer beeps before removing. 4  Use only a blunt tipped rectal thermometer. A baby’s temperature should usually be taken under the armpit (axillary temperature). However, your baby’s health care provider may ask you to take a rectal temperature as well. Tell your baby’s health care provider which way you took the baby’s temperature.

If you notice a temperature that is even just slightly above the normal range –​ 38°C (101°F) taken rectally or 37.5°C (99.5°F) taken under the armpit – bring your newborn baby to the doctor as soon as possible. Also bring your newborn baby to the doctor if he has any of the following symptoms: An armpit temperature of 37.2°C (99°F) or higher means a fever. 1  Wait for the thermometer to take the reading. 2  The normal range for a temperature taken under the armpit is 36.7°C to 37.1°C (98.0°F to 98.8°F).

This Site Might Help You. RE: What is a normal underarm temperature for an infant? Hi, I have a 6 week old baby that has been fussy today so I took her temperature under the arm and it was 98.1, but my mom said that I have to add a degree, which would mean that it is 99.1. Isn&#39;t that a low-grade fever? Best Answer: You do have to add a degree, so normal underarm temperature would be 97.6. As far as whether or not 99.1 would be a fever...probably not. Generally it's not considered a fever until it reaches 99.4 (or 98.4 under the arm).
Peer Review Status: Internally Peer Reviewed. The normal axillary temperature of a newborn infant, if correctly measured for 5 minutes, is from 36.5 to 37.4°C (mean + 1.5 S.D.). This range should be applied to both the term and premature infant. 
Temperature / Fever. Normal axillary (under the arm) temperature ranges from 97.5 to 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 to 37.4 degrees Celsius)*. Taking a rectal temperature. Normal rectal temperature is 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit or less (37.9 degrees Celsius or less)*. *These are the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended ranges. It is suggested that you discuss this with your baby's health care provider. A baby’s temperature should usually be taken under the armpit (axillary temperature). However, your baby’s health care provider may ask you to take a rectal temperature as well. Tell your baby’s health care provider which way you took the baby’s temperature.
Normal axillary temperature is 97.8 degrees F. However, a normal infant's temperature can range between 97.6 to 100 degrees F. Rectal Method.... 1  How to Take A Baby's Temperature Under The Armpit. This measurement, also known as axillary temperature, tends to be about half a degree to a degree below oral temperature. Therefore, normal axillary temperature would range between 97.6 degrees and 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit (36.4-36.7 degrees Celsius).
