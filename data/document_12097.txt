this born to run machine can easily reach speeds off about 70 mph 113 kph and all it takes for a cheetah to reach its potential is a few strides its built for speed body speeds at 10 meters per second and boosts up to 40 mph 64 kph in about three strides
the above article does describe how fast can a cheetah run but the actual mechanics behind the speed of the speed king can be found here ferrari enzo accelerates up at 8 0 meters per second which boosts it from 0 to 60 mph in about 3 5 seconds corvette twin accelerates at 7 1
a single female cheetah in captivity was accurately timed to run approximately 200 meters in 7 seconds giving a speed of 29 meters per second or 64 miles per hour the cheetah had a running start and the results are the average of three separate runs with rest in between
well the horse is fast too but is built for endurance and speed not just speed the fastest a horse has run is reportedly 43 mph over a 400 metres course from a standing start a good humble domestic cat can run as fast as the world s fastest man 30 mph now that puts the domestic cat in perspective too greyhounds can do 33 5 mph and the serval wild cat 50 mph
due to the huge aerodynamic pressure that comes from the speed a cheetah can at most run at its top speed for about 600 yards 550 meters exactly why the chase of the cheetah is less than 30 seconds
while running a cheetah covers 20 to 22 feet 6 to 6 7 meters in one stride about the same distance as a racehorse but a cheetah is so much faster the fastest racehorse runs 43 miles per hour 69 kilometers per hour while a cheetah can run at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour 112
scientists estimate that cheetahs can reach speeds between 70 75 miles per hour of course they can t sustain that high speed over long distances but they can go that fast in short bursts that can cover up to 1600 feet or more cheetahs can reach those speeds very quickly too a cheetah s explosive speed can take it from 0 to over 62 miles per hour in just three seconds now that s fast in fact it s about as fast as the world s most expensive sports cars can accelerate from 0 to 60
