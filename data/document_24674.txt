A two-post car lift will raise your car up to about 6 feet off the ground, which is low enough for most standard garage ceilings. While two-post lifts must be anchored to the ground for safety, this height allows you to work under your car, even though it does not allow you to store two cars on top of one another.
You need to add an additional 8 inches to 107 inches (this 8 inches accounts for the thickness of the runway and the 1-2 inches of “lift height” you will need to raise your runways “up” and off the locks, so that they can be lowered.)You now have a total required minimum ceiling height of 115 inches (9 feet 7 inches).

I bought the metal last fall to finish the ceiling, which I will do this spring when it warms up. I know that I want to put a lift in my center bay. I got to thinking that if 12 feet isn't enough height for my 3/4 ton dodge when its on the lift, then that might be a problem. In which case, before I finish the ceiling this spring I may need to think about figuring out a solution for more ceiling height in that
Car lift for garage. Does anyone know what the minimum garage height is for a 4 post car lift. I have heard that it is 9 or 10 feet but that sounds kind of low. I only have 10 feet and would realy like to turn my 2 car garage into a three car garage. 07-10-2009 #16.
02-13-2010, 09:08 AM. My garage is 26x26 with a 4 post lift and had a 10'2 ceiling. I raised the lift bay ceiling to 13'6 and have plenty of room now. I also put 1.5 spacers under the feet of my lift to increase the height to allow for my lifted f-150 to park under it. Ontop sits my lowered mustang.
