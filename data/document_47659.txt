Symptoms of the hereditary neuropathies vary according to the type and may include sensory symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the feet and hands; or motor symptoms such as weakness and loss of muscle bulk, particularly in the lower leg and feet muscles.
The inherited peripheral neuropathies are divided into the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), and other miscellaneous rare types, (for example, hereditary brachial plexopathy, hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathies).
A hereditary neuropathy is an inherited (runs in families) disorder of the peripheral nervous system (nerves away from the brain and spinal cord). There are many different hereditary neuropathies. Symptoms of a hereditary neuropathy may include: 1  Muscle weakness (especially in the foot and leg). 2  Foot deformities.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy type 2 (CMT2) is a non-demyelinating (axonal) peripheral neuropathy characterized by distal muscle weakness and atrophy, mild sensory loss, and normal or near-normal nerve conduction velocities.
Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is a disorder that affects peripheral nerves. These nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles as well as sensory cells that detect touch, pain, and temperature. In people with this disorder, the peripheral nerves are unusually sensitive to pressure. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies causes recurrent episodes of numbness, tingling, and/or loss of muscle function (palsy).
Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a relatively common, though under-diagnosed, hereditary disorder in which a fairly mild pressure or trauma to a single nerve results in episodes or periods of numbness and weakness, similar to an arm or leg going to sleep.
