Trilobites are an extinct group of arthropods (jointed-legged animals) known from more than 10,000 fossil species. The group Trilobita existed from early in the Cambrian Period (520 million years ago) until the end of the Permian Period (250 million years ago). The name Trilobita is derived from the three (tri-) lobed structure of the exoskeleton, which has a raised central lobe (or axis) and a pair of side lobes, called pleurae.
1 Arthropods are the living relatives of trilobites. 2  Spiders, scorpions and crustaceans share characteristics, providing clues to the Paleozoic lifestyle of their extinct forerunners. 3  An arthropod is an invertebrate with an exoskeleton. 4  Arthropods have a segmented body, and jointed appendages.
The Paleozoic is often called the age of the trilobite. Trilobites particularly flourished in the oceans of the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, beginning around 540 million years ago, with a diminishing number of families persisting until the Permian.
Trilobite (meaning three lobed) are extinct arthropods. Their name is in reference to the three round parts, called lobes, across their heads (cephalon), consisting of a slightly raised central lobe (the axis) and two flatter pleural lobes on either side.
The earliest trilobites known from the fossil record are fallotaspids, and redlichiids (both order Redlichiida) and bigotinids (order Ptychopariida, superfamily Ellipsocephaloidea) dated to some 540 to 520 million years ago.
A Trilobite is a fossil. The fossilised remains of a type of animal called an arthropod that lived in the sea between 521 and 250 million years ago. They are now extinct. They are called trilobites because their body shapes have 3 lobes. They looked a bot like woodlice.
Definition of TRILOBITE. : any of numerous extinct Paleozoic marine arthropods (group Trilobita) having the segments of the body divided by furrows on the dorsal surface into three lobes. See trilobite defined for kids.
