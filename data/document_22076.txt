An infected person is most contagious once they start having symptoms. He can spread smallpox to others until he is completely symptom-free. Smallpox gets its name from its most common sign of the disease: small blisters that pop up on the face, arms, and body, and fill up with pus.
Smallpox spreads from person to person mainly by aerosolized droplets that come from the coughing of infected patients. Contact with smallpox scabs or contaminated clothing or linens can also spread the disease.
Animals and insects do not carry or transmit smallpox disease and smallpox is not spread by food or water. Man-made variations and mutations of smallpox may not behave in the same way that naturally occurring smallpox has in the past.
