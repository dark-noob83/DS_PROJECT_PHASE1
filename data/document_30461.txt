Chlorine and hydrogen are both non-metals. A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outer shell. Chlorine is in group 7 of the periodic table. A hydrogen atom has 1 electron in its outer shell. Hydrogen can only form 1 bond. The hydrogen atom will share its 1 electron with chlorine to form one covalent bond and make a hydrogen chloride molecule (HCl). This is a picture of a hydrogen chloride molecule. By sharing the two electrons where the shells touch the hydrogen atom can count 2 electrons in its outer shell and the chlorine atom can count 8
1 So, for example, in water we know that there are twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms (H 2 O), making a ratio of 2:1. 2  In salt (sodium chloride) there are equal numbers of sodium and chlorine atoms (NaCl), so the ratio is 1:1.
They combine as atoms, and separate as ions. When sodium and chlorine atoms come together to form sodium chloride (NaCl), they transfer an electron. The sodium (Na) atom transfers one electron to the chlorine (Cl) atom, so that they both have full outer shells.
That represents sodium chloride--a combination of sodium and chlorine in a 1:1 ratio by atoms. The formula for molecular hydrogen would be written as H2. The 2 subscript immediately following the H means that there are two hydrogen atoms combined with one another. The formula for molecular oxygen is O2.
There are 2 atoms (1 sodium, 1 chlorine) in each formula unit of sodium chloride. 1 person found this useful. Edit.
