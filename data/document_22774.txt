Lolita fashion (ロリータ・ファッション, Rorīta fasshon) is a fashion subculture originating in Japan that is based on Victoria and Edwardian clothing, but the style has expanded greatly beyond Japan. The Lolita look began primarily as one of modesty with a focus on quality in both material and manufacture of garments. Casual Lolita is less of a style in and of itself but is used to describe a toned down approach to the lolita fashion. While the basic lolita elements are still adhered to, the key element in the casual lolita co-ordination is simplicity.
I bought cardigan and dress from the website www.rotita.com. It was horrible, ‘coz these items were too small for me. I was surprised, ‘coz I took all measurements before I placed the order. I tried to reach the seller, but this jerk vanished somewhere and I can’t get money from them. After giving me fake postal tracking numbers, they even tried to charge the shipping and handling fees when they made an offer to refund, but nothing was shipped or handled! DO NOT BUY FROM ROTITA.COM.
Thought it would be too small but I managed to get into it without too much problem! Thank you so much! My R-Series Jsk I got a while back and I finally had a chance to wear it. Hello! I have received my Holy Lantern JSK (replica) and I have to say I'm very very happy for the service and the quality of the dress. Simply wonderful! Thank you Linda for all your help with my order issues, i just received it a few hours ago and all the items are in perfect conditions. Sorry for any trouble and thanks again. Thanks Mia Waters for the beautiful photos. She bought the Magic Tea Party Veronica Classic Lolita JSK from us.
Although many people point to Japan as the creator of the Lolita fashion and the Lolita trend, the origin of its meaning is complex, and remains unclear. Casual Lolita is less of a style in and of itself but is used to describe a toned down approach to the lolita fashion. While the basic lolita elements are still adhered to, the key element in the casual lolita co-ordination is simplicity.
BUYER BEWARE!!! I bought two separate orders. They don’t fit & I asked for the address to send items back. Completely got the run around about how expensive shipping back to China is so it would be better for ME if they just gave me 20% store credit. Which is a waste since I won’t be buying from there again.
