While the thread's kick-off message was posted July 25, about two weeks after Microsoft shipped Office 2016 for Mac and Apple delivered the first public beta of OS X 10.11, aka El Capitan, the volume of messages added to the thread swelled yesterday, when Apple released the OS X upgrade. It's unclear whether Microsoft's or Apple's code was responsible for the Office 2016 crashes, or a combination of both. Computerworld has experienced similar Office 2016 crash behavior on the GM and official releases of El Capitan, as well as on a Mac equipped with the public preview of OS X 10.11.1.
Crashes and Office 2016 problems were first reported during the beta testing period but remain unresolved. Update: A Microsoft spokesperson has told MacRumors that a fix is in the works. We know that some users of Office 2016 for Mac are experiencing issues as a result of upgrading to Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan. We are actively working with Apple towards resolution.. Since OS X El Capitan was released to the public last week, Microsoft Office users have noticed some serious bugs when attempting to use the software. MacRumors has received multiple emails from people having issues with Office 2016, and there are several threads about the problem on our forums
Just my 0.02. I would just like to add that Outlook 2016 works well on El Capitan, so I'm not sure why Outlook 2011 is not working. Unfortunately after the preview was up I had to go back to 2011 since my University has traditional Office licensing and has to wait until September for the release. SC. I try to use Outlook in my just upgrade MBP to El Capitan and Outlook don't work for more of 2 minutes. Beach ball show up and the only way to stop the software is using Force to Quit. Is the only application with problems.
I have seen a lot of people commenting on difficulty with Outlook 2011 with OS X El Capitan. I have been using Office 2011 with no problems at all on Yosemite. Yesterday I upgraded to El Capitan, and Office 2011 no longer works at all (version 14.5.7). I personally don't use Outlook, but live and die with Word and Excel. Neither works at all now. They both crash on the startup screen as soon as the font menu starts loading
To work around this issue, run Outlook for Mac 2011 on Mac OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) or an earlier version.. Microsoft Outlook 2016 users are also encountering the same problems. I'm having the same issues with Microsoft Office 2016 running on El Capitan. 
We are aware of the issue with Outlook 2011 on El Capitan and of Office 2016 on El Capitan, Jeelani wrote, referring to an already-admitted problem with Outlook 2011 -- the email client bundled with Office for Mac 2011 -- as well as the crashes afflicting users of the newer Office for Mac 2016. Computerworld installed 10.11.1 on multiple Macs Friday and although Office 2016 did not crash during that day's work cycle, application failures have been intermittent enough in the past to make any judgment about the El Capitan update premature. At the moment, Microsoft has no answer.
