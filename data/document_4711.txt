That is for an average cost basis for having a contractor / builder build a basic one story garage for you on your property. If you are in an area with higher-than-average cost of living you can use $50 to $55. If there are complications or you prefer top quality materials and components the price can go up.So, generally speaking, a 24 ft.sq., two car, basic garage will cost in the range of $17,000 to $23,000.

1 Upgrading the quality of materials can bump the cost to $55 a square foot, or $13,200 for a minimum single-car structure, $21,000 for a two-car garage and $47,000 or more for the dream version. 
A 20-by-20-foot garage totalling 400 square feet would cost between $16,000 and $24,000 without an apartment, and anywhere from $20,000 to $35,000 with an apartment. Homeowners who are skilled at construction and can do some or all of the work themselves can cut an enormous amount off of those numbers. 
For this discussion we will assess the costs of building detached a two-car as well as a four car garage. The measurements of the average two car model is 26'x26'or 676 square feet. The average square footage of a four car garage is 48'x30' or 1440 square feet. 1 The two car garage would have a total of 728 square feet for a cost of $700, and the four car garage would have a total of 1728 square feet at a cost of $1700 - both sets of prices are for materials only;

In contrast, hiring a contractor to build a traditional (stick built) wooden 30x40 garage can cost from $35 to $45 per square foot, for a total cost of $42,000 to $54,000. This equates to a saving of around $20,000 (assuming you self-build). Other popular garage sizes include: 12x14, 20x20, 22x22 & 24x24.
