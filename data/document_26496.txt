Report Abuse. Most bacteria are not producers, they are consumers. Most bacteria are decomposers, though some are parasites. The bacteria that are called cyanobacteria are producers that use photosynthesis. There are also some bacteria that live near deep sea volcanic vents and produce their own food using chemicals for energy. In biology, bacteria are called autotrophs, like plants. The other group are called heterotrophs, and they are you consumers, like you and me and my cat over here. Some bacteria, though, are also what you would call recyclers.
Parts of the Food Chain (Producers/Consumers...). Producers. Plants are called producers. This is because they produce their own food! They do this by using light energy from the Sun, carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to produce food-in the form of glucouse/sugar. The process is called photosynthesis. Click on the image below to learn about photosynthesis.
Is bacteria a consumer? yes, they are grouped by the type of cell wall produced: a thick cell wall or a thinner cell wall. other group do not produce cell wall, this group is unique, because this all … ows them to change their shape one example may be: mycoplasma pneumonia. Bacteria (plural of bacterium) are microscopic single-celled  organisms (prokaryotes) that reproduce by binary fission, i.e.  one cell splits into two, the two cells split i … nto four, etc., etc.
Bacteria are important decomposers; they are widely distributed and can break down just about any type of organic matter. and the bacteria on Earth may form a biomass that exceeds that of all living plants and animals. Decomposers are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms, and in doing so, carry out the natural process of decomposition. Like herbivores and predators, decomposers are heterotrophic, meaning that they use organic substrates to get their energy, carbon and nutrients for growth and development.
Best Answer: Bacteria are the most abundant type of life on the planet. They can easily survive without any other organisms. As such, as a group, they are producers, consumers and decomposers. Unfortunately, this is like asking Are Eukaryotes producers, consumers, or decomposers?. The answer-for both bacteria and eukaryotes-is Yes.. Bacteria can be any of the above.
Fungi and bacteria are the most common decomposers.Tell whether each living thing below is a producer, consumer, or decomposer. a. apple tree-producer b. hawk-consumerc. mushroom-decomposer d. carrot-producere. dragonfly-consumer f. bamboo-producerg. cougar-consumer h. bacteria-decomposeri. Name: ____________________________________ Producers and Consumers A producer is a living thing that makes its own food from sunlight, air, and soil. Green plants are producers who make food in their leaves.A consumer is a living thing that cannot make its own food. Consumers get their energy by eating food.

Only a few kinds of bacteria cause disease. They are called pathogens. Sometimes bacteria that normally reside harmlessly in the body cause disease. Bacteria can cause disease by producing harmful substances (toxins), invading tissues, or doing both. 
Best Answer: Yes, most bacteria are producers. In biology, bacteria are called autotrophs, like plants. The other group are called heterotrophs, and they are you consumers, like you and me and my cat over here. Some bacteria, though, are also what you would call recyclers.
