Roth IRA contributions are never tax deductible; you must pay taxes on Roth IRA funds before you place them in your account. Traditional IRA contributions are often tax deductible, but you must meet several requirements.
You can contribute the full $5,000 to a Roth IRA (or $6,000 if 50 or older)only if your adjusted gross income in 2008 is less than $159,000 if married filing jointly or $101,000 if single. Married filers can make a partial contribution if their joint income is less than $169,000 ($116,000 if single).
You can receive a 50% tax credit on your first $2,000 in Roth IRA contributions if you’re: 1  Single and earn $17,750 or less. 2  Married filing jointly and earn $35,500 or less. 3  Head of Household and earn $26,625 or less.
Unlike 401k or Traditional IRA contributions, Roth IRA contributions are not tax deductible. According to the Roth IRA funding rules established by the IRS, all your contributions must be made with after-tax dollars. For example, let’s say you earn $40,000, and you’re in the 25% tax bracket.
However, if you make a $5,500 non-deductible Roth IRA contribution, you’ll pay your taxes first, which leaves you with $30,000 (75% of $40,000). Then you’ll make your $5,500 Roth IRA contribution, leaving you with $24,500 in disposable income.
Maximize your deduction. You can contribute up to $5,500 to an IRA in tax-year 2014, or $6,500 if you are age 50 or older. If a worker in the 25 percent tax bracket contributes $5,500 to an IRA, he will save $1,375 on his 2014 tax bill.
While your Roth IRA contributions are not tax deductible, you can claim a Roth IRA tax credit on IRS Form 8880 of up to 50% on your first $2,000 in Roth IRA contributions if your income falls within the predetermined income limits.
