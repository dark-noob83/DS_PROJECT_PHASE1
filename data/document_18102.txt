Conclusion. Assembly tolerance chain stack up analysis is used for calculating the tolerance value of the overall assembly (or a gap in the assembly) from the tolerance values of the individual components. The worst case method of the stack up analysis is the simplest among all the methods used in industry. This GD&T tutorial will talk about assembly tolerance chain stack up analysis and will describe the procedure of calculating the tolerance chain stack up analysis in a practical manner. slide 1 of 6. All the machining process produces the components within certain amount of tolerance to its desired dimensions
There are many methods and tools available for performing assembly tolerance stack up analysis. I already have an article on worst case method assembly tolerance stack up analysis. Though the worst case method is very simple to perform, it is only suitable when small numbers of components are in the assembly.

A statistical tolerance analysis is when you take the variation of a set of inputs to calculate the expected variation of an output of interest. In mechanical engineering, a product design is composed of multiple features, each with tolerance values that control the variable aspects of those features. The simplest form of tolerance analysis is the single direction, 1D Tolerance Stackup. A 1D Tolerance Stackup is created by creating a cross section of a model and adding the tolerance values for each feature in a straight line.
Tolerance analysis is the general term for activities related to the study of potential accumulated variation in mechanical parts and assemblies. Its methods may be used on other types of systems subject to accumulated variation, such as mechanical and electrical systems. Engineers analyze tolerances for the purpose of evaluating geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T). Methods include 2D tolerance stacks, 3D Monte Carlo simulations, and datum conversions. Tolerance stackups or tolerance stacks are terms used to describe the problem-solving process in mechanical engineering of calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and toleranc
Instead of summing tolerances, as in worst-case analysis, statistical analysis sums dimension distributions. It is important to understand that the inputs values for a worst-case analysis are design tolerances, but the inputs for a statistical analysis are process distribution moments (e.g., standard deviation). Worst-case analysis (also called tolerance stack-up analysis) can be used to validate a design. Statistical analysis (also called variation analysis) can be used to predict the actual variation of an assembly based on the variation of the part dimensions. If the analysis involves part dimensions that are not parallel to the assembly measurement being studied, the stack-up approach must be modified since 2D variation such as angles, or any variation that is not parallel with the 1D direction, does not affect the assembly measurement with a 1-to-1 ratio.
The aim of the assembly tolerance stack up analysis is to find out the overall thickness of the assembly (X) with tolerance. We have the thickness and the tolerance values of all the plates (plate-1, 2, 3 and 4).

Tolerances stack up in machining results from using operational datum that are different from design datum. It is inevitable due to economic considerations of the machining process. Conventional methods used for tolerance stack up analysis include worst-case and statistical analysis.
