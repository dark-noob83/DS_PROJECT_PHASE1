There are basically three types of charges at the end of the lease: the Disposition-Fee, an Excess Mile Adjustment and a Vehicle Condition Adjustment. If you plan to drive more than 15,000 miles, then you can usually buy increments of 1,000 per year after that. If you drive 13,000 miles per year, you shouldnâ€™t allow for 15,000 miles; instead, you should construct a lease for 12,000 and just pay the extra 1,000 at the end of the lease.

Now the dealer checked with Ally too, and they are offering about $20 more drive-off, and then $20 more per month. However, according to the dealer, there is no lease disposition fee through Ally. So the net difference is: US Bank: $1 x 36 months = $36 + $395 disposition fee = $441. Ally: $21 x 36 months = $756 - $395 disposition fee = $361 + $20 extra down = $381 EXTRA I'm paying through Ally.
On the other hand do I just pay the $400 disposition fee if I don't resign with them at the end of the lease. I got the Hyundai Sonata GLS optional equipment package for $258 a month 15,000 miles a year and nothing down. Help! The dealer never told me about the disposition fee the initial day. When I went back the next week with my husband to get a quote he then told me about the $400 disposition fee, and that time I was ok with it because I got such a great deal. So I signed the purchase order.
