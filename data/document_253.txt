Turtles do not breathe underwater in the sense of what we call breathing. That is, they do not take in oxygen through inhalation and exhalation. Rather, they absorb or take in oxygen through means other than just by their lungs. Turtles have a set of lungs that it can breathe with.
Yes, terrapins live in water, although if housing in a fish tank they need somewhere they can get up and out of the water to take a breath and sleep.
Diamondback terrapins can hold their breath from 45 minutes (during summer) to five hours. Sometimes groups of this species are found on exposed mudflats, basking in the sun.
At high tide, they swim about the marshes in search of food;at low tide, they are found nearly or entirely buried in the mud or hiddenunder drift. Diamondback terrapins can hold their breath from 45 minutes(during summer) to five hours.Sometimes groups of this species are found on exposed mudflats, baskingin the sun. Mating occurs in the spring when individuals move from openlagoons into small canals and ditches.
As its activity increases so does its demand for air. The turtle, depending on the species can hold its breath underwater for a long time. Most species can hold their breath anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours. How long the turtle can hold its breath is also in direct proportion to how active it is and if it is able to find pockets of air. These pockets of air can be found in small caves and/or under ice.
We suggest a water temperature of 76-78° F (24-26° C) and the optimal pH for captive Diamondback Terrapins seems to be in the 6.8 to 7.0 range. In much of their natural range, Diamondback Terrapins are found in brackish water.
