I love the name Spencer, mostly because it's my own, and think it is a unisex name, mostly because my best friend who is bigender (or identifies as both genders) changed their name to this, and never gets any odd looks, or anything like in the past(Lexie= not as unisex).
I like the name Spencer and it never made me think of dispenser until now lol. I think Spencer is good as a first or middle name.
We like the name Spencer for a boy, but can't think of any middle names. We like unique names and traditional names that aren't too common. Please help us and give us some suggestions.
A girl's first name that goes with the middle name Spencer. My husband and I are having our second baby girl in July. My husband's name is Spencer and I think it would be incredibly special for the baby to have his name as her middle name. Since Spencer can be either a girl or boy name, I think it is perfect for our little one. My only dilemma is that I am having trouble finding a first name that goes well with it.
Comments and insights on the name Spencer: | Edit. A male name, definitely not female. Pronounced Spen-sir. I love the name Spencer for a boy, not much a fan of it for a girl. I am a girl, and named Spencer, and I happen to think it's good for both genders.
Best Answer: Thank you for realizing how pretty Spencer is for a girl. It's my absolute favorite unisex name and I am surprised it is not used more often. Yes, it was originally a boy's name, but it's okay since it's becoming a popular trend.
need a boy name that goes siblings Trevor and spencer. Our boys names are Trevor Ray and Spencer Jay. My husbands name is Jason Ray, which is how we came up with our boys' middle names. What names go well with Trevor and Spencer and still has some sort of connection to my husbands name?
