If for any reason your blood platelet count falls below normal, the condition is called thrombocytopenia. Normally, you have anywhere from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. 
A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Having more than 450,000 platelets is a condition called thrombocytosis; having less than 150,000 is known as thrombocytopenia. You get your platelet number from a routine blood test called a complete blood count (CBC). 
A normal platelet count is generally higher than 150,000 platelets per microliter of circulating blood. People with ITP often have platelet counts below 20,000. ... With ITP, white and red blood cell counts are usually normal, but the platelet count is low. Causes If for any reason your blood platelet count falls below normal, the condition is called thrombocytopenia. Normally, you have ... blood. In adults, normal platelet count is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.
Low Platelet Counts. A low platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. The normal range for platelet counts is between 150,000 and 450,000 per cubic millimeter. Platelets are the blood cells that help stop bleeding by making your blood clot. ... Causes If for any reason your blood platelet count falls below normal, the condition is called thrombocytopenia. Normally, you have ... blood. In adults, normal platelet count is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.
A platelet count is used to detect the number of platelets in the blood. The test is included in a complete blood count (CBC) , a panel of tests often performed as part of a general health examination. Platelets are tiny fragments of cells that are essential for normal blood clotting. 
A platelet count below 150,000 per mcL is called thrombocytopenia, while a platelet count over 450,000 is called thrombocytosis. Platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50,000 per mcL (assuming no other problems are present). Platelets are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. A low or high platelet count is not often a problem by itself, but can frequently be a sign of another medical condition. For this reason, high or low platelet counts require additional medical attention.
78 Followers. A. Platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. A normal platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter, abbreviated mcL). The average platelet count is 237,000 per mcL in men and 266,000 per mcL in women. Platelets are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. A low or high platelet count is not often a problem by itself, but can frequently be a sign of another medical condition. For this reason, high or low platelet counts require additional medical attention.
Platelets are important elements in the blood that are important for blood coagulation (clotting and prevention of bleeding). The normal platelet count ranges between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter (one-millionth of a liter). Although the number of platelets is decreased, their function may remain intact in most cases of thrombocytopenia. All blood cells (white cells, red cells, and platelets) are made in the bone marrow. Thrombocytopenia means a lower platelet count in the blood compared to the normal range. Thrombocytosis refers to a greater number of platelets
A normal platelet count in adults ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A platelet count of less than 150,000 platelets per microliter is lower than normal. If your blood platelet count falls below normal, you have thrombocytopenia. However, the risk for serious bleeding doesn't occur until the count becomes very low—less than 10,000 or 20,000 platelets per microliter.
In case of a healthy individual, the normal platelet level ranges between 150,000 and 450,000 per μl (micro liter) of blood. According to statistics, almost 95% of healthy people have platelet values within this range. According to health experts, a value between 150,000 and 450,000 per μl of blood is the normal platelet count in children, whereas in adults, it is between 150,000 and 400,000 per μl of blood.
