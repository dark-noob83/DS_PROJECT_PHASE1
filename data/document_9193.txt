It all depends on how you are cooking it, and what type of chicken you are cooking. The internal temperature of a chicken breast should be about 170 F. or for whole chickens, thighs, legs, and wings it should be about 180 F. You can purchase a thermometer for about $3.00 at the grocery store. First get a food thermometer, as it will all depend on the size and thickness of the chicken. Cook it to at least 165 degrees. Any longer than that it might get dry. The thermometer can be used in the oven or on the grill. I usually cook it at 300-350 degrees for twenty to thirty minutes in the oven.
Baking the Chicken: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake the chicken, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink inside. You can bake the chicken legs in a 375°F. oven, if desired. Increase the baking time to 45 to 50 minutes. Tip: An accurate way to check chicken doneness is to insert an instant-read thermometer into the thigh, avoiding the bone. It should read 180°F when the chicken is done.
