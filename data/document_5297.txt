Enter Tinder. You know the drill. Swipe left, swipe right. His first photo is him with his shirt off, and he’s not doing something active. Swipe left. It’s a mirror selfie. Swipe left. Go back to MySpace. You have to click through his profile to actually figure out which one he is
A Tinder profile is made up only of your first name, age, photos (of your choice) and any pages you've 'liked' on Facebook. Tinder then finds you potential matches near you (you can narrow it down by searching by age and distance) and if they take your fancy, you swipe right to 'like' them. If not, go left to 'pass'.
More likes than nopes. Men apparently see much more that they like on Tinder than women do. On the popular dating app, which has users swipe right to indicate they “like” a potential match and swipe left to say “nope,” men are almost three times as likely to swipe right than women are, the New York Times reports.
The thing about Tinder is that they don’t know which way you’ve swiped, or even if you’ve seen their pictures. If you swipe right on their profile and they swipe right on your profile the two of you ‘match’ and only then can you start sending messages to each other.
If you have swiped right and the other person swiped right on your profile as well, congratulations, you have just gotten yourself your first Tinder match. Now you can move to messaging that person and get to know them or decide on contacting outside of Tinder.
