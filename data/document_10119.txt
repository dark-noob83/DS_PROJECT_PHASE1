The cost of a wind energy project will vary depending on the scale, site and installation requirements. Some typical figures for the installed cost for different scales of wind turbine are provided in the following table. Capital cost figures are approximate and include installation costs due to civil works.
This improvement will be driven by declining costs of wind farm installation, foundations and turbine The potential for cost reductions towers, which are expected to fall by 6.6%, 6.1% and 5.4% respectively in the next five years.
The length of the payback period depends on the turbine, the quality of wind at the installation site, prevailing electricity rates, and available financing and incentives. Depending on these and other factors, the time it takes to fully recover the cost of a small wind turbine is 6 to 30 years.
1 The Department of Energy finds that “ Among a large sample of wind projects installed in 2012, the capacity-weighted average installed cost stood at nearly $1,940/kW, down almost $200/kW from the reported average cost in 2011 and down almost $300/kW from the reported average cost in both 2009 and 2010 .” [3].
The costs for a utility scale wind turbine range from about $1.3 million to $2.2 million per MW of nameplate capacity installed. Most of the commercial-scale turbines installed today are 2 MW in size and cost roughly $3-$4 million
Home or Farm Scale Wind Turbines. Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more).
A 10 kW wind turbine costs approximately $48,000 – 65,000 to install. The equipment cost is about $40,000 (see 10 kW GridTek System) and the rest is shipping and installation. Towers without guy wires are more expensive than guyed towers.
The average height of a small wind turbine (of any capacity) is about 80ft. (about twice the height of a neighborhood telephone pole), with a range of 30-140 ft. Generator size and tower height are not generally related; a 5-kW turbine could be on a tower anywhere from 30-140 ft. in height, for example.
Total costs for installing a commercial-scale wind turbine will vary significantly depending on the number of turbines ordered, cost of financing, when the turbine purchase agreement was executed, construction contracts, the location of the project, and other factors.
