I guess it depends on where you live, what type of cow you want, what the stockmarket is doing, what you want it for and the age you want. I used to buy calves for 4-H and FFA. I paid around $150 to $450 per for a Dairy Calf. Angus (Beef cows) are more. They could go more or less then that. The average price for a cow is probably about $800.00 these days. Very few ranchers buy adult cows. They will breed their own, or purchase calves at various sizes and raise them.
2. The cost of carrying a cow for a year is $750 and increases one percent annually. 3. The price received for a 525 pound feeder calf is $240 per hundredweight through 2016 and then declines either 2.5 percent or 5.0 percent annually. 4. The price of a commercial slaughter cow is $105 per hundredweight and declines 5.0 percent annually. If it is assumed the cow will produce eight calves over her productive life and cattle prices decline 2.5 percent annually then a producer could pay $3,264 for a bred heifer and still breakeven while a 5.0 percent annual decline in prices would result in a breakeven purchase price of $2,832 per head.
In calculating the winter feed costs, Hoppe figured a 1400-pound cow will either eat or waste 40 pounds of feed daily. Using a hay price of $65 per ton and figuring 180 days on feed with the winter ration that translates into a feed charge of $1.40 per day or $252 for six months. Yardage for 4.7 years @ $90/year = $423.00. Total expenses = $2622.60. Net income over life of cow = $2582.03. If a producer would like to realize a profit of $200 per head each year that would be an additional cost of $940 over the life of the cow, meaning that the value to pay for a bred heifer would be $1642.03. And that figure, Hoppe noted, is pretty close to what bred heifers are selling for at the current time
1 For the entire wrapping and processing of the meat, the prices can range from $0.40 to $0.80 per pound of the cow. 2  According to GrannyRetreat.com, the cost associated for butchering a cow is not just only about having it killed and butchered. 3  A big portion of the cost will go for the processing. 1 For example, a butcher shop charges for the processing per pound between$4 and $5 per pound average (based on the hanging weight of 250 pounds and an expected loss of 50% in processing where fat and bone are not removed). 2  Another store charges around $250 for processing half a cow.
Beef Cattle Improvement Association, the average cow age in the state is 5.7 years, which means the average number of calf crops per cow is 4.7, since she doesn't calf that first year. Current cull prices would pay $70 per cwt., which would come to $910 for a 1300 pound cow. Yardage for 4.7 years @ $90/year = $423.00. Total expenses = $2622.60. Net income over life of cow = $2582.03. If a producer would like to realize a profit of $200 per head each year that would be an additional cost of $940 over the life of the cow, meaning that the value to pay for a bred heifer would be $1642.03. And that figure, Hoppe noted, is pretty close to what bred heifers are selling for at the current time
The difference of paying $3,750 for a bull and paying $5,250 for a bull doesn’t affect the service cost per cow that dramatically. In fact, the difference between a $3,750 bull and a $5,250 bull only moves the average cost per cow serviced by $9/cow. For example, using conservative production assumptions, the average service cost for a $4,500 bull that is turned out with 25 cows/year is $63.14/cow.
Of course, paying more for a bull doesn’t always mean you’re purchasing more genetic value; if you can buy a bull worth $5,500 in today’s market for $4,500, that’s a real savings of $1,000. Another interesting component about McGrann’s analysis is how sensitive it is to cow service number rates. For example, using conservative production assumptions, the average service cost for a $4,500 bull that is turned out with 25 cows/year is $63.14/cow.
1 The cost for having a cow butchered varies from one region to another. 2  In addition to the actual butchering, there are some labor costs associated with the procedure. 3  The kill fee alone will be between$25 to $50. 4  Butchering one beef at TheMeats.com, for example, is priced at $35.00. 1 For example, a butcher shop charges for the processing per pound between$4 and $5 per pound average (based on the hanging weight of 250 pounds and an expected loss of 50% in processing where fat and bone are not removed). 2  Another store charges around $250 for processing half a cow.
