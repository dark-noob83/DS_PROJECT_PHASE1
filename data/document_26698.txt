Engine RPM / Generator RPM = Generator pulley size / Engine Pulley size. So, knowing the generator needs to rotate at 3600 RPM, next define what speed the engine needs to run at. This ratio will determine the ratio of pulleys required. Let's say for example that the engine is a Diesel that needs to run at 1800 RPM for full rated torque. Knowing that I needed the engine to run at 3450 rpm and the generator to run at 1725 rpm, then... 3450 RPM / 1725 RPM = 2. Then say I've got a 2 pulley that fits the engine side, that means that the generator side needs to be twice as large, or 4.
The generator is supposed to run at 3600 rpms, but, when it is reduced by 2:1, it goes to 3500 rpms and gives you 5hp instead of the needed 5.5 hp, so, you have a 5% reduction in wattage out, giving you like 2850 watts instead of 3000 watts rms. All their performance charts show rpm’s at the alternator not the motor. The pulley on the crankshaft is considerably larger than the pulley on the alternator, giving you more rpm’s at the alternator than at the motor. All their performance charts show rpm’s from 1200 to 8000 rpm’s. All their performance charts show at 3000 rpm’s you get 13/16ths of max power
When turning ac generators at 110v at 30 amps, this is ((110*30)/746)=4.42 hp, but this is only the power you put in to get out. One thing people forget is the amount of power needed to get up to the 3600 rpm's needed to get 60hz (3600/60)=60hz. A average 5kw will need about 10 hp to keep up with loads and rpm's.(5000/746)=6.7hp. It takes about 1.2hp just to turn a generator at the speed of 3600 rpm's, the extra hp is call peek output. 30 amps alternator with a output say 13v is (30*13)=390 watts. 390/746=.52hp at 1200 rpms you will need a constant torque of (5252/1200)*.52=2.28 foot pounds or 27.31in/lb at 1200 rpm's.
Then plug the values into the equation and you get: 1800 RPM / 3600 RPM = 1/2 = Generator pulley size / Engine Pulley size. So, what ever size pulley is selected for the generator, the engine pulley size must be 2 times that size. The selection of pulley size is also complicated by the fact that not all pulleys are available in all shaft diameters. Knowing that I needed the engine to run at 3450 rpm and the generator to run at 1725 rpm, then... 3450 RPM / 1725 RPM = 2. Then say I've got a 2 pulley that fits the engine side, that means that the generator side needs to be twice as large, or 4.
(d) By making similar modifications on the control panel, you can increase the frequency from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. (e) If the control panel does not display the frequency, you will need to first connect a device that will measure the frequency while the generator is in operation and then change the engine rpm. Generator Frequency (f) = Number of revolutions per minute of the engine (N) * Number of magnetic poles (P) / 120. Conversely, P = 120*f/N. As per the above formulae, a 2-pole generator producing an output frequency of 60 Hz has an engine speed of 3,600 rpm. To change the output frequency to 60 Hz for the same generator configuration, the engine speed needs to be reduced to 3,000 rpm. Similarly, for a 4-pole generator, an engine speed of 1,800 rpm produces output of 60 Hz
For example, is the generator synchronous or induction? How many poles? Synchronous generators must rotate at a speed that is related to the frequency of the system and the number of poles in the machine. A two pole machine must rotate at 3600 r/min (on 60Hz systems) or 3000 r/min (or 50 Hz systems). For an AC generator that depends on the frequency and the number of poles in the field windings. A formula would be 2*frequency (in hz)* 60(sec/min)/[number of poles in field] so for a two pole generator @ 60hz you get 3600rpm,3000rpm for 50hz;
For that reason, they weigh less than half of an 1800 RPM Diesel Engine. The alternator on a 3600 RPM Diesel generator spins twice as fast so it can get by with less than half of the copper of an 1800 RPM alternator. Due to the higher engine speed, these 3600 RPM generators wear out much sooner. 
60Hz and 50Hz Power. The output frequency of a generator is one of the important parameters that determine the generator’s rating. The electrical output of the generator must be maintained at a fixed frequency, 50 Hz or 60 Hz, to match the output of a standard electrical grid or the frequency rating of your appliances. Generator Frequency (f) = Number of revolutions per minute of the engine (N) * Number of magnetic poles (P) / 120. Conversely, P = 120*f/N. As per the above formulae, a 2-pole generator producing an output frequency of 60 Hz has an engine speed of 3,600 rpm. To change the output frequency to 60 Hz for the same generator configuration, the engine speed needs to be reduced to 3,000 rpm. Similarly, for a 4-pole generator, an engine speed of 1,800 rpm produces output of 60 Hz
