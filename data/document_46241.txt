How much ferritin is normal depends on your gender and age. For adult men normal ferritin level is somewhere between 12 and 300 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter), while adult women may expect their ferritin to be from 12 to 150 ng/mL. Ferritin level for children depends on the age group, so if they are 1 to 5 years old, their ferritin should be 6 to 24 ng/mL. For children between 5 and 9 years of age ferritin test should show 10 to 55 ng of ferritin per mL, while children older than 9 years of age should have up to 200 ng/mL of ferritin. If the result of your ferritin test shows value lower than the normal range, you do not have sufficient amount of iron in the body
1 Hemoglobin. 2  Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 3  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 4  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 5  Ferritin. 1 Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. 2  The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. 3  The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. 4
A normal ferritin blood level, referred to as the reference interval is determined by many testing laboratories. The ranges for ferritin can vary between laboratories but are usually between 30–300 ng/mL (=μg/L) for males, and 18–115 ng/mL (=μg/L) for females. 
What are normal results for a ferritin test? The results may vary slightly among laboratories, but in general, normal ferritin levels are 12-300 nanograms per milliliter of blood (ng/mL) for males and 12-150 ng/mL for females. Medically Reviewed by a Doctor on 2/27/2015. 1 The ferritin test measures the level of ferritin, the major iron storage protein in the body. 2  The ferritin test is a simple blood test. 3  High levels of ferritin can indicate an iron storage disorder, such as hemochromatosis, or a chronic disease process.
Results. A ferritin blood test checks the amount of ferritin in the blood. Ferritin is a protein in the body that binds to iron; most of the iron stored in the body is bound to ferritin. The amount of ferritin found in the blood is the same amount that is in the body.
Results. The normal range for blood ferritin is: 1  For men, 24 to 336 nanograms per milliliter (standard units) or 24 to 336 micrograms per liter (international units). 2  For women, 11 to 307 nanograms per milliliter (standard units) or 11 to 307 micrograms per liter (international units). A higher than normal ferritin level can be caused by: 1  Hemochromatosis — A condition that causes your body to absorb too much iron from the food you eat. 2  Porphyria — A group of disorders caused by an enzyme deficiency that affects your nervous system and skin. 3  Rheumatoid arthritis or another chronic inflammatory disorder.
The normal range for ferritin levels is rather broad and varies slightly among laboratories. Normal ferritin levels are higher for men than for women. High or low levels of ferritin are suggestive of an iron storage disorder or iron deficiency anemia, respectively.
