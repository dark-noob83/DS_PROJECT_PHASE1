now we can calculate the cost of the sale by taking the average cost per unit multiplied by the number of units sold next calculate the value of the remaining units there are 125 units left we will assign $ 8 03 per unit because that is the weighted average cost of those units on january 7 goods available for sale is 415 units with a total cost of $ 3394 00 if we divide $ 3394 00 by 415 we get a weighted average cost of $ 8 18 rounded per unit the rest of the calculation is very simple at this point the company sold 245 units we will use $ 8 18 as the cost of each unit therefore the total cost of goods sold is $ 2 004 10

when using the weighted average method divide the cost of goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale which yields the weighted average cost per unit in this calculation the cost of goods available for sale is the sum of beginning inventory and net purchases the total of all purchased or beginning inventory units is 450 150 beginning inventory 300 purchased the weighted average cost per unit is therefore $ 257 78 $ 116000 450 units the ending inventory valuation is $ 45112 175 units $ 257 78 weighted average cost while the cost of goods sold valuation is $ 70890 275 units $ 257 78 weighted average cost the sum of these two amounts less a rounding error equals the $ 116000 total actual cost of all purchases and beginning inventory
