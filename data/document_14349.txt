Formula of Variable Cost. The formula to calculate variable cost is: Total Variable Cost = Total Quantity of Output * Variable Cost Per Unit of Output. To recognize variable costs, it is important to understand how to categorize costs. Variable costs are those which do not remain constant, specifically when production activities fluctuate. For example, if the spark plug business made 500,000 units last year, its unit variable cost is $90,000 / 500,000, or $0.18. This cost per unit is the variable cost of each variable unit produced, or in other words the additional cost incurred for the production of each spark plug.
Thus, the cost per unit is not constant. For example, ABC Company has total variable costs of $50,000 and total fixed costs of $30,000 in May, which it incurred while producing 10,000 widgets. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $50,000 variable costs) / 10,000 units = $8 cost per unit. In the following month, ABC produces 5,000 units at a variable cost of $25,000 and the same fixed cost of $30,000. The cost per unit is: ($30,000 Fixed costs + $25,000 variable costs) / 5,000 units = $11/unit. 
1 This is because fixed costs are now being spread thinner across a larger production volume. 2  For example, if the business above spends $50,000 per year in rent, rent costs are allocated to each unit at $0.10 per unit. 1 The total variable costs for the year are therefore (35,000 + 20,000 + 100,000), or $155,000. 2  These costs are directly related to the production volume for that year.
1 Note that in most cases, increasing production will still make each additional unit more profitable. 2  This is because fixed costs are now being spread thinner across a larger production volume. 3  For example, if the business above spends $50,000 per year in rent, rent costs are allocated to each unit at $0.10 per unit. 1 The total variable costs for the year are therefore (35,000 + 20,000 + 100,000), or $155,000. 2  These costs are directly related to the production volume for that year.
To calculate the number, multiply the direct labor hourly rate by the number of direct labor hours required to complete one unit. For example, if the direct labor hourly rate is $10 and it takes five hours to complete one unit, the direct labor cost per unit is $10 multiplied by five hours, or $50. Divide $60 by 40 to get the hourly rate of $1.50. Add the $1.50 in employee payroll tax to the $10 hourly rate to get the total direct labor hourly rate of $11.50.
By dividing the total variable costs for a specific period by that same period's production volume will provide us with the variable cost per spark plug. For example, if the spark plug business made 500,000 units last year, its unit variable cost is $90,000 / 500,000, or $0.18. This cost per unit is the variable cost of each variable unit produced, or in other words the additional cost incurred for the production of each spark plug. For example, if the business produced 1,000 more units, it would expect to incur additional production costs of $180
You can calculate the unit costs of production by dividing the total amount of your fixed and variable costs by the total number of units you produced. For example, say your total fixed costs are $30,000, your variable costs are $50,000 and you produced 40,000 units. The total production costs are the $30,000 fixed costs added to the $50,000 variable costs for a total of $80,000. Divide 40,000 units by $80,000 to get your $2 per unit production costs. Breakeven Analysis. When you calculate the unit costs of production, you are calculating the breakeven point, or minimum price, you must sell each unit at to make a profit. For example, say you produce 2,000 units costing $3 per unit that you resell at $5 per unit. Your profit is $5 minus $3, or $2 a unit.
For example, if the business above produced 500,000 units of its product that year, its unit variable cost is (155,000 / 500,000) or $0.31. 1  The unit variable cost is simply the variable cost per unit produced. 2  It is the extra cost incurred by producing each additional unit. 1 The total variable costs for the year are therefore (35,000 + 20,000 + 100,000), or $155,000. 2  These costs are directly related to the production volume for that year.
