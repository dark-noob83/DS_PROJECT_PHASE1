Within the beef industry, ribeye size varies greatly. Both excessively small and excessively large ribeyes are quality challenges for the beef industry. An optimum range for ribeye area is 11 to 15 sq. in. Ribeye area targets should be approximately 1.6 to 1.8 sq. in. per 100 pounds of carcass weight. Results from the Mississippi Farm to Feedlot program show that ribeye area averaged 12.95 sq. in., and ribeye area per 100 pounds of carcass weight (cwt) averaged 1.74 sq. in. The Yield Grade of a beef carcass is determined by considering four characteristics: (1) the amount of external fat (back fat), (2) the amount of KPH fat, (3) the area of the ribeye muscle, and (4) the hot
A general rule of thumb for carcass beef is 25% bone and trim loss, 25% steaks, 25% roasts, and 25% ground beef. The type of cattle, as well as cutting and trimming procedures, can have a dramatic affect on retail yield. When fat and bone are removed, the weight of take home product from a carcass decreases. Purdue University – Animal Sciences Department. An average beef animal weighs about 1200 (± 250) pounds and has a hanging hot carcass weight (HCW) of about 750 (± 200) pounds. In general, freezer beef is sold using HCW as the basis. Hot carcass weight represents about 63 (± 2) percent of live weight (dressing percent) and is affected by the length of time an animal is away from feed and water, amount of muscling, distance transported, and amount of finish
Hot carcass weight (HCW) is the hot or unchilled weight of a beef carcass after harvest and removal of the hide, head, gastrointestinal tract, and internal organs. It is sometimes reported as carcass weight. Carcass weight is the most important factor in determining carcass value when cattle are sold. The Yield Grade of a beef carcass is determined by considering four characteristics: (1) the amount of external fat (back fat), (2) the amount of KPH fat, (3) the area of the ribeye muscle, and (4) the hot
Only ten of the processors slaughter beef and three of them charge disposal fees ($10 to $12) in addition to the slaughter fee ($30 to $75 range). The average slaughter fee including the three disposal fees is $50.22 per head. The average processing fee is $0.46 per pound of hanging beef carcass weight. This ranged from $0.36 to $0.55 among the processors and some of them were using cold carcass weights instead of hot carcass weights. As feed prices fluctuate, cattle producers should know what the breakeven price is for finishing beef and use it to determine what to charge for freezer beef. The price of beef at a retail level is near record high. The average retail price of Choice beef as of June 2013 was $5.29 per pound.
The packaged beef take home weight is approximately 40 percent of the animal’s live weight, or 75 percent of the HCW. Table 1 shows the approximate retail yields from carcasses of different yield grades. Table 2 illustrates the. approximate carcass weights and take home package weight by live animal weight. Purdue University – Animal Sciences Department. An average beef animal weighs about 1200 (± 250) pounds and has a hanging hot carcass weight (HCW) of about 750 (± 200) pounds. In general, freezer beef is sold using HCW as the basis. Hot carcass weight represents about 63 (± 2) percent of live weight (dressing percent) and is affected by the length of time an animal is away from feed and water, amount of muscling, distance transported, and amount of finish
The dressing percentage can be calculated as: (hot carcass weight ÷ live weight) x 100 The dressing percentage of each species of livestock animal will differ (Table 1).can lose 50 to 100 pounds, pigs 10 to 15 Many factors can affect the dressing percentage of an animal. 
Ultimately the carcass price is determined by the buyer and the seller, but the worksheet goes through an example using current average prices. A hanging weight of $2.42 per pound compares to $1.52 per pound live weight for a beef type steer. As feed prices fluctuate, cattle producers should know what the breakeven price is for finishing beef and use it to determine what to charge for freezer beef. The price of beef at a retail level is near record high. The average retail price of Choice beef as of June 2013 was $5.29 per pound.
The dressing percentage can be calculated as such: Dressing Percentage (DP)= (Carcass Weight / Live Weight) x 100. Different species tend to average different DP’s. Beef cattle average 62%, steers 59%, hogs 74% and market lambs 54%. Farmers can expect a 1000 pound steer to result in a 620 pound hanging carcass or a 140 pound market hog to produce a 103 pound carcass (140 x .74). The carcass-cutting yield is the percentage of the carcass that actually ends up as meat. From this 600 pound beef carcass a farmer should expect around the following: 27.5% chuck, 3.2% shank, 3.8% brisket, 9.8% ribs, 8.5% short plate, 17.7% loin, 5.3% flank, and 22.8% round.
Beef Carcass Breakdown. With an average market (live or on hoof) weight of 1,150 lbs and the average yield of 62.2%, the typical steer will produce a 715 lb. (dressed weight) carcass. The dressed beef (or carcass) will yield approximately 569 lbs. (further details below) of red meat and trim (take home meat-which includes the average weight of 27 lbs of variety meat: liver, heart, tongue, tripe, sweetbreads and brains) and 146 lbs of fat, bone and loss
