In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. nuclei; from Latin nucleus or nuculeus, meaning kernel) is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types have no nuclei, and a few others have many.
Plant Cell Nucleus The nucleus is a highly specialized organelle that serves as the information and administrative center of the cell. This organelle has two major functions.
The nuclear pore is a protein-lined channel in the nuclear envelope that regulates the transportation of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm and surrounded by a nuclear envelope. This envelope safeguards the DNA contained in the nucleus.
The Cell Nucleus: The cell nucleus is a membrane bound structure that contains the cell's hereditary information and controls the cell's growth and reproduction. It is the command center of a eukaryotic cell and is commonly the most prominent organelle in a cell.
Most of the nuclear material consists of chromatin, the unstructured form of the cell's DNA that will organize to form chromosomes during mitosis or cell division. Also inside the nucleus is the nucleolus, an organelle that synthesizes protein-producing macromolecular assemblies called ribosomes.
Nucleus of the Cell Think of it as the Control Center or Headquarters of the cell. The nucleus of the cell contains much of the DNA of the cell, and it regulates the activities of that cell, whatever those activities are. Basically it controls everything that happens inside the cell, it's like a boss of the cell. People also call it the brain of the cell. But, the nucleus does not control everything.
1 Nucleolus-The nucleolus is a large structure in the nucleus that mainly makes ribosomes and RNA. 2  Nucleoplasm-The nucleoplasm is the liquid that fills the inside of the nucleus. 3  Chromatin-Chromatin are composed of proteins and DNA.
