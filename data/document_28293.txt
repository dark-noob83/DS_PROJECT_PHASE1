While most materials have some magnetic properties, relatively few can be made into magnets. Iron and a few other related metals can easily become magnetized. When alloyed with other metals or made into compounds, they have stronger magnetism or are easier to make.
All magnets are made of a group of metals called the ferromagnetic metals. These are metals such as nickel and iron. Each of these metals have the special property of being able to be magnetized uniformly. When we ask how a magnet works we are simply asking how the object we call a magnet exerts it’s magnetic field.
Magnets are made from a rock called magnetite. For example we will take a bar magnet it is made up of tiny bar magnets, they are called magnetic domains. Magnetic domains only … exist in special kinds of metals such as iron, nickel and cobalt. Other metals like aluminium or copper don't have magnetic domains. Magnets have south poles and north poles.
