Loci is the plural for of the Latin word, locus, meaning place or location. The method of loci is also called the Journey Method by Dominic O'Brien, and the imaginary journeys are often referred to as Memory Palaces or Memory Journeys. See also Mind Palace, the term used in the TV show, Sherlock.
The straight lines of the locus are parallel to the line from P to Q, because they are at a set distance (r) from the line. P and Q are fixed points at either end of the line, so we draw semicircles of radius r. Sometimes the locus is not just a line, but an area. For example:
Definition. noun, plural: loci. (general) A place, space or locality, especially a centre of an activity. (mathematics) The set of all points whose coordinates satisfy a given equation or condition. (genetics) The location of a gene (or of a significant sequence) on a chromosome, as in genetic locus.

The method of loci (loci being Latin for places), also called the memory palace or mind palace technique, is a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous Rhetorica ad Herennium, Cicero 's De Oratore, and Quintilian 's Institutio Oratoria).
Locus Theorem 3: The locus of points equidistant from two points, P and Q, is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment determined by the two points. Locus Theorem 4: The locus of points equidistant from two parallel lines, l1 and l2, is a line parallel to both l1 and l2 and midway between them. Locus Theorem 5:
