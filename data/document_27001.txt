Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms that occur when there is damage to the nerves that manage every day body functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion.
While diabetes is generally the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy, other health conditions — even an infection — may be to blame. Some medications also may cause nerve damage. Symptoms and treatment will vary based on which nerves are damaged. 1  Symptoms.
Autonomic neuropathy occurs when the nerves that control involuntary bodily functions are damaged. This may affect blood pressure, temperature control, digestion, bladder function and even sexual function.
Overview. Autonomic neuropathy (AN) is a condition that results from damage to nerves that assist in organ and organ system functioning. This nerve damage disturbs signal processing between the autonomic nervous system and the brain.
Autonomic neuropathy may affect the nerves that control sweating. 1  Reduced sweating is common, especially in the hands and feet. 2  It may be hard to recognize when your blood sugar is dropping because sweating is one of the main symptoms of low blood sugar.
Autonomic neuropathy affects the autonomic nerves, which control the bladder, intestinal tract, and genitals, among other organs. Paralysis of the bladder is a common symptom of this type of neuropathy. When this happens, the nerves of the bladder no longer respond normally to pressure as the bladder fills with urine.
Autonomic neuropathy is caused by damage to the nerves that help control the involuntary functions of the body (autonomic nervous system), such as heartbeat and blood pressure, sweating and temperature regulation, digestion, urination, and some aspects of sexual function.
