Three Methods: Cubic Inches Calculator Calculating the Volume of a Box in Cubic Inches Calculating the Volumes of Other Shapes. A cubic inch is a measure of volume that is equal to that of a cube measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) on each side. An object's volume in cubic inches is, thus, the same as that of a certain number of these hypothetical cubes.
1 Calculate your volume; Multiply area times the depth, this will be volume in cubic feet. 2  Calculate your cubic yards; Divide cubic feet by 27 to convert to cubic yards and this is your answer. 3  Where (ft 2) = square foot, (ft 3) = cubic foot, (yd 3) = cubic yard.
1 For example, if we wanted to find the volume of a refrigerator, we would find its length, width, and depth in inches. 2  Let's say our fridge is 50 inches (127.0 cm) long, 25 inches (63.5 cm) wide, and 20 inches (50.8 cm) deep.
Hi Debbie, 24 ft is 24/3 = 8 yards. 30 ft is 30/3 = 10 yards. 5 inches is 5/36 yards. Thus the volume is. 8 10 5/36 = 11.1 cubic yards. You can calculate this and similar volumes using our volume calculator.
