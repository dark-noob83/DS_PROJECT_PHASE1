The distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is considered to be the most important distinction among groups of organisms. Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not. Differences in cellular structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes include the presence of mitochondria and chloroplasts, the cell wall, and the structure of chromosomal DNA.
Membrane bound organelles like mitochondria, chloroplast, nucleus, etc. are absent in prokaryotes. Genetic material of prokaryotes is not present in nucleus and consists of a large DNA molecule compacted in an area of cytoplasm called the nucleiod region.
The prokaryotes are a group of organisms that lack a cell nucleus, or any other membrane. The prokaryotes are divided into two domains: Archeabacteria and Eubacteria.
Prokaryotes don't have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. They have a nucleoid which houses their genetic material, but they lack an internal membrane system. Eukaryotes … are approximately ten times the size of prokaryotes.
Cells in the monera kingdom such as bacteria and cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) are prokaryotes. Prokaryotic cells differ significantly from eukaryotic cells. They don't have a membrane-bound nucleus and instead of having chromosomal DNA, their genetic information is in a circular loop called a plasmid.
Introduction to characteristics of prokaryotes. Prokaryotes are the single-celled organisms and much smaller than eukaryotic cells. The size of most prokaryotes is between 1 µm and 10 µm, but can vary in size from 0.2 µm to 750 µm.
Prokaryotic cells have genetic material that is not contained in a nucleus; Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus in which their genetic material is separated from the rest of th … e cell. Also, keep in mind that eukaryotic cells are known to have a nucleus while prokaryotic cells do not.
