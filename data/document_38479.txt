A: Yes. If you do not have an old battery core to return to the Interstate Batteries wholesaler when you pick up your battery, the Interstate Batteries wholesaler will charge you core fee. Depending on the size of your battery and the part of the country you are in will determine the core fee you are charged. A: Yes.
The core charges range from $8 - $65 per battery depending on the type of battery you have. The benefit of purchasing an Interstate battery from Batteries Express Inc is that you will never pay a mark up on a core charge like you will if you purchase your Interstate battery from other dealers.
A “Core Charge” is similar to the deposit you might pay for a can or bottle of soda. In many states, to promote recycling, you are charged a deposit when you purchase a can of soda and you receive your deposit back when you return the empty can.
Core charge is a little misleading. If a battery is $50 plus a $10 core charge, the battery is really a $60 battery and you get a $10 rebate if you bring in an old battery for recycle. I'd rather have them call it a rebate than a core charge, because that's effectively what it is.
Less than 3 years ago I bought batteries for a heavy duty diesel truck that requires 2 batteries. Wal-Mart was the cheapest place to buy the batteries and they have a 3 year free replacement warranty on the particular batteries that I purchased.
1 With installation charges, taxes and recycling/core fees (which vary by state), the total cost for a replacement car battery can be $60-$300 or more. 2  For example, from 2010 to 2012, CostHelper readers reported paying $52-$130 for a car battery with do-it-yourself installation, at an average cost of $86.
