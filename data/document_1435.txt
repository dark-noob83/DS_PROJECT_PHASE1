I have those EBC rotors on my C5 and on a Trans Am. They are great rotors. They are completely black coated. The firepath does wear off immediately but the rest of the rotor stays black including the dimples and grooves. It looks pretty damn sharp and they do not rust out like stockers and many others. I use them with the EBC Greenstuff pads which are also awesome.
Most big twins are built these days with cost saving solid front and rear brake rotors but the new EBC Brakes black chrome rotor for big twin units convert this old technology to a modern fully floating design that will reduce the chance of rotor warping and vibration. As with all EBC big twin rotors, all components and hardware are stainless steel but in addition to the high lustre polished stainless steel centre hub, we have applied a black chrome finish to improve the cosmetics.
Posts: 376. i just ordered a set of black ebc rotors, supposedly the black wears off the surface pretty quickly but stays in the slots and drill holes. ebc is quality stuff so im sure they are worth it. if anything, it will resist rusting. (PICS PLZ!). I'm in the market to get new rotors. I've come across some black rotors and am curious if anybody have these and what their opinions are. Please post pics if you have these on your car. Thanks! __________________

Try to avoid the rotor surface and clean any overspray off with laquer thinner or acetone. Just dont use something oily or that leaves a residue to clean the rotor surface
Black Disc Rotors. Hello! In the search to get all my components black, I have reached the final frontier: the rotors. Back in the day of rim brakes it was easy: my X517 rims were black anodised, and were then ceramic coated. Brilliant braking performance, and they stayed black. 597. That zinc coating will be rubbed off in a few stops. Stainless steel isn't black, so once you use/wear the rotors they will show their true color. Two-piece rotors with black centers is as close as you're going to get.
Yes, the finish will disappear on the friction surface. It is just a black zinc coating similar to what EBC does on the domestic series of Sport rotors and on their Ultimax rotors. The hat and the edge of the rotor will stay coated though since the pad doesn't come in contact with them. 
It does come off completly where the pad makes contact with the rotors. Usually in a 100 miles or so. And the viens and holes stay black. If someone had one with 300 miles and the coating was not rubbed off even where the pad contacts, someone needs to re bleed. __________________.
