In a eukaryotic cell, mRNA is synthesized in the nucleus and translated on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. A protein-coding gene is transcribed into a pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA is processed into a mature mRNA. mRNA exits the nucleus. mRNA is translated on ribosomes to produce the polypeptide chain.
The process of eukaryotic transcription is separated into three phases, initiation, elongation, and termination. It is a complex process involving various cell signaling techniques as well as the action of many enzymes. The following information is a detailed description of eukaryotic transcription.
A eukaryotic cell has a nucleus that separates the processes of transcription and translation. Eukaryotic transcription occurs within the nucleus where DNA is packaged into nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures.
Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases. Unlike prokaryotic RNA polymerase that initiates the transcription of all different types of RNA, RNA polymerase in eukaryotes (including humans) comes in three variations, each encoding a different type of gene.
Eukaryotic translation is the process by which messenger RNA is translated into proteins in eukaryotes. It consists of initiation, elongation, translocation, and termination.
Gene transcription occurs in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.Unlike prokaryotic RNA polymerase that initiates the transcription of all different types of RNA, RNA polymerase in eukaryotes (including humans) comes in three variations, each encoding a different type of gene.
Transcription is the process of copying genetic information stored in a DNA strand into a transportable complementary strand of RNA. Eukaryotic transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell and proceeds in three sequential stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.
