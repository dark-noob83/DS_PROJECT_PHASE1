LUTINO QUAKER Genetics I have been asked many times about (Yellow) Lutino Quakers and the genetics of them. There are 2 types of Lutino Quakers, Sex Linked and Recessive. Most are recessive. We breed Sex Linked LUTINO'S. (Yellow) Quakers. Lutino are Red Eyed and Yellow are Dark eyed, and recessive only.
Since there is no melanin production, there is no dark pigment to interact with the structural color to create blue, so you are left with the expression of just the psittacin pigments yellow. In Quaker parakeets, there are actually two Lutino mutations.
This is a similar effect as the Tyndall effect that makes the sky appear blue. So the green in Quakers is a combination of the yellow pigments (commonly called psittacins) and the blue structural color. The greys of the chest and dark color of the flight feathers and tail are produced by the grey or brown melanins.
