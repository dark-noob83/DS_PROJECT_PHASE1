Fermi knew that when an atom splits it releases other neutrons, and he was quick to realize that under the right conditions those neutrons could go on to split other atoms in a chain reaction. This would lead to one of two things: a steady generation of energy in the form of heat or a huge explosion.
It’s possible to release this energy, and actually harness it, by splitting specific types of atoms apart into multiple fragments – a process known as nuclear fission. All you need to break apart a uranium-235 atom is a slow-moving free neutron.
Splitting an atom is called nuclear fission, a process that was discovered in 1938; the repeated splitting of atoms in fission is called a chain reaction. While most people do not have the equipment to do this, if you've ever been curious how it's done, here's an overview. Ad.
ANSWER Ernest Walton and John Cockroft (1932) were the first to split the nucleus in a completely controlled manner. This was under the direction of Rutherford (see below) who, whilst at the Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge had done so but not by entirely artificial means.
Best Answer: In the most common form of atomic bomb uranium 235 is split by striking it with a low energy neutron. Generally the heavier an element the easier it is to split its atom (fission). The mass of the fragments is less than that of the original atom and the lost mass is converted into energy (E=mc^2). The fission also releases more slow neutrons which go on to provide the chain reaction.
The focus of the splitting-the-atom story should be on the discovery of nuclear fission and its impact on world affairs. It is important not to overlook the science in this episode when considering the ethical and national-security considerations associated with fission and fusion.
