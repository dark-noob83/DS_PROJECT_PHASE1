The valuable high fiber food list links below will help you start eating more healthy fiber today! These two great lists of foods with high fiber content are vital to eating a healthy diet high in fiber. They'll help prevent constipation, diabetes, heart disease, excess weight and much more. Even though high fiber is so good for you, you can't digest plant fiber. The fiber you eat passes directly through your small intestine into your colon and out of your body. By taking this route, high fiber foods help keep your colon healthy and promote regularity.
Dietary fiber or roughage is the indigestible portion of food derived from plants. It has two main components: 1  Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, is readily fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically active byproducts, and can be prebiotic and viscous. Dietary fiber is the edible parts of plants or analogous carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine, with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine. Dietary fiber includes polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, lignin, and associated plant substances.
Fiber is also known as roughage. It is the indigestible part of plant foods that pushes through our digestive system, absorbing water along the way and easing bowel movements. The word fiber (North American) can also be spelled fibre (British). The word fiber is misleading, because many types of dietary fibers are not fibers at all. There are two broad types of fiber, soluble and insoluble. 1  Soluble fiber dissolves in water. 2  It changes as it goes through the digestive tract, where it is fermented by bacteria. 3  As it absorbs water it becomes gelatinous.
1 This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material. 2  It can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. 3  Soluble fiber is found in oats, peas, beans, apples, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium. 4  Insoluble fiber. Instead, it passes relatively intact through your stomach, small intestine and colon and out of your body. Fiber is commonly classified as soluble, which dissolves in water, or insoluble, which doesn't dissolve. 1  Soluble fiber. 2  This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material. 3  It can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels
Consistent intake of fermentable fiber through foods like berries and other fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, seeds, and nuts is now known to reduce risk of some of the world’s most prevalent diseases — obesity, diabetes, high blood cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, and numerous gastrointestinal disorders. Dietary fiber is the edible parts of plants or analogous carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine, with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine. Dietary fiber includes polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, lignin, and associated plant substances.
“ Fiber is found in whole grains, beans, fruits and vegetables,” Smathers said. It is often found in higher concentration in fruit and vegetable skins. She suggested a diet incorporating the following high-fiber foods: 1  Lentils, which have 16 grams of fiber per cup, cooked. Good sources of soluble fiber include beans, lentils, oatmeal, peas, citrus fruits, blueberries, apples and barley. Good sources of insoluble fiber include foods with whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, brown rice, cauliflower, potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers.

Soluble Fiber and Insoluble Fiber All plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seeds and beans, have fiber. But all fiber is not the same. It can be divided into two categories with different effects on your body. Soluble fiber is found in dried beans, peas, oats and oat bran, flaxseed and psyllium husks. Even though high fiber is so good for you, you can't digest plant fiber. The fiber you eat passes directly through your small intestine into your colon and out of your body.
