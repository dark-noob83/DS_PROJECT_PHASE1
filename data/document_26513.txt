The Sahara divides the continent into North and Sub-Saharan Africa. The southern border of the Sahara is marked by a band of semiarid savanna called the Sahel; south of the Sahel lies the lusher Sudan. Humans have lived on the edge of the desert for almost 500,000 years.
At 3.6 million square miles (9.4 million square kilometers), the Sahara, which is Arabic for The Great Desert, engulfs most of North Africa. The desert covers large sections of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia.
Look at the map and you'll see why, it covers a large area. That's why you have Mediterranean North Africa, the Sahara and sub-Saharan Africa. Basically, its existence confined ancient empires to the Mediterranean coast, and in general limited contact between the Mediterranean world and the African interior.
In addition to being extremely dry, the Sahara is also one of the hottest regions in the world. The average annual temperature for the desert is 86°F (30°C) but during the hottest months temperatures can exceed 122°F (50°C), with the highest temperature ever recorded at 136°F (58°C) in Aziziyah, Libya.
The desert has minimal and sporadic precipitation. It is located in a climate divide, where the ITCZ moves up from the south but doesn’t quite reach the Sahara desert, and the winter rainfall of North Africa does not move far south enough to have the rain hit the Sahara.
Sahara World's largest desert, with an area of c. 9,065,000sq km (3,500,000sq mi), covering nearly a third of Africa's total land area. It consists of Algeria, Niger, Libya, Egypt, and Mauritania, the s parts of Morocco and Tunisia, and the n parts of Senegal, Mali, Chad, and Sudan.
