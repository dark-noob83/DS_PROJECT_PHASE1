General Information. If you arrive in Uganda by air, you will be arriving at Entebbe International Airport (airport code: EBB). Entebbe is a medium sized town about 40 km south of Kampala on Lake Victoria. The airport is on a peninsula in Lake Victoria and is relatively modern (by African standards).
Please Note: Tourist Visas have increased from 50 usd to 100 usd as of July 1 – 2015. It now costs to visit Uganda as a Tourist going on a safari, as a Volunteer, short-term Missions worker, business person, or attending a convention here.
Visas. British nationals need a visa to enter Uganda. You can get a visa from the Ugandan High Commission in London, or at Entebbe airport on arrival. Ugandan immigration officers decide how long tourists are permitted to stay in Uganda when they enter the country.
Question: How much is a visa for 5 months single entry? Answer: The cost of your Uganda visa will largely depend on the type of visa you want and the length of your stay in Uganda. Charges have recently been revised and range from USD 50 to USD 200. In this case therefore, I suggest that you acquire a 6 month multiple entry visa, which would cost you about USD 100. You can get details on about visa fees and the cost of other permits in Uganda on this link.
The best place to get your Uganda Tourist Visa is at the point of arrival which for most is Entebbe International Airport.
