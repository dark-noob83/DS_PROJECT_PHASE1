Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF). The normal cerebral blood flow is approximately 50ml/100g/min or 700 ml/min, which is roughly 14 % of the cardiac output. This ranges from 20ml/100g/min in white matter to 70ml/100g/min in grey matter. The Kety-Schmidt technique applies the Fick principal using N 2 O to calculate whole brain CBF. Pressure autoregulation maintains CBF at a constant level in normal brain in the face of the usual fluctuations in blood pressure. It is a poorly understood local vascular mechanism. Normally autoregulation maintains a constant blood flow between MAP 50 mmHg and 150 mmHg.
CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW. The average cerebral blood flow in humans is approximately 55 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute. This is a little over 700 mL/min for a 1350-g brain. This level is reached in less than 10 s when cerebral blood flow is com pletely stopped. Low tissue oxygen levels in the brain (hypoxidosis) can be caused by de creased blood flow (ischemia) or with adequate blood flow accompanied by low levels of blood oxygen (hypoxemia).
By placing a radioactivity counter over the head, one can measure the amount of blood flow into the brain. (See How Nuclear Medicine Works .) The cerebral blood flow study takes 20 to 30 minutes to perform. If there is no blood flow to the brain as demonstrated by this study, the brain is dead. A negative cerebral flow study is indisputable evidence of a dead brain. Normal cerebral blood flow study showing cranial space filled with blood. Cerebral blood flow study showing no blood entering the brain. Another confirmatory test is chemical: The patient can be given 1 mg of atropine IV. In the patient with an intact brain, atropine will dramatically increase the patient's heart rate. In a brain-dead patient, atropine will not influence heart rate. 
Persistent cerebral blood flow occasionally confounds confirmatory tests for brain death and results in the anguish of delayed diagnosis, unnecessary use of expensive resources, and loss of transplant opportunities. We reviewed the literature to examine the reasons, frequency, and meaning of this problem. The destruction of the lower brain stem causes the loss of capacity to breathe spontaneously, and brain death is observed only in patients supported by respirators. Confirmatory tests measuring or showing CBF are based on the assumption that there is cessation of blood flow with brain death.
The cerebral blood flow is higher in children than in adults, typically exceeding 100 mL per 100 g per minute. However, contrary to popular thinking, the blood flow decreases only slightly with advancing age. The brain utilizes fully 25 percent of the body's total oxygen consumption. This level is reached in less than 10 s when cerebral blood flow is com pletely stopped. Low tissue oxygen levels in the brain (hypoxidosis) can be caused by de creased blood flow (ischemia) or with adequate blood flow accompanied by low levels of blood oxygen (hypoxemia).
Too little blood flow (ischemia) results if blood flow to the brain is below 18 to 20 ml per 100 g per minute, and tissue death occurs if flow dips below 8 to 10 ml per 100 g per minute. If the PaCO2 dips to 30 mmHg, this represents a 10 mmHg decrease from the initial value of PaCO2. Consequently, the CBF decreases by 1ml per 100g per min for each 1mmHg decrease in PaCO2, resulting in a new CBF of 40ml per 100g of brain tissue per minute.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the blood supply to the brain in a given period of time. In an adult, CBF is typically 750 millilitres per minute or 15% of the cardiac output. This equates to an average perfusion of 50 to 54 millilitres of blood per 100 grams of brain tissue per minute. CBF is tightly regulated to meet the brain's metabolic demands. If the PaCO2 dips to 30 mmHg, this represents a 10 mmHg decrease from the initial value of PaCO2. Consequently, the CBF decreases by 1ml per 100g per min for each 1mmHg decrease in PaCO2, resulting in a new CBF of 40ml per 100g of brain tissue per minute.
