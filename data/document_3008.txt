The predominant regions for zinc metal production, however, are China, Western Europe and Asia. It follows that a major world trade exists in zinc concentrates, mainly out of Australia, Latin America and Canada and into Asia (including China, which produces more zinc than it can mine) and Western Europe.
Zinc comes from natural mineral deposits of ore in the earth s crust. The deposits may be close to the surface, in which case they will be mined from an open pit. Alternatively, they may be some distance underground and cannot be mined directly from the surface. Approximately two thirds of the world s zinc production is derived from purely underground mining.
Zinc oxide is the metal zinc that has been oxidized. The chemical formula is ZnO, 1 zinc atom and 1 oxygen atom held together by an ionic bond. Zinc oxide does occur in nature as the mineral zincite, but it is quite rare and commercially unavailable.
It is also found as an element (in trace amounts) in plants and animals. Humans require Zinc as part of a balanced diet, this is obtained from foods such as: oysters, beans, spinach, nuts, oats, red meat and milk.
Brass, for example, is a mixture of copper and 20%-45% zinc. Name: The derivation of zinc is unknown but it comes from the similar German word zinker that is used for the element zink. The identified zinc resources worldwide are estimated to total over 1.9 billion tons.
Represented in the periodic table as Zn, zinc is a transition metal, grouped with cadmium and mercury. With the middling atomic number 30, it has five stable isotopes of atomic weight from the dominant zinc 64 to zinc 70, plus an extra 25 radioisotopes.
Zinc is the 24th most abundant mineral on earth and is found in  the form of sphalerite, an ore which is mined.    It is also found as an element (in trace amounts) in â€¦ plants and  animals.    Humans require Zinc as part of a balanced diet, this is obtained  from foods such as: oysters, beans, spinach, nuts, oats, red meat  and milk.
