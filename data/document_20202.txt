Thrush is just a yeast infection in the mouth and tongue and they give you an oral antibiotic that you dip a qtip in and wipe over the affected area. It may be that when you took him to the dr it was just milk and now has developed into thrush.
If you're breastfeeding you'll want to be on the lookout for white spots that may develop on your baby's tongue. That's called thrush, a type of yeast infection that may hinder him from eating well. Thrush is easily treated with nystatin liquid.
Share. Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) happens when the string of tissue under your baby's tongue (frenulum), which attaches her tongue to the floor of her mouth, is too short. If your baby has tongue-tie, her tongue can't move freely, and this can cause problems (NICE 2005a) .
My baby had a white tounge for a long time. Just from only eating milk. As long as she's not in any kind of pain, and no sores, it's probably just milk residue.
It could be a common and harmless yeast infection known as thrush. Thrush looks like cottage cheese or milk curds on the sides, roof, and sometimes the tongue of a baby's mouth. It's most common in babies 2 months and younger, but it can appear in older babies, too.
