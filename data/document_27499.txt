Serving Size in Ounces. A 2- to 3-ounce portion of cooked meat, chicken or fish -- all of which are protein-rich foods -- is the equivalent of one serving, reports the American Heart Association. Using everyday products as comparison tools can be an effective way to keep serving sizes in check.
An average amount of protein to eat per day is about as many grams as your weight is in kilograms. To convert your weight from pounds to kilograms, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2. One ounce of meat or 1 cup of milk can be estimated to be about 8 grams of protein.
If youâ€™re 15-18 years old: Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36 to estimate how many grams of protein you need each day. For example, a 16 year-old female who weighs 120 lbs would need about 43 grams of protein (120 lbs x 0.36 = 43.2). Keep in mind that this is just an estimate.
A person who eats 2,000 calories per day should eat 6 ounces of grain foods daily. At least half (3 ounces) of the grain foods eaten should be whole grains. Approximately one ounce of grain foods counts as a serving. This is about one slice of bread, one roll, or one small muffin.
A 6-ounce container of plain nonfat Greek yogurt has 18 grams of protein, for example, and a 3-ounce serving of lean ground beef has 21 grams. One egg has about 6 grams, 1/2 cup of cooked beans has 7 to 10 grams, and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter has 8 grams.
Grams of Protein Per Serving. Each ounce of cooked meat provides around 7 grams of protein, notes Taste of Home. If you ate a 3-ounce serving of chicken for lunch, then, you could expect to consume around 21 grams of protein from this food.
A serving size should be no larger than 4 to 6 ounces, and you shouldn't exceed 12 ounces of protein in your day. Naturally, if you're having protein without saturated fat, such as fish or tofu, you can have more.
