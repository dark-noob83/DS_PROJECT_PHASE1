Precipitation, evaporation, and river runoff Precipitation over the Atlantic Ocean varies between 10 cm per year in the subtropics,with minima near St. Helena and the Cape Verde Islands, and more than 200 cm per year inthe tropics. pdf version 1.0 (December 2001) Chapter 15 Hydrology of the Atlantic Ocean The hydrology of the Atlantic Ocean basins is deeply affected by the formation andrecirculation of North Atlantic Deep Water, which was discussed in Chapter 7.
~ Table of Content ~. The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceanic divisions. With a total area of about 106.4 million square kilometres (41.1 million square miles), it covers approximately twenty percent of the Earth's surface and about twenty-six percent of its water surface area. The first part of its name refers to the Atlas of Greek mythology, making the Atlantic the Sea of Atlas.
A second band of high rainfall, with values of100 - 150 cm per year, follows the path of the storm systems in the Westerlies of theNorth Atlantic Ocean from Florida (28 - 38°N) to Ireland, Scotland, and Norway(50 - 70°N). pdf version 1.0 (December 2001) Chapter 15 Hydrology of the Atlantic Ocean The hydrology of the Atlantic Ocean basins is deeply affected by the formation andrecirculation of North Atlantic Deep Water, which was discussed in Chapter 7.
On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values. Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic is second in size to the Pacific. With its adjacent seas, it occupies an area of about 106,400,000 square kilometres (41,100,000 sq mi); without them, it has an area of 82,400,000 square kilometres (31,800,000 sq mi).
