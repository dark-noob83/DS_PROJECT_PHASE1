Chapter 5. Microbial Biotechnology. The rich abundance of bacteria and other microbes provides a wealth of potential biotech applications. * Before you can consider the many applications of microbial biotechnology, you must be able to distinguish bacterial cells from plant and animal cells. Prokaryotes make up two of three domains. Many archaebacteria live in extreme conditions and as a result have unique metabolic properties (ie.
1 Medical microbiology: The study of the pathogenic microbes and the role of microbes in human illness. 2  Includes the study of microbial pathogenesis and epidemiology and is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology. 1 Evolutionary microbiology: The study of the evolution of microbes. 2  This field can be subdivided into: 3  Microbial taxonomy: The naming and classification of microorganisms. 4  Microbial systematic: The study of the diversity and genetic relationship
Microbial Ecology. 1  Microbial ecology is the study of microbes in the environment and their interactions with each other. 2  Microbes are the tiniest creatures on Earth, yet despite their small size, they have a huge impact on us and on our environment. It is estimated that we know fewer than 1% of the microbial species on Earth. Yet microbes surround us everywhere -- air, water, soil. An average gram of soil contains one billion (1,000,000,000) microbes representing probably several thousand species.
The B.S. in Biotechnology, Microbial Systems option, is an interdisciplinary degree offered by the College of Agriculture. Students pursue a basic science curriculum the first two years and then choose an area of emphasis (Microbial, Plant or Animal Systems) for the junior and senior year. What opportunities for laboratory research are there in Biotechnology-Microbial Systems? MSU offers a great opportunity for undergraduate research, in fact, a research and creative experience is required of all MSU students.

Industrial microbiology or microbial biotechnology is the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa and viruses) or plant and animal cells to create useful products or processes. 1 Vaccines. 2  Vaccines are essential to protect humans and animals from microbial diseases. 3  Recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the production of vaccines that offer protection without risk of infection (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine). 4  New vaccines are being developed by industrial microbiologists every day.

Insulin crystals. Biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2). 1 Some examples are the designing of organisms to produce antibiotics, and the engineering of genetic cures through genetic manipulation. 2  White biotechnology, also known as industrial biotechnology, is biotechnology applied to industrial processes. 3  An example is the designing of an organism to produce a useful chemical.
The Master of Microbial Biotechnology (MMB) degree program at N.C. State University represents one of the first and most successful Professional Science Masters programs in the country.
