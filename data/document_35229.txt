If you use 900 kWh/mo., that's 900 kWh / 30.4 days per month = 29.6 kWh/day. Figure how many kWh you need to generate each hour. From the map above you can see that if you live in a yellow area that you'll get 5 to 6 hours of peak sun per day on average. We'll call that 5 hours/day to be conservative. Since you need to generate 29.6 kwH/day, you need a 29.6 kWh / 5 hours = 5.92 kWp system. An $18,000 system ($12,600 after the tax credit) that produces 3800 kWh a year in a windy place with 12mph avg. windspeed will produce 76,000 kWh over its 20-year life, for a cost of $0.17 per kWh. That's much more than grid energy, and way more than solar.

1 4. • If you want to have 2000 kwh per month, it means you have to produce 2000/30 kwh every day, that is 66.66 kwh per day. 2  Considering there are 4 hours of peak sun every day in your area, the solar system will have to produce 66.66/4 = 16.66 kwh per hour, and that means 16660 in watts. 
Most solar panels today operate at around 12 - 14 % efficiency, meaning they convert about 1/8 of the suns energy to electricity, the rest just heats up the panel. That might sound terrible, but consider many of our current day technologies. A car is about 25% efficient, an incandescent light bulb about 4%. Report Abuse. Solar panels produce electric power according to their size, efficiency and how much sunlight they receive. For homeowners and small businesses, roof-mounted panels are a typical option. Solar panels rated at 100 to 200 watts cover about 10 square feet (1 square meter).
Left on for 10 hours, it will consume 1000 watt-hours, which is the same as 1 kilowatt-hour, or 1 kWh. Similarly (and under ideal conditions), if a 345 watt solar panel is left in the brightest sun for 1 hour, it will generate 345 watt-hours of energy. How many square miles of solar panels would be needed to generate 272,645 million kWh per year? The arithmetic is simple, but it’s with giant numbers so care is needed. Our one square foot of panels generates 30 kWh per year. There are 5280 times 5280 or about 28 million square feet in one square mile.
You will need roughly 4 Kw of solar panels (4000 WATTS) if you know how to use a soldering iron,then I would suggest searching ebay for solar “cells” and easily construct your own panels for around $300-$400 per 1 Kw. Depending on the protective enamle / frame and glass you choose to use. This takes into account some rainy and cloudy days. That’s 6 hours per day for 30 days = 180 sun-hours per month. In order to generate 300 KwH of solar electricity per month, we’ll need to have 1.667 Kilowatts of solar panel generation. That’s 1667 watts of generation capacity. If you have panels that generate 80 watts each, that will take about 21 panels running at 80 watts
100/1000 (kiloWatt) x 10 (hours) x 30 days = 30 kWh hours per month. Solar panels will work anywhere there is sun; however, some locations are better than others. Here are some of the more important factors you need to take into account: Location. Southern locations receive more direct sunlight than northern locations. 
To figure out how many kilowatt hours (kWh) your solar panel system puts out per year, you need to multiply the size of your system in kW DC times the .8 derate factor times the number of hours of sun. Your electric bills show how the average number of kWh you use per month. For example, a 50 Watt light bulb left on for one hour would be 50 Watt hours, and 20 50 watt light bulbs running for one hour would be 1 kilowatt hour (kWh).
Generally, a solar energy system will provide output for about 5 hours per day. So, if you have a 1.8 kW system size and it produces for 5 hours a day, 365 days a year: This solar energy system will produce 3,285 kWh in a year (1.8 kW x 5 hours x 365 days). If the PV panels are shaded for part of the day, the output would be reduced in accordance to the shading percentage.
