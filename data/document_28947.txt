Up-front costs are high. The tankless water heaters we tested cost $800 to $1,150, compared with $300 to $480 for the regular storage-tank types. Tankless models need electrical outlets for their fan and electronics, upgraded gas pipes, and a new ventilation system. That can bring average installation costs to $1,200, compared with $300 for storage-tank models. Tankless units might need more care. During our long-term testing, an indicator on the tankless model warned of scale buildup. We paid $334 for special valves and a plumber to flush out the water heater with vinegar.
Most often, tankless water heater installation is done by a plumber or HVAC contractor and most of the cost is based on what tankless water heater you want installed, as well as the complexity of the installation. On average, a tankless water heater can be installed in under 8 hours by a plumber and their apprentice. 
1 Because tankless water heaters require a 220V/240V electrical outlet or larger gas pipes than found in an average home plus a stainless steel ventilation system, installation can add $1,000-$3,000 or more, bringing total costs to $1,800-$4,500.

Gas tankless water heaters, which use high-powered burners to quickly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger, were 22 percent more energy efficient on average than the gas-fired storage-tank models in our tests. That translates into a savings of around $70 to $80 per year, based on 2008 national energy costs. That can bring average installation costs to $1,200, compared with $300 for storage-tank models. Tankless units might need more care. During our long-term testing, an indicator on the tankless model warned of scale buildup. We paid $334 for special valves and a plumber to flush out the water heater with vinegar.
