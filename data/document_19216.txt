Theme: Aromatic compounds as drugs (p-Aminophenol derivatives, quinones, phenols). Acids of aromatic series, their salts, esters and amides as drug substances.
Definition of AMINOPHENOL. 1. : any of three crystalline compounds NH2C6H4OH derived from phenol, distinguished as ortho-aminophenol, meta-aminophenol, and para-aminophenol, and used as dye intermediates, the para compound being also used as a fur and hair dye and as a photographic developer. 2. usually amino phenol: any amino derivative of a phenol.
In the search for less toxic compounds, para-aminophenol was tried in the belief that the body oxidized acetanilide to this compound. Toxicity was not lessened, however, and a number of chemical derivatives of para-aminophenol were then tested. One of the more satisfactory of these was phenacetin (acetophenetidin).
Introduction. Acetaminophen (paracetamol; N-acetyl-p -aminophenol; TYLENOL, others) is the active metabolite of phenacetin, a so-called coal tar analgesic.
4-Aminophenol (or para-aminophenol or p-aminophenol) is the organic compound with the formula H 2 NC 6 H 4 OH. Typically available as a white powder, it is commonly used as a developer in black-and-white film, marketed under the name Rodinal.
