I’m sure you’ve probably seen a couple (or more) reviews of Thor: The Dark World out there that are sort of flail-y and excited and filled with all caps that just generally praise this movie for being true to its thing and a heck of a lot of fun, plus, you know, LOKI.
On Loki’s Hair. “In Thor, that was my own hair. I grew it out. But I have naturally curly, blonde hair, so I’ll never look like that. By the time I got to The Avengers, I had come off two other films, which required me to have it very short.
If Judd Apatow wants to give me a call, I would love to. I love those movies. It’s nice to flex the funny bone.”. In 2011’s Thor, Tom Hiddleston was a scene-stealer as Thor’s bad apple brother Loki.

The good. By far the best thing about a party hostel like Loki is that it draws in hundreds of other travellers from around the world who are looking to meet new people, have a good time and join together for trips in the surrounding area.
