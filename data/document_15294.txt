Reference Range. Microalbuminuria is defined as excretion of 30–300 mg of albumin per 24 hours (or 20–200 mcg/min or 30–300 mcg/mg creatinine) on 2 of 3 urine collections. The detection of low levels of albumin excretion (microalbuminuria) has been linked to the identification of incipient diabetic kidney disease.
Albumin is a protein made by the liver. A serum albumin test measures the amount of this protein in the clear liquid portion of the blood.
An albumin test checks urine for a protein called albumin. Albumin is normally found in the blood and filtered by the kidneys. When the kidneys are working as they should, there may be a very small amount of albumin in the urine.
An albumin test checks urine for the presence of a protein called albumin. This is called albuminuria. It is most often caused by kidney damage from diabetes. But many other conditions can lead to kidney damage. These numbers are just a guide. The range for normal varies from lab to lab.
Causes of low albumin levels in plasma-hypoalbuminemia. The normal range of albumin concentration is blood plasma is about 3.5 to 5.4 grams per deciliter. Low blood plasma albumin levels also referred to as hypoalbuminemia may occur as a result of conditions like liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatitis.
Reference Range. The reference range for albumin testing is as follows: The normal range is 3.5 to 5.5 g/dL or 35-55 g/liter. This range may vary slightly in different laboratories. Albumin composes 50%-60% of blood plasma proteins. An image depicting human serum albumin can be seen below. The structure of human serum albumin.
