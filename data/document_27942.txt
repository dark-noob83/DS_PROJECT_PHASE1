Online the most you can sell an XBOX 360 for is $80.00, most places will only offer you $25-30 the highest I've seen is at digital-liquidations.com otherwise you should try to sell it through craigslist or ebay for a higher payout 250gb machines run about $120.00 nowadays in auctions. Your 4gb xbox wont get you much either. The Kinect may add to it, but together you'r better off asking for 100-150 dollars. The Witcher 2, GoW3, and Halo 4 are really the only games worth more than 10 dollars.
