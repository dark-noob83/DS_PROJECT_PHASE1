Here’s an estimate of what to expect: Carpet pad cost: $0.30 to $0.60 sq/ft. Carpet installation cost: $0.50 sq/ft.

$1.50 per square foot for the tile multiplied by 250 square feet, which equals $375. Add in 10% and the total for flooring materials comes to $412.50. For labor, $3 times 250 square feet equals $750. No need to add 10% here. Add in the removal and haul away for the carpeting and the total labor cost is $900. The total flooring installation price will be the sum of $412.50 for the materials plus $900 for the labor therefore the estimated cost is $1,312.50 (plus applicable taxes).
