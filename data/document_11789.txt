If you're from the regional circuit, you make at least $8000 per fight on your first contract. That number is doubled if you win and you have a chance at a bonus for: fight of the night, submission of the night, and knockout of the night. Most fighters make between 15 and 75 thousand per fight.
The revelation that Georges St-Pierre makes at least $5 million per fight was first reported by Georges himself in an interview from 2011. In the interview, GSP stated: For me, a fight is (worth) $4 to $5 million, and in the city where the UFC holds its events, there are economic benefits of between $15 to $20 million.

Fighters who have between one and five fights in the UFC will make just $2,500 per fight under the tiered system. Fighters with six to 10 UFC bouts will make $5,000; 11 to 15 will get fighters $10,000; 16 to 20 fights earns $15,000; and 21 bouts and up gets a fighter $20,000. Title challengers will make $30,000 and champions will pull in $40,000. The UFC's contract with Reebok is worth $70 million over six years.
$3,000 is usually the minimum that the UFC will pay a fighter and usually 3 or 4 guys will fight on a card for that. Some of these guys fight more than 5 times a year trying to make a name for themselves.
Best Answer: I am assuming you are asking about fighters who fight for the UFC organization. Guys on smaller shows fight often times a couple of hundred dollars with guys in the main event maybe getting a thousand or so. As far as the UFC, athletic commissions force the UFC to release how much each fighter gets paid.
