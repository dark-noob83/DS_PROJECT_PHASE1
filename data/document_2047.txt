The term macromolecule means 'very big' molecule. As you know, a molecule is a substance that is made up of more than one atom. The prefix macro-means 'large', and it is an antonym of the prefix micro-which means 'very small'.
A macromolecule is a very large molecule commonly created by polymerization of smaller subunits (monomers). They are typically composed of thousands or more atoms.
Definition: A macromolecule is a molecule with a very large number of atoms. Macromolecules typically have more than 100 component atoms. Examples: Most polymers are macromolecules and many biochemical molecules are macromolecules.
A macromolecule is a very large molecule made up of smaller units called monomers. The monomers may be the same or slightly different. Macromolecules are formed by dehydration reactions in which water molecules are removed from the formation of bonds.
A macromolecule is a molecule made up of two or more smaller molecules. A very large molecule such as a polymer or protein, consisting of many smaller structural units linked together.
Macromolecule. Definition. noun, plural: macromolecules. A large complex molecule, such as nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, with relatively large molecular weight. Supplement. In biology, a macromolecule is a term used to contrast a micromolecule (which is smaller in size and in molecular weight). Macromolecules are usually used to refer to large biological polymers, such as nucleic acids and proteins, which are made up of small monomers linked together.
