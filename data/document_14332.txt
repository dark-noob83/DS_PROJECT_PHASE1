The water that rushes down into the toilet bowl when you flush forces the water to go down and out the pipes. You can actually simulate a toilet flush by quickly pouring in a large amount of water into the toilet bowl.
Airplane toilets use an active vacuum instead of a passive siphon, and they are therefore called vacuum toilets. When you flush, it opens a valve in the sewer line, and the vacuum in the line sucks the contents out of the bowl and into a tank.
Now, airborne waste control technology could put the Jetsons to shame. Here's what happens when you flush at 35,000 feet up. An airplane's facilities work on a different principle than the conventional siphon toilet found in your home, and for a good reason.
Through the mid-1980s, airplane toilets used Anotec, the blue deodorizing liquid you see in the bottom of Port-a-Johns, to push waste from the bowl into onboard storage tanks. Electric pumps actively drove the process, circulating fresh fluid through with every flush.
Unfortunately, that is not the case. All of the waste gets stored in a tank in the plane, that gets sucked out by a truck when you land. The waste then gets sent to a waste treatment plant. We all can dream though. Fly on little poop, fly on.
He writes and edits for Slate ’s culture blog, Brow Beat. Not intentionally. Airliner toilets use either a “ closed waste system ,” which works much like a common house toilet and flushes the wastewater into an onboard sewage tank, or the more modern “ vacuum waste system ,” which sucks wastewater into the tank.
when you flush the toilet the waste goes through the pipes and to a treatment plant or a treatment pond and decomposes and evaporates   rhys.
