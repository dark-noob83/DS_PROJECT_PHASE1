Best Answer: Starvation mode happens after a long period of time on too little calories.... the metabolism does not slow down in one day or even a week on too little calories.. starvation mode is very exaggerated. The metabolism cannot completely stop either. You gain bulky muscle or just fat since your body didn't use the calories. Eat too little, and your body enters starvation mode since you are at too... show more To get optimum results when working out, you need to balance calorie burn vs calorie intake, otherwise you either gain weight or you burn muscle.
Report Abuse. wow, your a lucky guy, being able to eat that many calories! but your body defiantly won't go into starvation mode if you eating 2400-2500 calories a day, thats MAX for most people (woman at least) but other then that, i'm not too educated in the area of fitness, sorry..

Here is whats going to happen. First, as long as you take in 500 to a thousand calories a day, nothing going to happen. You won't loose a significant amount of muscle mass. Your body will store this energy as fat. Starvation mode occurs if you have no calorie to very little calorie intake intake for a few days. Starvation mode is your bodies last defense to keep you alive Your body will start using the fat first to provide energy because theire is protein in fat. How long does it take for your body to go into starvation mode? I've been sick with a stomach flu and im getting 500 - 1000 calories a day.
Most men have a BMR around 1800+. Those are calories your body burns just staying alive! So if you have a BMR of 1800 and are eating 1500 and burning an additional 1500 through exercise, then you will have an 1800 calorie deficit. That would send your body into starvation mode for sure. Um no. if you want to loose weightyou have to have a calorie defecit. And that is different than starvation mode. If you eat 1500 calories a day then exercise to burn 1600. The larger calorie defecit you have the more you loose. A man is supposed to eat around 2000 calories a day and a woman about 1500
If you don't eat regularly then your body will already be in a state of energy conservation. The more irregluar your eating pattern becomes, the more energy efficient your body will be. The body doesn't go from one state to a 'starvation mode' at a certain point, there are varying levels of 'starvation mode'. It's definately not a good thing to tempt your body into because it can take double the amount of time you're in starvation mode to recover from it. This often results in gaining back everything you lost plus more because your body WILL take from your muscles to feed your brain, since it doesn't run on fat stores.
