The difference between the Kelvin temperature scale and the Celsius temperature scale is that the Kelvin scale uses Celsius as the degree increments. Also, 0 degrees Kelvin is … calibrated to absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius).
Figure 5.25. A Comparison of the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin Temperature Scales. Because the difference between the freezing point of water and the boiling point of water is 100° on both the Celsius and Kelvin scales, the size of a degree Celsius (°C) and a kelvin (K) are precisely the same.
(ice point and steam point). On the celsius scale the difference between the ice point and steam point of water is 100 celsius degrees. The fahrenheit and celsius scale coincide at -40 degrees which means that -40°F and -40°C describe the same (very cold) temperature.
Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, and boils at 100 degrees C, while in Fahrenheit, water freezes at 32 degrees F and boils at 212 degrees F. You see that Celsius has 100 degrees between the freezing and boiling point, whereas Fahrenheit has 180 degrees between these two points.
The Celsius scale equally divides the temperature range between the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water into 100 equal parts. 0 deg Celsius is equal to 273.15 Kelvins and 32 deg Fahrenheit. The boiling point of water is 100 deg Celsius which is also 373.15 Kelvins and 21
In this scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (written “32 °F”), and the boiling point is 212 degrees, placing the boiling and freezing points of water exactly 180 degrees apart. Celsius is, or relates to, the Celsius temperature scale (previously known as the centigrade scale).
Difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The main difference between the scales of temperature lies on the relative values for freezing and boiling points. In Celsius, water boils at 100°C while its freezing point is at 0°C. In Fahrenheit scale, water boils at 212°F while its freezing point is at 32°F.
