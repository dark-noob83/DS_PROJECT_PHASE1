There are two types of sources of energy in the world: renewable energy sources and non-renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources include solar energy, biomass energy, wind energy, tidal energy, hydro energy, and geothermal energy. Non-renewable energy sources include oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy. Renewable energy sources are generated directly from nature, like the sun, rain, wind, tides, and it is possible to generate it over and over whenever it is needed. There are pros and cons to using both renewable energy sources and non-renewable energy sources. First let’s look at renewable energy. The obvious advantages of it is that wind, sun, ocean, and geothermal energy is in abundance and completely free of charge.
A biomass is also considered a renewable resource if used properly. Non-renewable Resources. Non-renewable resources are those natural resources which cannot be renewed once they are completely consumed. The resources which are replenished very slowly are also considered non-renewable resources. Their rate of production is very slow as compared to the rate of their extraction and consumption. Another example of a non-renewable resource is our lifetime. Once used up, any individual cannot get back lost time. Other good examples of non-renewable resources are; nuclear fuels, minerals, and shale.
Renewable energy is energy obtained from sources that can be renewed. Wind, sunshine and water power are the most common. Non-Renewable energy is energy obtained from sources … that cannot be renewed. Examples of these are fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Renewable and nonrenewable is different because renewable can used over and over again (water bottle). Nonrenewable is something that cannot be reused again (waste). Renewable resources are resources we can replenish like wind and sunshine. Nonrenewable resources are the resource we can not replenish like oil and coal.
Non-renewable energy is energy from a source which only has a limited supply. Example fossil fuels. A: The main difference between renewable and non-renewable energy is that renewable energy doesn't run out. Solar power energy is an example of a renewable energy resource. Non-renewable energy will eventually run out. Learn more about solar renewable energy at the link below. There is no difference. Renewable energy is also called green and clean because it emits no carbon dioxide. Non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels can only be used o … nce and release carbon when they are burnt. The answer above is partly correct.

Great examples of infinite, renewable resources are: wind, sunlight, tides, biomass, etc. Some of the renewable resources are supposed to have continuous supplies, such as wind energy and solar energy, while some others take a greater time in their renewal like wood, oxygen, etc. Their rate of production is very slow as compared to the rate of their extraction and consumption. Another example of a non-renewable resource is our lifetime. Once used up, any individual cannot get back lost time. Other good examples of non-renewable resources are; nuclear fuels, minerals, and shale.
The best examples of non-renewable resources are fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gases. Fossil fuels are produced by the decay of animal and plant matter. Their rate of production is very slow as compared to the rate of their extraction and consumption. Another example of a non-renewable resource is our lifetime. Once used up, any individual cannot get back lost time. Other good examples of non-renewable resources are; nuclear fuels, minerals, and shale. Water is a controversial resource which can be categorized as both a renewable and non-renewable resource
Best Answer: Differences:The difference between renewable and nonrenewable energy is that nonrenewable energy can be used up. Non-renewable sources are not environmental friendly and can have serious affect on our health. They are called non-renewable because they cannot be re-generated within a short span of time. Non-renewable sources exist in the form of fossil fuels, natural gas, oil and coal.
Renewable energy sources are ones which don't run out-which can be renew ed. We can keep using them and using them, and we'll never run out. Examples of renewable sources include wind, water power (hydroelectric), and solar power (light from the sun). Non-renewable energy sources are ones which do run out. As we use them to generate energy, they get used up, and can't be used a second time. Essentially, the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy is that renewable energy can be used over and over again. Whereas, non-renewable energy is energy that cannot be used again once it is used.
The difference between a renewable and a inexhaustible resource is that a renewable resource can be used or recreated again but inexhaustible resources can not be recreated be … cause they are always available for everyone to use. Remember that it must also be resource. Renewable and nonrenewable is different because renewable can used over and over again (water bottle). Nonrenewable is something that cannot be reused again (waste). Renewable resources are resources we can replenish like wind and sunshine. Nonrenewable resources are the resource we can not replenish like oil and coal.
