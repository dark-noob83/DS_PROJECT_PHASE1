School-aged children need between 10 and 11 hours of sleep per night. Not getting enough sleep is common in this age group, given increasing school obligations (e.g. homework), evening activities, and later bedtimes.
Age Hours Of Sleep 0 - 2 months 10.5 - 18 2 - 12 months 14 - 15 1 - 3 years 12 - 14 3 - 5 years 11 - 13 5 - 12 years 10 - 11. The #1 tip for good sleeping habits in children is to follow a nightly routine.
1-3 Years Old: 12 - 14 hours per day. As your child moves past the first year toward 18-21 months of age he will likely lose his morning and early evening nap and nap only once a day. While toddlers need up to 14 hours a day of sleep, they typically get only about 10.
Children who nap well are usually less cranky and sleep better at night. Although children differ, after six months of age, naps of 1/2 to two hours duration are expected and are generally discontinued between ages 2-5 years.
Most children from about 21 to 36 months of age still need one nap a day, which may range from one to three and a half hours long. They typically go to bed between 7 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 6 and 8 a.m. 3-6 Years Old: 10 - 12 hours per day.
The amount of sleep a child needs varies depending on the individual and certain factors, including the age of the child. Following are some general guidelines: 1-4 Weeks Old: 15 - 16 hours per day.
Sleep and Toddlers (1-2 years). Toddlers need about 11-14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period. When they reach about 18 months of age their naptimes will decrease to once a day lasting about one to three hours. Naps should not occur too close to bedtime as they may delay sleep at night.
4-12 Months Old: 14 - 15 hours per day. While up to 15 hours is ideal, most infants up to 11 months old get only about 12 hours of sleep. Establishing healthy sleep habits is a primary goal during this period, as your baby is now much more social, and his sleep patterns are more adult-like.
