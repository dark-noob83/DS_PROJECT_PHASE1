No--it's not safe to use anything that's foreign/not eye-safe so close to your eyes. Try making a trip to the nearest drugstore, they're sure to have it! I use Lash Grip adhesive, it comes in a small white tube (about $3).

Answers. Best Answer: You shouldn't chance using anything other than the eyelash glue. I read several things on the net ~ one girl tried something with toothpaste, and made her eyes burn like the devil.
I do not want to use store bought eye lash glue due to the chemical it contains, and how it can damage your eyelashes. I want to get rid of as much chemicals as possible out of my life, and live a natural lifestyle.
If you've still got the receipt from buying those lashes, return them so you can get one with glue that's not dried out. If you don't have the receipt, you can still try to return them; lots of places will stand behind the products they sell. Check the glue after you've bought the next ones and before you leave the store. take care.
