Fungi and animals digest other organisms to obtain energy and other nutrients. Animals typically eat' food and digest it internally. Fungi have external digestion! They literally grow through their food secreting enzymes outside of their cells and absorbing the breakdown products.
Fungi are heterotrophs and, like animals, obtain their carbon and energy from other organisms. Some fungi obtain their nutrients from a living host (plant or animal) and are called biotrophs; others obtain their nutrients from dead plants or animals and are called saprotrophs (saprophytes, saprobes).
In this symbiotic and intimate relationship the hyphae of the fungus greatly increases the surface area that is open to nutrient and water absorption, maximizing the plants access to these essential compounds and elements. In return, the plant supplies the fungus with carbohydrates for use as energy.
Lesson Plans. Symbiotic Fungi--------Saprotrophic Fungi-------Carnivorous Fungi Introduction to fungal ecological strategies All fungi are heterotrophic, which means that they get the energy they need to live from other organisms. Like animals, fungi extract the energy stored in the bonds of organic compounds such as sugar and protein from living or dead organisms. Many of these compounds can also be recycled for further use.

Lichens are Fungi! The plant-like appearance of lichens hides their true identity. A lichen is not a single organism, but the result of a partnership (mutualistic symbiosis) between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacteria. Some lichens are formed of three or more partners.
