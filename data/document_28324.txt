Salerno [saˈlɛrno] listen (help·info) is a city and comune in Campania (south-western Italy) and is the capital of the province of the same name. It is located on the Gulf of Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Salerno was an indendent Lombard principality in the early Middle Ages. Salerno was an active center of Carbonari activities supporting the unification of Italy in the 19th century. The majority of the population of Salerno supported ideas of the Risorgimento, and in 1861 many of them joined Garibaldi in his struggle for unification.
History [edit]. The area was given its modern name in 1080, when Robert Guiscard confirmed the possession of lands between the Sele river and Tusciano river to the Church of Salerno. During the second world war, markedly in 1943, the town was bombed several times by American aviators. In 1953 the town was involved in a disappearance which is still shrouded in mystery, involving its socialist mayor Lorenzo Rago.
