1 A PE occurs when a piece or all of a deep vein clot breaks off and is carried by the blood stream to the lung, where it blocks the blood vessel. 2  The size of the clot and the location of the blocked blood flow in the vessel determine the extent and severity of the PE.
1 In a leg or arm, a blood clot in a vein (deep venous thrombosis) can act as a dam and block blood from returning to the heart. 2  This may cause inflammation of the vein, or thrombophlebitis. 3  Common symptoms include swelling, redness or discoloration, warmth, and pain.
Blood clots typically form deep within the veins of the legs—deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the scary part is that most times blood clots can go undetected, resulting in pulmonary embolism and death when leg clots break free and lodge in the lungs. Here are the ten common signs that you may have a blood clot….
When a blood clot occurs in the leg, one of the recognizable signs is swelling. You will notice that one leg is bigger than the other leg as a result of water retention. Even though swelling of the leg may be caused by other issues, this is the most obvious signs of this condition.
Symptoms of a blood clot depend on the location of the clot. Symptoms of a blood clot in the venous system can include swelling of the affected area, warmth, redness, and pain. Venous blood clots occur most commonly in the arms and legs. Symptoms of an arterial blood clot result from a lack of or decrease in oxygen delivery to the tissues supplied by the involved artery. Pain in the involved area is often the first symptom. Other symptoms can occur when arterial clots form in a particular area.
Signs and Symptoms of Blood Clots. The signs and symptoms of blood clots range from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to pulmonary embolism (PE). The symptoms of clotting depend on the location of the affected blood vessel and whether the vessel is totally or partially blocked by the clot.
