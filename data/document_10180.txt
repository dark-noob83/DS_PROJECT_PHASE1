On the diesel Passat, the TDI badge stands for Turbocharged Direct Injection, which isn't really all that helpful as the gasoline-powered Passat is also turbocharged and also uses direct injection. Volkswagen attempts to clear this up by calling this Passat the Passat TDI Clean Diesel. If it helps, though, just pretend like the D stands for diesel and you'll be fine. With the gasoline-powered Passat, the TSI badge stands for Turbocharged Stratified Injection.. It means that the 1.8-liter four-cylinder combines turbocharging and direct injection, but it also is used to indicate that this new engine uses Volkswagen's latest and greatest technology.
All, A bit confusing (maybe just me). Does TDI stand for Turbo Direct Injection? and GTI Grand Touring Injection? Just wanted to confirm as some people say TDI is Turbo Diesel Injection! I have a Diesel 150BHP Golf but is badged GTI (I understand this is correct), but can present some confusion as to what GTI and TDI really are?
TDI = Turbo Diesel Injection or is the I stand for intercooled. The reason i ask is because i came across this site http://www.vwpartscentral.com/vwparts/jsp/index.jsp and when you choose 1997 ... they list a Jetta III TDI Diesel 96-99 and a Jetta TD (Canada) 93-99.

The Audi TT… what a car! You take the technology of its bigger sibling, the R8, and you put it all into a smaller package and you can have just as much fun with better fuel economy.
