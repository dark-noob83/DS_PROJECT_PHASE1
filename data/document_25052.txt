A normal fasting blood glucose target range for an individual without diabetes is 70-100 mg/dL (3.9-5.6 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70–130 mg/dL (3.9-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 90-130 mg/dL (5.0-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). If your doctor feels that you are pre-diabetic it would be okay to check a fasting blood sugar at home once a week or so.
If your blood glucose levels are in normal range, testing should be done about every three years. If you have prediabetes, you should be checked for diabetes every one to two years after diagnosis. Tests for Diagnosing Prediabetes and Diabetes. 
A. At present, the diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes is based in an arbitrary cut-off point for a normal blood sugar level. A normal sugar level is currently considered to be less than 100 mg/dL when fasting and less than 140 mg/dL two hours after eating. But in most healthy people, sugar levels are even lower. During the day, blood glucose levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL. In some, 60 is normal; in others, 90.
Levels may fluctuate after fasting for long periods of time or an hour or two after consumption of food. Despite this, the fluctuations are minor. Normal human blood glucose levels remains within a remarkably narrow range. In most humans this varies from about 82 mg/dl to 110 mg/dl (4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l). The blood sugar levels rises to nearly 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) or a bit more in normal humans after a full meal. In humans normal blood glucose levels are around 90 mg/dl, equivalent to 5mM (mmol/l). 
Thanks for using the forum. You will notice your blood sugar fluctuates during the day. It will go up after eating (especially if you eat a meal high in carbohydrates), it will go down after physical activity or exercise. The goal is to keep the fluctuation within the normal blood glucose parameters (65-120). I had my blood tests four days ago, and all levels are withing the normal parameters, except the Creatinine Levels which is 1.58. The BUN level is 25.11. I have normal LIPID PROFILE, normal URINE ANALYSIS, normal HEMATOLOGY, and a PSA of 1.250.
Answer: Now, in a normal individual we measure blood sugar under different circumstances. What we call fasting blood sugar or blood glucose levels is usually done six to eight hours after the last meal. So it's most commonly done before breakfast in the morning; and the normal range there is 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. Now when you eat a meal, blood sugar generally rises and in a normal individual it usually does not get above a 135 to 140 milligrams per deciliter.
Blood Sugar Range: Level of Blood sugar on waking up with an empty stomach should be normally between 80 to 120 mg/dl. Thereafter normal blood sugar should be between 120 to 160 mg/dl two hours after having food and during bedtime the blood sugar values should be between 100 to 140 mg/dl. 
A person with prediabetes has a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl. If the blood glucose level rises to 126 mg/dl or above, a person has diabetes.&quot; and &quot;•An A1C 5.6% or below is normal. In prediabetes, A1C levels range between 5.7%-6.4%. The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 90-130 mg/dL (5.0-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). If your doctor feels that you are pre-diabetic it would be okay to check a fasting blood sugar at home once a week or so.
The target blood glucose levels vary a little bit depending on your type of diabetes and between adults and children. Where possible, try to achieve levels of between 4 and 7 mmol/L before meals and under 8.5 mmol/L after meals. The target level for HbA1c is under 48 mmol/mol (or 6.5% in the old units). Normal and diabetic blood sugar ranges. For the majority of healthy individuals, normal blood sugar levels are as follows: 1  Between 4.0 to 6.0 mmol/L (72 to 108 mg/dL) when fasting.
The paramedics got his blood sugar up to a normal range but within 20 minutes it was under 20 again. Upon checking his pump, it appears he received about 163 units of insulin in a 24 hour period (25 units is normal for him). No one can explain what happened. This resulted with a week in the hospital. I had my blood tests four days ago, and all levels are withing the normal parameters, except the Creatinine Levels which is 1.58. The BUN level is 25.11. I have normal LIPID PROFILE, normal URINE ANALYSIS, normal HEMATOLOGY, and a PSA of 1.250.
