The silicon melt temperature was measured for 30 min. The temperature variations at the melt surfaces and bottom with the temperature of crucible top and bottom being 1450°C and 1430°C are shown in Fig. 4. The concentrations of boron added are non-doping, 1×10 18 and 1×10 20 atoms/cm 3, respectively.
Gold boils at 2807.0°C or 5084.6 F °and its melting point 1064.43 C° or 1947.9741 F°.  For gold to evaporat … e, it would take EXTREME HEAT TO DO THAT, and to my  knowledge, it would be impossible to do that with out a heat source of great  magnitude........
(I know that the melting point of silicon is 1414 Celsius.) – wizlog Dec 13 '11 at 22:05. well, for one thing, leakage current goes up exponentially with temperature, and at some point any transistor is going to be either strongly on or weakly on.
1948 degrees 1948 degrees F is equal to 1064.44 degrees C     Gold melts at the temperature of i060 degrees C 1064.18 °C OR 1947.52 °F when it is heated to high temperatures. Gold melts at 1 948.316 degrees Fahrenheit. + 22 others found this useful.
The melting point of the element, silicon, is about:  Melting Point: 1687 K (1414°C or 2577°F)  Boiling Point: 3538 K (3265°C or 5909°F)  Resource: http://education.jla … b.org/itselemental/ele014.html  You can find the freezing point of the element there as well.

Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Silicon melts at 1,414 degrees Celsius (2,577.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Silicon boils at 2,900 degrees Celsius (5,25
The material, a compound of silicon, copper, nickel and iron, “melts” (actually turning from a solid to a slush-like mix of solid and liquid material) as it cools below 900 degrees Celsius, whereas silicon ordinarily melts at 1414 degrees C.
