The cubic meter is the unit of volume in the International System of Units. The symbol for cubic meters is m 3. Less formally, cubic meter is sometimes abbreviated cu m. When calculating volume, it is important to realize that volume is proportional to the cube of the linear dimension.
To convert a cubic meter to a meter, you just take the cubic root of the cubic meter: Cubic Root(m^3) = m Which is the same as: (m^3)^1/3 = m^(3*(1/3)) = m^1 = m. That i … s not quite right. It only applies to the linear dimension of a cube. In general, a cubic metre is a measure of volume, with dimensions [L3].
Answer   A cubic meters means one meter to the power of three. It is a measuring unit for volume and is equal to 1000 liters. When you have a cube with the side of one me … ter you have a cubic meter volume.
In the opposite sense, 1 m 3 is equal to 0.000000001 kilometer cubed (10 -9 km 3). When converting between cubic meters and non-SI units of volume such as cubic inches (cu in) or cubic miles (cu mi), the linear-unit conversion factor must be cubed. For example, one meter is approximately 39.37 inches (39.37 in); therefore 1 m 3 = 39.37 3 = 6.102 x 10 4 cu in (approximately).
