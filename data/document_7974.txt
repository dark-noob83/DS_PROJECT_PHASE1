The mean is the average you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The median is the middle value in the list of numbers. To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order, so you may have to rewrite your list first. The mode is the value that occurs most often. If no number is repeated, then there is no mode for the list. The range is just the difference between the largest and smallest values. Just remember the following: mean: regular meaning of average median: middle value mode: most often. (In the above, I've used the term average rather casually. The technical definition of average is the arithmetic mean: adding up the values and then dividing by the number of values.
I think that you have meant Mean, and not Meen. A mean is the average of numbers. For example if you have 2, 3, and 4 The mean of these numbers would be 3. In Algebra, a score is a collection of 20 items, i. e., a score =  20. 2 people found this useful. Edit.

The actual arithmetical step. E.G: 2 + 2 = 4: The adding is the operation and the + sign is the operator. x(x + 3) = (x-squared + 3x) The multiplication through is the oper … ation, with the times sign implied rather than written, for clarity. Since we don't have a value for x here we can't perform the + operation. 
The mean is the usual average: (1 + 2 + 4 + 7) ÷ 4 = 14 ÷ 4 = 3.5. The median is the middle number. In this example, the numbers are already listed in numerical order, so I don't have to rewrite the list. But there is no middle number, because there are an even number of numbers. In this case, the median is the mean (the usual average) of the middle two values: (2 + 4) ÷ 2 = 6 ÷ 2 = 3. The mode is the number that is repeated most often, but all the numbers in this list appear only once, so there is no mode. Just remember the following: mean: regular meaning of average median: middle value mode: most often. (In the above, I've used the term average rather casually. The technical definition of average is the arithmetic mean: adding up the values and then dividing by the number of values.
Mode = value with the highest occuring frequency E. g.: If you have 9 numbers: 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 8, your mode is 2 because the number 2 occurs 4 times compared to other numbers. Median = middle value E. g.: If you have 5 numbers (an odd number of values): 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5, your mode is 3. Mean= The average value of a set of numbers. To work out the mean/average, you need to: 1. Add all the numbers together 2. Divide the total by the amount of numbers there are. e.g. The scores for a test are 10, 8, 5, 7, 3 and 4. Step 1: 10 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 3= 36 Step 2: 36/6= 6 The mean is 6.
The mean test score is 85. Definition: The arithmetic mean of a set of data is found by taking the sum of the data, and then dividing the sum by the total number of values in the set. A mean is commonly referred to as an average. In the problem above, the mean was a whole number. 
The mean, mode and median are ALL averages, therefore the average is not just the mean Mean-sum of numbers divided by the number of numbers Mode-the most frequently occurring number in a set of numbers. A group of numbers can be said to have two modes (bimodal), one mode or no modes. Median-the middle number. Mean= The average value of a set of numbers. To work out the mean/average, you need to: 1. Add all the numbers together 2. Divide the total by the amount of numbers there are. e.g. The scores for a test are 10, 8, 5, 7, 3 and 4. Step 1: 10 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 3= 36 Step 2: 36/6= 6 The mean is 6.
