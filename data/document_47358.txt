If the wireless connection on your Dell Vostro is disabled, you can re-enable the connection by switching on the wireless adapter. If you're using a Dell Vostro desktop computer and there's no wireless switch available on the computer, you can re-enable the wireless adapter from within Windows. Flip the wireless switch located at the front of the Dell Vostro, to the left of the speakers and headphone connections, to turn on all wireless connections. If you cannot find a wireless switch, hold down Fn and 2 to turn on wireless. Click Start.. Right-click Network.

Dell Vostro 1500 has a button on the left side at the rear that is called a 'hardware switch'. Image: If this is turned off wifi does not work. If this is active and it still does not work check your BIOS since you might be able to turn it off there too. Oh and there is no FN combo to activate wifi on a Vostro.

Hi Sharad_vaddoriya, Welcome to the Community. I would like to inform you can turn on the wireless radio on your Vostro 1014 by pressing the Fn and F2 keys together. This is common for any dell laptop. If you are still having issues with the wireless, check in the device manager for any bangs on the wireless driver.
