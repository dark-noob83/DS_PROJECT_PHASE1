Einsteinâ€™s Contribution to Mathematics. While Einstein was remembered for his contributions to physics, he also made contributions in mathematics. He contributed several equations to calculus and geometry, ten of which are called the Einstein Field Equations. He first published these equations in 1915.
Einstein's contributions to math and science are immense, physics in particular. Arguably, his best known achievement is his theory of relativity, and the famous equation E = mc 2.
What Albert Enstien contributed to Mathematics. Albert Einstein's contribution to mathematics is his famous E=mc2. This is one of his most well-known accomplishments. One of Einstein's great insights was to realize that matter and energy are really different forms of the same thing. Matter can be turned into energy, and energy into matter.
Albert Einstein was a genius theoretical physicist. He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence, theory of relativity, Brownian motion and photoelectric effect. He was honored with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Here are some interesting facts about Albert Einstein.
In addition to the theory of relativity, Einstein is also known for his contributions to the development of the quantum theory. He postulated (1905) light quanta (photons), upon which he based his explanation of the photoelectric effect, and he developed the quantum theory of specific heat.
