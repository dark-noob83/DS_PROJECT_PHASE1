Esophagus. The esophagus is a small hose-like tube, which connects the mouth to the stomach. As it leaves the mouth, the esophagus follows a straight path through the neck and chest, passing near the heart through the diaphragm muscle and finally entering the stomach. The walls of the esophagus are composed of muscles, which move in wave-like contractions to push food into the stomach.
Confidence votes 5.0K. It is a long tubing which allows food to be tranferred to the small intestine through peristalsis. No digestion occurs in the esophagus. +++ The first sentence is incorrect. It is the tube from mouth to stomach, not to the intestine, but it is right that digestion does not occur within it. This is a form of physical digestion. Peristalsis is the contracting and relaxing of muscles, and in the case of the oesophagus this muscle movement pushes the food down to your stomach, where the digestion process will continue.
Esophagus (or oesophagus or gullet) is a muscular tube connecting the throat (pharynx) with the stomach. During swallowing food travels from the mouth through the pharynx into the esophagus and to the stomach by peristaltic contraction of the esophagus. What is Esophagus? A magic tube connecting the mouth to stomach, its help moves the food from the mouth to stomach and stops reverse motion from

The esophagus is about 8 inches long, and is lined by moist pink tissue called mucosa. The esophagus runs behind the windpipe (trachea) and heart, and in front of the spine. Just before entering the stomach, the esophagus passes through the diaphragm. 1 Esophageal ulcer: An erosion in an area of the lining of the esophagus. 2  This is often caused by chronic reflux. 3  Esophageal stricture: A narrowing of the esophagus. 4  Chronic irritation from reflux is the usual cause of esophageal strictures.
Esophagus – Digestive System. Upper esophageal sphincter is a muscle bundle at the beginning of the esophagus. This muscle is in use when breathing, eating, belching, and vomiting. Immediately, when swallowing the upper esophageal sphincter opens to allow the bolus (masticated food) to pass into the esophagus. What is Esophagus? A magic tube connecting the mouth to stomach, its help moves the food from the mouth to stomach and stops reverse motion from the stomach.
Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood.
The epiglottis is a flexible flap at the superior end of the larynx in the throat. It acts as a switch between the larynx and the esophagus to permit air to enter the airway to the lungs and food to pass into the gastrointestinal tract. The epiglottis is a thin, leaf-shaped structure at the superior border of the larynx, or voice box. In its relaxed position, the epiglottis projects into the pharynx, or throat, and rests just posterior to the tongue.
Esophagus is a tube of about 25 to 30 cm long connecting the mouth to the stomach; food takes only 7 to 10 seconds to travel through the esophagus. When the body is in the upright position, even then, liquids can travel through esophagus and reaches the stomach due to this peristaltic contraction. What is Esophagus? A magic tube connecting the mouth to stomach, its help moves the food from the mouth to stomach and stops reverse motion from the stomach.
The mouth is the beginning of the digestive tract. In fact, digestion starts here as soon as you take the first bite of a meal. Chewing breaks the food into pieces that are more easily digested, while saliva mixes with food to begin the process of breaking it down into a form your body can absorb and use.
