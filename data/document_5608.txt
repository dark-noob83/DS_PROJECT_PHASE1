Smell depends on sensory receptors that respond to airborne chemicals. In humans, these chemoreceptors are located in the olfactory epithelium â€” a patch of tissue about the size of a postage stamp located high in the nasal cavity. The olfactory epithelium is made up of three kinds of cells:
1 The cilia of the sensory neurons are immersed in a layer of mucus. 2  Odorant molecules (molecules that we can smell) dissolve in the mucus and. 3  bind to receptors on the cilia. 4  These are 7-pass transmembrane proteins. 5  Binding of the odorant activates a G protein coupled to the receptor on its cytoplasmic side.
The sense of smell, just like the sense of taste, is a chemical sense. They are called chemical senses because they detect chemicals in the environment, with the difference being that smell works at dramatically larger distances than that of taste.
The olfactory nerve is the cranial nerve located closest to the front of the brain, and is therefore called cranial nerve I.. This nerve is responsible for the sense of smell, which is particularly important in other animals but somewhat less so in humans. One byproduct of the sense of smell,...

Senses of Taste and Smell. Taste buds and olfactory cells (smell receptors) detect chemicals, thus they are chemoreceptors. 1  Sense of Taste. 2  Taste Buds located in papillae on the tongue, hard palate, pharynx, and epiglottis. 3  Five types of tastes (Really there are at least six the sixth is water.
Olfaction or the sense of smell involves chemicals. The receptors for smell are the olfactory hair cells located on the roof of each nasal cavity in a path of cells called the olfactory epithelium or membrane. Odors or scents chemical vapors. Chemoreceptor cells (neurons) perceive the chemicals as they vaporize.
