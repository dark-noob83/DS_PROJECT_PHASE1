Atenolol and Weight Gain: An Overview. There are a number of possible side effects with atenolol (Tenormin Â®). Gradual weight gain, however, does not appear to be one of them. This data comes from clinical trials that extensively studied atenolol and documented its side effects. However, gradual weight gain has been reported rarely with other beta blockers.
Side effects are then usually separated into those that occur in more than 1 percent of people (common side effects) and those that occur in less than 1 percent of people (rare side effects). For people taking atenolol, gradual weight gain was not reported as either a common or rare side effect. Gradual weight gain, however, does not appear to be one of them. This data comes from clinical trials that extensively studied atenolol and documented its side effects. However, gradual weight gain has been reported rarely with other beta blockers.

Tenormin is available in 25, 50 and 100 mg strength tablets; it is also available vials of 5 mg atenolol in ten ml of citrate-buffered solution for intravenous injection. The IV preparation should only be administered by trained personnel.
Yes. Weight gain can occur as a side effect of some beta blockers, especially the older ones, such as atenolol (Tenormin) and metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL). The average weight gain is no more than 4 pounds (about 2 kilograms). Newer beta blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg), don't usually cause weight gain as a side effect. Weight may rise in the first weeks of taking the beta blocker and then generally stabilizes.
Uncommon, but serious side effects from atenolol include shortness of breath; swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; unusual weight gain; fainting. If these side effects are experienced, patients should contact their physician or health care provider right away. This information is solely educational.
