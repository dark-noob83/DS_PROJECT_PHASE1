Sakurajima. Sakurajima is an active volcano and a former island (now connected to the mainland) of the same name in Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan. The north peak (its highest peak) rises 1,117 m above sea level.
Sakurajima volcano is a geologically young stratovolcano consisting of two N-S aligned and adjoining edifaces, Kita-dake (1117 m) and Minami-dake (1040 m).
Tectonic Setting. A volcano is just a vent for magma and gases to escape through. Sakurajima rests on the southern island of Japan, known as Kyushu. Japan rests along the Eurasian Plate, a continental plate, coming in contact with the Philippine plate, an oceanic plate.
Plate Boundaries: The SakuraJima Volcano rests on the southern island of Japan, known as Kyushu. Japan rests along the Eurasian Plate, coming in contact with the Filipino plate. These plates rest in a subduction zone, meaning it's a convergent boundary. These two plates are pushing towards each other.
The Volcano. Sakurajima is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and can erupt more than a thousand times a year, spewing ash kilometers above the volcano. Sakurajima is a stratovolcano, one of the 16 Decade Volcanoes, and a former island in Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan. In 1914 an eruption caused the island to be connected with the Osumi Peninsula. It's summit is split into three peaks, Kita-dake, Naka-dake, and Minami-dake.
