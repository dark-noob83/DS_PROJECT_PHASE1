Any way to downgrade to a No Annual Fee Delta card? I signed up for the Delta Platinum card when it was $150, the Gold was $100, and the Sky Miles one had no annual fee. When I signed up for the Platinum, I always thought that I can downgrade to the no annual fee card if necessary without hurting my credit. 
The annual fee on the middle level Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express is quietly going up to $195 from $150 prior starting May 1st. If you apply before May 1st your first year fee will be $150, then go up to $195 the following year. The base Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card’s annual fee remains at $95 and also gets the improvement of no foreign transaction fees so there is some genuine enhancement there.
Until September 8, 2014, American Express has increased the sign-up bonus to 50,000 miles on the Platinum Delta Skymiles card after you spend $1,000 in purchases with your new card in the 1st 3 months. Normally, the sign-up bonus on this card is 30,000 miles. But the annual fee of $195 is NOT waived for the 1st year. 
Just note, Amex has confirmed that the Delta Platinum cards will raise their annual fee from $150 to $195, a 30% increase, so some of you might think about switching to the Gold version with a $95 annual fee instead. 
3. Higher Annual Fee. The annual fee on the Delta Platinum card increases from $150 to $195. The Delta Reserve annual fee stays the same at $450 and the annual fee of $95 stays the same on the Delta Gold card. The annual fee will increase for new and current Delta Platinum card holders.
