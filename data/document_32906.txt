Cells that are growing and dividing go through a repeating series of events called the cell division cycle (or cell cycle). During the first phase (G1), the cell grows and prepares for DNA replication, which occurs in the subsequent S phase.
At mid-interphase. The DNA replicates during the S phase of interphase, after G1 and before G2, the two growth phases.
Introduction. Chromosomal DNA replication occurs during a phase of the cell cycle known as the S phase. Although the length of the S phase can vary significantly between different cell types, several absolute controls exist that dictate when and how many times in a cell cycle DNA replication can occur.

At mid-interphase. The DNA replicates during the S phase of interphase, after G1 and before G2, the two growth phases. Throughout interphase, the DNA is extended, and free nucleotides have access to the strands.
