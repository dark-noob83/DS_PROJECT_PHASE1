1 A single IVIG infusion costs approximately $3,000 for a child and 10,000 for an adult. 2  The cost of IVIG is low for children because only a few grams are used. 3  A BioRx.net brochure states that the cost of IVIG is generally estimated to be about $100 per gram to administer. 1 The cost IVIG, according to CIDPUSA Foundation, a foundation dedicated to autoimmune and neuromuscular diseases, is $48 to $68 a gram. 2  A single IVIG infusion costs approximately $3,000 for a child and 10,000 for an adult. 3  The cost of IVIG is low for children because only a few grams are used
Figure 2. Average itemized cost of treating a myasthenia gravis crisis patient with IVIG ($78,814 per patient) vs. Plasma Exchange ($101,140 per patient). For IVIG, the two greatest costs are the fees associated with patient time spent in an intensive care unit ... Using the above data, the average short term cost for utilizing plasma exchange for MGC was $101,140 per patient compared to IVIG which accrued an average cost per patient of $78,814. The TreeAge 4.0 cost analysis tree for these calculations is demonstrated in Figure 1.
The difference in total cost favored IVIG over PLEX with an average savings of $22,326 per patient. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that overall costs are highly dependent on IVIG dosing, hospital lengths of stay, and the number of plasma exchange days required. Using the above data, the average short term cost for utilizing plasma exchange for MGC was $101,140 per patient compared to IVIG which accrued an average cost per patient of $78,814. The TreeAge 4.0 cost analysis tree for these calculations is demonstrated in Figure 1.
IVIG is an expensive therapy and ultimately, insurers and hospitals question the use of this drug for desensitization. Is it cost-effective? Data do exist in this regard Currently, a four dose course of IVIG for a 70 kg person at 2 g/kg would cost $25 000-$26 000. However, one must compare this to the cost of maintaining patients on dialysis, which is the only other option. In the IGO2 study, the calculated cost savings was ~$300 000/patient transplanted versus those who remained on dialysis for the 5 years of the study.
1 A BioRx.net brochure states that the cost of IVIG is generally estimated to be about $100 per gram to administer. 2  Depending on the dose, a course of IVIG therapy can cost between $1,500 and $15,000 per month. 1 The cost IVIG, according to CIDPUSA Foundation, a foundation dedicated to autoimmune and neuromuscular diseases, is $48 to $68 a gram. 2  A single IVIG infusion costs approximately $3,000 for a child and 10,000 for an adult. 3  The cost of IVIG is low for children because only a few grams are used
Cost decision tree of IVIG vs. plasma exchange. Estimated total costs are provided for possible outcomes associated with each treatment arm. The average estimated cost for using each therapy ($101,140 for plasma exchange and $78,814 for IVIG) takes into ... Using the above data, the average short term cost for utilizing plasma exchange for MGC was $101,140 per patient compared to IVIG which accrued an average cost per patient of $78,814. The TreeAge 4.0 cost analysis tree for these calculations is demonstrated in Figure 1.
This is followed by the products to be freeze dried. All this ends up for IVIG to be priced at $ 48 to $ 68 a gram. A single IVIg infusion costs about $3000 for a child and 10,000 for an adult. For a child the cost of IVIg is low because only a few grams are used. The price of IVIg in India is $25 a gram. In Pakistan IVIg costs 20 a gram. IVIg can be bought from China at 45-10 A Gram. In USA a sucrose IVIg can be bought for $60 and non Sucrose IVIG for $70 with all supplies and nurse. 
No significant differences in cost between SCIG and IVIG products exist either for the patient or insurer. However, there are different cost considerations related to the site of care, including nursing and supplies. The primary cost difference between the two types of treatment centers on supervision. During IVIG infusions, medical supervision is required, whereas it is not for SCIG patients who self-infuse and incur no infusion nursing costs. Even for IVIG patients, the cost to infuse at home is less than at a healthcare site. As a result, some insurance companies are encouraging both IVIG and SCIG patients to infuse at home rather than in a clinical setting. The exception to this is HMOs.
