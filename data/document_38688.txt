Yes, however there are risks involved. First of all, most males with Down's Syndrome tend to be infertile, or have a sperm-count so low they cannot effectively reproduce. If they do manage to reproduce, there are many issues that can arise due to the production of gametes (sex cells) during meiosis.
Today, there approximately 400,000 people with Down syndrome living in the United States. MYTH: Down syndrome is hereditary and runs in families. TRUTH: Translocation, a type of Down syndrome that accounts for 3 to 4% of all cases, is the only type of Down syndrome known to have a hereditary component.
Down syndrome is caused by a problem with a baby's chromosomes. Normally, a person has 46 chromosomes. But most people with Down syndrome have 47 chromosomes. In rare cases, other chromosome problems cause Down syndrome. Having extra or abnormal chromosomes changes the way the brain and body develop.
Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome. Chromosomes are small “packages” of genes in the body. They determine how a baby’s body forms during pregnancy and how the baby’s body functions as it grows in the womb and after birth. Typically, a baby is born with 46 chromosomes.
As you can see, for 2 people with Down syndrome having babies, the chances are as follows: -25% chance their child will be typical (no Down syndrome). -50% chance their baby will have Down syndrome. -25% chance there will be no viable pregnancy.
People with Down syndrome have 47 chromosomes (an extra 21st). Now picture the 47 chromosomes reduced, or divided in half. You get one half with 23 chromosomes (or a typical cell) and one with 24 (with the extra 21st chromosome).
MYTH: All people with Down syndrome have a severe cognitive disability. TRUTH: Most people with Down syndrome have a mild to moderate cognitive disability, or intellectual disability. This is not indicative of the many strengths and talents that each individual possesses.
