The loss of those neurons leads to involuntary shaking, slowed movements, muscle stiffness and other symptoms. Medications can help control these symptoms, but there is currently no treatment to slow the disease course. In most cases, Parkinson’s disease is sporadic, meaning its cause is unknown. However, research has hinted that the disease involves a failure of mitochondria. Some pesticides have toxic effects on mitochondria, and can induce symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in animals.
Diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated include: 1  Alzheimer’s Dementia, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), mental retardation, deafness and blindness, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and stroke.
A flurry of emergent research has linked mitochondrial dysfunction to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in impaired ATP generation, loss of cellular repair mechanisms, and cellular inefficiency.
Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system resulting from depletion of dopamine-producing cells in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra. A variety of genetic and environmental factors underlie this loss of brain cells.
FMM recognizes the importance of continued Parkinson’s disease research, education, programs and support groups, as this month marks the fifth year both houses of Congress have officially declared April Parkinson’s Awareness Month. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative movement disorder.
Mitochondrial Parkinson's disease: A form of Parkinson's disease that seems to be linked to mitochondrial defects-mitochondria are the energy-producing components of body cells. Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, degenerative brain disorder characterized by tremors, muscle rigidity and slowed movements.
