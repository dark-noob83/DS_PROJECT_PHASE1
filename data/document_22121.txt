Leave a reply. IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) is a molecule that oxidizes tryptophan, which is needed by cytotoxic T-cells. When cancer cells and T-reg cells secrete IDO in the vicinity of cytotoxic T cells, antitumor activity is abrogated. Dendritic cells also express IDO, and when this is done in the context of antigen presentation, induction of T-reg cells occurs – see Nature Reviews Immunology 4, 762-774 (October 2004). a | Potential mechanisms for the ‘bystander’ effects of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-expressing cells.
Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO or INDO EC 1.13.11.52) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the IDO1 gene. This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine. Rosmarinic acid inhibits the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase via its cyclooxygenase-inhibiting properties. COX-2 inhibitors down-regulate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, leading to a reduction in kynurenine levels as well as reducing proinflammatory cytokine activity.
Combination therapies with agents such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors may have the potential to synergize with immunotherapeutic approaches to improve immune function against tumor cells. Combination therapies, such as with IDO inhibitors, have the potential to synergize with immunotherapeutic approaches.” Completion of the study is anticipated for November 2017. Alex A.

NLG919 is a potent IDO (indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitor with Ki/EC50 of 7 nM/75 nM in cell-free assays. INCB024360 analogue is a potent, competitive IDO1 (indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase) inhibitor with IC50 of 67 nM. Phase 2. S7756. Indoximod (NLG-8189）. Indoximod (NLG-8189), a methylated tryptophan, acts as an IDO (indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitor, and reverses IDO-mediated immune suppression.
Introduction. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) is a heme containing enzyme responsible for the initial step in the major pathway of l-tryptophan catabolism, the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway. Based on IDO-1 inhibitors such as PI, 1,4-naphthoquinone, 3-amino-2-naphthoic acid, benzothiazolethione and phenylmethanthiol, we first narrowed the list down to molecules containing potential heme ligators through the use of SMARTS-like strings in the MOE interface.
New York–based Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) acquired Flexus Biosciences in San Carlos, California, for $ 800 million upfront—with another $ 450 million in milestones on offer—locking in one of the last remaining unpartnered programs targeting the indoleamine-2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme. “IDO inhibition helps to reveal the target to the immune system.”. IDO is overexpressed by antigen presenting cells in many cancers. “We know that the expression of IDO usually correlates with a significantly poor prognosis,” says Carl Decicco, head of discovery and R&D at BMS.
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism through kynurenine pathway, thus causing depletion of tryptophan which can cause halted growth of microbes as well as T cells. Rosmarinic acid inhibits the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase via its cyclooxygenase-inhibiting properties. COX-2 inhibitors down-regulate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, leading to a reduction in kynurenine levels as well as reducing proinflammatory cytokine activity.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) is a heme containing enzyme that catalyses the initial step in the major pathway of l-tryptophan catabolism; the kynurenine pathway. A large body of evidence has been accumulating for its immunosuppressive and tumoural escape roles and its applicability as a therapeutic target. Based on IDO-1 inhibitors such as PI, 1,4-naphthoquinone, 3-amino-2-naphthoic acid, benzothiazolethione and phenylmethanthiol, we first narrowed the list down to molecules containing potential heme ligators through the use of SMARTS-like strings in the MOE interface.
