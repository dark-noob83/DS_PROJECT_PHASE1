The sensor sends an output voltage signal that is directly proportional to the NOx concentration. The NOx sensor can be incorporated upstream and downstream of the catalyst, to provide a feedback control loop to the ECM, indicative of the ...
Knock Sensor. The knock sensor is located on the engine block, cylinder head or intake manifold. This is because its function is to sense vibrations caused by engine knock or detonation. The PCM uses this signal to alter the ignition timing and prevent
A vehicle knock sensor is a sensor screwed into the engine's block or cylinder head. It is used to detect engine knock or detonation (there is a piezoelectric element inside the sensor).
The signal from the knock sensor is sent to the PCM/ECM and that is used to control the engine's timing. Typically you'll have one knock sensor on each bank of the engine (one on inline 4/5/6 cylinder engines, two on V6, V8, V10 engines).
A nitrogen oxide sensor or NOx sensor is typically a high-temperature device built to detect nitrogen oxides in combustion environments such as an automobile or truck tailpipe or a smokestack.
When the sensor detects too much NOx in a vehicleâ€™s exhaust gas, it tells the SCR system to inject more urea, which uses ammonia to reduce emissions. However, if too much urea is used, ammonia starts being released. The sensor can detect this ammonia slip and tell the SCR to inject less urea.
NOx Sensor Replacement. The NOx sensor detects the level of nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gases. It is a component of the emissions control system. This article explains how to diagnose and replace a faulty NOx sensor in an E87 1 series BMW equipped with an N43 engine.
A knock sensor assures that you're getting as much power and fuel economy as is possible from your engine. More details: A knock sensor allows the engine to run with the ignition timing as far advanced as possible.
