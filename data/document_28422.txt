you may choose to have genetic testing if you are concerned that you have an increased risk for having or getting a disease that has a genetic cause the information you obtain from the tests may help you make decisions about your life for example late onset disease testing determines whether you carry a genetic change that increases your risk for developing a disease such as breast cancer or huntington s disease later in life this might be of interest if you have a relative who has the disease
in the past the main genetic tests searched for abnormal chromosome numbers and mutations that lead to rare inherited disorders today tests involve analyzing multiple genes to determine the risk of developing certain more common diseases such as heart disease and cancer in addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders
this article focuses on genetic testing for medical purposes dna sequencing which actually produces a sequences of as cs gs and ts is used in molecular biology evolutionary biology metagenomics epidemiology ecology and microbiome research in addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders
genetic testing is a personal choice blood tests for some of the more common genetic diseases may be performed on a woman and her partner before a pregnancy if they wish to know if they are carriers many times genetic testing is done first on the woman and only done on the partner if the woman is a carrier 
genetic testing involves examining your dna the chemical database that carries instructions for your body s functions genetic testing can reveal changes or alterations in your genes that may cause illness or disease although genetic testing can provide important information for diagnosing treating and preventing illness there are limitations for example if you re a healthy person a positive result from genetic testing doesn t always mean you will develop a disease
genetic testing also known as dna testing allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases and can also be used to determine a child s parentage genetic mother and father or in general a person s ancestry or biological relationship between people in addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders
genetic testing is the process of using medical tests to look for changes mutations in a person s genes or chromosomes hundreds of different genetic tests are used today and more are being developed genetic testing for diseases that can be inherited genetic testing can be used in different situations the type of testing most often used to check for cancer risk is called predictive gene testing it s used to look for gene mutations that might put a person at risk of getting a disease
examples of disorders for which genetic testing may be used to confirm a diagnosis include adult polycystic kidney disease iron overload hemochromatosis and charcot marie tooth disease presymptomatic and predictive testing an expanded carrier screening test can detect genes associated with a wide variety of genetic diseases and mutations pharmacogenetics if you have a particular health condition or disease this type of genetic testing may help determine what medication and dosage will be most effective and beneficial for you
guide a genetic test examines the dna deoxyribonucleic acid of a person s cells genetic testing can identify changes in genes or can analyze the number arrangement and characteristics of the chromosomes testing may be performed on samples of blood semen urine saliva stool body tissues bone or hair information obtained from newborn screening can help guide medical treatment to ensure the best possible outcome for the baby check to see if you carry a genetic change that increases your risk for a disease such as breast cancer or huntington s disease later in life late onset disease testing
