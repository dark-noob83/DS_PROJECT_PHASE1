Genetic modification is the process of altering the properties of cells in an organism by changing the genetic makeup of the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. This can include deleting or changing genes, or transferring genes from one organism to another.
Genetic modification. Genetic modification, or GM for short, is not the same as cloning. Although cloning techniques are used in genetic engineering, the two things should not be confused. This table shows some of the differences.

Because the exact same recognition sequences exist in the DNA of different organisms, biologists can use restriction enzymes to cut a stretch of DNA from the genome of one organism and paste it into the genome of another. (A genome is any complete set of the DNA warehoused in a cell’s nucleus.).

Genetic Modification of Bacteria. Bacteria-the first organisms to be genetically engineered-are used for replicating and altering genes that are subsequently introduced into plants or animals. Bacterial systems lend themselves to genetic manipulation in part because of their rapid reproduction rates.
In Canada, enzymes that are used in food processing are regulated as food additives. An enzyme meets the definition of a food additive, as set out in section B.01.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations, when it affects the characteristics of the food and/or it or its by-products become part of the food.

The most common vector used in genetic engineering is a circular form of DNA known as a plasmid. Endonucleases are used to cut the plasmid molecule open at almost any point chosen by the scientist. Once the plasmid has been cut open, it is mixed with the insulin gene and a ligase enzyme.
