Over time, the lion's habitat has been reduced by the expansion of humans. Historically, it was found in southern Europe, Eurasia, Africa and in Greece, its range spreading east to India. By 100 A.D. the lion was extinct in Greece, and by the late 19th century, it was extinct in Turkey.
Features. Lions are typically found in semi-arid plains and in savanna grasslands. This habitat is ideal for the grazing animals that are the lion's primary prey, and the savanna grasslands feature wide, spreading acacia trees which provide the lions with shade and places to rest during the day.
Habitat. African lions live in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. They wander a territory of 100 square miles (259 square kilometers), according to National Geographic. This territory consists of scrub, grasslands or open woodlands.
Lions consume a wide variety of prey, from wildebeest, impala, zebra, giraffe, buffalo and wild hogs to sometimes rhinos and hippos. They will also feed on smaller animals such as hares, birds and reptiles. Lions are also known to attack elephants when food is scarce.
