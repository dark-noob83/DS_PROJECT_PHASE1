History. Plant cells were first discovered in the 17th century by scientist Robert Hooke, a genius whose contributions to science were wide-ranging and diverse. In 1665, he published a book called Micrographia that contained drawings and descriptions of objects he had observed through the microscope.
1838 Matthias Schleiden-First to observe and report that all plants were composed of cells. 1839 Theodore Schwann-First to observe and report that all animals were composed of cells. Theodore Schwann and Schleiden are attributed to the first two points of the Cell Theory.
Robert Hooke used the term cells to describe units in plant tissue (thick cell walls could be observed). Of course he saw only cell walls because cork cells are dead and without protoplasm. He drew the cells he saw and also coined the word cell.
The cell was first discovered and named by Robert Hooke in 1663. He remarked that it looked strangely similar to cellula or small rooms which monks inhabited, thus deriving the name. However what Hooke actually saw was the dead cell walls of plant cells also known as cork.

Creating Cell Theory. Scientist Matthias Schleiden discovered in 1838, that all plants have cells, which are called plant cells. Theodor Schwannn found that all animals are also made up of cells, which are called animal cells. These are two types of the many different kinds of cells.
1833: English Botanist Robert Brown discovered the nucleus in plant cells. 1838: Matthias Jakob Schleiden, a German botanist, concluded that all plant tissues are composed of cells and that an embryonic plant arose from a single cell. He declared that the cell is the basic building block of all plant matter.
