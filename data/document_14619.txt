A distinction can be made between proximal ageing (age-based effects that come about because of factors in the recent past) and distal ageing (age-based differences that can be traced back to a cause early in person's life, such as childhood poliomyelitis). Accumulation of Misrepairs is focalized and self-accelerating. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs leads to the development of spots or plaques in a tissue, such as atherosclerotic plaques and age spots in skin. Thus, development of aging changes is inhomogeneous and self-accelerating.
Over the past 30 years, Weiss says, research attention has focused primarily on environmental influences on early developmental stages. Far less extensively researched, but a subject of increasing interest, are environmental chemical exposures that can affect the health of the aging brain.

In humans, ageing represents the accumulation of changes in a human being over time, encompassing physical, psychological, and social change. Reaction time, for example, may slow with age, while knowledge of world events and wisdom may expand. Accumulation of Misrepairs is focalized and self-accelerating. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs leads to the development of spots or plaques in a tissue, such as atherosclerotic plaques and age spots in skin. Thus, development of aging changes is inhomogeneous and self-accelerating.
The Effects of Aging on Skin. Your skin changes with age. That's about a lifetime of sun exposure, personal habits such as smoking and diet, and changes that happen with normal aging. As you get older, you may notice your skin isn't as smooth or tight as it once was. It may also be drier, more fragile, and thinner than it used to be. With age, skin may also bruise more easily, due to loss of support around blood vessel walls that happens with age. Below the skin's surface, losing fat in your cheeks, temples, chin, nose, and around your eyes may loosen skin and give your face a leaner look.
T he population of Americans aged 65 and older is expected to double between 2010 and 2050, 1 and by midcentury the proportion of the human population made up of people over age 80 is projected to have quadrupled since 2000. 2 So factors that affect this aging population are of increasing importance. Time after Time: Environmental Influences on the Aging Brain. Elizabeth Grossman, a Portland, OR–based environmental and science writer, has written for Environmental Health News, Yale Environment 360, Scientific American, The Washington Post, and other publications.
Ageing (British English) or aging (American English) is the process of becoming older. In the narrow sense, the term refers to biological ageing of human beings, animals and other organisms. In the broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism (cellular senescence) or to the population of a species (population ageing). Accumulation of Misrepairs is focalized and self-accelerating. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs leads to the development of spots or plaques in a tissue, such as atherosclerotic plaques and age spots in skin. Thus, development of aging changes is inhomogeneous and self-accelerating.
Everyone's body undergoes changes, some natural and some not, that can affect the way the endocrine system works. Some of the factors that affect endocrine organs include aging, certain diseases and conditions, stress, the environment, and genetics. An environmental endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) is a substance outside of the body that may interfere with the normal function of the endocrine system. Some EDCs mimic natural hormone binding at the target cell receptor.
You can see that depending upon how you frame the question about foods and the brain you get a different list of foods and a different reason for consuming them. If you wish to alter your current brain function or slow your brain's aging you need to consume foods that target specific chemical processes. In truth, no one ever considers these distinctions when eating-we just eat what tastes good.
