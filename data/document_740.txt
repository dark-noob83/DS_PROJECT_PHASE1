Rack Space Costs: For rack cost, we’re taking a widely-used industry short-cut and adding a 50% uplift to the power cost. Monthly Average TCO per VM. The total 5-year cost of ownership for the web-scale solution comes to $1,133,253. The VM TCO formula with a 5% cost of capital results in a discounted monthly average TCO per VM of $83. Using the formula without a cost of capital (i.e. without discounting the cash flows) results in a monthly average TCO per VM of $92.
For example, suppose you plan on a three-year lifecycle. A $20,000 fixed server cost remains the same over three years, but an annual network connectivity cost of $500 would cost $1,500 per server over three years, and a $2,000 annual management database cost for the deployment would cost $6,000 over three years. Other organizations might use longer or shorter lifecycles.
The resulting host as configured would achieve a 27:1 consolidation ratio, or an average cost of $2488 per server. To further illustrate the cost savings within the virtual environment, 20 additional standard workload servers would price out at approximately $2750 per server, for a total of $55,000.
Even though the total average across all VM’s is 3GB of RAM for each VM, the consolidation ratio doesn’t necessarily work that easily. 40:1 is an achievable ratio for the mixture of VM’s within my current environement, which brings the cost per VM to around $1680 per VM.
Per VM licensing is based on a rolling average of the highest number of VMs over the last 12 months. 1  You want to manage cost reporting effectively and decide to buy VMware vCenter Chargeback.
1 On an average day, you run between 90 and 125 virtual machines. 2  As shown in the chart above, at the end of the year, usage typically spikes to 200 to 250 virtual machines for two months. 3  The daily maximum total virtual machines still averages only about 130
