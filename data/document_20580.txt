Set the posts with cement for stability when possible. To get the desired post length, add together the depth of setting, the height of top wire above the ground and 6 extra to get the desired post length. For example, a corner brace post set 3.5' for a 4' fence would have to be 8' long.
Line posts are required to hold up the fence and need to be placed at specific intervals, depending on the type of fence. Most wood fences are spaced 8 feet between fence posts. This isn't for a structural purpose, although 8 feet provides enough support for a wooden fence. Dimensional lumber is usually available in 8 or 16 feet lengths, so having posts 8 feet apart means less cutting and wood waste. 
Fence Sturdiness. Depending on the length of your wire fence, you can put line posts up to 20 feet apart. When you're installing steel or wood posts, you can use 15-foot spacing. The terminal posts are the corner, end and gate posts. If your terminal posts are 30 feet apart, you should set your line posts 10 feet apart, typically the maximum distance your line posts should be apart.
Wood posts from 5.5 to 8.5 feet long and from 2.5 to 8 inches or larger diameter are readily available. The larger the top diameter, the stronger the post. Line posts can be as small as 2.5 inches, but larger ones will provide for a stronger, more durable fence. Corner and gate posts should have a top diameter of at least 8 inches. Brace posts should be 5 inches or more in diameter.
Typical fence height is either 51 or 54 inches. Spacing between wires depends on the number of line wires and fence height. Common wire spacing in inches from ground are: three wire 16-16-16; four wire 16-10-10-10; five wire 12-10-10-10-10; and six wire 12-8-8-8-8-8. Line posts are usually spaced 12 to 20 feet apart. Only 1 strand of barbed wire is needed if using woven wire that is 39 inches or higher. It is installed about four inches above the woven wire with a minimum of 2 inches from the top of the post. I would like to know the recommended strand spacing for wire fences for 4,5 and 6 strand fences as well as the recommended height for a wire strand above a field fence if my posts are 4'6 above grade.
Depth: 1  Anchor posts should be treated like any wood post and go down at least 2.5 feet for a 5 foot tall fence. ( 2 The bigger the post, the deeper you want to set it.). 3  T-posts have “blades” on them that should be buried, again, at least 2 feet for a 5 foot fence I would think. Depth: 1  Anchor posts should be treated like any wood post and go down at least 2.5 feet for a 5 foot tall fence. 2
Wooden line posts are typically 5-6 wide treated posts and are set 2'-2.5' in the ground. When using t-posts, we recommend a 5:1 ratio of wooden to metal t-posts. Most commonly, fence posts can be placed 8-12 feet apart. Brace posts should be set no less than 3.5 feet into the ground. To get the desired post length, add together the depth of setting, the height of top wire above the ground and 6 extra to get the desired post length. For example, a corner brace post set 3.5' for a 4' fence would have to be 8' long.
Terminal Post Distances. The distance between terminal posts can greatly affect the distance between line posts. The terminal posts are the corner, end and gate posts. If your terminal posts are 30 feet apart, you should set your line posts 10 feet apart, typically the maximum distance your line posts should be apart.
When selecting posts, be sure that the posts are at least 3 taller than the fence they are supporting. Line posts need to be set 2'-2.5' deep. T-posts should never be used as brace posts, only line posts. A 1.33 description is a post weighing 1.33 lbs/ft, while a 1.25 post is a post weighing 1.25 lbs/ft. To get the desired post length, add together the depth of setting, the height of top wire above the ground and 6 extra to get the desired post length. For example, a corner brace post set 3.5' for a 4' fence would have to be 8' long.
Corner and gate postsshould have a diameter of at least 8 inches. Braceposts should be 5 inches or more in diameter.Line posts can be as small as 2 1/2 inches, butlarger diameter posts will make the fence strongerand more durable.Steel posts have several advantages. On extremely flat land,line posts are generally spaced from 10 to 16 feetapart if the fence is not electrified, to as much as150 feet apart for an electrified fence. Battens orspacers are installed in all dips or at a maximumof 30 feet apart for five strands and 50 feet for twoto three strands.
