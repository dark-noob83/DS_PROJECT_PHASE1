Lysosomal storage diseases are caused by the accumulation of macromolecules (proteins, polysaccharides, lipids) in the lysosomes because of a genetic failure to manufacture an enzyme needed for their breakdown. Neurons of the central nervous system are particularly susceptible to damage.
Whatâ€™s Missing Historically, lysosomal storage disorders have been described as a group of disorders caused by missing enzymes. This description suggests that enzyme is missing from the body completely. While some individuals with lysosomal storage disorders do not make any enzyme, many individuals do make enzyme.
Gaucher disease is the most common of the lipid storage diseases. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Fatty material can collect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, and bone marrow.
Overview. An enzyme is a protein that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction occurs. Enzymes are substrate specific, meaning that each type of enzyme has a specific type of molecule that it affects. The human body needs enzymes to influence the rates at which biological processes occur.
PKU symptoms are caused by alterations or mutations in the genetic code for the PAH enzyme. Mutations in the PAH gene prevent the liver from producing adequate levels of the PAH enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine. The PAH gene and its PKU mutations are found on chromosome 12 in the human genome.
Gangliosides are fatty substances necessary for the proper development of the brain and nerve cells (nervous system). Under normal conditions, gangliosides are continuously broken down, so that an appropriate balance is maintained. In Tay-Sachs disease, the enzyme necessary for removing excess gangliosides is missing.
