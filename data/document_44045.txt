It can be. But just because you have dark urine doesn’t necessarily mean that it is always dangerous. Dark urine can be caused by many factors, such as the food you eat, how hydrated you are, and of course certain illnesses. Obviously, one of the biggest concerns with dark urine is dehydration.
Darkened urine is urine that is dark yellow, brown, dark red, or red, and it may range from slightly dark to considerably dark. A change in urine color may be temporary, or it may be persistent. The duration and course of darkened urine can vary widely, depending on the cause.
Sometimes your urine can be a few shades darker than the usual light yellow urine. In fact, your urine can be very dark and even a different dark urine color such as red urine, brown urine, orange urine or rust urine color. The appearance of dark urine may be unsettling and cause you to question your health.
If your urine is just a dark yellow color at times, especially when you don’t drink enough fluids, then you don’t need to worry. Dark yellow urine is a sign of dehydration. Your urine is dark because your kidneys are doing what they are supposed to do when you are dehydrated: conserving water by making less urine. If this is the case, drink more water — eight 8-ounce glasses each day.
Urine is produced in the kidneys, which are important organs for the health of our body. When we take fluid in, it passes from our digestive system into our circulatory system, where it is filtered through the kidneys. The kidneys get rid of waste products through the urine.
Dark urine is most commonly due to dehydration and concentrated urine. However, it may be an indicator that excess, unusual, or potentially dangerous waste products are circulating in the body. For example, dark brown urine may indicate liver disease due to the presence of bile products.
