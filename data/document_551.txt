1 Interior paint itself costs anywhere from $12-$50 or more a gallon, depending on the quality. 2  Painting a 12x12-foot room, both walls and ceiling, can require $25-$100 worth of paint, plus $10-$50 for primer, brushes, rollers, drop clothes and other supplies. A rate of no less than $1.80/sf including materials is realistic, acceptable and more than fair for a qualified professional to paint rooms with 9' ceilings. Expect to pay $1 extra per square foot for 9'- 15' and $2.50 extra for 15' +. Some additional costs for extreme conditions will raise that amount
1 For example, if it takes you 10 seconds per square foot to paint a bare wall, a wall 12 foot (3.7 m) long by 10 foot (3.0 m) high, plus the time it might take to mask the wall and reload your brush or roller, and you can estimate 40 minutes for that wall. Add this into your labor estimate. 1  For example, if running your office and paying your operating expenses costs $5,000 per year, and you expect to do 100 jobs in the year, to pass all the burden of expenses to your customers you would have to add $50 to every job. 2  Add in transportation and any other daily fees.
I would love to know the total sq footage of that 10 room house that you charged $9000+ to paint. Yes the wall sq footage was 5900, but $1.80 per square foot of wall space is a bit high for a residential repaint IMO. Take for example, I charge 1.75 sq foot for 10x10 room with 8 foot ceilings. A rate of no less than $1.80/sf including materials is realistic, acceptable and more than fair for a qualified professional to paint rooms with 9' ceilings. Expect to pay $1 extra per square foot for 9'- 15' and $2.50 extra for 15' +. Some additional costs for extreme conditions will raise that amount
