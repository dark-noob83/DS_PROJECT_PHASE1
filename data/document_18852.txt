Halon is a liquefied, compressed gas that stops the spread of fire by chemically disrupting combustion. Halon 1211 (a liquid streaming agent) and Halon 1301 (a gaseous flooding agent) leave no residue and are remarkably safe for human exposure.
Halons are a family of chemicals similar to Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but containing at least one atom of bromine. Like CFCs, Halons are very unreactive and stable, non-flammable and non-toxic. At room temperature, they are usually colourless gases or liquids which evaporate easily.
Halons are low-toxicity, chemically stable compounds that have been used for fire and explosion protection from early in the last century. Halon has proven to be an extremely effective fire suppressant. Halon is clean (i.e., leaves no residue) and is remarkably safe for human exposure.
Noun. 1. halon-a compound in which the hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon have been replaced by bromine and other halogen atoms; very stable; used in fire extinguishers although it is thought to release bromine that depletes the ozone layer. organic compound-any compound of carbon and another element or a radical.
Halons are extremely unreactive and used in built-in fire  suppression systems where water would probably cause more damage  than the fire itself, such as computer rooms. The halon smothers  the fire, preventing oxygen from reaching the burning materials.
A class of simple hydrocarbon derivatives in which bromine, chlorine and fluorine are substituted for some or all of the hydrogen atoms. These compounds are used mainly as fire-extinguishing gases, the two best known being Halon 1211 (CF2BrCl) and Halon 1301 (CF3Br).
