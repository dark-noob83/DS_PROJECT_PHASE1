The morphology of a sensory receptor is usually specific and selective for transduction of a particular form of energy, a phenomenon referred to as receptor specificity. This property of receptor specificity is the basis of the labeled line code, the key coding mechanism for the modality of the stimulus.
General senses modalities include somatic and visceral senses Special senses include sensory modalities of smell, taste, vision, hearing and equilibrium. A given postganglionic axon carries information for only one sensory modality.
8. Conclusions As an individual interface or an additional system interface solution, the tactile modality is a viable choice for the deliverance of system information. It helps to alleviate information overload for the visual and auditory modalities.
Sensory Integration is a dynamic process that occurs in the central nervous system and involves receiving sensory information and turning it into functional responses. All day, every day, we receive sensory information through touch, hearing, sight, taste, smell, body position, and movement and balance.
1. A very intense stimulus can sometimes stimulate sensory neurons that have evolved for a different modality. Thus, with. a blow to the eye, one sees stars.. In this example the photoreceptors in the eye are responding to. You correctly answered: c. intense pressure. 2.
Theory Behind the Model. Learning modalities are the sensory channels or pathways through which individuals give, receive, and store information. Perception, memory, and sensation comprise the concept of modality. The modalities or senses include visual, auditory, tactile/kinesthetic, smell, and taste.
