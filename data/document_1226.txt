How to Cook an Artichoke. 1 If the artichokes have little thorns on the end of the leaves, take a kitchen scissors and cut of the thorned tips of all of the leaves. This step is mostly for aesthetics as the thorns soften with cooking and pose no threat to the person eating the artichoke.
Cover the pot with the lid and let Artichokes cook at a high simmer on stove until they are tender. Cooking time can vary, depending on the size of the Artichokes. A good approximation is 30 minutes for a Medium-sized Artichoke or 45 minutes for a Jumbo-sized Artichoke.
Cover. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer. Cook for 25 to 45 minutes or until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off. Note: artichokes can also be cooked in a pressure cooker (about 15-20 minutes cooking time). Cooking time depends on how large the artichoke is, the larger, the longer it takes to cook.
