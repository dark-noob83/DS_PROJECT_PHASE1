I have formulated the COSHH assessment but i do not know what to include in the COSHH register.. If anyone can help me with this really soon I would really appreciate it.
The register is provided as a blank template and you need to complete the register with details of the hazardous substances used and stored in your business.
MSDS's are important in helping you, or anyone you supply, to make the workplace safe and to protect the environment. More specifically, a safety data sheet contains information to help you make a risk assessment as required by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (CoSHH).
Use this COSHH register template to keep an inventory of hazardous substances used and stored within your business, helping you to control substance use and comply with the COSHH regulations.
COSHH is the law that requires employers to control substances that are hazardous to health. You can prevent or reduce workers exposure to hazardous substances by: 1  finding out what the health hazards are; 2  deciding how to prevent harm to health (risk assessment); 3  providing control measures to reduce harm to health;
Keeping a list of all substances used or generated within your workplace in a COSHH inventory, can help you create an effective COSHH system that is both easy to maintain and easy to access important COSHH information. You may use the COSHH register template in your business, and can add your company name at the top.
