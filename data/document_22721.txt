The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys and consist of a series of layers with different structure and functions. The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis. The adrenal cortex produces a class of steroid hormones called corticosteroids, named according to their effects.
The adrenal glands are orange-colored endocrine glands which are located on the top of both kidneys. The adrenal glands are triangular shaped and measure about one-half inch in height and 3 inches in length. Each gland consists of a medulla (the center of the gland) which is surrounded by the cortex.
Epinephrine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, more commonly called adrenaline and noradrenaline, are produced by the adrenal medulla. These are hormones that increase heart rate, glucose levels and oxygen in the body, while suppressing non-essential bodily functions. Endocrine glands, such as the adrenal glands, directly influence the body by secreting into the blood, rather than through an intermediary, such as a glandular duct.The adrenal glands are composed of two major components: the adrenal medulla and the adrenal cortex.

1 The adrenal cortex—the outer part of the gland—produces hormones that are vital to life, such as cortisol (which helps regulate metabolism and helps your body respond to stress) and aldosterone (which helps control blood pressure). The adrenal glands have a multi-functional role in the endocrine system. The two very different parts of these glands, the medulla and cortex, regulate and maintain many of your internal processes—from metabolism to the fight-or-flight response.
Hormones of the Adrenal Glands. The adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla have very different functions. One of the main distinctions between them is that the hormones released by the adrenal cortex are necessary for life; those secreted by the adrenal medulla are not. The adrenal glands have a multi-functional role in the endocrine system. The two very different parts of these glands, the medulla and cortex, regulate and maintain many of your internal processes—from metabolism to the fight-or-flight response.
The medulla is located in the center of the gland and makes adrenalineAdrenaline-the hormone that helps control the fight or flight response and puts the body on high alert (also known as epinephrine) and noradrenaline. These hormones are also known as epinephrine and norepinephrine. The cortex is located on the outer layer of the adrenal gland and makes a number of different hormones that help control the heart, kidneys, GI tract, bones, genitalia, and immune system. These hormones control carbohydrate metabolism, muscular integrity, hemodynamic changes, and sexual maturity
Your adrenal glands make hormones. One of these is cortisol, which helps your body deal with stress. According to the adrenal fatigue theory, if your life is too stressful, your adrenal glands may not pump out enough hormones, leading to a wide variety of symptoms. If you have Addison's disease, your adrenal glands don't make enough hormones. Unlike adrenal fatigue, this is an illness that doctors can test and recognize. In most cases of this disease, the adrenal glands have been damaged by the immune system. Other causes of Addison's disease include: 1  Tuberculosis (TB).
For years the adrenal gland remained a behind-the-scenes player in the development of several chronic conditions, like fibromyalgia (for more common questions and expert answers on Fibromyalgia, visit Sharecare.com) and chronic fatigue. Few patients know about or understand this gland. The adrenal gland should make the necessary amount of hormones in a balance, without producing too much or too little. One of the major hormones made by the adrenal gland is cortisol.
