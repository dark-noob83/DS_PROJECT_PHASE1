Blood is considered a type of connective tissue. Blood is composed of the formed elements and plasma. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. The formed elements consist of the cells and cell fragments. The erythrocytes (red blood cells), platelets, and leukocytes (white blood cells) are all considered formed elements.
Major elements that are found in cytoplasm are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. The type of minerals present in the cytoplasm depends on cell type. Cells making up bones … tend to have more minerals such as calcium in it.
Platelets, or thrombocytes, are the smallest of the formed elements and are actually fragments of large cells called megakary-ocytes, which are found in bone marrow.
In eukaryotic cells the cytoplasm contains organelles, such as mitochondria, that are fi … lled with liquid kept separate from the rest of the cytoplasm by biological membranes. The cytoplasm is the site where most cellular activities occur, such as many metabolic pathways, and processes such as cell division.
Platelets are best described as. cytoplasmic fragments of cells. Identify the blood type that is the universal donor. O. Identify the giant cells that are located in the red bone marrow and they give rise to thrombocytes.
(This is why the term formed elements is used instead of blood cells to describe erythro-cytes, leukocytes, and platelets.) The fragments that enter the circulation as platelets lack nuclei but, like leukocytes, are capable of amoeboid movement.
Answer: c. Blood is composed of the formed elements and plasma. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. The formed elements consist of the cells and cell fragments. The erythrocytes (red blood cells), platelets, and leukocytes (white blood cells) are all considered formed elements. When a sample of blood is centrifuged, the percentage occupied by the formed elements is the hematocrit. An average hematocrit is about 45%.
