Advertisement. I have been trying to figure out what Bruce Banners education is in and I am getting conflicting results. Most sources (including Marvels website) indicate that he has a PhD in Nuclear Physics. However, one source (wikipedia) states that he has an MD and a PHD and therefore also a physcian. There is no reference for this source and I do not think it is correct. Honestly, Wikipedia is awful for many things. Since no one else seems to have a definitive answer I will make my own conclusion that the Marvel website is correct and Banner is a PhD in Nuclear Physics. Seems fitting to the character.
