Prepare the bottle. A lamb should be fed with an 8 ounce baby bottle with a rubber nipple. 1  Initially, you should fill the bottle with 10% of the baby lamb's weight in colostrum and feed this to the lamb within its first 24 hours. 2  Feed the lamb every two hours, if possible, during this timeframe.
-----. In a day bottle lambs need about 5 oz of milk per pound of weight. You can figure this out and then break the feedings down to multiple times per day. In the first 24 hours you will want to feed around the clock, usually every 2 hours in the day, every 3 at night.
Feed the lambs 4 to 5 times in the first 18 hours of life if the lamb is unable to suckle on a ewe. When feeding lambs with a stomach tube, give no more than 20cc per pound of body weight. This is roughly 4 ounces per feeding in a 6 pound lamb (1 ml = 1 cc; 1 oz = 30 cc).
Feeding Schedule and Amounts. Milk Replacer After the initial colostrum feeding, lambs should receive about 15% to 20% of their body weight in milk replacer daily. Example: 5 lb lamb X 16oz/lb= 80 oz X 20% = 16 oz daily. Divide the above daily amount by the number of feedings in a 24-hour period.
1 Initially, you should fill the bottle with 10% of the baby lamb's weight in colostrum and feed this to the lamb within its first 24 hours. 2  Feed the lamb every two hours, if possible, during this timeframe. 3  After the initial colostrum feeding, your lamb will need 140 milliliters of milk replacer.
Suggested Feeding Schedule: For the first 24 hours of life, give the lamb colostrum. Feed it every 2 hours if possible through the first 24 hours of life. In the next 24 to 48 hours of the lamb's life, begin gradually mixing the colostrum or colostrum substitute with lamb milk replacer.
1 For the first 24 hours after receiving the colostrum, lambs should be fed 140 milliliters every four hours. 2  After this, feed your lamb 200 milligrams four times a day. 3  Your lamb should still be fed about
