Electrolytes are minerals found in your blood, urine and other body fluids that carry an electric charge. These minerals include calcium, potassium, sodium, chloride, phosphorus and magnesium. Electrolytes help with muscle function, as well as the maintenance of fluid balance and your body's pH.
Whole foods, such as fruits and nuts, contain valuable amounts of electrolytes. Electrolytes are electrically charged particles that help ensure proper bodily function. The most familiar types include potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium.
Fruits and Vegetables. Many fruits and vegetables contain three important electrolytes -- calcium, potassium and magnesium. High-calcium fruits and vegetables include collard greens, spinach and turnip greens. Fruits and vegetables that are high in potassium include apricots, bananas, potatoes, kiwi, tomatoes and sweet potatoes.
Other fruits and vegetables that contain calcium are broccoli, oranges, green beans, dried beans of all types, mushrooms, asparagus and cabbage. High potassium fruits and vegetables include apricots, bananas, potatoes, pears, kiwi, tomatoes, lettuce, celery and sweet potatoes.
List of drinks/foods that replenish electrolytes! First off, electrolytes are minerals found in your blood, urine and other body fluids that carry an electric charge. These minerals include calcium, potassium, sodium, chloride, phosphorus and magnesium.
Foods containing sodium and chloride include table salt, beef, pork, sardines, cheese, olives, corn bread and sauerkraut. All processed and canned foods made with added salt, such as deli meats, chips and other snacks, nuts, butter, margarine, mayonnaise and many condiments, have sodium and chloride.
Sodium and chloride -- the two electrolytes that make up table salt -- are present in foods together and work in the body to maintain fluid balance for proper cell function.
