Black Snake Moan is the oddest, most peculiar movie I've seen about sex and race and redemption in the Deep South. It may be the most peculiar recent movie ever except for Road House, but then what can you say about Road House? Such movies defy all categories. The girl is Rae (Christina Ricci); it is no coincidence that Jackson's character is named Lazarus, and Lazarus determines to return her from near death or whooping cough, one or the other. No saint himself, he wants to redeem her from a life of sluttery.
Dumped by the wife for whom he sold his heart, his soul, and his music to make her happy, Lazarus sees in Rae something of what he s been missing. Black Snake Moan is smart and soulful but it s also red hot. The movie burns with the sweaty heat of the deep, deep south. It s not afraid of sex, nudity, and smoldering, immorality. The film also knows a thing or two about beautiful, bad ass cursing. MOVIE REVIEW. Black Snake Moan It s disguised itself as a trashy, fun exploitation flick but Black Snake Moan is credible morality tale about damaged people helping and healing each other.
