telophase. Telophase is the fifth and final phase of mitosis, the process that separates the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells. Telophase begins once the replicated, paired chromosomes have been separated and pulled to opposite sides, or poles, of the cell. During telophase, a nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes to separate the nuclear DNA from the cytoplasm.
Telophase. The final stage of mitosis or meiosis, when chromosome separation is completed. The final stage of mitosis .The final stage of meiosis when the chromosomes move toward opposite ends of the nuclear spindle.A stage of nuclear Division in meiosis and mitosis, occurring once in mitosis and twice in meiosis.
Anaphase: Spindle fibers shorten, the kinetochores separate, and the chromatids (daughter chromosomes) are pulled apart and begin moving to the cell poles. Telophase: The daughter chromosomes arrive at the poles and the spindle fibers that have pulled them apart disappear.
The cell now undergoes a process called cytokinesis that divides the cytoplasm of the original cell into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell is haploid and has only one set of chromosomes, or half the total number of chromosomes of the original cell.
The chromosomes begin to uncoil, which makes them diffuse and less compact. Along with telophase, the cell undergoes a process called cytokinesis that divides the cytoplasm of the parental cell into two daughter cells.
1 A nuclear envelope reforms around each chromosome set, the spindle disappears, and cytokinesis follows. 2  In animal cells, cytokinesis involves the formation of a cleavage furrow, resulting in the pinching of the cell into two cells.
