Glia are seen as very important for the understanding of and development of treatments for Parkinson’s Disease. The 2008 publication Glial reactions in Parkinson’s disease raised the issue of whether glial activation is an important component in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Microglia (and astrocytes, another type of glial cells) are distributed in large non-overlapping regions throughout the brain and spinal cord. Microglia are constantly scavenging the CNS for damaged neurons, plaques, and infectious agents.
Schwann cells must perform all of the functions of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia in the brain, as none of these glia exists outside the CNS. Schwann cells. Microglia are associated with nervous system pathology and inflammation to defend against disease and repair damaged brain tissue. Glia are far from inert interstitial brain cells. Some types of glia are involved in synaptic transmission, which implicates these glial cells in many aspects of learning, memory and other types of information processing; and in nervous system dysfunction, including neurological and psychological disorders.
Glial cells, sometimes called neuroglia or simply glia (Greek γλοία glue; pronounced in English as either /ˈɡliːə/ or /ˈɡlaɪə/), are non-neuronal cells that maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and provide support and protection for neurons in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. As the Greek name implies, glia are commonly known as the glue of the nervous system; however, this is not fully accurate. Neuroscience currently identifies four main functions of glial cells: 1  To surround neurons and hold them in place. 2  To supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons.
The term neurodegenerative disease refers to the principal pathology associated with disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, and it is presumed that neurodegeneration results in the clinical findings seen in patients with these diseases. Phrases combining astrocytes with individual neurodegenerative disorders, for example, astrocyte and Alzheimer's disease, were also included in the search. The abstracts of retrieved citations were reviewed and prioritized by relevant content.
If brain or spinal cord cells are injured through trauma or disease, astroglial cells react by rapidly producing more glial fibrillary acidic protein. Although its function is not fully understood, glial fibrillary acidic protein is probably involved in controlling the shape, movement, and function of astroglial cells. Intermediate filaments form networks that provide support and strength to cells. Several molecules of glial fibrillary acidic protein bind together to form the type of intermediate filament found in
With this capability, glia respond to nervous system injury and disease, and can also replace brain cells lost with age. However, this stem-cell-like property of glia also implicates them in brain cancer, as nearly all cancers originating in the brain derive from types of glial cells. Glia are far from inert interstitial brain cells. Some types of glia are involved in synaptic transmission, which implicates these glial cells in many aspects of learning, memory and other types of information processing; and in nervous system dysfunction, including neurological and psychological disorders.
These glia include the oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and astrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, glia derive from the neural crest. These PNS glia include Schwann cells in nerves and satellite glial cells in ganglia. Current research involving glial cells in the human cochlea proposes that these cells are the common precursor to both mature Schwann cells and satellite glial cells. As the Greek name implies, glia are commonly known as the glue of the nervous system; however, this is not fully accurate. Neuroscience currently identifies four main functions of glial cells: 1  To surround neurons and hold them in place. 2  To supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons.
Microglia are a type of glial cell that are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, and thus act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia constitute 20% of the total glial cell population within the brain. Microglia (and astrocytes, another type of glial cells) are distributed in large non-overlapping regions throughout the brain and spinal cord. Microglia are constantly scavenging the CNS for damaged neurons, plaques, and infectious agents.

The GFAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called glial fibrillary acidic protein. This protein is a member of the intermediate filament family of proteins. Intermediate filaments form networks that provide support and strength to cells. Several molecules of glial fibrillary acidic protein bind together to form the type of intermediate filament found in astroglial cells. Astroglial cells support and nourish cells in the brain and spinal cord
