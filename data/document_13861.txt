The amounts needed in the body are not an indication of their importance. A balanced diet usually provides all of the essential minerals. The two tables below list minerals, what they do in the body (their functions), and their sources in food. 
Manganese is a trace mineral that is present in tiny amounts in the body. It is found mostly in bones, the liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Manganese helps the body form connective tissue, bones, blood clotting factors, and sex hormones. It also plays a role in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption, and blood sugar regulation. Manganese is also necessary for normal brain and nerve function.
So in summary factors that help mineral absorption include the form of the mineral ingested, small particle size, solubility, ascorbic acid, and a good intestinal state. The problem is that only 1% to 8% of the mineral supplement is absorbed by the body which makes it an inefficient way of absorbing the correct amount of minerals. Also a lot of the recipients used to bind these cheaper supplements can act as blockers in absorption.
Vitamin D and other vitamins and minerals. The way that vitamins and minerals work in your body is interconnected. How well vitamin D works depends on the amount of other vitamins and minerals that are present in your body. The other vitamins and minerals needed to help vitamin D work well are called cofactors. To get the most benefit from vitamin D, you must have other cofactors in your body. Vitamin D has a number of cofactors; the ones listed below are the most important. 1  Magnesium. 2  Vitamin K. 3  Zinc. 4  Boron. 5  Vitamin A. Doctors and scientists are still working to understand fully how different vitamins and minerals work together in your body, and how that affects your health. The Food and Nutrition Board in the United States sets Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for the amount of some
There are 103 known minerals, at least 18 of these are necessary for good health. Mineral imbalance is epidemic. Osteoporosis is on the rise in our nation, 30 million people in the US over 50 are susceptible to fractures caused by mineral deficiencies in their bones. Minerals are the catalysts that keep our ‘ battery ‘ going and hold it’s ‘ charge .’ Minerals compose about 4% of the human body. We cannot produce minerals within our bodies, so we must obtain them through our food. They ultimately come from the earth
• They help to regulate our bodies tissue growth. • Minerals provide structural and functional support for the body. There are two categories of minerals essential within the body, macro-minerals & micro-minerals. There is no one mineral deficiency, they all must be maintained in balance within the body.

We cannot produce minerals within our bodies, so we must obtain them through our food. They ultimately come from the earth
Calcium. Of all of these minerals found in the body, calcium is the main mineral, it comprises almost half of the mineral content in the body. Just 1% of the calcium in the body is actually in the blood, so blood tests are not accurate answers to just how much calcium our body truly has.

Minerals must be in a form that can make it to the cells. Minerals that are not bioavailable just get passed straight through the body. Bioavailability has a precursor which is absorption. To do any good minerals must be absorbed through the intestine walls into the blood stream. The problem is that only 1% to 8% of the mineral supplement is absorbed by the body which makes it an inefficient way of absorbing the correct amount of minerals. Also a lot of the recipients used to bind these cheaper supplements can act as blockers in
The nutrients in food give our bodies the information and materials they need to function properly. But our daily diets may not always be providing all the information our bodies need. We all know that we need to get a basic balance of nutrients every day. In other words, nutrients give our bodies instructions about how to function. In this sense, food can be seen as a source of information for the body. See examples in Food As Information. Thinking about food in this way gives us a view of nutrition that goes beyond calories or grams, good foods or bad foods.
