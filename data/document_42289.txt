Knowledge center. A Bartholin's cyst, or Bartholin's duct cyst occurs when the duct of the Bartholin's gland is blocked, resulting in the development of a fluid-filled cyst. Even though it may sometimes be caused by an infection, a Bartholin's cysts is not an infection.
Bartholin's Cyst Causes. A Bartholin's cyst develops when the duct exiting the Bartholin's gland becomes blocked. The fluid produced by the gland then accumulates, causing the gland to swell and form a cyst. An abscess occurs when a cyst becomes infected. Bartholin's abscesses can be caused by any of a number of bacteria. These include bacterial organisms that cause sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea as well as bacteria normally found in the intestinal tract, such as Escherichia coli.
Introduction. A Bartholin's cyst, also called a Bartholin's duct cyst, is a small growth just inside the opening of a woman's vagina. Cysts are small fluid-filled sacs that are usually harmless. A Bartholin's cyst can stay small and painless and may not cause any symptoms.
Experts believe that the cause of a Bartholin's cyst is a backup of fluid. Fluid may accumulate when the opening of the gland (duct) becomes obstructed, perhaps caused by infection or injury. A Bartholin's cyst can become infected, forming an abscess.
The blocked gland is called a Bartholin gland cyst. (Sometimes it's called a Bartholin duct cyst.) These cysts can range in size from a pea to a large marble. They usually grow slowly. If the Bartholin gland or duct gets infected, it's called a Bartholin gland abscess.
