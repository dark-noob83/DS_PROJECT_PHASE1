$25 per client. 5 clients per day = $125. $125 x 5 days per week = $625. $625 x 4 weeks per month = $2,500. $2,500 x 12 months per year = $30,000 per year. NB: 5 clients @ 1/2 hour each = 2 1/2 hours (lets say 3 hours). so for 3 hours work a day (not including driving). $30,000 per year gross. In Australia, personal care assistants earn about $20 per hour and work 8 hour days. The point is you will be earning twice as much for half the hours. And it gets better! You can charge between $25 - and what ever you believe is fair keeping in mind that the Government sets its Medicare rebate at just over $50. Say you charge $35 for a home visit. 5 clients @ $35 per client = $175 (gross) per day. 5 days @ $175 per day = $875 per week. 4 weeks @ $875 per week = $3,500 per month

For many pods to get paid for ROUTINE foot care they have to charge an out of pocket fee which can range from $75. - $175 per foot (and sometimes more depending on where and on who).
