Thank you for your response to our blog. When you have a fractured rib or ribs you can experience pain and disability for the upwards of 6 weeks, depending on how severely the fracture is displaced. It can be helpful to see your doctor for pain management during this time. If your ribs are more severely injured or displaced you may need to see a specialist.
1. Put ice over the fractured rib. Apply an ice pack, frozen gel pack or bag of peas from the freezer onto your rib injury for about 20 minutes every hour you are awake for the first 2 days, then reduce it to 10-20 minutes 3x daily as needed to reduce pain and swelling.
A fractured rib usually takes at least 6 weeks to heal. To help manage the pain while the fracture heals: 1  Put ice on the injured area. 2  Get extra rest. 3  Take pain medicine such as aspirin or ibuprofen. 4  Your doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medicine if over-the-counter medicines don't work.
Although broken ribs will eventually heal on their own in 1-2 months if you are relatively healthy, knowing how to treat them at home will significantly reduce your discomfort. In rare cases, fractured ribs puncture the lungs or damage other internal organs, which necessitates emergency medical treatment.
