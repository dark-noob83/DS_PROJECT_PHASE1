On average, a $600 to $900 bike will not weigh 15 pounds. It may weigh 19 to 23 pounds, but it will still be quite fast (certainly faster than your mountain bike), offer good handling, and be decked out with Shimano or Campagnolo components that will last years with proper care and maintenance. 
26lb is very light. Rider weight counts SO much more than people realize. the 220lb guys trying to shave grams off a 25lb bike have no chance against a strong 150lb rider on a 32lb bike. Everyone likes a light bike, but fitness and body weight are enormous advantages, drastically more than a couple pounds of bike. Rider weight is so much more important, as is a riders strength. I rode with buddies the other day on their ~22lb, carbon 29er xc bikes with me on my AM 30lb beast and was the fastest out of all of us. It wasn't that my bike was the lightest, it was that I've been riding forever and they haven't.
1 Take 3 pounds off your bike, pedal at a constant rate of 200 watts, and you’ll get to the top of a 7 percent climb a whole 7.5 seconds ahead of the competition. 2  A 1-pound advantage only puts you ahead by 2.5 seconds. Let’s find out. Take a hypothetical rider and have her ride two bikes up a hill at the same speed. The first bike weighs 15 pounds and the second bike will shave off the 3.21 pounds to weigh in at 11.79 pounds. For each test, we’ll have her ride at 15 mph. Everything is constant, except for the bike, so what we ought to see is a reduction in the power required to get up the hill. That’s the real test of your saving

What is the difference between a $700 bike and a $3,000 bike? They may look the same, but there are many differences. On a high-end bike, expect to get components that are even lighter, stronger and more beautiful. The superior quality of the machining and finish of higher-end components make them worry-free.
I've been asked a few times how much the Pugsley weighs compared to a normal bike. So I borrow the neighbours scales to find out. My road bike, a Dawes Ultra Galaxy comes in at 13.1 or 28.9 lbs Kg, the Genesis iOiD sits at 13.6 Kg or 30 lbs and the mighty Pugsley an interesting 19.3 Kg or 42.5 lbs. All bikes without panniers, etc
But, most weight conscious people aren't bringing their bikes down to 15 pounds because down at that weight, the handling gets very sketchy. 17 - 17.5 pounds is the normal range. The real discussion is about 1.5 to 2 pounds. The performance advantage of a lighter bike is greatest when the hill is steepest. UCI regulations limit a racing bike to about 15 pounds. What we are discussing, from a normal all-steel bike to a super-light, barely legal bike is about 4 pounds. This is what we're going crazy about, 4 pounds. Maybe a bit more with a less expensive groups.
The question truly depends on the specifics! The average adult bicycle weighs roughly 30 pounds, but this is dependent among many factors. Firstly, road bikes have a variety of weights depending on the purpose, quality, and manufacturing date. Older road bikes could weight as much as 35 or even 40 pounds. Nowadays, the everyday road cyclist owns a bicycle that weighs usually between 15 and 25 pounds.
1 If you’re having trouble telling what the difference is between the 11 pound bike and 15 pound bike, save yourself the eyestrain. 2  That’s the message. 3  Take 3 pounds off your bike, pedal at a constant rate of 200 watts, and you’ll get to the top of a 7 percent climb a whole 7.5 seconds ahead of the competition.

He further assumed a rider who can kick out 250 watts. A 160 pound rider will take 19 minutes and 21 seconds to get up the hill. Every 5 pounds added make the trip up the hill take 30 seconds longer. That means each added pound adds 6 seconds to the time it takes to get up this hill. That is only 6 seconds on a stiff, 20 minute climb. UCI regulations limit a racing bike to about 15 pounds. What we are discussing, from a normal all-steel bike to a super-light, barely legal bike is about 4 pounds. This is what we're going crazy about, 4 pounds.
