You may not like it, but we need pain. Pain acts as a warning system that protects you. Pain says, Warning, Warning....stop what you doing and do something else. For example, if you have your hand on a hot stove, pain tells you to stop touching the stove and remove your hand.
The nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord, together known as the central nervous system, and a vast array of peripheral nerves that transmit information to and from these central structures. The nervous system may be damaged by infection, injury, vascular problems, inflammation, and degeneration. However, the causes of many general nervous system disorders are not fully understood. The first article deals with pain, which is a common symptom of many disorders.
Your nervous system is made up of your brain, spinal cord, and your spinal or peripheral nerves (the nerves that extend from your spine to every area of your body). Your brain is the control center of literally every function in your body. If your brain dies, you die.
