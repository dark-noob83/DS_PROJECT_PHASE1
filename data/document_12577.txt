Adultery: In the context of Georgia divorce law, adultery is defined as sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than the spouse.
Filing Requirements. If you file for divorce on grounds of adultery, Georgia requires that you name your spouse’s paramour in your complaint. This person is a “co-respondent.” He becomes part of your legal action and you must serve him with a copy of your complaint for divorce, just as you must serve your spouse.
Defenses. Both your spouse and her paramour have the right to contest your ground of adultery in a Georgia court of law. The easiest way for either of them to do this is if you condone her affair. This means that you must immediately terminate your relationship with her when you learn of her infidelity.
Adultery is a misdemeanor crime in GA [see statute below]. Misdemeanors carry a fine of upto $1000.00 and/or a sentence of upto 6 to 12 months in jail.
Georgia’s legal definition of adultery is very specific. Your spouse’s infidelity must have involved actual intercourse with someone other than you. Homosexual sex qualifies, according to the State Bar of Georgia, if it involves penetration. Other forms of sexual contact are not adultery.
