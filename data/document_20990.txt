The weakness may progress over hours to days to involve the arms, truncal muscles, cranial nerves, and muscles of respiration. Variants of GBS may present as pure motor dysfunction or acute dysautonomia. The mean time to the clinical function nadir is 12 days, with 98% of patients reaching a nadir by 4 weeks. Trunk, bulbar, and respiratory muscles can be affected as well. Patients may be unable to stand or walk despite reasonable strength, especially when ophthalmoparesis or impaired proprioception is present. Respiratory muscle weakness with shortness of breath may be present.
