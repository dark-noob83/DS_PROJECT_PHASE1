If it costs New Jersey an average of $71,000 to care for each elderly inmate, as one study suggests, that would cost taxpayers $21.3 million -- about double the cost for the same number of younger, healthy inmates. Health care costs for older inmates skyrocket. The growing number of older prisoners represents a potential fiscal time bomb. Elderly prisoners cost more because almost all expenses related to their health care must be borne by state tax dollars.
The rising cost of care. State and federal prisons spend an estimated $16 billion taxpayer dollars a year keeping elderly convicts in the clink, Fathi said. Nearly a quarter of that price tag – roughly $3 billion taxpayer dollars annually – is devoted to providing health care to sick or drying prisoners. By the year 2030, there will be upward of 400,000 elderly prisoners — nearly a third of the projected total penal population, said Inimai Chettiar, a director at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and the co-author of the ACLU report.
At least 15% of the prisoners in 20 states are 50 or older, according to the ACLU report. In West Virginia, 20% were at least 50. The costs of confining such prisoners are about double — $68,270 per year — the $34,135 annual cost for the average younger inmate. 1 Costs of keeping aging and sick prisoners - $68,270 per year-are double that of younger, healthier inmates. 2  Some inmates languish and die before their release requests are acted on by prison authorities.
(AP). State spending on prisoner health care increased in 42 states between 2001 and 2008, with a median growth of 52 percent, according to a new report from The Pew Charitable Trusts. The primary driver of the cost spike is bigger and older prison populations. During the same period, the number of state and federal inmates age 55 and older grew from 40,200 to 77,800, a 94 percent increase. Since 2008, the number of elderly inmates has continued to grow to 121,800 in 2011.
The growing number of older prisoners like Thomas represents a potential fiscal time bomb for the state and nation: Elderly prisoners cost more because almost all expenses related to their health care must be borne by state tax dollars. Health care costs for older inmates skyrocket. The growing number of older prisoners represents a potential fiscal time bomb. Elderly prisoners cost more because almost all expenses related to their health care must be borne by state tax dollars.
The Pew Center on Research has estimated that the cost of managing an elderly prisoner is approximately $70,000 annually. This yields a per diem of $192, compared with the Department’s average healthcare cost of $10.96 per inmate per day for all facilities during Fiscal Year 2013-14. The remaining 82,209 prison population is under the age of 50, and their health care costs average approximately $2,500 per prisoner.”. “This rough analysis indicates that elderly prisoners cost four times as much as non-elderly prisoners.
Assuming hospitalization days are representative of overall prison health care costs, the elderly prison population was responsible for approximately half of the $408 million prisoner healthcare costs in 2012, which averages to $11,000 per year solely for the health care of elderly prisoners. The remaining 82,209 prison population is under the age of 50, and their health care costs average approximately $2,500 per prisoner.”. “This rough analysis indicates that elderly prisoners cost four times as much as non-
1 In Georgia, prisoners age 65 and older command an annual average medical care cost of $8,565 -- a huge leap from the annual average of $961 for inmates under age 65, according to a report by the Human Rights Watch. By the year 2030, there will be upward of 400,000 elderly prisoners — nearly a third of the projected total penal population, said Inimai Chettiar, a director at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and the co-author of the ACLU report.
Elderly more expensive. A 2012 ACLU study estimated that it costs nearly $70,000 a year to house a prisoner over 50, compared with an average of $34,135 for a younger inmate. The increase is primarily driven by much higher health care costs for the older population. Health care costs for older inmates skyrocket. The growing number of older prisoners represents a potential fiscal time bomb. Elderly prisoners cost more because almost all expenses related to their health care must be borne by state tax dollars.
