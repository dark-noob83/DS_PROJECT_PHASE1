Ground beef that’s been defrosted in the fridge can be safely kept for an additional one to two days in the refrigerator before cooking, says the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Question: I thawed some ground beef in the fridge today, planning to use it for tonight’s dinner. But now my plans have changed.
1 How long does ground beef last in the fridge once it is cooked? 2  Cooked ground beef will usually stay good for 3 to 4 days in the fridge and 3 months in the freezer.
In the refrigerator, ground beef, stew meat, and steaks may thaw within a day. Bone-in parts and whole roasts may take 2 days or longer. Once the raw ground beef thaws, it will be safe in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. All other cuts of beef can be refrigerated safely for 3 to 5 additional days before cooking. During this time, if you decide not to use the beef, you can safely refreeze it without cooking.
And since you thawed the ground beef in the fridge, you can also safely refreeze it within that same timeframe, says the USDA. None of this would apply, on the other hand, if you had thawed the ground beef in the microwave or in cold water.
1 Ground beef that has been defrosted in the fridge can be kept for an additional 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator before cooking; ground beef that was thawed in the microwave or in cold water should be cooked immediately.
How long it took to freeze will have a bearing on it, too. If the ground beef was 3 days old when frozen, you might try cooking it from frozen. If it was freshly ground when frozen, the thawed meat will likely be good for 2 days.
