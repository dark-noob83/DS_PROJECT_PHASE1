Prime rate or prime lending rate is a term applied in many countries to reference an interest rate used by banks. The term originally indicated the interest rate at which banks lent to favored customers—i.e., those with good credit—but this is no longer always the case.
The interest rate that commercial banks charge their most credit-worthy customers. Generally a bank's best customers consist of large corporations. The prime interest rate, or prime lending rate, is largely determined by the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate which banks lend to one another.
Significance. The interest charged on many variable-rate loans is indexed to the prime rate printed in the Wall Street Journal, as is known as the WSJ Prime Rate.. That means that the interest rates on those loans rise and fall in tandem with the prime rate. For example, if a loan agreement states that the interest rate will be the WSJ Prime Rate plus 4 points, adjusted once a year, if the WSJ Prime Rate is 3.25 percent, the loan's initial interest rate will be 7.25 percent.
In the United States, the prime rate runs approximately 300 basis points (or 3 percentage points) above the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans made to fulfill reserve funding requirements.
Prime rate (or prime interest rate). The prime rate used to be defined as the interest rate at which banks lend to their most creditworthy (prime) customers. Now, it is simply an index that is 3 percentage points above the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve. Banks set their own rates, but tend to move in unison.
