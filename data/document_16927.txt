Twenty percent of your total calories from fat equates to 400 calories per day. To calculate how much fat you should consume in a day first, you need to know how many calories you should eat which we just covered in the above section. If you eat the right amount of calories, and the correct proportions of carbs, protein and fat, you’ll not only be healthy, but you’ll curb cravings, feel less hungry and lose excess weight quickly. Fad diets often require people to reduce entire groups of nutrients, including fats or carbohydrates, to dangerous lows.
Sedentary women between the ages of 19 and 30 should consume between 1,800 and 2,000 calories per day. Carbohydrates should account for 810 to 1,300 of your calories each day. As there are 4 calories in 1 gram of carbohydrates, this amounts to 202.5 to 325 grams of carbohydrates per day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, you should consume 1,800 calories per day and 202.5 to 292.5 grams of carbohydrates. The number of calories that a woman should consume each day varies with her age and level of physical activity. Regardless of these differences, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates account for 45 to 65 percent of your total calories.
As a general rule, between 10 percent and 15 percent of your total calories should come from protein. So, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, at least 200 should come from protein, or about 50 grams. You should try to eat around one gram of protein per one kilogram of body weight, or around 0.4 grams per pound. An easier way to figure this out in your head is to take your weight, divide it in half, and subtract 10. If you eat the right amount of calories, and the correct proportions of carbs, protein and fat, you’ll not only be healthy, but you’ll curb cravings, feel less hungry and lose excess weight quickly. Fad diets often require people to reduce entire groups of nutrients, including fats or carbohydrates, to dangerous lows.
Moderately active women between the ages of 19 and 30 should try to eat 2,000 to 2,200 calories per day. As carbohydrates should account for 900 to 1,430 of these calories, you should eat 225 to 357.5 grams of carbs each day. If you are between the ages of 31 and 50, these values decrease to 2,000 calories and between 225 and 325 grams of carbs every day. The number of calories that a woman should consume each day varies with her age and level of physical activity. Regardless of these differences, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates account for 45 to 65 percent of your total calories.
Research shows Americans eat too much added sugar (22 teaspoons a day, which translates to about 350 calories!) and not enough fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods. Rather than focusing on the amount of carbs you eat, concentrate on increasing the quality of the sources of carbs you eat. Carb grams/meal range (3 meals per day): 86–151 grams. *Based on 45%–65% of calories from carbohydrate. Note: Men who are under 65 years of age, moderate to large in stature, at a healthy weight, and get a lot of exercise may need more calories and grams of
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day. You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label.
A person who eats 2,000 calories per day should eat 6 ounces of grain foods daily. At least half (3 ounces) of the grain foods eaten should be whole grains. Approximately one ounce of grain foods counts as a serving. This is about one slice of bread, one roll, or one small muffin. A person who eats 2,000 calories daily should have 2 ½ cups of vegetables a day. This might include a half-cup each of broccoli, tomatoes, cauliflower, and a sweet potato. Aim for lots of color on your plate as a way to get a variety of vegetables each day.
A person who consumes 2,000 calories daily should eat about 5½ ounces of protein each day. You can get protein from seafood, lean meat and poultry, as well as eggs, beans and peas, tofu, nuts, and seeds. A person who eats 2,000 calories daily should have 2 ½ cups of vegetables a day. This might include a half-cup each of broccoli, tomatoes, cauliflower, and a sweet potato. Aim for lots of color on your plate as a way to get a variety of vegetables each day.
1 First you figured out how many calories you need to eat per day for your specific goal (losing fat, building muscle, or maintaining your current weight). 2  From there you figured out where those calories should come from each day by calculating your ideal daily intake of protein, fat and just now, carbs. And, since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, you’d just need to divide this left over amount of calories by 4 to figure out exactly how many grams of carbs you’d need to eat each day.
