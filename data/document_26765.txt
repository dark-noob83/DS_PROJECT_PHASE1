1 Resurfacing with a pebble or quartz aggregate finish (like PebbleTec or Diamond Brite can cost $3,500-$8,500 for a rough finish or about $5,000-$10,000 for a polished finish, depending on the style and color.
I resurfaced my 28,000 gallon gunite pool in 2002 with a pebble Tech finish, ceramic tile at the water line and bullnose coping. The project cost me $13,000. However, I am currently waiting for that same company to come out to mu pool and explain why the coping is cracking and falling apart...
The cost to resurface a gunite pool depends on your location, the  size of your pool, and exactly what you want done. On average, as  of 2014 it cost between $8,000 and $15, … 000 to resurface a pool.
If cost is an issue, you might  want to consider a below ground pool with a liner rather than a  gunite pool. Add a spa, decking, and high end equipment and you can  easily be up in the $40,000 to $50,000 range, depending on size.

Once I start using my pool in the hot summer months, the chlorine output of a 25,000 gallon salt cell won’t be able to keep up with the chlorine demand of my pool. I recommend getting a cell that is rated for a pool at least 1/3 larger than your pool size.
1 Salt water pools use a chlorine generator to convert salt to chlorine through electrolysis. 2  A generator requiring the addition of salt is most convenient for the pool system. 3  Salt water pools convert salt and water, using an electric current, into chlorine and hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide.
