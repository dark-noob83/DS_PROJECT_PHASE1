Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O → 12H2O + 6 CO2. The energy released is trapped in the form of ATP for use by all the energy-consuming activities of the cell. 1  glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid.
The primary role of oxygen in cellular respiration is to. A) yield energy in the form of ATP as it is passed down the respiratory chain. B) act as an acceptor for electrons and hydrogen, forming water. C) combine with carbon, forming CO2. D) combine with lactate, forming pyruvate.
The breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water occurs during  glycolysis and aerobic respiration in cellular respiration. The  carbon dioxide is a waste product.
The process of respiration produces energy for organisms by combining glucose with oxygen from the air. During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen are changed into energy and carbon dioxide. Therefore, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere during the process of cellular respiration. glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy. Respiration is also the process by which once-living (organic) organisms are decomposed.
