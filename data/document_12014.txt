With the Chevy Volt Charging, I would pay $56 – which amounts to a marginal electricity cost of $32 per month. This is assuming I put 20 miles of electricity into the car per day, or 600 miles a month (216 KwH). So $32 divided by 600 miles gets me 5.3 cents per mile or a marginal electricity cost or 14.8 cents per KwH. In my analysis, I assume that I will put 20 miles of electric range into the battery on an average day. As such, given the EPA estimates of 36 KwH per 100 miles, you will need to put roughly 7.2 KwH into the Chevy Volt per day.
COST OF OPERATION: The Volt can drive for 40 miles on a single full electric charge of it’s battery pack. It is a known fact that the battery pack will be allowed to drain down from 80% to 30% before the gas-generator kicks in. Since the battery pack holds 16 KWH of energy, that means 8 KWH will get you 40 miles. Clearly for 40 miles of driving at present gas and electric prices, there will be a very significant cost savings. Of course, there is some uncertainty of where these numbers will be when the Volt arrives in 2010. [ad#post_ad-left-1-1]After the first 40 miles, the combustion engine generator will kick in.
To see the numbers for the current year click here. If we use the average, the cost to recharge the Volt will be $0.85, and the range for 2007 will be from 48 cents to $1.34 depending where you live.

If electricity costs $0.11 per kWh and the vehicle consumes 34 kWh to travel 100 miles, the cost per mile is about $0.04. If electricity costs $0.11 per kilowatt-hour, charging an all-electric vehicle with a 70-mile range (assuming a fully depleted 24 kWh battery) will cost about $2.64 to reach a full charge. This cost is about the same as operating an average central air conditioner for about 6 hours. General Motors estimates the annual energy use of the Chevy Volt will be 2,520 kilowatt-hours, which is less than that required for a typical water heater or central air conditioning. To compare the fueling costs of individual models of conventional and plug-in vehicles, see the Vehicle Cost Calculator.
Additionally, the figures given for the Chevy Volt above are calculated using a price of $1.16 per kwh (kilowatt hour) of electricity. Although electricity costs vary from place to place, nowhere in the United States is the average residential retail price of electricity anywhere close to $1.16 per kwh. As well, Car and Driver observed that the 25 mile electric-range figure for the Volt was not an average mileage figure, but rather the product of worst-case scenario driving: GM's recently revised electric-range claim is 25 to 50 miles, and we ended up in the low to middle of that band.
The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned so I looked up what I pay for electricity. I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. - 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery.

The cost per mile for gas and electric usage in my 2012 Volt is currently 6.8 cents. 20230 miles driven and not one oil change needed yet. At my current rate I will need to change the oil at the mandatory 24 month interval, rather than because of depleted oil life. Yep 45 cents $0.36/kwh service charge + at least $0.0857 usage. http://www.lipower.org/pdfs/account/rates_resi.pdf. So using the above cited formula a Chevy Volt would cost $166 /month v $160/month for gasoline (gas is $4/gal today).
The cost to charge your Volt is based on 2 numbers. How much electricity you used how much it costs for a unit of electricity. Because many are not familiar with the terminology, I have a little table below to compare the two. Yep 45 cents $0.36/kwh service charge + at least $0.0857 usage. http://www.lipower.org/pdfs/account/rates_resi.pdf.

The Volt comes in as costing $3,235 more to own than a Leaf. Remove the $7,500 tax credit from the Leaf and Volt, and the Volt comes in as the most expensive to own at $39,185 (Prius = $36,920, Leaf $35,950). Also with the Volt there is a huge assumption you make on a static spreadsheet of how much fuel will cost. Prius costs more as well…. http://gm-volt.com/2013/12/13/edmunds-volts-5-year-ownership-cost-is-much-cheaper-than-prius/. That’s a great dissection of the cost there! The only things I don’t see is what percentage of the volt’s miles are in EV mode.
At that rate, my calculations indicate that the cost to operate a Volt for 15,000 miles per year is not a whole lot lower than my 25 mpg four cylinder Malibu. On the other hand, if I install a second electric meter, the off peak rate for the charger will be $0.12 per kilowatt hour. In my analysis, I assume that I will put 20 miles of electric range into the battery on an average day. As such, given the EPA estimates of 36 KwH per 100 miles, you will need to put roughly 7.2 KwH into the Chevy Volt per day.
