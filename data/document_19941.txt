About 100,000 years ago, the most recent of these eruptions formed the Mammoth Knolls, low hills just north of the Town of Mammoth Lakes. Mammoth Mountain, a young volcano on the rim of Long Valley Caldera, was built by numerous eruptions between 220,000 and 50,000 years ago. Volcanoes in the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain, which extends from just south of Mammoth Mountain to the north shore of Mono Lake, have erupted often over the past 40,000 years. During the last 5,000 years, an eruption has broken out somewhere along this chain every 250 to 700 years. The Inyo Craters and nearby lava domes were formed by a series of small to moderate eruptions 550 to 600 years ago, and the most recent eruptions along the volcanic chain took place about 250 years ago at Paoha Island in Mono Lake.
Water partially fills a phreatic crater formed on the northern flank of Mammoth Mountain, the snow-covered peak in the background. This and other nearby craters were formed by explosive eruptions about 700 years ago that were distinct from nearby eruptions at the southern end of the Inyo Craters. Geological Summary. Mammoth Mountain, a trachydacitic lava-dome complex, lies on the SW topographic rim of Long Valley caldera. The 3369-m-high volcano lies west of the structural rim of the caldera and is considered to represent a magmatic system distinct from Long Valley caldera and the Inyo Craters (Hildreth, 2004).
Mammoth Mountain, a Pleistocene trachydacitic lava-dome complex constructed on the SW topographic rim of the Long Valley caldera between about 200,000 and 50,000 years ago, forms the broad peak on the horizon. Geological Summary. Mammoth Mountain, a trachydacitic lava-dome complex, lies on the SW topographic rim of Long Valley caldera. The 3369-m-high volcano lies west of the structural rim of the caldera and is considered to represent a magmatic system distinct from Long Valley caldera and the Inyo Craters (Hildreth, 2004).
For the ski area, see Mammoth Mountain Ski Area. Mammoth Mountain is a lava dome complex west of the town of Mammoth Lakes, California, in the Inyo National Forest of Madera and Mono Counties. It is home to a large ski area on the Mono County side. Mammoth Mountain was formed in a series of eruptions that ended 57,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain is home to the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, founded by Dave McCoy in 1953. Mammoth is the highest ski resort in California and is notable for the unusually large amount of snowfall it receives compared to other Eastern Sierra peaks—about 400 annually—due to its location in a low gap in the Sierra crest.
Summary. Quick Facts. Mammoth Mountain, a lava-dome complex, lies on the southwest topographic rim of Long Valley Caldera. The 3,369-m (11,053 ft) high volcano lies west of the structural rim of the caldera and is considered to represent a magmatic system distinct from Long Valley Caldera and the Mono-Inyo Craters. The latest magmatic eruptions at Mammoth Mountain took place about 57,000 years ago. 
Mammoth Mountain rises to the SE of Minaret Summit. The 3369-m-high volcano formed between about 111,000 and 57,000 years ago and consists of a series of trachydacitic and rhyodacitic lava flows and lava domes. Geological Summary. Mammoth Mountain, a trachydacitic lava-dome complex, lies on the SW topographic rim of Long Valley caldera. The 3369-m-high volcano lies west of the structural rim of the caldera and is considered to represent a magmatic system distinct from Long Valley caldera and the Inyo Craters (Hildreth, 2004).

The volcanic region is one of the most seismically active in a mostly quiet network of 17 volcanoes throughout California. 
Ask Dr. Kaye! Technically, Mammoth Mountain is not an active volcano. According to the Smithsonian’s Global Volcanism Program, “active” is a description reserved for volcanoes that have erupted in the last 10,000 years (the Holocene), and the last eruption from Mammoth Mountain was ~57,000 years ago1. Mammoth Mountain is just one part of a huge volcanic system called the Long Valley Caldera — a giant hole in the earth stretching from just northwest of Bishop, California from Lake Crowley to Glass Mountain (Figure 1).
Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. The chain stretches 25 miles (40 km) from the northwest shore of Mono Lake to the south of Mammoth Mountain. The Mono Lake Volcanic Field forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one cinder cone volcano on its northwest shore.
