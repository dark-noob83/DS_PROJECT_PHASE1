To research topics, begin with your Thaumonomicon and (for primary topics) some paper, and click on the desired icon. For primary research, one piece of paper will be used, and you will gain a research note for the topic, which you can then insert in the research table for the minigame. You can scan many different things: blocks, mobs and other entities, nodes, and even dropped items. For most things (mobs, entities, or items) you will gain research points equal to the target's aspects. For a node, you will gain points equal to about 1/10 of the node's strength in each aspect.

Mobs and objects from other mods may also have aspects: These can be specified by the mod, or supplied by a bridge mod connecting it to Thaumcraft. For many crafted items, Thaumcraft itself can calculate the aspects from their recipe, even if the mod itself has not specified them. However, vis of compound aspects (found in some nodes) cannot be directly used: Whenever it is extracted or transmitted, each point of a compound aspect is replaced by a point of one of the primal aspects the compound is ultimately composed of. Essentia, in liquid or crystalline form, can appear in any aspect.
