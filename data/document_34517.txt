Continental crust is also less dense than oceanic crust, whose density is about 2.9 g/cm 3. Continental crust is considerably thicker than oceanic crust, mostly 25 to 70 km versus the average thickness of the oceanic crust of around 7–10 km. About 40% of Earth's surface is now overlaid by continental crust. Continental crust makes up about 70% of the volume of Earth's crust.

The mantle which surrounds the core and has a thickness of 2900 kilometers. The crust floats on top of the mantle. It is composed of basalt rich oceanic crust and granitic rich continental crust. Figure 10h-1: Layers beneath the Earth's surface.
Beneath the oceans we find a crust that is on average 7 kilometers thick and composed mainly of basalt. Oceanic crust also has a density of about 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter. The continent's are composed of mainly granitic rock whose thickness varies between 10 and 70 kilometers. The thickest portions of continental crust are found under the various mountain ranges. Continental crust is also lighter than oceanic crust having a density of about 2.7
