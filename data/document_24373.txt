You typically take insulin glulisine within 15 minutes before a meal or within 20 minutes after you begin eating. With insulin lispro, you administer your injection within 15 minutes before a meal or immediately afterward. If you take insulin aspart, your doctor will likely advise you to take the drug 5 to 10 minutes before meals.
If you take Regular insulin or a longer-acting insulin, you should generally take it 15 to 30 minutes before a meal. If you take insulin lispro (brand name: Humalog), which works very quickly, you should generally take it less than 15 minutes before you eat.
Lantus is a basal rate insulin and it last 24 hours. It's usually given once a day at bedtime. It is not like the shorter acting insulins like novolog or lispro that should be given before meals. I'm not sure why the md ordered 2 times/day.
Since the first rapid-acting insulin, insulin lispro (brand name Humalog), came on the market in 1996, most diabetes experts have recommended taking it within 15 minutes of starting a meal (any time between 15 minutes before starting to eat to 15 minutes after starting to eat).
There are two major types of insulin taken before meals, rapid acting and short acting. Rapid acting insulins include lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (NovoLog), and insulin glulisine (Apidra). Itâ€™s generally best to inject these insulins up to 15 minutes before you plan to eat.
Another diabetes myth just bit the dust: the idea that pre-meal (bolus) injections of regular human insulin should be given thirty minutes before eating. This is a myth that I grew up with, and one that I had religiously taught my insulin-using patients back in the days before insulin analogs became available.
You and your doctor should discuss when and how you will take your insulin. Each person's treatment is different. Some people who use regular insulin take it 30 to 60 minutes before a meal. Some people who use rapid-acting insulin take it just before they eat.
