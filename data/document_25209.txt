Abreu says about three quarters of his patients aged 15 to 55 benefit from ketamine. Older patients have a lower response rate. The initial six infusions cost $3,800, the beneficial effects of which last anywhere from 3 to 5 weeks for some patients, and up to 12 weeks for others. Patients return as needed for single boosters, which cost $600. Because the FDA has not approved ketamine for this use, insurance doesn't cover it.
I was pleased to hear of the relatively low cost per infusion at Princeton. I am on the other side of the U.S. and many clinics offer ketamine infusions for treating depression at significantly higher costs. Many clinics, even “non-profit” clinics, are charging well over $1,000 per treatment.
In the US, doctors typically charge $400-800 per infusion. That’s a lot of money, but it’s consistent with the cost of similar procedures. Unfortunately, insurance doesn’t cover ketamine therapy, so the patient must bear the full cost.
Patients who have been diagnosed with treatment resistant depression are candidates for ketamine infusion therapy. This includes patients with major depressive disorders, post-partum depression, bi-polar depression and severe anxiety states.
The treatment of severe depression is more difficult and requires a higher level of care, such as ECT, TMS, and now ketamine therapy. Ketamine infusion therapy is reserved for those patients with severe depression that is considered otherwise treatment resistant.
