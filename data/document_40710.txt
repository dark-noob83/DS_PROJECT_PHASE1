Paddle Board Size. No matter how you are using a stand up paddle board, this one rule holds true: the bigger you are, the bigger board you'll need. Most 1st time paddlers start out with a board in the 10'6-12' range. But the length of the SUP is not always the best indication of how floaty a board will be.
As a general rule, add 8 inches to your overall height (or throw a shaka overhead). The chart below is based on 8 inches. We provide a range because, depending on technique, board, water conditions, and the type of paddling you intend to do, you might prefer a slightly different measurement. For surf, we recommend 6-8. For flat water, 8-10. For racing 10-12.
