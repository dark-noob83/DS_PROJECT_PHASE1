Cheetahs are known to consume large amounts of food in a single day such as cats living in the Etosha National Park (Namibia), eat up to 10 kg of food in just two hours. They also stay with their prey for about 11 hours. Other predators like hyenas and lions are not present in large number in Etosha.
Known for being the world’s fastest land animal, the cheetah is a large feline that can run up to 75 miles per hour in short bursts to cover distances up to 1,600 feet and accelerate to over 60 miles per hour within just three seconds!
This article will guide you toward a better understanding of cheetahs diet. Cheetah, the only wild cat that is aerodynamically built for the speed, is capable to accelerate from 0 – 100 km/h within just three seconds. Though in short bursts, cheetahs are adept to run at a speed of 120 – 125 km/h.

The cheetah then tries to sneak within 50 yards of its prey before attacking, since a cheetah can go its top speed for only about 300 yards.
Since the animals can reach top speeds in no time, cheetahs have a slender body frame that is both lightweight and aerodynamic. Averaging a shoulder height of 30 inches, most cheetahs are between 110 to 140 pounds on their small stature.
Furthermore, cheetahs may eat rabbits, birds, hares, antelopes, and warthogs. Since water can be very scarce in its native land, cheetahs have the ability to survive with just one drink every three or four days.
When desperate, cheetahs will also occasionally eat impalas, birds, rabbits, and the babies of animals like the warthog, kudu, sable, and oryx. They not only catch food fast, they eat it as fast as they can as well.
