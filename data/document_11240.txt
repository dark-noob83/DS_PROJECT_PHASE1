­Fat, or adipose tissue, is found in several places in your body. Generally, fat is found underneath your skin (subcutaneous fat). There's also some on top of each of your kidneys. In addition to fat tissue, some fat is stored in the liver, and an even smaller amount in muscle. Where fat is concentrated in your body depends upon whet her you are a man or woman: 1  An adult man tends to carry body fat in his chest, abdomen and buttocks, producing an apple shape
Most of the studies relate to human biology, but researchers such as Holick, Ferguson and Gehrmann in the United States are gathering evidence that the process is very similar in reptile skin.9,14,15,16,24 A simplified animated diagram (Figure 1, below) illustrates the vitamin D pathway. In humans, that which is not hydroxylated to calcediol in the liver is taken up into body fat, where it is apparently stored 23 but we are not aware of any studies ascertaining whether such storage takes place in reptiles, or if it does, how long such a store might last.
Giant meal worms should be stored in a bedding such as our worm chow, which they will eat until it becomes a fine dust, at which point it should be discarded and fresh worm chow should be added, in addition to the bedding small amounts of fruits and vegetables can be added for moisture such as potato, apple, or carrots.

Best Answer: Reptiles do not use body fat to generate heat, but they _do_ store energy as fat and use it when food supply is low, or, in the case of females, to provide nutritive substances for their eggs during the breeding season. Geckoes, for instance, accumulate fat on the basal portion of their tails. Report Abuse. Reptiles do have body fat, but they do not use it for heat. They are ectotherms (the term cold blooded is no longer used), meaning that they maintain their body heat using the environment. However, some reptiles do generate their own body heat through shivering, but they are not true endotherms.
Obesity is a common problem in many reptiles and amphibians kept in captivity. Many species are overfed because of owners ignorance of natural feeding intervals and of food types commonly eaten in the wild. Foods: Vitamin A is found in dark green and yellow vegetables and yellow fruits, such as broccoli spinach, turnip greens, carrots, squash, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, cantaloupe, and apricots, and for non-herbivorous species vitamin A can be obtained from animal sources such as liver and whole eggs.
The Gila monster is the largest lizard in the United States, and one of the few species of venomous lizard in the world. It has a stocky body with a large head and a short, fat tail. The skin consists of many round, bony scales, a feature that was common amongst the dinosaurs but is unusual in today's reptiles. The majority of the Gila monster's range is in western and southern Arizona, south to southern Sonora in Mexico, although populations are also found in restricted areas of California, Nevada, Utah and New Mexico.
Reptiles arose over 300,000,000 years ago, having evolved from a salamander-like ancestor. They represent a completion of the transition from life in water to a fully terrestrial lifestyle (although some reptiles have returned to the water). Reptiles exhibit some remarkable adaptations. Tails of lizards, for instance, are used for many purposes. The fat Gila monster of the Sonoran desert of North America uses its plump tail to store energy in the form of fat. African chameleons use their prehensile tail as a fifth limb to wrap around branches
Waterproof skin and a water-resistant egg means that reptiles can live in places and ways that amphibians can’t. There are over 8,700 currently recognized species, a large majority of which belong to the group Squamata, which includes the lizards, snakes, and worm-like amphisbaenians.
