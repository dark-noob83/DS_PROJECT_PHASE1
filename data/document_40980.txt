30 minutes before the end of the cooking time remove the prime rib roast from the oven and check the internal temperature. For the roast to be rare the internal temperature should be 120°F to 125°F but remove from the oven when it is 115°F to 120°F and allow to stand for 20 minutes. 1 Cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. 2  Remove every 30 minutes and turn the roast in the marinade. 3  Remove from the refrigerator and allow the prime rib to set out for approximately two hours before cooking. 4  Allow it to reach room temperature before placing in the oven.
4 Place the roast fat side up and rib bones down in a roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, making sure that the thermometer isn't touching a bone. 5 After browning the roast at a 500°F temperature in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. To figure out the total cooking time, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare. A full rack will not fit in my oven, so when I’m feeding a crowd, I cut the roast in half (3 ribs on one roast and 4 ribs on the other) and cook them in separate ovens. As for estimating how big a roast you’ll need, the butchers I’ve talked to say to estimate 2 people for every rib.
Roast in oven until thermometer registers 115°-120°F for rare or 125°-130°F for medium. (The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise after you take the roast out of the oven.). Check the temperature of the roast using a meat thermometer 30 to 45 minutes before you expect the roast to be done. For example, with a 10 pound roast, you would expect 2 1/2 hours of total cooking time (15 minutes at 500° and 2 1/4 hours at 325°). A full rack will not fit in my oven, so when I’m feeding a crowd, I cut the roast in half (3 ribs on one roast and 4 ribs on the other) and cook them in separate ovens. As for estimating how big a roast you’ll need, the butchers I’ve talked to say to estimate 2 people for every rib.
Prime Rib Roast (standing rib roast), at room temperature (very important) 2 tablespoons butter, room temperature. Preparation: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Pat the room-temperature standing rib roast (prime rib roast) dry with paper towels or napkins. Smear the cut ends only of the roast with the butter. The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit.
1 Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 2  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at 450°F, then turn the oven to 325°F for the rest of the cooking time. 3  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. 1 Preheat oven to 450°F. 2  Pat the rib roast dry with a paper towel or napkin. 3  Smear the cut ends of the roast with the butter. 4  Place the roast (ribs down or fat side up) in roasting pan. 5

1 After 20 minutes of high heat cooking reduce heat to 350°F and continue to roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes OR until the meat thermometer reads 130°F for rare doneness OR 140°F for medium-rare doneness, that is the way a prime rib really should be served, check your roast after 1 hour cooking time. 1 While the roast is resting prepare the au jus; place the roasting pan on top of the stove over high heat. 2  Add in the wine; cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring and scraping any brown bits. 3  Add in the beef stock; cook and reduce the juice by half (this might take about 20 minutes). 4  Add salt and pepper to taste.
1 1 1/2 tsp. salt. 2  1/2 tsp. pepper. 3  Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly. 4  Using a fork, poke holes throughout the roast. 5  Place the prime rib in a dish or pan with sides. 6  Do not use plastic. 7  Pour the marinade over the meat. 8  Cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. 1 Cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. 2  Remove every 30 minutes and turn the roast in the marinade. 3  Remove from the refrigerator and allow the prime rib to set out for approximately two hours before cooking. 4  Allow it to reach room temperature before placing in the oven.
Sear the rib roast (prime rib) for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do Not Cover the roast. The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes. If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher. So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit.
