Astronomers estimate that the average distance between two asteroids in the asteroid belt is about 600,000 miles (966,000 km). This is about 2.5 times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. That is a lot of space between two neighboring asteroids!
Because the asteroid belt is between the Mars and Jupiter orbits, it is around 2.2 to 3.2 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun – which is approximately 329,115,316 to 478,713,186 km. The average distance between objects is a massive 600,000 miles.
The asteroid belt contains more than 200 asteroids larger than 60 miles wide. Scientists estimate that there are more than 750,000 asteroids in the belt wider than 3/5 mile. There are millions of smaller asteroids. The average distance between asteroids in the main belt is about 600,000 miles. Ceres, the largest and most massive, is 590 miles wide. It contains almost one-third of the total mass of all the
The Asteroid Belt is located in an area of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. That places it between 2.2 and 3.2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. The belt is about 1 AU thick. The average distance between objects in the Asteroid Belt is quite large. If you could stand on an asteroid and look around, the next one would be too far away to see very well.

Confidence votes 6. Unlike old science fiction movies which gives you the impression that asteroids are close together, the average distance between asteroids is approximately 1 million km. If you were to travel through the asteroid belt, the chance of encountering an asteroid is next to nothing.
