For overall chronic disease risk reduction and Type 2 diabetes management, the goal is 150 minutes per week or about 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week. That would be about 3500 - 4000 steps for someone who can walk at a pace of 3.5 - 4 MPH. If you are truly sedentary now (e.g. you get 2000 or fewer total steps per day, including exercise), then don't aim to walk 10,000 steps tomorrow. Most of us walk briskly at about 3.5 miles per hour which takes about 17 minutes per mile or about 85 minutes for 5 miles. The faster your pace (MPH), the faster you can walk the 5 miles. If you walk at a pace of 4 MPH, then you will take 15 minutes to walk one mile or 11/4 hours to walk 5 miles.
Other ideas include wearing a pedometer to track how many steps you take per day (health experts recommend shooting for 10,000 steps per day) and working with a personal trainer (double up with a friend to lower the cost) to create an exercise routine. 
That’s because the 10,000-steps-a-day recommendation has nothing to do with sedentary, fast-food-drenched circa-2015 America. Rather, the recommendation first popped up in a very different food and environment: 1960s Japan. But moving from 2,500 steps a day, say, to 5,000, is a small but important victory for people who don’t get any exercise, and can have important health ramifications. “We know that you get the biggest bang for your buck by just moving from a sedentary state up a little bit,” she said.
Those gadgets are actually pedometers, and many wearers check their numbers of steps each day in the hopes of reaching 10,000 -- equal to about five miles. The average person might log a third or half that many in one day, studies say. There's little scientific backing behind the goal of taking 10,000 steps a day. 
They have lost much of their thoracic extension and are bent forward shuffling along. An excellent book that can help in this area is Natural Posture for Pain-Free Living by Kathleen Porter. Many People Don’t Get Close to 10,000 Steps a Day Taking 10,000 daily steps means you’ve walked about five miles or 9 kilometers. Many people do not get close to reaching this goal, which is why fitness trackers can be so useful. According to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), the average person only walks between 3,000 and 4,000 steps per day. 
Experts say that while 10,000 steps a day is a good number to reach, any amount of activity beyond what you're currently doing will likely benefit your health. The origins of the 10,000-steps recommendation aren't exactly scientific. If you normally walk about 5,000 steps a day, getting in an extra 30-minute, brisk walk into your day would take you to about 8,000 steps, Tudor-Locke said. The average U.S. adult walks about 5,900 steps daily, she said.
Share. If you pluck someone off the street, whether in New York or Wichita or Seattle or Sacramento, and ask them how many steps people should aim for per day in order to get enough physical activity, they’ll probably tell you 10,000. But moving from 2,500 steps a day, say, to 5,000, is a small but important victory for people who don’t get any exercise, and can have important health ramifications. “We know that you get the biggest bang for your buck by just moving from a sedentary state up a little bit,” she said.
How long will it take you to walk 10,000 steps? Most of us walk briskly at about 3.5 miles per hour which takes about 17 minutes per mile or about 85 minutes for 5 miles. The faster your pace (MPH), the faster you can walk the 5 miles. If you walk at a pace of 4 MPH, then you will take 15 minutes to walk one mile or 11/4 hours to walk 5 miles. If you walk 5 MPH (which is a jog for most folks), then it will take 12 minutes to walk one mile or 1 hour to walk 5 miles.
Set a goal -- 10,000 steps per day is highly recommended -- and then make it your mission to beat it. If 10,000 is daunting at first, work from a number you feel comfortable with and increase your steps by 500 each week until you get to 10,000. 
Instead, the agency recommends adults engage in 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, such as brisk walking. To meet the CDC's recommendation, you need to walk about 7,000 to 8,000 steps a day, Tudor-Locke said. If you normally walk about 5,000 steps a day, getting in an extra 30-minute, brisk walk into your day would take you to about 8,000 steps, Tudor-Locke said. The average U.S. adult walks about 5,900 steps daily, she said.
