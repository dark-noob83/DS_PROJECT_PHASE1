Artificial insemination is often used in animals to multiply the possible offspring of a prized animal and for the breeding of endangered.....

Typically a statistical procedure is used to rank animals based on their estimated breeding values for traits of economic importance. The statistical procedures used allow ranking animals across herds or flocks, provided the animals in different herds or flocks have relatives in common.
The length of a controlled breeding season varies depending on factors such as the marketing objective, size of the operation, and personal preference. Some controlled breeding seasons last only a few weeks whereas others last several months. How to Convert to a Controlled Breeding Season. Beef cattle producers who use year-round breeding and would like to convert to a 90-day controlled breeding season can do so in a three-to four-year program.
First Year. To begin converting from a year-round breeding season to a defined, controlled breeding season, the last day of the breeding season must be determined. On this day, remove bulls from the cow herd and exclude them for six months. How to Convert to a Controlled Breeding Season. Beef cattle producers who use year-round breeding and would like to convert to a 90-day controlled breeding season can do so in a three-to four-year program.
Fitness traits are especially at risk with this breeding scheme. Selective breeding through controlled mating enables farmers to breed animals that are more resistant to the impacts of climate change, such as sudden changes in temperature, prolonged droughts or the appearance of new diseases. However, in general controlled breeding is a low-cost technology. If stones are locally available and can be used to build the mating pens, an average investment would come to around US$ 30. In areas with clay soils, adobe bricks may be used, at an average cost of US$ 90.
Various methods for selective breeding exist, from high-tech and costly processes such as in-vitro fertilisation or genetic engineering to more simple low-cost techniques that rely on the selection and controlled mating of animals based on observable characteristics. 
Breeding is the reproduction that is producing of offspring, usually animals or plants: 1  Breeding in the wild, the natural process of reproduction in the animal kingdom. 2  Animal husbandry, through selected specimens such as dogs, horses, and rabbits. 3  Plant breeding, through selected specimens such as trees. 
Selective breeding is used to bring out certain traits in offspring. Dogs are a good example of this. Some varieties of plants are bred this way as well to bring out good qual … ities, like cross pollination. 1 The Definition of Selective Breeding Selective breeding, or artificial selection, is the process of breeding animals or plants to get particular traits or characteristics. 2  In the animal world, breeds of animals 3  ….

In selective breeding the traits that the offspring inheirits is controlled by the person who is doing the breeding. For example if a chihuahua breeder is looking to make smal … ler dogs, they are gonna breed two small dogs with the hope that the puppies will inheirit their parents traits. 1 The Definition of Selective Breeding Selective breeding, or artificial selection, is the process of breeding animals or plants to get particular traits or characteristics. 2  In the animal world, breeds of animals 3  ….

breeding. n. 1. the process of bearing offspring; reproduction. 2. (Genetics) the process of producing plants or animals by sexual reproduction. 3. the result of good training, esp the knowledge of correct social behaviour; refinement: a man of breeding. 4. a person's line of descent: his breeding was suspect. 5. (Nuclear Physics) physics a process occurring in a nuclear reactor as a result of which more fissionable material is produced than is used up.
Selective breeding is the process in which two animals from the same species reproduce due to useful characteristics. Two animals with a certain type of characteristic are bred together to produce offspring. 1 The Definition of Selective Breeding Selective breeding, or artificial selection, is the process of breeding animals or plants to get particular traits or characteristics. 2  In the animal world, breeds of animals 3  ….
