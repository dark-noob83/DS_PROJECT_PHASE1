Example: Check the angles and corresponding sides: All the angles in a rectangle are congruent to each other and now check that the sides are proportional to each other. 2. Scale factor: If two polygons are similar, then the ratio of the lengths of the two corresponding sides is the scale factor.
Congruent shapes are two shapes that are equal in shape and size. In order for two shapes to be congruent, each must have the same amount of sides and their angles must also be the same.
Click here: Similar Polygons. Recall that two shapes are congruent if they have the same shape and size. When two shapes have the same shape but different sizes, we call the shapes similar. You can also think of similar objects or shapes as scaled versions of each other.
Now this is for a similar figure. The sides notice are not equal. In a congruent figure we have the same angles and the same sides. So in similar figures, the angles are congruent but the sides are just proportional. That means that they all have the same ratio. If you want to figure out if the shape is congruent, if the figure is congruent, then the sides have to be equal.
