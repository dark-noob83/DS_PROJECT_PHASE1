WHERE ARE THE RAINFORESTS. The map below shows the location of the world's tropical rainforests. Rainforests cover only a small part of the earth's surface-about 6%, yet they are home to over half the species of plants and animals in the world.
Fifty seven percent of all tropical rainforests are found in Latin America. One third of the world's tropical rainforests are in Brazil. Other tropical rainforests are located in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands (25% of the world's tropical rainforests) and West Africa (18%). Temperate rainforests are found along some coasts in temperate zones. The largest temperate rainforests are found on the Pacific coast of North America.
I. Rainforests: What they are and where they're found... Temperate rainforests are located along the Pacific coast of Canada and the United States, and are also found in New Zealand, Tasmania, Chile, Ireland, as well as Scotland and Norway. Temperate rainforests are much more scarce than tropical rainforests.
