Cofactor. Definition. noun, plural: cofactors. (biochemistry) An inorganic complement of an enzyme reaction. Supplement. Cofactors pertain to the inorganic substances that are needed by certain enzymes to carry out catalysis of a particular chemical reaction.
A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound that is required for the protein's biological activity. These proteins are commonly enzymes, and cofactors can be considered helper molecules that assist in biochemical transformations.
coenzymes are organic molecules that are required by certain enzymes to carry out catalysis. They bind to the active site of the enzyme and participate in catalysis but are not considered substrates of the reaction. coenzymes often function as intermediate carriers of electrons, specific atoms or functional groups that are transfered in the overall reaction.
A coenzyme is a type of cofactor. It is the loosely bound cofactor to an enzyme. Cofactors are chemical compounds that are bound to proteins. A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound, while a coenzyme is a non-protein molecule.
Coenzymes. Coenzymes: A nonprotein component of enzymes is called the cofactor. If the cofactor is organic, then it is called a coenzyme. Coenzymes are relatively small molecules compared to the protein part of the enzyme. Many of the coenzymes are derived from vitamins.
