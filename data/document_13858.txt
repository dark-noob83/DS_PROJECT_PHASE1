Weight Loss. When followed as advised, people on a ketogenic diet for weight loss lose weight and lose it quickly, according to dietitian Juliette Kellow. According to a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, men who followed a ketogenic diet for four weeks lost an average of 12 pounds.
In response to the post above me, I've never entered Ketosis 'after a couple of hours'. Generally it takes me 2-3 days depending on if I exercise as well. Mind you, the length of time is also dependent on how much glycogen you have in your liver (stored sugar) as this needs to be burnt/used/stored first. Thus you could arrive in Ketosis much quicker depending on what your diet was before hand.

It usually takes a month to get to the first stage of becoming keto-adapted, and it takes up to 2 years to fully train your body to use ketones fully.
The rate of weight loss on a ketosis diet varies, and how long it takes to work depends on how much weight you need to lose, but you may be able to lose more than 12 pounds in a month.
At first you spill lots of ketones in your urine. After 2 years your keto sticks will hardly show any ketones. Eugenia 11687 · August 07, 2012 at 9:07 PM. Dr Kruse mentioned that to be TRULY keto-adapted after a lifetime on carbs, you will need two years.
If you go on a binge, it can take you a couple of days or more to eliminate the glycogen out of your liver. If you just have a few extra carbs, then no it does not take 3 days to get back into ketosis. If I have a piece of chocolate cake, for example, it only takes me a day to get back on track.
Under 50 grams of carbs a day will eventually get you to ketosis. Depending on the person and level of activity, it could take 2-3 days or up to a week before the body’s glycogen is depleted.
