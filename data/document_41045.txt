In the United States, the maximum retirement benefit permitted in 2014 under a defined benefit plan is $210,000 (up from $205,000 in 2013). Defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. currently do not have contribution limits. 
Definition. The annual Addition limit is the maximum amount that may be added to a defined contribution plan on behalf of a participant for any plan year. The maximum amount is the lesser of the following: (a). 100% of the participants compensation for the year or (b) . The dollar limit that is in effect for the year.
Defined contribution plans are subject to IRS limits on how much can be contributed, known as the section 415 limit. In 2013, the total deferral amount, including employee contribution plus employer contribution, is limited to $51,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less. The employee-only limit in 2015 is $18,000 with a $6,000 catch-up. In contrast, a Defined Contribution retirement plan is an arrangement where an employer, during the time a person is employed, puts money in a registered retirement account on the employee's behalf.
Annual Limit on Compensation Contribution to 401K Plan for the Current Year. The 401k annual limit on compensation is one of the least understood limits, but it’s just as important to comprehend as all the others. The good news is that it’s not really difficult to understand. All this rule does is limit the amount of your compensation that can be taken into account when determining how much you can contribute to your account. For 2012, the annual limit on compensation is $250,000.
An employer’s maximum deduction is limited to 25% of the annual compensation paid to eligible employees. For 2012, the individual maximum contribution limit for employees applied to all defined contribution plans is 100% of compensation or $50,000, whichever is less. 
If you are age fifty or older you can contribute an additional $6,000 as a catch-up contribution for a total of $24,000 from the employee’s salary. The annual defined contribution limit is the total amount of employee plus employer money that can be contributed to your 401k account. The limit for 2015 is $53,000 but that does not include the catch-up contribution. If you are an HCE or expect to exceed the annual compensation limit in 2015 you need to (1) assess your plan rules around the contribution limits and true up calculations in the 401k plan and (2) whether your employer offers a non-qualified retirement plan in excess of the 401k limits.
DEFINITION of 'Annual Addition'. The total dollar amount contributed in a given year to a participant's retirement account under a defined-contribution plan. An annual addition is the sum of employer contributions, employee contributions and forfeitures in a particular year. The annual addition is subject to a maximum limit. This annual addition limit is the lesser of 100% of the participant's compensation for the year or the dollar limit in effect for the year. The annual addition dollar limit was fixed at $49,000 for each year from 2009 to 2011.

In a defined contribution plan, fixed contributions are paid into an individual account by employers and employees. The contributions are then invested, for example in the stock market, and the returns on the investment (which may be positive or negative) are credited to the individual's account. In contrast, a Defined Contribution retirement plan is an arrangement where an employer, during the time a person is employed, puts money in a registered retirement account on the employee's behalf.
