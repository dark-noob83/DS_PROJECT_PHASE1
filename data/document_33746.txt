I have been coaching lacrosse for 10 years now. I started at a PA high school coaching JV and received 3K from one of the less affluent schools in the Philly area. Right now I am an assistant lacrosse coach in Cali. I have been doing this basically on a volunteer basis, but I do find it odd the head coach is getting half of what I did 10 years ago (this is at one of the most affluent schools in the Bay Area).
