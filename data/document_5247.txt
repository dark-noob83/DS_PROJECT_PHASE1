REMAINS: Many original buildings. Located on highway 49 south of Sonora, Coulterville was named after George Coulter, one of the first whites to come to the gold camp already populated by Chinese and Mexicans. The Chinese first appeared in 1850, creating a small settlement at the north end of what was to be Coulterville.
