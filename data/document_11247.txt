Gifts. According to the IRS, certain gifts are not taxable. These include gifts that are less than the annual exclusion amount. As of 2012, a married couple can give up to $26,000 tax-free, referred to as gift splitting.. If you pay tuition or medical expenses for someone, you don't have to pay tax on the money.
Also, another way for parents to avoid the gift tax is to remember that each parent is entitled to their own individual $14,000 exclusion. This means that your mother and father could each give you $14,000 this year — for a total of $28,000 — without being taxed on that gift.
For instance, if you give your daughter $20,000 on December 17, $6,000 of it is taxable. You'll have to file a gift tax return (by April 15 of the next year), and you'll use up $6,000 of the total amount you can give away or leave free from estate tax.
For deaths in 2015, everyone has a lifetime gift and estate tax exemption of $5.43 million, which means you can leave or give away up to $5.43 million without owing any federal tax. This amount goes up every year to adjust for inflation.
In 2015, a taxpayer can give up to $14,000 per person per year without being taxed on the gift. For example, this year you could give Friend A $14,000, Friend B $14,000, and your sister $14,000 and not be taxed on your gifts.
In 2014, you can give a lifetime total of $5.34 million in taxable gifts (that exceed the annual tax-free limit) without triggering the gift tax. Beyond the $5.34 million level, you would actually have to pay
Most taxpayers can avoid paying a gift tax. As of 2012, each U.S. taxpayer can give up to $13,000 tax-free, the annual exclusion amount set by the Internal Revenue Service. This limit is subject to change. For example, from 2006 through 2008, it was $12,000.
