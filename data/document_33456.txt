A thymoma is a tumor of the thymus gland. The tumor can grow and squeeze blood vessels, the heart and lungs and require removal. A thymoma may also metastasize to other organs. Fortunately, most patients can have the tumor removed and do well. Removal of the thymoma does NOT cure MG.

Thymectomy, the surgical removal of the thymus gland (which often is abnormal in individuals with myasthenia gravis), reduces symptoms in some individuals without thymoma and may cure some people, possibly by re-balancing the immune system. Thymectomy is recommended for individuals with thymoma.
