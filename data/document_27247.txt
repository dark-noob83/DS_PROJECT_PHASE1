But there are a variety of ways to avoid the IRA early withdrawal penalty if you meet specific criteria: Turn age 59 1/2. Once you turn age 59 1/2, you can withdraw any amount from your IRA without having to pay the 10 percent penalty. But regular income tax will still be due on each withdrawal. IRA distributions are not required until after age 70 1/2.
The early withdrawal penalty does not apply to distributions that: 1  Occur because of the IRA owner's disability. ( 2 This can be a very narrow definition, so if you get a severe paper cut, don't consider a Roth IRA distribution for a disability until you review IRS Code Section 72(m)(7) and IRS Publication 590 .).
Normally, you must pay income taxes and a 10 percent penalty tax on money removed from your traditional or Roth IRA before you reach age 59 1/2. The IRS will lift some of the restrictions for a disability withdrawal, but the rules are different for traditional and Roth IRAs.
IRA Withdrawal Rules. With the exception of the recovery of previous non-deductible contributions, all IRA withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax. An additional 10% early distribution penalty tax is assessed if you have not reached at least age 59 ½ when you take your distribution.
Regardless of your age, you will need to file a Form 1040 and show the amount of the IRA withdrawal. Since you took the withdrawal before you reached age 59 1/2, unless you met one of the exceptions listed in Publication 590-B, you will need to pay an additional 10% tax on early distributions on your Form 1040.
An early withdrawal is an IRA withdrawal taken before you reach age 59 ½, which is subject to a 10% penalty tax in addition to ordinary income taxes. Below are eight situations which may qualify you for an exception to the 10% penalty tax on an IRA early withdrawal.
Penalties on Earnings from Contributions. Unless an exception applies, most distributions from a Roth IRA before the owner reaches age 59 1/2 will be subject to an early withdrawal penalty of 10% on the amount of the distribution.
In 2001, before he is age 59 1/2, Paul withdraws $10,000 from the Roth IRA. Paul will have no tax to pay on this withdrawal because he paid income taxes on the full $20,000 he converted in 1998; however, he WILL have to pay a 10% penalty (or $1,000) unless one of the IRA early withdrawal exceptions apply.
