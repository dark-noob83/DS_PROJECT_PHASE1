This involves you setting up about 30 folders and sub-folders inthe RailWorks\Source folder and the same in your Assets folder. It is much easier to have RW_Tools do thisfor you as it only involves your typing two words and clicking a couple of buttons:-1. That is all you need from RW_Tools for the time being, now you must run Rail Works and from the main. screen, select Routes / New Route (bottom right of the screen) then you will see the Choose a Template. window, scroll down and you should see the template you set up. Select your template, and click the Create button.
From TS2014 onwards, can assemble their own QuickDrive consists using the game's built-in QuickDrive consist editor. QuickDrive consists allow players to quicky pick a train, a route, and some time of day information and hop into the train and go. I'm using my own products as an example here, so you can see my PreLoad folder sits here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\railworks\Source\ChrisTrains\RailSimulator\PreLoad. Navigate to this folder in the blueprint editor, right-click the folder and choose New Blueprint.
To put this simply, it means you can create a consist, and then save it to share with your friends. Or you can download a consist from the internet to use. And of course, it allows you to add consists to the quickdrive rule, which will be described in a quickdrive tutorial soon... 
There is nothing out there that I can find that relates with Railworks 2013. Everything on building scenarios and making consists is from Rail Simulator 2 back about 2008/9. Rail Simulator.com says that they are working on updating the tutorial to cover scenarios and consists, but it is not out yet. I was looking to find out how to build a consist that I can select for use in the Quick Drive menu. Send an e-mail to [email protected] and ask them how you can create a consist so that it shows in the TS-2013 QUICK DRIVE TRAINS option.
However, if not, or to make the Consist Editor easier to use, you can proceed asfollows:-A. Run the RW_Tools Asset Editor and select a folder containing rolling stock you are going to use in yourconsist, e.g. RailWorks\Assets\3DTrains\TrainPacks\Diesel\EMD_F7\ATSFB. Pantograph, Needs 3 rd rail, etc appear.11. You can select the route the consist will appear on (must be a QD route, but TS2015 does not appear touse this data at this time, as most consists appear for all routes). You can select multiple routes using Ctrl-click to highlight all the routes you need.12.
To add consists for your product, you need to create a PreLoad folder in your source developer folder structure. I'm using my own products as an example here, so you can see my PreLoad folder sits here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\railworks\Source\ChrisTrains\RailSimulator\PreLoad. Navigate to this folder in the blueprint editor, right-click the folder and choose New Blueprint.
The consist files include a tag(s) which allow you to show which routes the train can berun on, however at this stage this does not seem to be implemented in TS2015 e.g. TheClass 377 is set to run on the London-Brighton route, however in Quick Drive it isavailable for every QD route. Pantograph, Needs 3 rd rail, etc appear.11. You can select the route the consist will appear on (must be a QD route, but TS2015 does not appear touse this data at this time, as most consists appear for all routes). You can select multiple routes using Ctrl-click to highlight all the routes you need.12.
That entry to the Railworks XML file for the Eanos (in this case) will become an entry for a .bin file, and that file does exist. There's obviously an important caveat here: if you attempt to reference a model that doesn't exist, your consist will fail. I'm using my own products as an example here, so you can see my PreLoad folder sits here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\railworks\Source\ChrisTrains\RailSimulator\PreLoad. Navigate to this folder in the blueprint editor, right-click the folder and choose New Blueprint.
Something that is not obvious to many newcomers to RailWorks is that in order to create your own content (scenery, locos, route templates, etc), you have to set up some folders on your own computer first where the raw information is placed before turning it into a format that RailWorks can understand. 
3. This version will automatically copy serz.exe AND msvcr71.dll from the RailWorks folder into your RW_Tools folder once you have set up the path to RailWorks from the Options menu. 4. A desktop icon for RW_Tools should appear on your desktop, otherwise click on the .exe to run it. THEN READ THE HELP FILE......
