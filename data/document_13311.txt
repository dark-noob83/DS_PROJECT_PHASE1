I’ve made osso buco, an Italian dish of braised veal shanks, several times. I’ve eaten it in fine Italian restaurants but I’ve never really liked it until now.
1 To serve, cut and discard the twine, put a single osso buco (veal shank) in a bowl, and ladle about 3/4 cup of the sauce and vegetables over it. ( 2 If the sauce and the meat are not still warm, heat them together very gently over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes.).

Add the tomato paste and mix well. Return browned shanks to the pan and add the white wine and reduce liquid by half, about 5 minutes. Add the bouquet garni and 2 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is falling off the bone.
I open the braising chapter with one of Italy's most renowned braises: osso buco. It's a classic Milanese dish usually made with veal shanks cooked in a rich broth that includes tomato and wine. I salt the meat before cooking it, a technique that tenderizes the veal.

I've made osso buco many times but Giada's recipe is the best by far. I personalized it by using 1/2 the oil, more than enough, double the tomato paste, garlic instead of cloves, and doubled the cooking time at a very low temperature...DELICIOUS!!!
