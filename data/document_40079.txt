The wrist is a complex joint that connects the hand to the forearm. The wrist is comprised of the ends of the two forearm bones (the ulna and radius) and eight small bones called carpals. The radius is positioned on the thumb side of the wrist, and the ulna on the pinky side. The carpal bones are arranged in two rows.
Your wrist joint deviates -- or tilts -- from side to side. Ulnar deviation tilts your wrist toward the pinkie side of your hand. Radial deviation tilts your wrist toward the thumb side of your hand. These movements are used frequently during the day as you type, write, get dressed and talk on the phone.
The wrist is one of the smaller joints in your body, but it is made up of multiple bones. Two rows of 4 small carpal bones sit at the base of your hand. The bottom row of carpal bones meets the end of the forearm bones, enabling movement in your wrist joint.
Most of the muscles that act on the wrist joint are located in the forearm. Wrist Muscles. A healthy wrist is extremely mobile to give our hands full range of motion. It is a super flexible joint, able to move and bend forward, backward and side to side.
Wrist Bending. Forward bending of your wrist is called flexion. This motion is needed for daily activities such as styling your hair, writing, getting dressed, using a screwdriver and lifting heavy objects. Normal wrist flexion is approximately 70 to 90 degrees.
The major joints of your body move in several directions. Therefore, the range of motion for a given joint is tested for each type of movement possible at the site. Flexion refers to the bending capacity of joints, such as your elbows, hips and knees. Shoulder flexion involves raising your arm upward toward your ear.
