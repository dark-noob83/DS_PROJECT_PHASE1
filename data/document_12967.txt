The function time() returns the current time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 12:00 PM, GMT. Show example. Time expressed in the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 12:00 PM GMT is a so-called timestamp (UNIX timestamp) and is quite useful when you work with dates/times in the future or the past.
For some unknown reason, MATLAB codes its date/time values as the number of elapsed days starting from January 1 in the year 0000.
c=clock %returns a six element date vector containing the current time and date in decimal form: [year month day hour minute seconds]. Alternatively, in this case, you can use functions year(now), month(now), day(now), hour(now), minute(now), and second(now) instead of c(1), c(2), c(3), c(4) c(5), and c(6).
t = now returns the current date and time as a serial date number. A serial date number represents the whole and fractional number of days from a fixed, preset date (January 0, 0000). floor(now) returns the current date as a serial date number, and rem(now,1) returns the current time as a serial date number. datestr(now) returns the current date and time as a string.
This represents the amount of computer time used by your program, and could be somewhat less than the elapsed wall clock time. MATLAB includes a function CLOCK which returns the YMDHMS date as a vector of six integers. Two values of CLOCK can be subtracted, and the difference, or elapsed wall clock time, returned in seconds, by the function ETIME. MATLAB includes two functions TIC and TOC.
Tips. To time the duration of an event, use the timeit or tic and toc functions instead of clock and etime. The clock function is based on the system time, which can be adjusted periodically by the operating system, and thus might not be reliable in time comparison operations.
