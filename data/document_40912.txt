Geologic History. Crater Lake partially fills a type of volcanic depression called a caldera that formed by the collapse of a 3,700 m (12,000 ft) volcano known as Mount Mazama during an enormous eruption approximately 7,700 years ago. The climactic (caldera-forming) eruption of Mount Mazama changed the landscape all around the volcano. Mount Mazama rose to an approximate height of 3,700 m (12,000 ft) above sea level. The erupted magma was mainly andesite. The caldera wall displays the geologic layering of lava flows through time. As the volcanic complex evolved, so did its eruptive style.
About 6,850 years ago Mount Mazama, a stratovolcano, collapsed to produce Crater Lake, one of the world's best known calderas. The caldera is about 6 miles (10 km) wide. Mount Mazama was one of the major Quaternary volcanoes of the Cascade Range. The summit of Mount Mazama was between 11,000-12,000 feet (3,300-3,700 m) prior to the climatic eruption.
Mount Mazama started growing about 400,000 years ago, and it was made up of lava flows mixed with pyroclastic material. After that base was created, it switched to more explosive eruptions about 75,000 years ago. Then Mount Mazama started cone building eruptions until about 50,000 years ago. It’s not a mountain any more, but geologists refer to Mount Mazama as a peak in Oregon that used to exist before a catastrophic eruption destroyed the entire mountain and collapsed it into a giant caldera.
Mt. Mazama began its most destructive eruption about 7,680 years ago. A distinct band of volcanic chemicals and ash particles was discovered in the Greenland ice in a layer dated to 7,676 years ago. A caldera formed by the collapsing of the top of the mountain, during the catastrophic eruption of almost 50 cubic kilometers of magma.
Crater Lake is 1,932 feet (589 m) deep, making it the deepest lake in the United States. Additional information about Mount Mazama and Crater Lake is presented on the Cascade Volcano Observatory homepage of the U.S. Geological Survey. Mount Mazama was one of the major Quaternary volcanoes of the Cascade Range. The summit of Mount Mazama was between 11,000-12,000 feet (3,300-3,700 m) prior to the climatic eruption.
Mount Mazama is a stratovolcano in the Oregon segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range located in the United States. The volcano 's collapsed caldera holds Crater Lake, and the entire mountain is located within Crater Lake National Park. When it last erupted, the eruption was 42 times greater than the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Mazama's summit was destroyed by a volcanic eruption that occurred around 5677 (± 150) BC. The eruption reduced Mazama's approximate 12,000-foot (3,700 m) height by about 1 mile (1,600 m). Much of the volcano fell into the volcano's partially emptied neck and magma chamber
Before Crater Lake came into existence, a cluster of volcanoes dominated the landscape. This cluster, called Mount Mazama (for the Portland, Oregon, climbing club the Mazamas), was destroyed during an enormous explosive eruption 7,700 years ago. In the more than 100 years since Dutton’s first survey, scientists have steadily unraveled the mystery of the formation of Crater Lake and with it the demise of Mount Mazama. Mount Mazama. Mount Mazama was formed over a period of nearly half a million years by a succession of overlapping volcanoes. The first eruptions about 420,000 years ago built Mount Scott, located just east of Crater Lake
Crater Lake occupies a basin in Mount Mazama, one of the volcanoes that make up the Cascades Mountain Range along the west coast of the United States. The major volcanoes of the Cascades include the following (listed from south to north): 1  California: Lassen Peak and Mount Shasta. Mount Mazama grew, erupted, then collapsed to form the caldera, and finally precipitation filled the caldera. Although Crater Lake has been dormant for about 5,000 to 6,000 years, there could be another eruption someday in the future and Mount Mazama might grow back.
