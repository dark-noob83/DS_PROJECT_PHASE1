In the action center, I keep getting notification that my windows and mcafee firewalls are both turned off. I go to turn them both on, and nothing happens. I have scanned my computer several times and I am not under any threat. I will tell you again but like this MY MCAFEE IS BLOCKING MY ACCESS TO MY ACTION CENTER AND WONT ALLOW ME TO ACTIVATE ANY OF MY FIREWALLS AND GIVES ME A NOTICE THAT MY FIREWALL IS TURNED OFF EVERY 5 MINUTES Now can you read. windows firewall and mcafee firewall will not turn on.
My understanding of McAfee is that McAfee disables window defender. As for software firewall, if McAfee has a firewall it should turn off windows firewall, if it has not then turn windows firewall off. (you only need one software firewall). 
One firewall, whether it is the Windows XP Internet Connection. Firewall or a different software firewall, can provide substantial. protection for your computer.. Also note that if you update your third-party firewall to a new. version, the update routine will probably turn it off first. Re: Windows Firewall-McAfee Security Center. Windows Firewall can not protect you from the virus,but McAfee can. Note: You do not have to use Windows Firewallâ€”you can install and run any. firewall that you choose
You can only run one firewall. Anymore than that will conflict with each other My recommendation is that I would get rid of all McAfee and run Windows Defender and Windows Firewall. This is more than enough protection particularly when you add in Smart Screen and the security improvements in IE10.

Guys, I have a question about Windows Firewall. I want to use Windows firewall, but everytime I go into control panel then Windows Firewall, it says, These settings are being managed by vendor application McAfee Personal Firewall.. It won't let me do anything on Windows Firewall.

- Windows Defender. - McAfee Anti-virus and Anti-spyware. I read where if you have more than one anti-virus or firewall running at the same time, that it can actually put your computer at risk as well as slow it down... Just looking for some guidance as to which I should go with! Thanks so much in advance for any and all help! P.s. No, you don't want two [software] firewalls. If you're gonna use McAfee, you might as well use its firewall --- meaning you should disable the Windows firewall. Next, a question: You didn't specify your operating system.
It may end up locking up your computer. I have mine both turned on (Windows Firewall + BitDefender Firewall). The problem is that sometimes when I run certain application that's not supposed to be executed, I get both firewalls a prompt window at the same time. 2 firewalls makes things more harder. you are gonna have one trying to block other. best to just run windows firewall i would think than mcafee's. you will always get warning with turning one of them off. it is just so annoying popping up at start up in task bar
When I checked Windows Security Center, it says Windows firewall and McAfee firewall are both turned on. Should I turn off Windows firewall and if I do, will that start McAfee firewall? Sorry I couldn't get a screen shot of it, don't know how. I am using McAfee Total Protection and checked my settings to make sure everything was working fine after the download. The dashboard says the firewall is on and the computer is secure, but when I click on firewall, I see this: [__MPFs:*_FIREWALL not a resource]: off. [__MPFs:*_FIREWALL_DESCRIPTION_OFF not a resource].
