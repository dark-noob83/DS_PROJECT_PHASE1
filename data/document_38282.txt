Dental bridges literally bridge the gap created by one or more missing teeth. A bridge is made up of two crowns one on each tooth on either side of the gap -- these two anchoring teeth are called abutment teeth -- and a false tooth/teeth in between. These false teeth are called pontics and can be made from gold, alloys, porcelain or a combination of these materials. 1 Cantilever bridges are used when there are adjacent teeth on only one side of the missing tooth or teeth. 2  Cantilever bridges are usually used to replace only one tooth. 3  Maryland bonded bridges (also called a resin-bonded bridge or a Maryland bridge) are made of plastic teeth and gums supported by a metal framework.
Dental bridges can range in price from $700 to $1,500 per tooth based on the aforementioned factors. If you exercise proper dental hygiene and visit your dentist for regular checkups, your bridges can last for many years.
