The organisms in kingdom fungi include mushrooms, yeasts, molds, rusts, smuts, puffballs, truffles, morels, and molds. More than 70,000 species of fungi have been identified. T he fungi constitute and independent group to that of plants and animals. 1 The structure of cell wall is similar to plants but chemically the fungi cell wall are composed of chitin. 2  Fungi are heterotrophic organisms. 3  They fungi digest the food first and then ingest the food, to accomplish this the fungi produce exoenzymes. 4  Fungi store their food as starch.
It occurs in saprotrophs or heterotrophs, and is most often associated with fungi (for example Mucor) and soil bacteria. Saprotrophic microscopic fungi are sometimes called saprobes; saprotrophic plants or bacterial flora are called saprophytes (sapro- + -phyte, rotten material + plant). Saprotrophic nutrition /saeprɵˈtrɒfɪk/ sæprɵˈtrɒfɪk is a process of its chemoheterotrophic extracellular digestion involved in the processing of dead or decayed organic. Matter it occurs in saprotrophs or, heterotrophs and is most often associated with (fungi for Example) mucor and soil. bacteria
The use of the term food-making process is used here to mean those food products that require the aide of fungi in their production. For example, the one with which you are most familiar is baked bread. The yeast is utilized in making the dough rise so that bread will come out light and fluffy. We will cover some of the more common examples, some of which you will be familiar. Food Products. There has now been a great deal of research that has been carried out on some of the fermented food products, so that the identify of the fungus involved in the process has been established.
Fungi In Manufacturing of Food. Introduction. Although the use of fungi as a component in the food making process is more common now than in the recent past, these food products, with some notable exceptions, are still not a familiar sight to western cultures. We will cover some of the more common examples, some of which you will be familiar. Food Products. There has now been a great deal of research that has been carried out on some of the fermented food products, so that the identify of the fungus involved in the process has been established.
Ascomycota includes yeasts, the powdery mildews, the black and blue-green molds, edible types such as the morel and the truffle, and species that cause such diseases of plants as Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight, apple scab, and ergot. There are over 50,000 species, about 25,000 of which occur only in lichens. The 100,000 identified species of organisms commonly classed together as fungi are customarily divided into four phyla, or divisions: Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Deuteromycota.

Introduction. Fungi may be the food, or may make the food edible following processing. Processing may make it possible to consume the foodstuff by adding, modifying or removing components, including flavours, nutritional elements such as vitamins or colours to enhance the appeal of the food. 
There are five kingdoms of living organisms: plants, animals, fungi, and tiny bacteria and protozoa. Mushrooms, molds, and yeasts are all in the fungi kingdom. Although sometimes they look similar to plants, fungi do not produce their own food through photosynthesis. Fungi range in size from just one tiny cell to several inches tall. 
The Fungi are a group of eukaryotic, non-phototrophic organisms with rigid cell walls. This includes mushrooms, molds and yeasts. Many fungi are saprophytes, getting nutrients by absorbing them from dead, decaying plant material. Still, other fungi are parasitic, stealing resources from a host organism. Many fungi reproduce by releasing spores.
Abundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil, on dead matter. They are both symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology (from the Greek μύκης, mukēs, meaning fungus). In the past, mycology was regarded as a branch of botany; today it is a separate kingdom in biological taxonomy.
