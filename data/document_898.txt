Recovery Techs Reap Rewards. In 2012, the average surgical technologists brought home $43,480 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of the top 10 percent, salaries exceeded $60,240, while salaries for the bottom 10 percent were often less than $29,710. But these figures are regardless of specialty. Another factor in the lower pay is training, as tissue recovery technicians usually enter the field of tissue procurement as surgical technologists. Generally, surgical technologists hold either a certificate or associate degree. Employers may also ask tissue recovery technicians to earn their Certified Tissue Bank Specialist or Certified Eye Bank Technician designation
