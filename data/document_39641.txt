This is partly due to the way dietary supplements are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Research studies in people to prove that a dietary supplement is safe are not required before the supplement is marketed, unlike for drugs. Some supplements may help ensure that you get adequate amounts of essential nutrients or help promote optimal health and performance if you do not consume a variety of foods, as recommended in the MyPlate and Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Nearly half of U.S. adults use dietary supplements, Bailey noted, and supplements are a $30-billion-a-year business. People have very strong beliefs about these products and I don't know where they are getting their information, Bailey said. When they recommend supplements, doctors are most likely to recommend calcium for bone health (24 percent) or to improve overall health (18 percent), or fish oil for heart health (12 percent) or to supplement diet (11 percent), Bailey said. 1 | 2.

Summary. This report indicates high use of dietary supplements in the U.S. adult population during the past 20 years, with over 40% of adults using one or more dietary supplements during 1988–1994, and over one-half of adults using supplements during 2003–2006. 1 The percentage of the U.S. population who used at least one multivitamin/multimineral product increased from 30% in 1988–1994 to 39% in 2003–2006, with use more common among women than men.
Supplements vs. whole foods. Supplements aren't intended to be a food substitute because they can't replicate all of the nutrients and benefits of whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables. So depending on your situation and your eating habits, dietary supplements may not be worth the expense. If you're generally healthy and eat a wide variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, low-fat dairy products, lean meats and fish, you likely don't need supplements.
DVs are presented on food and supplement labels as a percentage. They help you compare one product with another. As an example, the %DV for calcium on a food label might say 20%. This means it has 200 mg (milligrams) of calcium in one serving because the DV for calcium is 1,000 mg/day. Some supplements may help ensure that you get adequate amounts of essential nutrients or help promote optimal health and performance if you do not consume a variety of foods, as recommended in the MyPlate and Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

We really don't know what's inside.. FDA cracks down on tainted dietary supplements. The most popular supplements are multivitamins, used by 39% of U.S. adults in 2006. Some consumers mistakenly view supplements as a way to make up for a poor diet. That rise, from 42% in 1988 to 53% in 2006, has fueled the growth of the supplement industry to a $27 billion behemoth, according to Consumer Reports. Dietary supplements are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the same way as drugs. The makers do not have to prove safety or effectiveness
