After germination, most seedlings grow best if the air temperature is below 70 degrees F. If temperatures are too warm (over 75), the seedlings will grow too fast and get weak and leggy. Most seedlings grow fine in air temperatures as low as 50 degrees, as long as soil temperature is maintained at about 65 to 70.
When the light is turned on, an ideal temperature for the cuttings and seedlings is between 68ºF and 77ºF (20ºC and 25ºC). As the plants get older they can evaporate a little bit more and the temperature may increase to a maximum of 82ºF (28ºC).
If temperature is kept consistently and sufficiently warm, your tomato seeds will usually germinate within 5 to 10 days. Best to keep temperature range 70 to 80F (21 to 27C). The lower the temperature the slower the germination. However, temperatures below 50F (10C) or above 95F (35C) are poor for
When grown indoors, seedlings do not develop the ability to handle temperature extremes or direct sunlight. Place them outdoors in partial shade for an hour or two the first day, 3 to 6 hours the second, and all day the third. By the fourth day, they should be able to handle direct sunlight for a few hours.
The temperature of the cannabis should not be excessively cold or hot. The best temperature range for cannabis is 24 to 30 C (70 to 86 F) when day or when artificial light is on. Temperatures above 31 C and under the temperature of 15.5 C seem to decrease (THC) tetrahydrocannabinol potency and sluggish growth.
Conversely, when plants are given high temperatures and only moderate light, the stems elongate. Plants growing under moderate intensity lamps (40-50 watts per sq ft, 430-540 watt per sq m) should be kept on the low side of the recommended temperature range. Plants growing under higher intensity lamps (60 watts per sq ft, 650 watts per sq m and higher) should be kept on the warmer end of the scale.
When CO2 is being used, the plant prefers to be a few degrees warmer, between 79° and 85° F (26°-29° C). Individual marijuana varieties differ in their temperature preferences by a few degrees, so some experimentation is required to find the ideal temperatures for the strain you are growing.
Temperature, Humidity & Air Quality. Marijuana grows well in moderate temperatures – between 70° and 85° F (21°-29° C). Both high and low temperatures slow marijuana’s rate of metabolism and growth. Plants grow fastest when the temperature during the lighted period is kept between 72° and 77° F (22 ° -26 ° C).
If you start seed 5 to 8 weeks before transplanting, your seedlings can grow in seed flats and will be about 10 inches tall at transplanting. If you start 8 to 12 weeks early, then plan on growing them in pots up to 12 inches diameter. Find out your last frost date by calling your co-operative extension agent.
