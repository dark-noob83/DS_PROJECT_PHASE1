Stomata â€“ Stomata are pores in the leaf that allow gas exchange where water vapor leaves the plant and carbon dioxide enters.
WAX PLANT (HOYA). Wax plant belongs to the genus Hoya, a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae. Wax plants grown in the foliage plant industry are primarily cultivars of one species-Hoya carnosa. The preferred common name of the species is wax plant, but wax vine and porcelain flower are occasionally used.
Tropical Plants. Tropical plants grow where there is little danger of frost, but often excessive heat. There are a number of plants that produce waxy leaves in this environment. The cycads, for example, are a group of palmlike trees with a stout central trunk. Hardy in USDA zones 8 to 10, cycad leaves are thick, leathery and waxy.
The wax plant has thick, waxy leaves that are sometimes variegated. Peperomias are small plants with thick, waxy leaves, and may vary greatly in leaf size and shape with an upright to mounding habit. The popular jade plant (Crassula spp.) produces thick, succulent, waxy leaves; some variegated varieties are available.
At the right, on the upper stem of the roadside weed called Spiny-leafed Sow Thistle, Sonchus asper, you see glandular hairs -- hairs with glands atop them. In many species the glands on such hairs are sticky and sometimes you can find small insects such as aphids stuck to them.
