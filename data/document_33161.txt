Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, is a way of obtaining very detailed images of organs and tissues throughout the body without the need for x-rays or ionizing radiation. The MRI safety information on this page was developed in cooperation with the Institute for Magnetic Resonance Safety, Education, and Research (www.imrser.org) and from content on www.MRIsafety.com.
For the MRI procedure, the patient is placed inside of the MR scanner—typically a large doughnut-shaped device that is open on both ends. The powerful magnetic field aligns atomic particles called protons that are present in most of the body's tissues.

The MRI Magnet The MRI scanner is a large magnet (10,000 lbs.) with a tremendously strong magnetic pull. The magnet in the MRI scanner creates a force field which can affect objects that are close to it. As you approach the MRI scanner, the attractive force field increases rapidly. * An object that is attracted by a magnet and which can become magnetized itself. Magnetic Field Hazards All MRI magnets have a magnetic field that extends into the exam room. Anyone entering the MRI scanner room will be exposed to the magnetic attraction of the scanner.
Video: MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create clear and detailed cross-sectional images of your head and body. You don't need to prepare for an MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging is safe for children, and an adult may stay in the scanning room for reassurance. Young children, toddlers and infants may need sedation since they must remain still throughout the imaging process. The exam itself is painless, but noisy.
This Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook provides procedures for the safe conduct of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Authority: Title 38 United States Code 7301(b) and Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations 17.38. 2. SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES. This Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook provides guidance for preventing injuries in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) suites
The signals are specially characterized using the rapidly changing magnetic field, and, with the help of computer processing, images of tissues are created as slices that can be viewed in any orientation. An MRI examination causes no pain, and the magnetic fields produce no known tissue damage of any kind. The MR scanner may make loud tapping, knocking or other noises at times during the procedure.

What is MRI? Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive test that uses a magnetic field and radiofrequency waves to create detailed pictures of organs and structures inside your body. 1 The MRI machine will create a strong magnetic field around you, and radio waves will be directed at the area of your body to be imaged. 2  You won’t feel the magnetic field or radio waves. 3  During the MRI scan, the magnet produces loud tapping or thumping sounds and other noises.
Great care is taken to be certain that objects such asferromagnetic screwdrivers and oxygen tanks are not brought into the MR system area.

1 MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radiofrequency waves, and a computer to create detailed cross-sectional (2-dimensional) and 3-dimensional images of the inside of your body without using ionizing radiation (like X-rays, computed tomography, or nuclear imaging). 1 The MRI machine will create a strong magnetic field around you, and radio waves will be directed at the area of your body to be imaged. 2  You won’t feel the magnetic field or radio waves. 3  During the MRI scan, the magnet produces loud tapping or thumping sounds and other noises.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Guide. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of organs and structures inside the body. In many cases, MRI gives different information about structures in the body than can be seen with an X-ray, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT) scan. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done for many reasons. It is used to find problems such as tumors, bleeding, injury, blood vessel diseases, or infection. MRI also may be done to provide more information about a problem seen on an X-ray, ultrasound scan, or CT scan.
