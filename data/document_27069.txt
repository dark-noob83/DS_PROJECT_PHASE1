Paleomagnetism is the study of past magnetic fields. Hot spots are fixed pockets of heat that well up to form volcanic features. Learn how paleomagnetism and the study of hot spots provide evidence that supports the theory of plate tectonics.
paleomagnetism. paleomagnetism, study of the intensity and orientation of the earth's magnetic field as preserved in the magnetic orientation of certain minerals found in rocks formed throughout geologic time.
So paleomagnetism can really be thought of as the study of an ancient magnet field. Some of the strongest evidence in support of the theory of plate tectonics comes from studying the magnetic fields surrounding oceanic ridges.
Plate tectonics is the theory that the earth's crust is broken up into plates that float on top of a hotter and more fluid layer below. Evidence to support this theory has been uncovered through the study of the earth's past magnetic field, known as paleomagnetism.
Paleomagnetism. Paleomagnetism is the study of the earth's past magnetic field. It may help you to recall this term if you remember that it is the combination of two words: 'paleo', which means ancient, and 'magnetism' which means exhibiting a
Sci-Tech Encyclopedia: Paleomagnetism The study of the direction and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field through geologic time. Paleomagnetism has been, and continues to be, an important tool in unraveling the past movements of the Earth's, tectonic plates.

Best Answer: Paleomagnetism is the earth's magnetic field as it existed in the past. The magnetic field present in fossilized rocks, created by the earth's magnetic field when the rocks were formed. http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dic...
