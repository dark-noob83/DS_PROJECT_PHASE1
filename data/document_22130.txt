This born to run machine can easily reach speeds off about 70 mph (113 kph) and all it takes for a cheetah to reach its potential is a few strides. Its built for speed body speeds at 10 meters per second and boosts up to 40 mph (64 kph) in about three strides. Due to the huge aerodynamic pressure that comes from the speed, a cheetah can at most run at its top speed for about 600 yards (550 meters) ,exactly why the chase of the cheetah is less than 30 seconds. Cheetahs frequently lose their kill to a larger animal because they need rest before eating.
A cheetah can attain speeds up to 76 miles per hour but can only sustain them for over a distance of approximately 1,500 feet. Cheetahs can accelerate at an amazing rate, going from a standstill position to as fast as 68 mph in less than three seconds. 
The above article does describe how fast can a cheetah run but the actual mechanics behind the speed of the speed king can be found here. 1  Ferrari Enzo accelerates up at 8.0 meters per second, which boosts it from 0 to 60 mph in about 3.5 seconds. 2  Corvette Twin accelerates at 7.1 meters per second. Due to the huge aerodynamic pressure that comes from the speed, a cheetah can at most run at its top speed for about 600 yards (550 meters) ,exactly why the chase of the cheetah is less than 30 seconds. Cheetahs frequently lose their kill to a larger animal because they need rest before eating.
Cheetahs, of course, are built to run faster than humans, regularly clocking speeds of up to around 60 miles per hour (96.5 kilometers per hour). During a photo shoot with National Geographic Magazine, a cheetah from the Cincinnati Zoo named Sarah covered 100 meters and clocked a peak speed of 61 mph (98 kph). 
Cause an Uproar-Cheetahs. The cheetah can run up to speeds of 70 miles per hour, but that's not fast enough to save it from the brink of extinction. 1  Featured Videos. 
70 mph (112 kph). Explanation. A single female cheetah in captivity was accurately timed to run approximately 200 meters in 7 seconds, giving a speed of 29 meters per second (or 64 miles per hour). The cheetah had a running start, and the results are the average of three separate runs with rest in between
The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a big cat in the subfamily Felinae that inhabits most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the only extant member of the genus Acinonyx. The cheetah can run as fast as 109.4 to 120.7 km/h (68.0 to 75.0 mph), faster than any other land animal. In the wild, the cheetah is a prolific breeder, with up to nine cubs in a litter. The majority of cubs do not survive to adulthood, mainly as a result of depredation from other predators. The rate of cub mortality varies from area to area, from 50% to 75%, and in extreme cases such as the Serengeti ecosystem, up to 90%.
110 kph but only for a few seconds at a time. about 100 mph and can run 20 feet per second. That's not right cheetahs run up to 126 mph. Answer. A cheetah can run at speeds of upto 75mph, for short periods of time. OK look. All you have to do is use common sense, is they could run 100 mph but only cover 20 feet then there's know way that's possible. If you broke it down that would be only 35mph.
