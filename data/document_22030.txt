A. Migration, genetic drift, speciation, and natural selection B. Allele change and microevolution C. Slow adaptation, stasis, and expansion. Add your answer.
Gradualism and punctuated equilibrium are two ways in which the evolution of a species can occur. A species can evolve by only one of these, or by both. Scientists think that species with a shorter evolution evolved mostly by punctuated equilibrium, and those with a longer evolution evolved mostly by gradualism.
Which factors are common to both gradualism and punctuated equilibrium? A. Migration, genetic drift, speciation, and natural selection B. Allele change and microevolution C.
One should not confuse punctuated equilibrium with saltationism, however: in both gradualism and punctuated equilibrium, evolution and speciation are gradual processes that take many generations to manifest. Answer 2 Gradualism basically says there is slow change over long periods of time.

To date, what is clear is that both evolutionary patterns â€“ phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium have played at least some role in the evolution of life. Gradualism and punctuated equilibrium are two ways in which the evolution of a species can occur.
