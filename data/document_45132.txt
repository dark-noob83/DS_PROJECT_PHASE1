spatial coherence The extent to which a property exhibits a similar value over some spatial region. Spatial coherence is exploited in some illumination calculations in which a scene is broken down into discrete cells that can each be treated as a single entity. The scene is spatially coherent over each cell.
Consider a wave propagating through space. Coherence is a measure of the correlation that exists between the phases of the wave measured at different points. The coherence of a wave depends on the characteristics of its source. Let us look at a simple example.
Temporal coherence is a measure of the correlation between the phases of a light wave at different points along the direction of propagation. Temporal coherence tells us how monochromatic a source is. Assume our source emits waves with wavelength λ δλ.
Objective To become familiar with the concept of spatial coherence. prelab. 1) You have a Young's interferometer with a slit spacing of 1mm. The measured fringe spacing 1m from the slits is 0.8mm and the visibility (xc) of the fringes is 2.7mm.
