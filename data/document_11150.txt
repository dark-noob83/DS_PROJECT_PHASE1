1 Place the tenderloin in a roasting pan. 2  Place the pan in the oven and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 3  Allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
The National Pork Board recommends cooking pork chops, roasts, and tenderloin to an internal temperature between 145° F. (medium rare) and 160° F. (medium), followed by a 3 minute rest. Since large cuts increase approximately 10° F. while resting, remove them from the heat at 150° F. followed by a 10
1 Place pork tenderloin in roasting pan. 2  Roast for 30 minutes. 3  Turn the pork over and roast for another 25 minutes. 4  The pork tenderloin is ready when the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).
With a pork tenderloin: Season the meat, sear all sides in a very hot pan, and then finish in the oven at 350°F (175°C) degrees until the internal temp. hits 145°F (63°C). Then let it sit for 10 minutes, and cut 'er up. If you need it done faster, a higher oven temp will accomplish this, but may compromise quality.
1 Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices. 2  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist. 3  After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees.
I always season my pork tenderloins, then pan-sear for a crispy brown outer crust, then put into the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes to one hour. At 45 minutes, I begin checking the internal temperature of the meat.
The National Pork Board suggests cooking to a final internal temperature of 160F degrees, which can be achieved by cooking to 155F degrees and removing the tenderloin from the oven to rest 10 minutes (the temperature will rise several degrees).
