Melanoma Definition. Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes-the cells that produce pigment. Melanoma may begin in association with a mole. Melanocytes produce a pigment called melanin that gives the skin its colour and protects it from sun damage. Darker skin has more melanin and more protection.
Melanoma: The most dangerous form of skin cancer, a malignancy of the melanocyte, the cell that produces pigment in the skin.
Melanoma is cancer that begins in cells that become melanocytes, which are specialized cells that make melanin (the pigment that gives skin its color). Most melanomas form on the skin, but melanomas can also form in other pigmented tissues, such as the eye.

Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back.
: a tumor of high malignancy that starts in melanocytes of normal skin or moles and metastasizes rapidly and widelyâ€”called also malignant melanoma, melanocarcinoma, melanoepithelioma, melanosarcoma.
malignant melanoma a malignant skin tumor, usually developing from a nevus and consisting of dark masses of cells with a marked tendency to metastasis. It is not common, but its incidence is increasing and it is the most aggressive type of skin cancer.
