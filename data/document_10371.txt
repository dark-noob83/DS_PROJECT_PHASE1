The chromatin is located in the nucleus of a cell. It contains the genetic material, like Deoxyribonucleic Acid (also known as D.N.A.) Chromatin are tiny little fibers compressed together in the nucleus. It can be likened to a spider's web.
Chromatin structure is also relevant to DNA replication and DNA repair. Easier Definition Mass of genetic material composed of DNA and proteins that condense to form chromosomes in eukaryotic cell division. Chromatin is located in the cell's nucleus. It contains information that controls metabolism and heredity.
Share. By Regina Bailey. Definition: Mass of genetic material composed of DNA and proteins that condense to form chromosomes during eukaryotic cell division. Chromatin is located in the nucleus of a cell. During prophase of mitosis, chromatin fibers become coiled into chromosomes with each chromosome having two chromatids joined at a centromere.

In the nucleus, the DNA double helix is packaged by special proteins (histones) to form a complex called chromatin. The chromatin undergoes further condensation to form the chromosome. So while the chromatin is a lower order of DNA organization, chromosomes are the higher order of DNA organization.
