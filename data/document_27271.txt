Pelvic floor dysfunction refers to a wide range of problems that occur when the muscles of the pelvic floor are weak, tight, or there is an impairment of the sacroiliac joint, low back, coccyx and/or hip joint. These conditions may be due to infections (usually undiagnosed), pregnancy or childbirth, insidious onset, poor posture from chronic low back or SI dysfunction, trauma (e.g. bad fall), or a result of surgery.
