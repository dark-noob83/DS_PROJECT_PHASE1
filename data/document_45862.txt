Home Pump Types Triplex Pumps. Triplex pumps are a type of reciprocating positive displacement pump that is used to move both thin liquids (such as water) and viscous fluids (such as oil).
Save. Pumps are used to move fluid such as a liquid, slurry or gas. Pumps displace the volume of these fluids via mechanical or physical movement. One kind of pump with multiple cylinders is the triplex pump.
A pump piston is a moving component that uses piston rings to create a seal, and transfers force in order to eject or compress fluid in the cylinder. Reciprocating pumps are either duplex (two cylinders) or triplex (three cylinders). These pumps may be powered by steam or air, or via a motor or engine's belt drive.
Reciprocating Pumps. Triplex pumps fall into the category of reciprocating-style pumps. Reciprocating pumps move fluid via one or multiple plungers or pistons. A plunger is a rubber cap and shaf device that uses pressure to release stoppages.
A positive-displacement reciprocating pump that is configured with three plungers. Triplex pumps are the most common configuration of pump used in both drilling and well service operations.
Triplex Pump is a term that refers to a particular kind of Pump, the parts of which are manufactured by different kinds of brands and companies for assisting in oil drilling and extraction. Triplex is one of the varieties of pumps that are available at competitive prices and approved by the American Petroleum Institute.
Triplex pumps are essentially plunger pump with 3 cylinder and 3 heads. They are essentially used for pumping high quantity / low quantity fluid at high pressures. Flow of liquid will be continuous due to the operation of 3 plunger in a cyclical manner.
