Peru is situated along the boundary of two tectonic plates: the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. The interface between these two plates is located near the Peruvian coast. At a rate of about 60 mm per year the South American Plate is moving towards the Pacific Ocean over the Nazca Plate.
Nazca Plate Tectonic Summary. The South America arc extends over 7,000 km from the Chilean margin triple junction offshore of southern Chile, north along the western coast of South America, to its intersection with the Panama fracture zone offshore the south coast of Panama in Central America.
The Nazca plate is a plate, not a plate boundary. It forms a  convergent boundary with the South American Plate, divergent  boundaries with the Pacific and Cocos plates, and â€¦ a  divergent/tansform boundary with the Antarctic Plate. 2 people found this useful. Alyssa Walters.
The Nazca Plate. The Nazca plate is an oceanic tectonic plate in the southeastern Pacific Ocean that shares both convergent and divergent boundaries, corners multiple triple junctions, contains three seamount chains, overrides four hotspots, and is responsible for the creation of the Andean orogeny (Figure 1).
Relative to a fixed South America plate, the Nazca plate moves slightly north of eastwards at a rate varying from approximately 80 mm/yr in the south to approximately 70 mm/yr in the north.
The Nazca Plate is a small oceanic plate off the coast of South America. It has five triple junctions where three different plates come together. It also produced the largest earthquake ever recorded by seismographs. Tectonic Plates in southern Pacific Ocean, USGS.
It marks the plate boundary between the subducting Nazca plate and the South America plate, the region where the oceanic crust and lithosphere of the Nazca plate begin their descent into the mantle beneath South America.
