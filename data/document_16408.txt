A: Amino acids are the building blocks that make up protein. Your body puts them together like Legos to create muscle. While your body can make some from scratch (called non-essential amino acids), you have to obtain others (essential amino acids), from food or supplements. These essential amino acids—especially a certain kind called branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)—are the limiting factor in your body’s ability to build muscle. Here’s more on what the BCAAs are, why you need them, and how to get them into your diet.
Amino acids are stars in the supplement world, hailed as the magic touch for those who wish to build huge amounts of muscle as quickly as possible. While amino acids are important to your muscles, they won't build them for you -- only heavy weight training can do that. Many bodybuilders take multiple amino acid supplements at once, thinking that they are giving themselves a boost, but that's not true.
Leucine, a branched chain amino acid, is a protein stimulus gunslinger. Find out how it works and pull the trigger to build more muscle! Look around the gym and you'll see as many different body types as there are dumbbells.
You get tyrosine from phenylalanine, one of the essential amino acids, so if your diet isn't balanced, you may suffer from a tyrosine deficiency only because your body doesn't have the ingredients to make it -- but it won't make you build muscle faster.
If you want to lose fat or build muscle, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are quite possibly the most valuable supplement in the entire known universe. Take them before and after a workout, as well as between meals, and your muscles will grow larger at a rate faster than you ever thought possible.
Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are found throughout the body. Specifically, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been found to aid in maintaining and building lean muscle mass and increasing energy and endurance during workouts. Leucine, isoleucine and valine are the three BCAAs.
