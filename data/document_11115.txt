According to Fidelity, a family making $55,000 would need to save $48,000 to cover the qualified expenses of a public university and $107,000 to cover such costs for a private one. This translates into saving $160 a month for a public college and $410 a month for a private one. Next, using Sallie Mae data, Fidelity estimated (conservatively, it said) how much in scholarships, grants and family gifts households currently making $55,000, $75,000 and $100,000 annually could expect to receive and subtracted that amount out from the expected cost.
JPMorgan Asset Management's 2015 Guide to Retirement has a handy retirement savings checkpoint guide to help you with that one. To get a crude idea of how much you should have saved, find the age nearest to your age and then go across to the column with the salary nearest to your current salary. Then multiply the number you land on by that salary. For example, this guide suggests that if you're 35 years old and earn $100,000 a year, you should have saved $140,000 by now. Among other things, this assumes you continue to contribute 5% of your salary annually, you retire at age 65, and you die at age 95. 
To get there, the average worker should have saved (in all retirement accounts combined) about a year's worth of salary at age 35, three times at age 45, five times at age 55 and eight times by age 67. For example, a worker earning $100,000 at age 67 should have saved $800,000. When her center has surveyed workers about how much they need to have saved by retirement age, the median answer was $500,000. When asked how they came up with that number, about half said they guessed.
The discount brokerage powerhouse told savers and investors exactly how much they needed to save for retirement at each age milestone. For example: 1  By age 35, you need the the equivalent of one year’s salary saved. 2  So if you make $55,000 per year, you should have $55,000 saved for retirement. 1 So if you make $55,000 per year, you should have $55,000 saved for retirement. 2  Remember, this isn’t your emergency fund or the kid’s college fund! 3  By age 40, you need two years salary
Finally, according to Fidelity, a family making $100,000 would need to save $55,000, or $250 a month, for a public university and $123,000, or $460 monthly, for a private one. (see Fidelity’s site and the image in this post for more details about the full yearly and monthly guidelines). Next, using Sallie Mae data, Fidelity estimated (conservatively, it said) how much in scholarships, grants and family gifts households currently making $55,000, $75,000 and $100,000 annually could expect to receive and subtracted that amount out from the expected cost.
They break the saving retirement goals by the amount of your current salary you should have saved up: For example, by age 35, Fidelity suggests that you should have saved 1X your current salary, then 3X by 45, and 5X by 55. By retirement age, you should have at least 8 times your ending salary. This will help you replace 85% of your pre-retirement income, which is a better rule than saving up a million dollars.
Most retirement rules of thumb focus on how much to save each year (10 to 15 percent is a common benchmark), how much you should have saved by the end of your career or what percent of your final pay you need to live on in retirement (70 to 85 percent is a good target). When her center has surveyed workers about how much they need to have saved by retirement age, the median answer was $500,000. When asked how they came up with that number, about half said they guessed.
By age 35, Fidelity suggests you should have saved 1X your current salary, then 3X by 45, and 5X by 55. So using the previous T. Rowe example, a 45-year-old earning $80,000 should have $240,000 tucked away. A 2012 study done by Aon Hewitt, however, says you need 11 times your final working salary to retire at 65. But you can refine that number further by factoring in your age and how much you’ve already saved. For example, if you’re 45, making $80,000 and have already saved twice that amount, you should aim to save 22% of your salary. (See table below.).
Your salary at age 22 is different then your salary at age 35. Denote salary based on the amount you're getting paid at each particular age. In other words, if at age 35 you earn $40,000 a year, you should have $40,000 saved. If by age 45 you earn $50,000 a year, you should have three times that amount, or $150,000, saved.
