However, this cost is only one aspect of the real cost associated with keeping the truck on the road legally. It has been shown that the average annual cost of operating a tractor trailer for one year is approximately $180,000 per year or $1.38 per mile, depending on the number of miles the truck drives in one year. The cost of fuel is the number one largest cost associated with driving a tractor trailer. On average, a standard passenger vehicle uses 500 gallons of unleaded fuel per year. A tractor trailer uses up to 20,500 gallons of diesel fuel in the same time period.
It has been estimated that 4% of the overall cost to run a tractor trailer is attributable to insurance costs. There are multiple insurance policies required to adequately protect the owner of the truck against liability and will average out to be approximately $6500 per year or $0.05 per mile.
The average cost of a new Kentworth truck varies between as low as 35,000$ for the cheapest and most basic models to up to 100,000$ for the most expensive models.
The total price for a tractor trailer can be $260,000 or even more! The average price for the cab alone (where the engine is, and from which the driver controls the truck) is in the area of $130,000 to $180,000. The cost of the trailer is another $30,000 to $80,000. Some of the reasons a truck is so much more expensive than a passenger vehicle is the ruggedness it requires.
