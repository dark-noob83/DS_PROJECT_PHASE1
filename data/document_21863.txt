osmolality. the concentration of a solution in terms of osmoles of solutes per kilogram of solvent. serum osmolality a measure of the number of dissolved particles per unit of water in serum. In a solution, the fewer the particles of solute in proportion to the number of units of water (solvent), the less concentrated the solution.
The serum or plasma osmolality is a measure of the different solutes in plasma. Among other applications, serum osmolality is indicated to evaluate the etiology of hyponatremia and may be used to screen for alcohol intoxication by means of the osmolal gap.
serum osmolality. a measure of the number of dissolved particles per unit of water in serum. In a solution, the fewer the particles of solute in proportion to the number of units of water (solvent), the less concentrated the solution.
Osmolality is a measure of the number of dissolved particles in a fluid. The osmolality test reflects the concentration of substances such as sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, and urea in a sample of blood, urine, or sometimes stool.
serum osmolality. a measure of the number of dissolved particles per unit of water in serum. In a solution, the fewer the particles of solute in proportion to the number of units of water (solvent), the less concentrated the solution.
Urine osmolality is used to measure the number of dissolved particles per unit of water in the urine. As a measure of urine concentration, it is more accurate than specific gravity. Urine osmolality is useful in diagnosing disorders of urinary concentration such diabetes insipidous and in assessing hydration status.
