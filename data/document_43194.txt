By the Hour. A handyman who works independently will usually charge around $60 to $65 an hour on average. Depending on where you live the actual price range can run from $55 to $75 for an independent operator. A handyman who is part of a larger business can charge up to $125 an hour or more. The $60 an hour handyman who just opened his business will probably take about the same time as the $125 an hour handyman who has 30 years in the business, and both will probably have no trouble on a small job like changing cabinetry hardware.

However, there are professional handyman services that may charge higher, sometimes up to $125 an hour.

And I am the most competitive with regard to rate, experience, and quality. I have set prices for certain items (see pricing below). But as a general rule, I charge a flat rate of $60 per hour for all miscellaneous services (like Honey-do lists etc.) with a $100 minimum. That means if your project takes 1-¼ hours, the charges will reflect this ($75). If you combine services it will reduce the overall price of your projects by up to 20%-25%. 
If you find you are too busy or don't like to do home fixes, we would love to help. We charge $50 per day travel (within our area) and a hourly rate of $40 per hour for professional and organized supply trailer and $25 per hour if helper is needed. Payment will be expected in full when complete. 
If you are just starting out in the trade and don’t have a ton of experience I would start at about $25 per hour. I started at $25 an hour in 2004. I quickly kept raising my hourly rate as my experience increased and I felt I was providing an extremely valuable service to my clients. If one guy charges $15 an hour there’s a pretty good chance that he is only worth $15 an hour (if that). If someone has the courage to charge $100 an hour I’d be willing to bet that he is probably worth that much.
