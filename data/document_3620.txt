The battery is a store of chemical energy. The energy is transferred by electricity to the lamp, which transfers the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the useful energy transfers-we use electric lamps to light up our rooms. But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us.
The greater the gradient, the more energy will be exchanged. Convection is the way heat is transferred from one area to another when there is a bulk movement of matter.. It is the movement of huge amounts of material, taking the heat from one area and placing it in another. Warm air rises and cold air replaces it. The heat has moved. 
work - (physics) a manifestation of energy; the transfer of energy from one physical system to another expressed as the product of a force and the distance through which it moves a body in the direction of that force; work equals force times distance. Energy can exist in a variety of forms, such as electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal, or nuclear, and can be transformed from one form to another. It is measured by the amount of work done, usually in joules or watts. See more at law of conservation of energy.
Energy transfer. Energy transfer is the transfer of energy from one object or material to another. There are a few main ways that energy transfer occurs: ⁕Radiant energy ⁕Heat conduction ⁕Convection ⁕Mass transfer ⁕Electrical power transmission ⁕Mechanical work. It includes the transfer of kinetic energy and the transfer of chemical energy. The transfer of chemical energy from one molecule to another depends on proximity of molecules so it is often used as in techniques to measure distance such as the use of FORSTER RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be saved in various forms. One way to store it is in the form of chemical energy in a battery. When connected in a circuit, energy stored in the battery is released to produce electricity. They can be transferred into other kinds of energy. Energy Transfer. In this diagram, we shall look at a bigger picture of how energy is transferred from one object to another, and from one state to the other.
Energy transferred is the movement of energy from one body to another,for example transfer of energy from hotter body to a cooler body. 2 people found this useful. Edit. 
Important Research. Test Your Knowledge. Energy is transferred from one object to another when a reaction takes place. Energy comes in many forms and can be transferred from one object to another as heat, light, or motion, to name a few. For the blue ball to move to the position of the green ball, energy must be given to the blue ball. This energy would be in the form of motion, with the person lifting the blue ball to a higher level.
