Ventricular septal defect (VSD), demonstrated in the image below, is the second most common cardiac malformation, accounting for approximately one fifth of all congenital cardiac anomalies.
Malalignment VSD is caused by the malalignment (incorrect alignment) of the conoseptal portion of the ventricular septum (the part of the septum which connects to the underside of the valves, results in a malalignment VSD.
A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a hole between the two pumping chambers of the heart. The result of such a hole is that some of the blood returning from the lungs, which should be pumped to the body, is instead pumped back to the lungs.
A ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles (ventricular septum). A VSD can potentially cause a shunting of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle or from the right ventricle to the left ventricle.
Malalignment of the conoseptal portion of the ventricular septum results in a malalignment VSD. This type of VSD causes one of the most common forms of congenital heart disease known as Tetralogy of Fallot.
A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart.
Background. A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common form of congenital heart disease and is one of the most common cardiovascular anomalies in individuals with chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome. However, the frequency of a chromosome 22q11 deletion in patients with a VSD is not known.
A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common form of congenital heart disease, and a VSD is found in 14% to 18% of individuals with a chromosome 22q11 deletion. However, the frequency of a chromosome 22q11 deletion in individuals with a VSD is not well-defined.
