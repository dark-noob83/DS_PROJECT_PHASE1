Almost all the Chinese who came to Australia, came as sojourners with the intention of returning home to their families laden with riches. Although many European diggers had the same intention, the Chinese were criticised for not investing their gold in Australia, but stashing it away to take home to China.
The first major wave of migration to Australia after white settlement was from China in the 19th century. Many Chinese people came to Australia during the gold rush in the 1850s. White Australians were hostile towards them. Sometimes there were riots on the goldfields. Some Chinese people were murdered by white people.
The 'rush' was well and truly on. Victoria contributed more than one third of the world's gold output in the 1850s and in just two years the State's population had grown from 77,000 to 540,000! The number of new arrivals to Australia was greater than the number of convicts who had landed here in the previous seventy years.
