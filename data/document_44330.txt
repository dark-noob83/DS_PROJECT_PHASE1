Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, a disorder in which the body attacks its own healthy cells and tissues. When someone has rheumatoid arthritis, the membranes around his or her joints become inflamed and release enzymes that cause the surrounding cartilage and bone to wear away. In severe cases, other tissues and body organs also can be affected.
In RA, bone may be affected by structural joint damage (erosions) and osteoporosis. The causes of osteoporosis associated with RA are numerous and include the effects of chronic inflammation, the effects of medication and lifestyle factors. Osteoporosis in RA can present in two ways: generalised bone loss or periarticular (around joint space) osteoporosis.
Studies have found an increased risk of bone loss and fracture in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for osteoporosis for many reasons. To begin with, the glucocorticoid medications often prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can trigger significant bone loss. In addition, pain and loss of joint function caused by the disease can result in inactivity, further increasing osteoporosis risk. Studies also show that bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis may occur as a direct result of the disease. The bone loss is most pronounced in areas immediately surrounding the affected joint
Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis often experience pain, swelling, and stiffness in their joints, especially those in the hands and feet. Motion can be limited in the affected joints, curtailing oneâ€™s ability to accomplish even the most basic everyday tasks. When someone has rheumatoid arthritis, the membranes around his or her joints become inflamed and release enzymes that cause the surrounding cartilage and bone to wear away. In severe cases, other tissues and body organs also can be affected.
Osteoporosis is a disease marked by reduced bone strength leading to an increased risk of fractures (broken bones). The Osteoporosis objectives for 2020 track bone mineral density as a measure of the major risk factor for fractures, and hip fractures, the major and most serious of osteoporosis-related fractures. 
The Link Between Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoporosis. Studies have found an increased risk of bone loss and fracture in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for osteoporosis for many reasons. To begin with, the glucocorticoid medications often prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can trigger significant bone loss. In addition, pain and loss of joint function caused by the disease can result in inactivity, further increasing osteoporosis risk. Studies also show that bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis may occur as a direct result of the disease. The bone loss is most pronounced in areas immediately surrounding the affected joints.
Arthritis is a general term for conditions that affect the joints and surrounding tissues. Joints are places in the body where bones come together, such as the knees, wrists, fingers, toes, and hips. The two most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 1  Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful, degenerative joint disease that often involves the hips, knees, neck, lower back, or small joints of the hands. On the other hand, people with RA may be more likely to develop osteoporosis. This is especially true because some medications used to treat RA can contribute to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis and arthritis do share many coping strategies.

Osteoporosis is a common feature in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and may lead to an increased risk of fracture. Patients who fracture are often immobilized for a significant period, and this may have a further adverse effect on bone. The causes of osteoporosis associated with RA are numerous and include the effects of chronic inflammation, the effects of medication and lifestyle factors. Osteoporosis in RA can present in two ways: generalised bone loss or periarticular (around joint space) osteoporosis.
