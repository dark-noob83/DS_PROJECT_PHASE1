Microwave ovens are rated in Watts (W) or Kilowatts (kW) if it is a commercial oven. To find out your oven's running cost, look-up the power output (usually found on the back of the machine or in the manual) then use our energy calculator below to see approximately how much it costs to run per minute.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: A microwave oven putting out 900 watts consumes around 1500 watts. One unit of electricity is 1 kilowatt-hour, so a 1500 watt appliance will use 1.5 kWh or 1.5 units. Electricity is about 7p per unit, so it will cost around 11p to run it continuously for 1 hour.

100 Watts X 1,000 Hours = 100,000 Watts / 1,000 = 100 KWH   100 Killowatt Hours X Electric rate .08 = 8.00 + .50 cost of lamp   Total cost to run that light bulb (on average rated life) is $8.50    That's why the new fluorescent lamps are so cost effective. Do the math.
*based on the Average rate of 15.2p/kWh (September 2014 tariff) for a unit of electricity. Microwaves energy input in Watts is usually more than its output in Watts, please check your user manual. On average a microwave will use 30% to 50% more energy than the rated output.
When you use the microwave you are using 900 watts. You have to know electric utility bill rate is for your location. For this example I will use 10 cents per kilowatt/hour. (1) kilowatt is 1000 watts, 900 watts = 0.9 kw (1) minute = 1/60 hour = 0.01667 hour 0.9kw x 0.01667 hour x 0.10 $/kw/hr = $0.0015 or 0.15 cents. P.S. if you use your microwave during peak hours there could be a demand charge on each kw used.
A typical charge for electricity is a little over 10c per kilowatt hour in the US or 10p in UK The television wi … ll use 1 KWH in about 10 hours so it will cost in the region of 1-2c or 1-2p per hour to run.
