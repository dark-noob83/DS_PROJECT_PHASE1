Biomedical engineers earned a median yearly income of $88,670, while electrical engineers made a median salary of $89,180 annually. Environmental engineers earned a median income of $82,220, while the median income for mechanical engineers was $82,100 per year, reported the BLS in May 2013.
How much does a mechanical engineer make? The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that in 2012, the median mechanical engineer salary was $38.74 an hour, or about $80,500 a year. According to the BLS, most mechanical engineers work full time, though some work in excess of 60 hours a week.
Salary by Specialty. Your salary as an engineer can depend upon your chosen specialization. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), aerospace engineers earned one of the highest annual wages, taking in a median salary of $103,870 as of May 2013 (www.bls.gov).
Job growth for other types of engineers is expected to be slower than average. From 2012-2022, employment growth will be 7% for aerospace engineers, 4% for chemical engineers, 4% for electrical and electronics engineers and 5% for mechanical engineers.
