The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world’s five oceans, followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean. It covers an area of about 155 million square kilometers (about 60 million square miles). One of the Pacific Ocean’s greatest assets is fish, including herring, salmon, sardines, snapper, swordfish, tuna, and shellfish. In 1996, over half (60%) of the world’s total fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Pearls are harvested along Australia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, Panama, and the Philippines.
The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean in the world. It lies mainly in the Western Hemisphere, separating North America from Europe and South America from Africa. It … stretches from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (Antarctica) in the south. The Southern Ocean is the fourth largest ocean covering 7, 848, 000 square miles. The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of all the oceans covering 5, 427
The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean. The Indian Ocean covers 28,900,000 square miles, or 15% of the earth. The Indian Ocean is between Africa on the west and Asia on the north.

The third largest ocean in the world, the Indian Ocean, is surrounded by the Arabian Peninsula and Southeast Asia in the north, Africa in west and Australia in the east. The Southern Ocean has been defined relatively recently, in 2000, and consists of the waters around Antarctica. South China Sea, one of the largest seas after the 5 largest oceans of the world, surrounds hundreds and hundreds of islands. The largest oceans and sea map indicates the name and location of the ten most prominent water bodies on Earth.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest body of water on Earth, covering approximately 155 million square kilometers (59 million square miles), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Located between the Southern Ocean, Asia, Australia and the Americas, the Pacific Ocean occupies about one-third of the Earth's surface. Containing almost twice as much as the world's second largest body of water, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean holds more than half of the Earth's open water supply.
