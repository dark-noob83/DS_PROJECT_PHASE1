A Colles' fracture -- or distal radius fracture -- is often called a ''broken wrist.'' Technically, it's a break in the larger of the two bones in your forearm. The bone breaks on the lower end, close to where it connects to the bones of the hand on the thumb side of the wrist.

A wrist fracture is a medical term for a broken wrist. The wrist is made up of eight small bones which connect with the two long forearm bones called the radius and ulna. Although a broken wrist can happen in any of these 10 bones, by far the most common bone to break is the radius.
The five bones in your hand that connect your wrist to your thumb and fingers are called the metacarpal bones. You have a fracture (break) in one or more of these bones. This is called a hand (or metacarpal) fracture. Some hand fractures require wearing a splint or a cast.
Your fractured (broken) wrist has been placed in a plaster cast to make sure that the wrist is kept still while the fracture heals. The plaster cast will stay on for up to six weeks. Once the plaster cast has been taken off, your wrist will need another six weeks to become fully strong.
