To me, sandalwood is the smoothest and sweetest of all of the wood notes. The sweetness from sandalwood is not like most sweet notes; the only sweetness I can compare it with is vanilla. As both of these notes are creamy, sweet, and have a little spice. They both have the same construction and feel.

What it Smells Like. Sandalwood essential oil provides perfumes with a striking wood aroma. It has a sweet, fresh chypre odor, which is widely employed in the fragrance industry as a base note. It has excellent blending and harmonizing qualities and is valued as a fixative ingredient for other perfume ingredients.

Sandalwood as a note is a striking wood base. It has a bright and fresh edge with few natural analogues. In most perfumes and scents I find it very strong. It permeates a small space easily and can be very heady despite the crisp edge. For me, the scent of sandalwood lingers, smelling like a memory after a time. First and foremost sandalwood represents the earth. A sandalwood scented hero is a man of dirt and woods; he is robust, practical, and worldly. In a word sandalwood is manliness. Secondly, sandalwood represents wealth, luxury, and status because it is scarce, expensive, and refined.
Corey Member. ClubmanRob has a good handle on it, but I highly recommend getting different samples from different vendors if you're interested in the stuff. I have the TOBS Sandalwood shave cream, and it smells a little medicine-y, but fades nicely into a more woodsy smell. It also smells almost nothing like the Sandalwood soap (regular soap, not shave soap) I got from a natural food place. 
Although it is classified as a wood, the scent of sandalwood is a blend of floral and creamy notes. It has none of the raspy sharpness of rosewood or the pencil shaving bite of cedarwood or certainly nothing earthy or damp like vetiver.
