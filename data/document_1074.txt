Cook skinless, boneless chicken tenderloins for 10 minutes or less. These strips of chicken are very thin, so they usually finish cooking in 10 minutes or less. This amount of time also applies to boneless chicken breast cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Boil boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 15 to 20 minutes. Thick chicken breasts will need about 20 minutes, while thinner, flatter pieces and smaller chicken breast halves will only need about 15 minutes.
Instructions: 1  Combine marinade ingredients in a large zip top plastic bag. 2  Add chicken and marinate 30 minutes or longer. 3  Preheat oven to 425° F. 4  Line a large rimmed baking sheet with extra-wide foil (this is only to save cleanup) and place a baking/cooling rack on top. 1 Preheat oven to 425° F. 2  Line a large rimmed baking sheet with extra-wide foil (this is only to save cleanup) and place a baking/cooling rack on top. 3  Or set two 8 x 11 disposable foil broiler pans on your baking sheet. 4  Remove drumsticks from marinade and place on rack. 5  Bake for 45 minutes, turning once after 35 minutes.
Baking the Chicken: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake the chicken, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink inside. You can bake the chicken legs in a 375°F. oven, if desired. Increase the baking time to 45 to 50 minutes. Tip: An accurate way to check chicken doneness is to insert an instant-read thermometer into the thigh, avoiding the bone. It should read 180°F when the chicken is done.
2. Place in a sprayed metal rectangular pan. Spray each chicken leg with non-fat butter cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 35-40 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees and the outside is golden brown.

Bake for 20 to 30 minutes: The chicken is done when opaque all the way through and the meat registers at least 165°F in the thickest part. Broil for extra-crispy skin: If you'd like the skin to be a bit more crispy and golden, turn on the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes. Cooking time is generally 20 to 30 minutes, or until the chicken registers 165°F in the thickest part. Amazingly, all the chicken pieces wind up cooking at about the same rate — dark meat pieces cook a bit slower than white meat, but the thickness of the breast meat means everything finishes around the same time.
Cook for 25-30 minutes more, or until the chicken closest to the bone slices of cleanly. Place the chicken on paper towels to cool and blot for about five minutes before serving. If you are not serving the chicken right away, reheat it in the oven at 475 degrees F for about five minutes before serving.
