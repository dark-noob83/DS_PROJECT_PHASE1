Energy from the Sun is very important to the Earth. The Sun warms our planet, heating the surface, the oceans and the atmosphere. This energy to the atmosphere is one of the primary drivers our weather. Our climate is also strongly affected by the amount of solar radiation received at Earth.
In this video lesson, learn about solar energy and how it affects temperatures on Earth. You will also learn what causes changes in day length and why some parts of Earth experience seasonal differences throughout the year.
Latitude Affects Temperature. One of the primary factors affecting the unequal heating of the Earth’s atmosphere is latitude. Latitude is the measurement of the distance of a location on the Earth from the equator. The further away from the equator that a location resides, the less sunlight that this location receives.
Earth's Shape Affects its Temperature. Let's start with the general temperature on Earth. Imagine this: if you hold a flashlight at a right angle to a surface, you get a uniform, bright circle. Now, tilt that flashlight to a 45° angle and that same beam of light gets spread over a larger area.
Report Abuse. The vast majority of Earth's temperature is based on its distance from the Sun. Compared to absolute zero, the difference intemperature on the night side of a winter location versus the day side of a summer location is still only about 40 degrees celcius difference... virtually nothing when compared to absolute zero.
The climate of the Earth depends on how much of the Sun's energy is retained in the land, sea and air-and how the climate system responds to changes. The major potential influences on the heat retained by the Earth include atmospheric composition, solar radiation and volcanic eruptions.
