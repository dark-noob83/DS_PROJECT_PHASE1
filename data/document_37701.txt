Sateen has been a popular fabric since the early 1900s. Being made of cotton, it is much cheaper than silk satin and is also more durable, as well as being machine washable. In the early 20th century, the material was often used for women's undergarments because of its durability and smooth feel. Long-fiber, combed or carded cotton is used to make sateen. The cotton is then mercerized to bring out a sheen. Mercerization involves soaking the fiber in a bath of sodium hydroxide (such as lye) and then in an acid bath. The result makes the cotton fiber stronger and more easily dyed
Lining sateen is one version of this fabric, although it's not always made with cotton. When used for lining jackets or wraps, it is usually a heavy, luxurious, yet sturdy fabric. It may be made from silk, wool, nylon, polyester, or any other fiber that would produce the type of lustrous fabric required. Long-fiber, combed or carded cotton is used to make sateen.

A satin fabric tends to have a high luster due to the high number of floats on the fabric. Because of this it is used in making bed sheets. Many variations can be made of the basic satin weave including a granite weave and a check weave. Satin weaves, twill weaves, and plain weaves are the three basic types of weaving by which the majority of woven products are formed.

If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen
Sateen is a cotton fabric with a luster resembling that of satin. It is used for sheets and apparel and is known for its soft, smooth texture. The fabric is quite useful and durable, but it can also be more expensive than some other fabrics when produced with a high thread count. Long-fiber, combed or carded cotton is used to make sateen. The cotton is then mercerized to bring out a sheen. Mercerization involves soaking the fiber in a bath of sodium hydroxide (such as lye) and then in an acid bath. The result makes the cotton fiber stronger and more easily dyed
Sateen is a fabric made using a satin weave structure but made with spun yarns instead of filament. The sheen and softer feel of sateen is produced through the satin weave structure. Warp yarns are floated over weft yarns, for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or sateen, the weft yarns are floated over the warp yarns). Standard plain weaves use a one-over, one-under structure.
