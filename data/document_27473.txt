Anti-fouling paint or bottom paint is a specialized coating applied to the hull of a ship or boat to slow the growth of subaquatic organisms that attach to the hull and can affect a vessel's performance and durability. Thin sheets of copper or Muntz metal were nailed onto the hull in an attempt to prevent marine growth. One famous example of the traditional use of metal sheathing is the clipper Cutty Sark, which is preserved as a museum ship in dry-dock at Greenwich in England.

Hull coatings may have other functions in addition to their antifouling properties, such as acting as a barrier against corrosion on metal hulls that will degrade and weaken the metal, or improving the flow of water past the hull of a fishing vessel or high-performance racing yacht.

Bottom paint (aka antifouling paint) is a paint or coating designed to discourage weeds, barnacles, and other aquatic organisms from attaching themselves to (and in the case of wooden boats, eating) the underwater portion of your boat's hull. Although environmental concerns have relegated the most noxious mixtures of yesteryear to the dustbin of history, bottom paint still remains a complex topic. Here's a look at what bottom paint is, its application, and how to find the one that's right for you.
Antifouling is the most common (and arguably the most important) painting job carried out by boat owners. It is vital to protect your boat through antifouling, as once fouling has a hold on your hull it will rapidly colonise the surface, making it difficult to remove. Applying an antifouling paint will prevent the attachment of fouling organisms, such as barnacles, weeds and slime, to the hull of your boat – a fouled hull can cause serious problems, therefore prevention is much better than cure.
