The nucleolus is the nuclear subdomain that assembles ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells. The nucleolar organiser regions of chromosomes, which contain the genes for pre‐ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), serve as the foundation for nucleolar structure. Key Concepts. 1  The nucleolus, whose primary function is to assemble ribosomes, is the largest structure in the cell nucleus. 2  The nucleolus organiser regions of chromosomes, which harbour the genes for pre‐rRNA, are the foundation for the nucleolus.
The nucleolus directs the assembly of proteins within the cell nucleus. The nucleolus is the part of the nucleus containing most of the genes that code for the synthesis of ri … bosomal RNA (rRNA: the RNA molecules found in ribosomes). So rRNA is synthesized within the nucleolus. The Nucleolus is a 'nuclear organelle' inside of the eukaryotic Cell's nucleus. It's primary role is to synthesize messenger Rna which is rapidly exported, via the Nuclear Por … es, to the nearly situated Ribosome peppered Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum.
The nucleolus is contained within the cell nucleus. A nucleolus (plural: nucleoli) is the part of a eukaryote cell where ribosomes are made. Viewed through a microscope, the nucleolus appears as a dark spot inside the cell's nucleus. It is made up of dense RNA and proteins. There is usually more than one nucleolus in a eukaryote cell. The nucleolus is made at a nucleolus organizer region (NOR), which is a chromosome region around which the nucleolus forms. Inside the nucleolus ribosomes are made. Ribosomes are molecular machines that synthesize proteins.
The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. nuclei; from Latin nucleus or nuculeus, meaning kernel) is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types have no nuclei, and a few others have many.

Function of the Nucleolus. Ribosomes are made of two subunits, a large and a small. Each subunit is manufactured separately in the nucleolus. The proteins needed to make them enter the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane. The rRNA is made in the nucleolus itself
The talk page may contain suggestions. (October 2012). The nucleolus is contained within the cell nucleus. The nucleolus (/nuːˈkliːɵləs/ ; plural nucleoli /nuːˈkliːɵlaɪ/) is the largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, where it primarily serves as the site of ribosome synthesis and assembly. 
The nucleolus is the central portion of the cell nucleus and is composed of ribosomal RNA, proteins and DNA. It also contains ribosomes in various stages of synthesis. The nucleolus accomplishes the manufacture of the ribosomes. 
The nucleolus is by far the most easily recognized substructure in the eukaryotic nucleus, and can be seen by using a variety of dyes as well as by phase contrast microscopy. Indeed, in budding yeast, the single nucleolus takes up nearly half of the nucleus. Cells from other species often have multiple nucleoli. The nucleolus is a ribosome factory, composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein.
It is not surrounded by a membrane but sits in the nucleus. The nucleolus makes ribosomal subunits from proteins and ribosomal RNA, also known as rRNA. It then sends the subunits out to the rest of the cell where they combine into complete ribosomes. Ribosomes make proteins; therefore, the nucleolus plays a vital role in making proteins in the cell. Ribosomes are made of two subunits, a large and a small. Each subunit is manufactured separately in the nucleolus. The proteins needed to make them enter the nucleus through pores in the nuclear membrane.
