Share to: Archaea are unicellular prokaryote, an organism of the kingdom Monera (or Prokaryotae), comprising the bacteria and cyanobacteria, characterized by the absence of a distinct, … membrane-bound nucleus or membrane-bound organelles, and by DNA that is not organized into chromosomes.
bacteria eukaryotes organisms domain. Life on Earth can divided into three large collections, or domains. These are the Eubacteria (or true bacteria), Eukaryota (the domain that humans belong to), and Archae. The members of this last domain are the archaebacteria. Most archaebacteria (also called archae) look bacteria-like when viewed under the microscope.
2. Organisms can be classified into one of three domains based on differences in the sequences of nucleotides in the cell's ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), the cell's membrane lipid structure, and its sensitivity to antibiotics. 3. The three domains are the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya. 4. Prokaryotic organisms belong either to the domain Archaea or the domain Bacteria; organisms with eukaryotic cells belong to the domain Eukarya. 5. Microorganism transfer genes to other microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer-the transfer of DNA to an organism that is not its offspring.
Its domain is Eukarya. The rabbit is a mammal, and  all mammals belong to the taxonomic d … omain of Eukarya.  Eukarya covers all organisms in the Kingdom Animalia, as well as  the Kingdoms Plantae, Fungi and Protista.
Actually, there are two DOMAINS of prokaryote.   This are the Domain Archaea and the Domain Bacteria   Archaea comprises archaebacteria which live in harsher conditions … and differ from bacteria in their cell wall composition.
