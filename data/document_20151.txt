DiamondTome. At Zen Lifestyle we use a new method of microdermabrasion – DiamondTome. This crystal free treatment uses natural diamond tipped wands instead of abrasive particles for skin resurfacing. Diamondtome will help to reduce fine lines and rejuvenating the skin without discomfort or down time. This treatment works best as a regular treatment supporting your skin regime – for optimum results we reccommend an initial course of 6, one taken every 10. DiamondTome is however also great as a one-off pick me up to give your skin’s health and appearance a boost.
The DiamondTome™ Skin Resurfacing system with DiamondTome™ Wands is an evolution in microdermabrasion. DiamondTome™ offers a twenty-first century skin care technology for applying the millennia old technique of dermabrasion. Leading plastic surgeons and dermatologist regard the DiamondTome™ system as being more gentle and affective than other exfoliating systems, even at higher settings. The length of the treatment and number of treatments vary depending on skin type and condition.
The DiamondTome system requires no crystals or particulates to create the abrasive action. DiamondTome microdermabrasion uses a wand encrusted with diamond chips and slight suction to exfoliate the upper layers of your skin. 
The clinician must wear a particle mask and client must wear eye protection and remove contacts. The cost per treatment of crystal-based systems is normally $5 - $12 per treatment.
