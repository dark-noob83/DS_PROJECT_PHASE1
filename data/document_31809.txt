45 minutes at 400 degrees F. 60 minutes at 350 degrees F. 90 minutes at 325 degrees F. Place the potato directly on the oven rack in a preheated oven. Place a baking sheet (I put a piece of aluminum foil) on the lower rack (below the potatoes) to catch any drippings. Convection Oven: (about 5 ounces or 150 grams each). 45 minutes at 375 degrees F. 60 minutes at 325 degrees F. 90 minutes at 300 degrees F. Convection ovens cook up to 20% faster than regular ovens. Also, the food in a convection oven is cooked at a lower temperature than in a regular oven to achieve the same results
1 Place in a bowl and coat lightly with oil. 2  Sprinkle with kosher salt and place potato directly on rack in middle of oven. 3  Place a baking sheet (I put a piece of aluminum foil) on the lower rack to catch any drippings. 4  Bake 1 hour or until skin feels crisp but flesh beneath feels soft. 1 Heat oven to 350°F and position racks in top and bottom thirds. 2  Wash potato (or potatoes) thoroughly with a stiff brush and cold running water. 3  Dry, then using a standard fork poke 8 to 12 deep holes all over the spud so that moisture can escape during cooking. 4 
Place the prepared potatoes in the middle rack of the oven. Bake for about 40 minutes and check if they are ready by piercing them with a fork or measure the internal temperature. If required, bake them for another 5 minutes or until they can be mashed easily. In case of smaller potatoes, a 350 °F setting and baking for 40 minutes is ideal. To be more precise, the oven temperature setting is correlated with the potato size and baking duration. The perfect oven temperature for baked potatoes is between 400 - 425° F or 200 - 220° C for medium-sized potatoes. If you are using a gas mark oven, consider setting the temperature to 6 or 7.
Potatoes are best baked in moderate heat. Do not think of baking them quickly, at a very high heat, or you will get uncooked potato flesh in the center and a burnt outer skin. The perfect oven temperature for baked potatoes is between 400 - 425° F or 200 - 220° C for medium-sized potatoes. If you are using a gas mark oven, consider setting the temperature to 6 or 7.
1 Don't preheat the oven. 2  Prick your sweet potatoes each 2-3 time with a fork, then place them directly on the oven rack in the middle of the oven, above the foil. 3  Turn the oven on to 425. 4  Bake for 45 minutes for sweet potatoes/yams that are 2-3 inches in diameter. 1 Turn the oven on to 425. 2  Bake for 45 minutes for sweet potatoes/yams that are 2-3 inches in diameter. 3  For sweet potatoes that are up to 4 inches in diameter, bake for an hour. 4  For super large sweet potatoes, bake for an hour and 15 minutes.
1 Bake the potatoes: You can bake the potatoes directly on the oven rack, or you can place them a few inches apart on a foil-lined baking sheet. 2  Bake the potatoes for 50 to 60 minutes. 3  Flip them over every 20 minutes or so and check them for doneness by piercing them with a fork. 
1 Potatoes may also be baked at lower temperatures for longer times. 2  This process tends to give the outside of the spud a crisper skin. 3  350 degrees F (175 C) for approximately 1 and a 1/2 hours or 375 °F (191 °C) for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes is a good guideline. 4  Cooking times will vary. 
1 Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). 2  Scrub the potato, and pierce the skin several times with a knife or fork. 3  Rub the skin with olive oil, then with salt. 4  Place the potato in the preheated oven, and bake for 90 minutes, or until slightly soft and golden brown. 
Heat oven to 350 degrees and position racks in top and bottom thirds. Wash potato (or potatoes) thoroughly with a stiff brush and cold running water. Dry, then using a standard fork poke 8 to 12 deep holes all over the spud so that moisture can escape during cooking. Sprinkle with kosher salt and place potato directly on rack in middle of oven. Place a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any drippings. Bake 1 hour or until skin feels crisp but flesh beneath feels soft.
1 Heat oven to 400° F. Pierce each sweet potato several times with the tines of a fork. 2  Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil. 3  Bake until tender, about 45 minutes. 4  Make a slit in the top of each sweet potato. Directions. 1  Heat oven to 400° F. Pierce each sweet potato several times with the tines of a fork. 2  Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil. 3  Bake until tender, about 45 minutes. 4  Make a slit in the top of each sweet potato. 5  Top with 1 tablespoon of butter and season with the salt and pepper.
