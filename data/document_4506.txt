Thus, the proportion of collisions that can overcome the activation energy for the reaction increases with temperature. The only way to explain the relationship between temperature and the rate of a reaction is to assume that the rate constant depends on the temperature at which the reaction is run.
In general, what is the relationship between temperature and the reaction rate of a chemical reaction? Weegy: falseThe relationship between temperature and reaction rate is described by the Arrhenius equation, which says that the rate constant of a reaction will vary exponentially with temperature. Get an answer.
As you increase the temperature the rate of reaction increases. As a rough approximation, for many reactions happening at around room temperature, the rate of reaction doubles for every 10°C rise in temperature. You have to be careful not to take this too literally. It doesn't apply to all reactions.
The relationship between oil temperature and flow rate is generally a CONSTANT, ie as the oil temperature increases, the viscosity of the fluid decreases. This would lead to t … he assumption that flow rates would also increase, but that is not the case.
A. The higher the temperature, the slower the reaction rate. B. The lower the temperature, the faster the reaction rate. C. Temperature does not affect reaction rate. D. The low
In general, as temperature rises, so does reaction rate. This is because the rate of reaction is dependent on the collision of the reacting molecules or atoms. As temperature rises, molecules or atoms respond with increased motion, increasing the collision rate, thus increasing the
That's an increase of 1.7% for a 10&deg rise. The rate of reaction will probably have doubled for that increase in temperature-in other words, an increase of about 100%. The effect of increasing collision frequency on the rate of the reaction is very minor. The important effect is quite different. . . The key importance of activation energy.
