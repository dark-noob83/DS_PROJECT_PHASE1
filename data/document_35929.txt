1 The kiddos we serve love TherAplay and so do their families. 2  When we asked in the 2014 patient family survey, “Would you recommend TherAplay to a friend?” 100% of families who completed the survey responded with a resounding Yes. 3  TherAplay, like all United Way agencies, undergoes a major evaluation every four years.
Donate to TherAplay. Equine-assisted physical and occupational therapies work wonders for children with special needs. Of course this innovative treatment comes with a price tag. Each hour of treatment costs TherAplay $200, yet, on average, health insurance reimburses only $80 per treatment hour.
Each year we must raise nearly $500,000 to close the gap between the cost of treatment and reimbursements from health insurance so we can continue to help children with special needs grow stronger and have more opportunities in life. Please make as generous a donation as you can.
