Phenolic Resins. Also known as formaldehyde resin glue, this adhesive is one of the oldest synthetic polymers, first developed in 1872. As one of the least expensive glues, it is generally used to bond thin sheets of wood together to form plywood or wood chip to make particleboard.
I've used contact cement on phenolic backed veneer with good results. I would, however, make sure that the backer is thick enough to be sure that you would not see any telegraphing of the texture of the glue through once you finish up the pieces (of course, high gloss would be the most susceptible to this effect).
any of the adhesives based on novolac or resol phenolic resins. Phenolic resin adhesives are manufactured as liquid compositions and films.
Phenol Formaldehyde resin commonly called a phenolic glue or more simply a “P.F.” glue, means a condensation product of formaldehyde and a monohydrate phenol including phenol itself, cresol and xylenols.
Definition. An adhesive used for bonding exterior plywood. Phenolic resin is produced in a reaction between phenol and formaldehyde. An extender is usually added to the phenolic resin prior to use in the plywood-manufacturing process.
