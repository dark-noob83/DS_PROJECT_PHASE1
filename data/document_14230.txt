Best Answer: Caffeine Adults and children age 12 years and over 100–200 mg no more than every 3–4 hours. In timed-release form, the dose is 200–250 mg once a day. Timed-release forms should not be taken less than six hours before bedtime. The LD50 (Lethal Dose 50% - i.e. the level at which half of an affected group will likely die) nicotine dose for an adult human being is around 60mg. Your numbers weren't way off, just a bit high.
In massive doses, caffeine is lethal. A fatal dose of caffeine has been calculated to be more than 10 grams (about 170 mg/kg body weight) - this is the same as drinking 80 to 100 cups of coffee in rapid succession-not an easy thing to do.
Best Answer: From Wikipedia entry for Caffeine: Extreme overdose can result in death.[61][62] The median lethal dose (LD50) given orally, is 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats. 
http://www.consumergenetics.com/caffeine_test.php. The lethal dose of caffeine is 2 grams of caffeine per day, that is, 80-100 cups of coffee a day. For slow metabolizers of caffeine, the lethal dose of caffeine can be lower
It's dependent on weight & individual sensitivity & estimated to be about 150-200 milligrams/kilogram of body mass. ChaCha on! [ Source: http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-a-lethal-dose-of-caffeine ]. More Answers to  What is a lethal dose of caffeine . The lethal dose of caffeine is 2 grams of caffeine per day, that is, 80-100 cups of coffee a day.
That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two energy shot drinks. Although caffeine use may be safe for adults, it's not a good idea for children. And adolescents should limit themselves to no more than 100 mg of caffeine a day. 
Lethal Dose Table Lethal dose (LD 50) is the amount of an ingested substance that kills 50 percent of a test sample. It is expressed in mg/kg, or milligrams of substance per kilogram of body weight. 
Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day. A cup of coffee contains 80–175 mg of caffeine, depending on what bean (seed) is used and how it is prepared (e.g. drip, percolation, or espresso). Massive overdose can result in death. The LD 50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on individual sensitivity, but is estimated to be 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass (75–100 cups of coffee for a 70 kilogram adult).
Report Abuse. The lethal dose of caffeine is pretty high--40 grams, or the equivalent of 80 cups of coffee. To date, the weight of scientific evidence has established no causal link between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease. The lethal dose of pure nicotine is 40-60 mgs. The LD50 (Lethal Dose 50% - i.e. the level at which half of an affected group will likely die) nicotine dose for an adult human being is around 60mg. Your numbers weren't way off, just a bit high.
The minimum lethal dose of caffeines ever reported is 3,200 mg, administered intravenously. The LD50 of caffeine is estimated between 13 and 19 grams for oral administration for an average adult.
