For a fillet that is about 1″ thickness, bake the fish at 400° for about 10-12 minutes. When using a foil wrap, the fillet should be baked at 375° for about 15-20 minutes. ● Tail Fillet. The tail tip is the thinnest fillet and often the most tender. When baking a tail wrapped in foil, use 375° as the heat setting and bake the fish for 20-22 minutes. ● Salmon Steak. Steaks of course are much thicker than a fillet. For each 1″ of thickness, figure on 10 minutes of baking time. Steaks should be baked uncovered at exactly 400°.
Bake Until Opaque and Flaky. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for fillets or 350 degrees F for a dressed fish. You can bake the fillets at a lower temperature, if desired, but remember to increase the cooking time. Bake salmon fillets or steaks, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness. 
The best way to cook the thicker fillets is to use 400° as the set temperature and bake the fish for 18-20 minutes. If a lower heat is desired, season the fillet and wrap it in foil, sealing it tightly and bake at 350° for about 25-30 minutes. When baking a tail wrapped in foil, use 375° as the heat setting and bake the fish for 20-22 minutes. ● Salmon Steak. Steaks of course are much thicker than a fillet. For each 1″ of thickness, figure on 10 minutes of baking time. Steaks should be baked uncovered at exactly 400°.
Turn on the oven function of the toaster oven and set the temp to about 375 degrees. Clean the sweet potato and poke some holes in it with a fork so the steam pressure doesn't … cause it to explode. Put it in the toaster oven to cook for at least 20 minutes and then check it by poking it to see how soft or firm it is. 
Directions. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Place salmon, skin side down, on a non-stick baking sheet or in a non-stick pan with an oven-proof handle. Bake until salmon is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve with the Toasted Almond Parsley Salad and squash, if desired
Another thing that determines how long the salmon is baked is oven temperature. Typically, recipes for baking salmon call for an oven temperature of 350 to 450 degrees. The salmon should always be put into a pre-heated oven. Cooking in an oven that hasn't been pre-heated can cause drying of the fish. 
RE: What temperature should i cook salmon in foil in a fan oven and for how long? I&#39;m cooking salmon in a fan oven wrapped in foil with some seasoning and olive oil. I was think the temp should be around 180-200 for 15-20 minutes??? I'
Confidence votes 105. If you are asking the oven temp i would say at 350 F is fine. If you have a meat thermometer, i cook salmon to around 160 F so it is still very moist and not overcooked. Wow....this isn't chicken. Simply use a sheet of foil and create a tent over the salmon. I cook fillets at 275F in the oven or on the grill skin side down until internal temp is 135-140. Just when the fat starts oozing out of the top of
When cooking the best investment you can ever make is a $7 thermometer or go all out an buy a $25 digital probe one. 350 is a normal temperature to cook in a oven. Allow the fish to cook and reach an internal temp of 125-130, allow the fish to rest for a few minutes, this will allow th fish to finish cooking. Good luck and remember do cook buy thickness. Cook by Temperature.
