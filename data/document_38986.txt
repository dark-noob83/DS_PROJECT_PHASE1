Eyeshine is a visible effect of the tapetum lucidum. When light shines into the eye of an animal having a tapetum lucidum, the pupil appears to glow. Eyeshine can be seen in many animals, in nature and in flash photographs. This classification does not include tapeta lucida in birds. Kiwis, stone-curlews, the boat-billed heron, the flightless kakapo and many nightjars, owls, and other night birds such as the swallow-tailed gull also possess a
tapetum lucidum. A reflecting pigment layer lying behind the visual receptors of the retina of certain mammals (e.g. cats, dogs), birds and fish, which gives a shining appearance to the eyes when illuminated in the dark. tapetum lucidum. the iridescent reflecting tissue layer of the choroid of some species of animals that gives their eyes the property of shining in the dark. It is characteristic of nocturnal animals and allows incident light two opportunities to stimulate the retinal receptors. Called also choroidal tapetum.
Human's don't have the tapetum lucidum layer. This is present in animal eyes. It's what causes them to glow … in the dark. There sometimes is a rare occurrence when it does happen in humans, which causes them to lose their sight. exists and is an alternate of. Merge this question into. Split and merge into it. Answer by Mmorgen250. the tapetum is blueish and blackish...and edible.....it is good with shrimp and cocktail sauce. it is used in the eye to serve as a cushion for the lens.
tapetum lucidum. A layer of tissue in the choroid of the eye between the vascular and capillary layers in some animals, but not in humans. This membrane reflects light shined into the animal's eyes. tapetum lucidum. the iridescent reflecting tissue layer of the choroid of some species of animals that gives their eyes the property of shining in the dark.

a tapetum is a layer of tissue at the back of an animals eye that is reflective and helps them have better night vision. Humans dont have a tapetum because it is used for night vision and  we dont typically need that funtion. Vertebrates with a tapetum  (the layer of tissue behind the retina) … are typically nocturnal.  Humans are not nocturnal, rather diurnal (active during the day). 1 person found this useful.
FamilyPet The Tapetum Lucidum is the technical term for the reflective layer that lies just beneath a dog’s retina. Anyone who has seen a dog’s eyes in dim light or shined a light into a dog’s eyes in darkness has seen the Tapetum Lucidum. Other animals that have the Tapetum Lucidum include deer, cattle, cats, horses and ferrets. The presence of Tapetum Lucidum in dogs allows them to operate extremely well in low-light situations. Additionally, this trait helps wild dogs such as coyotes and wolves track and attack prey.

The tapetum lucidum, which is iridescent, reflects light roughly on the interference principles of thin-film optics, as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the tapetum lucidum cells are leucophores, not iridophores. The tapetum lucidum is a retroreflector of the transparent sphere type. This classification does not include tapeta lucida in birds. Kiwis, stone-curlews, the boat-billed heron, the flightless kakapo and many nightjars, owls, and other night birds such as the swallow-tailed gull also possess a tapetum lucidum.
