The reference ranges for mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration are as follows: MCH: 27-33 picograms (pg)/cell in adults. MCHC: 33-36 g/dL in adults. Normal values may vary depending on the individual laboratory. A related value is mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cells, or in other words, the ratio of hemoglobin mass to the volume of red cells.
In the routine laboratory test for hemoglobin (Hb), it is usually measured as total hemoglobin and the result is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dl) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. Hemoglobin normal values: Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying pigment in the blood, the predominant protein in the red blood cells.
Normal Adult Female Range: 36 - 46 percent Normal Adult Male Range 41 - 53 percent Normal Newborn Range: 49 - 61 percent [ back to top ] HEMOGLOBIN (HGB) - Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. The ESR (sedimentation rate for short) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment to the bottom of a tube in a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test. Anticoagulated blood is placed in a Westergren tube (it's an upright tube) and the rate at which the red blood cells fall is measured and reported in mm/h.
Normal Adult Range: 80 - 100 fl Optimal Adult Reading: 90 Higher ranges are found in newborns and infants [ back to top ] MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration) - Hemoglobin concentration (hemoglobin amount relative to the size of the cell) per red blood cell. The ESR (sedimentation rate for short) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment to the bottom of a tube in a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test. Anticoagulated blood is placed in a Westergren tube (it's an upright tube) and the rate at which the red blood cells fall is measured and reported in mm/h.

1 Age 2 to 6 years: 11.5 to 13.5 g/dl (mean 12.5 g/dl). 2  Age 6-12 years: 11.5 to 15.5 g/dl (mean 13.5). 3  Female. 4  Age 12-18 years: 12.0 to 16.0 g/dl (mean 14.0 g/dl). An example of normal ranges that is widely accepted by Family Practice physicians is as follows: 1  Birth: 13.5 to 24.0 g/dl (mean 16.5 g/dl). 2  Age 1-2 months: 10.0 to 18.0 g/dl (mean 11.2 g/dl). 3  Age 2-6 months: 9.5 to 14.0 g/dl (mean 12.6 g/dl).
For people without diabetes, the normal range for the hemoglobin A1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes, and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter. If your hemoglobin level is lower than normal, you have anemia. There are many forms of anemia, each with different causes, which can include: 1  Iron deficiency. 2  Vitamin B-12 deficiency. 3  Folate
Normal hemoglobin values are related to the person's age and sex. Normal values may vary slightly between test systems, and which groups of doctors have determined normal values for their group of patients; however, the value ranges are close (vary by about 0.5 g/dl) for almost every group. An example of normal ranges that is widely accepted by Family Practice physicians is as follows: 1  Birth: 13.5 to 24.0 g/dl (mean 16.5 g/dl). 2  Age 1-2 months: 10.0 to 18.0 g/dl (mean 11.2 g/dl). 3  Age 2-6 months: 9.5 to 14.0 g/dl (mean 12.6 g/dl).
