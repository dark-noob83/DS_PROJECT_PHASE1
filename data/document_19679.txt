1. Research the type of grass that grows best in your region. Most grasses are either cool season grasses and warm season grasses. It's important to find out which kind of grass grows best where you live to ensure a healthy lawn all year round.
The small flowers in most grass species are known as florets. Florets grow together in small groups called spikelets, which collectively form inflorescences. Flowers produce the spores that pollinate other flowers, which produce seeds. With any luck, some of the seeds will grow new healthy grass plants.
Habitat. Cotton grass occurs in the U.S. throughout a broad range that spans from south and central Oregon through northern New Mexico, the Great Lakes region and New York. It can also be found further south in North Carolina and Tennessee.
Grass stems, called culms, grow up from the base of the plant (the crown). In most grass species, the culms are hollow and rigid, except at the nodes -- joints that join stem segments together. Narrow leaves extend out from the culms, above each node.
A second type of sweetgrass (Hierochloe odorata) grows in cooler regions of North America. The grass grows in moist meadows, along shady, grassy areras and in mountain canyons. You can find the grass growing in many western states as well as in New Jersey, Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota.
Most lawn grasses grown in New York -- Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, and fescues -- are cool-season grasses. They grow best in spring and fall. The major exception is zoysia grass, a warm-season grass occasionally grown in warmer areas downstate.
