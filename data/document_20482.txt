Distribution. The mountain pine beetle is native to western North America, from northern Mexico to northern British Columbia. It is also present in an isolated population of pine that is surrounded by prairie in the Cypress Hills area of southwestern Saskatchewan, which was likely infested in the early 1980s.
Previous studies reported that in response to warmer temperatures, the mountain pine beetle has substantially increased its geographic range, killing trees 450 miles further north in Canada and 2,000 feet higher in elevation in the Rocky Mountains.

MPB primarily develop in pines such as lodgepole, ponderosa, Scotch and limber pines, and less commonly affect bristlecone and pinon piñon. pines

The mountain pine beetle (MPB) is a native insect that attacks pines in western North American forests. The current MPB outbreak started in British Columbia in the early 1990s. The insect has since killed about 50% of the total volume of commercial lodgepole pine in the province.
