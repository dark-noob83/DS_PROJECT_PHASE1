If you go to a private institution, the price does vary a lot, sometimes $30 - $50 for half an hour. If you go to a company or through your school, they might let you borrow guitars. A nylon acoustic is pretty cheap, it's about $60, it's good for beginners. I'd suggest getting something like that if your serious about lessons.
You can buy a good quality beginner guitar for about $200. For around $300-$400 you can get a fantastic guitar to learn on. That doesn’t mean someone can’t learn on a $100 guitar, but some of the features and the better quality that come with a nicer guitar definitely make for a much better learning experience.
These days you can learn how to play guitar over the internet. Check out Mark McKenzie's guitar video lessons here: http://www.jamoramaguitar.com The videos are very easy to follow and to my surprise extremely helpful even for advanced guitar players. For beginners I would have to say this is a gold mine.

#9. My guitar teacher has an interesting price structure -- $20 for 30 minutes, $25 for an hour. His theory is that lessons should be an hour so he prices to give incentive to go for the hour. He also teaches out of his house, so there's no vig for a music store.

I pay $15 per 1/2 hour, so I would say no that's not a very good deal; but I don't know how your area compares to mine as far as the demand for music lessons and supply of instructors goes.
