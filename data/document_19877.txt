Typically, herbal infusions made with alcohol or vegetable glycerin are referred to as tinctures or extracts. The difference between extracts and tinctures is the amount of herb infused in the alcohol or glycerin. An extract is considered 1 part herb to 1 part alcohol or glycerin. A tincture is considered 1 part herbs to 3 parts alcohol or glycerin. Infusions are necessary with some herbs due to their delicate nature.
A fluid extract (sometimes called liquid extract) is a more concentrated form of herbal medicine than a tincture. A fluid extract is made by combining one part herb with one part fluid, for example, 250 grams of herb to 250 ml. of alcohol. The ratio of fluid to herb for tinctures varies from 3:1 (i.e. 3 parts fluid to one part herb) to 8:1, depending on the herb. There is usually sediment in fluid extract bottles. The bottle must be shaken well to combine it with the liquid. The dosage of fluid extracts is much smaller, usually given in drops.
Best Answer: A tincture is generally made by soaking herbs in 100 proof alcohol for 4 to 8 weeks. An extract is usually made through distillation. Strength usually follows the same path for each herb: Tea, infusion, decoction, tincture, and finally, the strongest of all, an extract.
An herbal extract generally refers to both powdered and liquid herbal concentrates. A tincture is a liquid herbal extract made with alcohol as the solvent. Glycerin can be used as the solvent in place of alcohol. Glycerin based tinctures, however, do not last indefinitely and are not as convenient for use in personal care applications.
