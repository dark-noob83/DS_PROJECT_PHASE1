Hepatorenal syndrome is a condition that involves a progressive form of kidney disease, common process is kidney failure. This would persist and can provide a grave effect on the person’s life by complications. Prognosis. As reported in most or a number of cases with hepatorenal syndrome, the disease process can be very fatal and even cause death. Once a person is diagnosed with the condition, it is believed that the condition’s prognosis is poor.
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a functional, reversible form of acute kidney injury in patients with acute or chronic severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable causes of renal pathology. 
Background. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is the development of renal failure in patients with advanced chronic liver disease, occasionally fulminant hepatitis, who have portal hypertension and ascites. 
Hepatorenal syndrome (often abbreviated HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of kidney failure, termed type 1 and type 2 HRS, which both occur in individuals with either
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a form of impaired kidney function that occurs in individuals with advanced liver disease. Individuals with hepatorenal syndrome do not have any identifiable cause of kidney dysfunction and the kidneys themselves are not structural damaged. Important.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a unique type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced cirrhosis. It is characterized by functional impairment of the kidneys due to vasoconstriction of the renal arteries in the setting of preserved tubular function and absence of significant histologic abnormalities. There are 2 forms of HRS: type 1 is characterized by an acute progressive decrease in kidney function and very short survival without treatment, whereas type 2 features stable less severe kidney failure and longer survival compared with type 1. A liver transplant is the preferred treatment for HRS.
Treatment of Hepatorenal Syndrome. Medications called vasoconstrictors can help with the low blood pressure caused by HRS. Dialysis may be used to improve kidney symptoms. Dialysis filters harmful wastes, excess salt, and excess water from your blood. Preventing Hepatorenal Syndrome. The only certain way to prevent HRS is to keep your liver healthy. To reduce your risk of developing cirrhosis, avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. You should also try to avoid contracting hepatitis. Hepatitis A and B can be prevented by vaccination.
The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50% over the short term, as determined by historical case series. The only long-term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation. The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of kidney failure, termed type 1 and type 2 HRS, which both occur in individuals with either cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure.
The kidney failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney. The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition. The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of kidney failure, termed type 1 and type 2 HRS, which both occur in individuals with either cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure.
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a type of progressive kidney failure. As the kidneys stop functioning, toxins begin to build up in the body. Eventually, this leads to liver failure. It is only seen in people with severe liver damage and is almost always caused by cirrhosis. Preventing Hepatorenal Syndrome. The only certain way to prevent HRS is to keep your liver healthy. To reduce your risk of developing cirrhosis, avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. You should also try to avoid contracting hepatitis. Hepatitis A and B can be prevented by vaccination.
