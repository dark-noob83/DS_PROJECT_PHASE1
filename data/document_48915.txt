It takes approximately five to six half lives for the drug to be cleared from the body. The half-life for fentanyl patches is 9.5 to 12.4 hours. Multiply that by 6 and it could take up to 74.4 hours to clear the drug. You can do the math. Fentanyl lozenges-approx. 7 hours. Duragesic takes a few hours to kick in and is supposed to last up to 72 hours (like how Oxycontin is supposed to last 12 hours) but most people find it lasts 36-60 hours. From my experience I've found fentanyl patches to last about 48-54 hours.
Around two weeks to a month. It all depends on how regularly you smoke, your metabolism/body type, and whether or not you drink vinegar or cranberry juice. If you were to smok â€¦ e marijuana every day for a month, it would take approximately one month for the THC to get out of your system.
Transdermal Fentanyl, the fentanyl patch, has an onset of action of 6-12 hours, that is, it takes this long to get into the system and give pain relief. In case of opioids, the comparision is made not in terms of which is stronger but in terms of the dose which is required to have the same analgesic effect.
Best Answer: Hi, Fentanyl has a half-life of about 7 hours (ie after 7 hours, half the drug remains. After another 7 hours, half of that ....etc). But the patches work by releasing fentanyl into body fats, which then slowly release the drug into the blood stream over 72 hours.
