CERN is a high-energy particle physics organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The organization, founded in 1954, currently has about 20 member countries.
CERN's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research – as a result, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN as a result of international collaborations. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web.

The acronym CERN originally represented the French words for Conseil Europeen européen pour La Recherche (Nucleaire Nucléaire european Council For), nuclear research which was a provisional council for building, the laboratory established By 12 european governments. in 1952
At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. They use the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments to study the basic constituents of matter – the fundamental particles.
