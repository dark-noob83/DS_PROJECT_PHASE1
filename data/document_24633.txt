A recursive formula designates the starting term, a1, and the n th term of the sequence, an, as an expression containing the previous term (the term before it), an-1. The process of recursion can be thought of as climbing a ladder.
adjective. The definition of recursive is using the same formula or operation on a result to create the next result, or repeatedly returning to the same point. 1  An example of something recursive is a computer program that uses the same formula at the end of one line of numbers to create the next line of numbers.
See also Explicit formula. Recursive Formula. For a sequence a 1, a 2, a 3, . . . , a n, . . . a recursive formula is a formula that requires the computation of all previous terms in order to find the value of a n. Note: Recursion is an example of an iterative procedure. See also.
Recursive formula is a formula that is used to determine the next term of a sequence using one or more of the preceding terms.
