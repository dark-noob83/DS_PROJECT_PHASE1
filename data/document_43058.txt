Take the price of the home, deduct the price of the land, and divide that amount by the square footage of the home. For example, if the home is selling for $230,000 and the land costs $30,000, then the construction cost is around $200,000. If the home is 2,000 square feet, then the cost per square foot is $100.

Consequently, a larger home may have a lower square footage cost than a smaller home.
