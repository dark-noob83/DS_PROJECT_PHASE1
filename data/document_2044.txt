1 Carbon Dioxide is transported within blood in multiple forms which include transport as a simple dissolved gas, bound by protein, and a chemically-modified form (See: Gases in Liquids). Transport of Carbon Dioxide in Venous Blood. Carbon dioxide diffuses from peripheral cells into venous blood and is transported to the lungs in three distinct chemical forms. Roughly 10% is transported as a simple dissolved gas. The remainder enters local erythrocytes and encounters one of two fates.
1 List the three forms of carbon dioxide carried by the blood and how they interact to form the total CO2 dissociation curve. 2  Diagram using pertinent chemical reactions how CO2 is processed by red blood cells traversing tissue and lung capillaries. Learning Objectives: You should be able to: 1 
There are three ways in which carbon dioxide is transported in the blood stream: Approximately 5% of carbon dioxide in the blood is transported as dissolved carbon dioxide in … the blood plasma.Approximately 10% of carbon dioxide in the blood is transported bound to haemoglobin and plasma proteins. Share to: Blood transports CO2 from tissue cells to the lungs in 3 forms: 1) Dissolved in blood plasma (7 -- 10%) 2) Chemically bound to Hb (around 20%), it forms a compound named carba … minohemoglobin. This reaction occurs rapidly and does not require an enzyme. CO2 binds directly to the amino acids of the Hb protein molecule
Dissolved Gas. 1  Roughly 5-10% of carbon dioxide is transported from tissues to the lungs in a simple dissolved form. 2  In this process, metabolically-generated carbon dioxide gas simply diffuses into local capillaries, travels to the lungs via venous blood, and is exhaled. Transport of Carbon Dioxide in Venous Blood. Carbon dioxide diffuses from peripheral cells into venous blood and is transported to the lungs in three distinct chemical forms. Roughly 10% is transported as a simple dissolved gas. The remainder enters local erythrocytes and encounters one of two fates.
Carbon dioxide binds with haemoglobin to produce carbaminohaemoglobin. The majority of carbon dioxide in the blood is transported as bicarbonate ions. Carbon dioxide binds with water to form carbonic acid, it then dissociates to form bicarbonate ions.

Some of the carbon dioxide is transported dissolved in the plasma. Some carbon dioxide is transported as carbaminohemoglobin. However, most carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate. As blood flows through the tissues, carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells, where it is converted into bicarbonate. Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the tissues and into the blood, where it is dissolved in the plasma. While some of the carbon dioxide remains dissolved in the plasma, most carbon dioxide diffuses into our red blood cells.

The effect of carbon dioxide in the blood. Haemoglobin can also bind carbon dioxide, but to a lesser extent. Carbaminohaemoglobin forms. Some carbon dioxide is carried in this form to the lungs from respiring tissues. The presence of carbon dioxide helps the release of oxygen from haemoglobin, this is known as the Bohr effect.
Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood from the tissue to the lungs in three ways: (i) dissolved in solution; (ii) buffered with water as carbonic acid; (iii) bound to proteins, particularly haemoglobin. Approximately 75% of carbon dioxide is transport in the red blood cell and 25% in the plasma. Carbon dioxide transport in the tissue is summarized in Figure 1. It combines with water to form carbonic acid. This reaction is very slow in plasma but fast within the red blood cell owing to the presence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.
