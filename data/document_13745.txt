I was a manager there for 2 years.. I only worked in the Sally's company for a total of 2-1/2 years. It was, by far, the worst working experience ever. The only reason why Sally's is still around is because they treat their customers REALLY well. Employees are another story. They do not care about their employees-we can be replaced. Their words. The pay is the absoloute worst. The Co always brags about how much money THEIR making but pay the employees who make that money for them shit, which is why they have a constant turnover in employees.
