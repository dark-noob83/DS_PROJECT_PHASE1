The name of the ship is Tsimtsum. It was a Japanese cargo ship. It was headed to Canada, where the Patel family was to move to. A storm hits the ship but Pi manages to escape on a lifeboat with a couple of animals, including Richard Parker, a tiger.
Part 2 of Life of Pi begins with the sinking of the Tsimtsum. Prior to this catastrophe, Pi has enjoyed the trip immensely, tracking the boat's daily progress with gleeful precision. Then, four days out into the Pacific, some noise, possibly an explosion, wakes Pi in the middle of the night.
Summary. The ship sinks, and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat in the midst of utter chaos. He sees a Royal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker in the water, near drowning, and urges him to save himself. Richard Parker boards the lifeboat and suddenly Pi realizes the danger in sharing a tiny space with a vicious animal. He throws himself into the roiling water. The narrative moves back a few moments to the point just before the sinking of the Tsimtsum. Pi is sleeping when a loud noise, perhaps an explosion, wakes him.
