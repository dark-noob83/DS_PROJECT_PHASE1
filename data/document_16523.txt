The speed awareness course does not involve any type of test. You have been offered the opportunity to attend a speed awareness course because you were recorded driving above the legal speed limit. Although we do have the power to prosecute those who break the speed limit, we would rather persuade drivers to slow down.
You can't suggest that you want to do a Speed Awareness Course, if you are eligible to attend the course you will be notified by the police. The criteria operated by each Police Force in relation to attending SACs differs slightly. The following are the guidelines operated by one police force:
National Speed Awareness course. To attend this course you must have received a letter from the police. Drivers that attend this course significantly reduce their chances of being involved in a crash and of being caught for the same offence in the next 2 to 3 years.
The National Speed Awareness Scheme is run throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland by a selection of training providers. To view all course locations that are available nationally please visit offer.ndors.org.uk. You will need your driving licence number to hand.
The speed awareness course is an educational presentation that lasts approximately four hours. The workshop takes place in a classroom based scenario with up to 23 other motorists.
High speed offences and drivers who have already completed a Speed Awareness Course or What Driving Us course in the last 3 years, will not be eligible to take another course of the same kind. A driver cannot request to attend a Driver Behavour Course.
