Other stories say foot binding began during Tang times. Whenever it started, it was a barbaric practice. Young girls, between the age of 5-7, had their toes tucked under their feet, and then had their feet wrapped in long pieces of cloth to hold their toes in place.
Eight years ago, Farrell, curious if the practice of foot binding still existed, asked a friend in China, who in turn asked her sister, who was overheard by her car driver. The driver revealed that he had a grandmother with bound feet. It was this elderly woman, Zhan Yun Ying, who would become Farrell’s first subject.
In rural China, where the neon lights of the country’s big cities don’t shine, traces of the old country remain—hidden in tiny shoes. Foot binding, the cruel practice of mutilating the feet of young girls, was once pervasive in turn-of-the-century China, where it was seen as a sign of wealth and marriage eligibility. For a millennium—from the 10th to 20th centuries—the practice flourished on and off, deeply ingrained in Chinese society.
History. The practice of Chinese foot binding began during the rule of Li Yu when the emperor became attracted to a concubine who had bound her feet tightly for a dance routine. It was originally confined to the imperial court, but later spread to cities and villages.
Women wanted ever-smaller, more curved feet, and so the foot binding process was created to achieve highly arched, 3-inch (7.6-centimeter) feet. The practice thrived for 1,000 years until it was outlawed in 1912 after the revolution of Sun Yat-sen.
Results of Bounded Feet. The practice of foot binding does not have an actual date of when it started; however there are many legends as to when the practice began and why. Foot binding was first reported during the Five Dynasties and Ten States period in the tenth and eleventh century.
