Enhanced File Allocation Table utilizing a 28-bit binary system, first used in Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98, that saves disk space by using 4k Cluster. See FAT32 Page for extended information about FAT32. Today, later versions of Microsoft Windows, such as Windows XP, Vista, and 7 are using NTFS and not FAT.
Short for File Allocation Table, FAT is a method of keeping track of the contents of a hard drive used by early Microsoft operating systems. The table is a chart of numbers that correspond to cluster addresses on the hard drive.

1. FAT. The traditional DOS filesystem types are FAT12 and FAT16. Here FAT stands for File Allocation Table: the disk is divided into clusters, the unit used by the file allocation, and the FAT describes which clusters are used by which files. Let us describe the FAT filesystem in some detail.
The file allocation table contains the following types of information about each cluster on the volume (see example below for FAT16): 1  Unused (0x0000). 2  Cluster in use by a file. 3  Bad cluster (0xFFF7). 4  Last cluster in a file (0xFFF8-0xFFFF).

File Allocation Table (FAT). FAT is a file system produced by Microsoft, Seattle Computer Products (SCP), Novell, Digital Research, Compaq and IBM. There are a few types of FAT, each being supported or not supported by Linux.
