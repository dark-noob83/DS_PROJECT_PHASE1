Abstract. Background and Purpose —The presence of early x-ray hypoattenuation is an important selection criterion for thrombolytic therapy. However, knowledge about the pathophysiological constellation reflected by this hypoattenuation is lacking. Our objective was to study the relationship between the presence of early CT hypoattenuation and the volumes of critical cortical hypoperfusion.
CTs were scrutinized for the presence of hypoattenuation. On the PET scans, the volumes of critical cortical hypoperfusion were assessed. RESULTS: CT hypoattenuation was present in 18 patients (56%), all of whom had critical cortical hypoperfusion and developed infarction.
A hypoattenuating lesion is a type of abnormal tissue that can show  up on computed tomography. On the scan, the lesion shows up as  brighter and whiter than what is conside … red normal. The lesion can  indicate an array of medical issues and it warrants further  investigation.
Solving the world's problems. . . one answer at a time. Hypoattenuation is a term used to describe areas that show up as whiter and brighter than normal on an x-ray or CT Scan. Hypoattenuating lesions are commonly referred to in regards to the liver or kidneys. If your doctor looks on your CT scan and spots an area on your kidney or liver that is whiter or brighter than it should be, this is a hypoattenuating lesion.
