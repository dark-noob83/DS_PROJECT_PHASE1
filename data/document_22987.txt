Monogastric vs Ruminant. Mammals, being the most developed organisms, possess highly sophisticated digestive systems to feed on a variety of food types available in the world. Monogastric and ruminants are the two main types of mammals based on their types of digestive systems. Monogastrics are the organisms with a simple and single-chambered stomach in their digestive system. The most obvious example for a monogastric would be the humans; however, there are many other organisms of this type such as all the omnivores and carnivores.
The digestive system. The digestive system is one of the body's major organ systems. All animals-with the exception of some endoparasites such as tapeworms-have a digestive system. In this section we're going to look at digestion in ruminants, and compare their guts with those of other, non-ruminant, mammals. Animals with monogastric digestion are still able to digest some of the cellulose in their diet, by way of symbiotic gut bacteria. However, their ability to extract energy from cellulose digestion is less efficient than in ruminants.
The pig has a digestive system which is classified as monogastric or nonruminant. Humans also have this type of digestive system. They have one stomach (mono = one, gastric = stomach). The monogastric differs from that of a polygastric or ruminant digestive system found in cattle and sheep. These animals have one stomach broken into four compartments. Due to the differences in the digestive systems, cattle can utilize different types of feeds than pigs.
Components of the ruminant digestive system. The digestive system of a typical ruminant or a forestomach fermentator, has three compartments prior to reaching the fourth or true stomach (Fig. 5-3). These are the reticulum, the rumen, the omasum and then the abomasum or equivalent to the stomach in monogastric species. The reticulum. Advantages and disadvantages of the fermentative process for digestion. Carbohydrates, such as glucose, are converted to VFA, while the amino acids are usually deaminated. The carbon skeletons of amino acids are also used for VFA production and their nitrogen is reused for new amino acids (Fig. 5-6).

Making the world better, one answer at a time. While there are more advantages than disadvantages of a monogastric digestive system, there are still disadvantages that exist. Animals with a monogastric digestive system are unable to extract energy from the cellulose that they consume in their foods. The main parts of the digestive system are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, gull bladder, and pancreas. Food does not actually pass thro … ugh the liver, gull bladder and pancreas, but they do produce a green liquid called bile that helps digestion
Transcript of Monogastric Digestion. Monogastric Digestive System The mouth is the begining of the digestive process.It is considered mechanical and chemical digestion. The Pharynx and esophogus are tubes leading to the stomach
• Monogastrics have a single-chambered stomach, but ruminants have a four-chambered stomach. • Ruminants are always herbivores while monogastrics show all types of food habits. • The digestive system of ruminants is more efficient than the monogastric system in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. • Ruminants regurgitate the ingested food during digestion, but monogastrics do not. • Ruminants are foregut fermenters while monogastric herbivores are hindgut fermenters. Monogastrics are the organisms with a simple and single-chambered stomach in their digestive system. The most obvious example for a monogastric would be the humans; however, there are many other organisms of this type such as all the omnivores and carnivores.
