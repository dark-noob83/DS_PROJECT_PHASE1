Planting Plan. Choose a sunny location for fastest flowering; marigolds do fine in up to 20 percent shade, but take longer to bloom. Use a small garden rake to break up soil, and remove any weeds or rocks. Place seeds 6 inches apart. Cover with 1/4 inch of fine soil. Tamp down lightly, and soak gently so that seeds aren't displaced.
Depending on the variety, marigolds can grow 8 to 40 inches tall, and develop blooms that can range in size from 1 to 5 inches. For germination within about five to 10 days, start the seeds indoors six weeks before the last spring frost and expose them to ideal conditions.
1 Marigolds need lots of sunshine. 2  Though they grow in almost any soil, marigolds thrive in moderately fertile, well-drained soil. 3  Sow them directly into the garden once the soil is warm, or start seeds indoors about a month to 6 weeks before the last spring-frost date.

Marigolds take around 45 to 50 days to flower after you plant seeds, so seeds sown in early April should flower by May.
This will improve soil drainage and fertility. Plant marigold seeds in the soil 1/4 inch deep and water the area deeply. The appropriate spacing for marigolds depends on the mature size of the plant. French marigolds (Tagetes patula) are smaller plants and can be spaced 6 to 9 inches apart.
