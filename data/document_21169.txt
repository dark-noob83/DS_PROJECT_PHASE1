When Gemfire fell into the hands of the now current King of Ishmeria, Eselred, he sought to abuse the object's power, using it to embark on a tyrannical reign, instilling fear within his oppressed subjects. Ishmeria fell into despair as his power flourished. The object in the game is to unify a fictional island by force. Players use soldiers and knights, as well as fantasy units such as magicians, dragons or gargoyles in order to capture the castle needed to control that particular territory.

GemFire Enterprise (GFE) is a high-performance, distributed data management platform that serves as the core component of the GemFire Enterprise Data Fabric (EDF). A Distributed System (DS) is formed when a set of GFE instances are clustered, typically over a LAN, to provide the collective data storage and replication behavior (although a single process may run as its own Distributed System).
GemFire is a distributed in-memory data grid for OLTP applications. It is backed by a robust, shared-nothing persistence architecture that guarantees the performance of in-memory and the reliability of disk. By combining data redundancy, GemFire provides the best-of-breed, high availability for data. 
In-Memory Data Grid. Pivotal GemFire® stores all operational data compressed and in-memory to avoid disk I/O time lags. Nodes operate in a cluster, optimizing data distribution and processing, to ensure the highest speed and balanced utilization of system resources. Pivotal GemFire supports user defined object models in complex graphs, as well as documents in JSON format. Data can be accessed in native clients for Java, C++ and C#, as well as applications supporting REST calls.
GemFire provides the same basic functionality of a database: data access, querying, indexing, server-side functions, transactions and archival persistence. Because GFE is designed to run in the memory space of applications, it exposes data as ready-formed objects, rather than disjointed tables. A Distributed System (DS) is formed when a set of GFE instances are clustered, typically over a LAN, to provide the collective data storage and replication behavior (although a single process may run as its own Distributed System).
In short, they turn to VMware’s vFabric GemFire. GemFire is a distributed in-memory data grid database software product that enables data distribution, data replication and partitioning (sharding), cashing data management at the exact moment the information is needed. (See also What's Next For Taming Big Data.). GemFire is well-designed for latency-sensitive applications such as virtualized environments that may require interrupt-moderation or interrupt-throttling-industry terms that IT developers and database deployers use when building a system that potentially doesn't take well to lags in data flow or processing.
GemFire supports pub-sub by keys, wildcarding on key-based subscriptions, and also content-based continuous query capability wherein you submit a where clause into the distributed system, which is evaluated in real-time as data changes, and delivers deltas based on the evaluation of the where clause. A Distributed System (DS) is formed when a set of GFE instances are clustered, typically over a LAN, to provide the collective data storage and replication behavior (although a single process may run as its own Distributed System).
Gemfire (ロイヤルブラッド, Royal Blood) is a fantasy strategy with rough European and Celtic inspirations. It was distributed during a time when Koei was known primarily for basing its creations on historical events or famous fictional works. 
Thus, the GemFire sys-tem is very useful in applications where operational data size can grow to unknown size and/or the rate of data change is high. Scaling a peer-to-peer system A peer-to-peer system offers low latency, one-hop data distribution, dynamic discovery, and transparency of location. This is a federated approach to caching data for a very large number of consumers and is a highly-scalable topology. Applications use the client-server topology to host the data in one or more GemFire 'cache servers'.
