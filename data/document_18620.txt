OBSIDIAN-Formed from rapid cooling of felsic lavas, high in silica and aluminum. Obsidian is an extrusive igneous rock, formed from the extremely rapid cooling of felsic lava which includes orthoclase, quartz, and mica.
Obsidian is an igneous rock that forms when molten rock cools very rapidly. The result is a rock that cooled so fast, crystals did not get a chance to form. Obsidian is a volcanic glass with a smooth and uniform structure.
Obsidian is an igneous rock that forms when molten rock material cools so rapidly that atoms are unable to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure. It is an amorphous material known as a  mineraloid ..
Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock. It is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimum crystal growth.
Obsidian is formed from the extreme rapid cooling of lava. The rock has been named 'volcanic glass' as it is very smooth and is also translucent. The rock is igneous as it is … formed from lava. 8 people found this useful.

Obsidian is a volcanic glass, meaning that the mineral constituents from which it formed did not have time to crystallize due to the rapid cooling.
