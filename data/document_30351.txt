If the air temperature cools to the dew point, or if the dew point rises to equal the air temperature, then dew, fog or clouds begin to form. At this point where the dew point temperature equals the air temperature, the relative humidity is 100%.
or condensation point is the temperature at which a parcel of air must be cooled at constant pressure and humidity mixing ratio until it reaches saturation, and at which condensation of water vapor forms either as dew, cloud droplets, ice crystals, mist or fog. All air has some water vapor in it.
If there is then further cooling of the air, say because the air parcel is rising to higher (and thus colder) levels in the atmosphere, even more water vapor must condense out as additional dew, fog, or cloud, so that the dew point temperature then falls along with the air temperature.
The dew point is the temperature at which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled, at constant barometric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation temperature. The dew point is associated with relative humidity.
Suppose that the temperature of a rising air parcel is 350C and the dew point 270C. At first the parcel is buoyant and rises freely. The rising air in the parcel expands and cools at the dry adiabatic rate. The dew point also drops but not as rapidly as the air temperature due to the decrease in air pressure.
Dew Point Monitors. The dew point is the temperature at which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled, at constant barometric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation temperature. The dew point is associated with relative humidity.
Dew point is closely linked to relative humidity, which is the ratio of the pressure of water vapor in a parcel of air relative to the saturation pressure of water vapor in that same parcel of air at a specific temperature. Relative humidity (RH) is expressed as a percentage.
