part of the hardware glossary a barcode reader also called a price scanner or point of sale pos scanner is a hand held or stationary input device used to capture and read information contained in a bar code a barcode reader consists of a scanner a decoder either built in or external and a cable used to connect the reader with a computer there are five basic kinds of barcode readers pen wands slot scanners charge couple device ccd scanners image scanners and laser scanners a pen wand is the simplest barcode reader it contains no moving parts and is known for its durability and low cost
a barcode is an optical machine readable representation of data relating to the object to which it is attached originally barcodes systematically represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines and may be referred to as linear or one dimensional 1d 
most barcode scanners have the ability to read code 128 barcodes by default such as the idautomation usb barcode scanner this scanner dependably reads the idautomation code 128 barcode font and universal barcode font when printed as small as 6 points which is an x dimension of 4 mils symbol size according to gs1 128 specifications the height of the barcode should be 15 % of the length or 0 50 inch 1 3 cm whichever is greater the x dimension may range from 10 mils 025 cm to 40 mils 1 cm
upc universal product code is a numeric symbology used in retail applications upc has two variations an 11 digit upc type a barcode and and 6 digit upc type e barcode a check digit is automatically calculated by the barcode generation software in both upc variations upc type e upc e upc e is a smaller seven digit upc symbology for number system 0 it is often used for small retail items for upc e barcodes you normally specify 6 digits and let your barcode printing software calculate the seventh check digit for you
upc type a upc a upc a symbols consist of 11 data digits and one check digit the first digit is a number system digit that normally represents the type of product being identified the following 5 digits are a manufacturers code and the next 5 digits are used to identify a specific product upc type e upc e upc e is a smaller seven digit upc symbology for number system 0 it is often used for small retail items for upc e barcodes you normally specify 6 digits and let your barcode printing software calculate the seventh check digit for you
1d vs 2d barcodes there are two types of barcodes linear or 1d and 2d the most visually recognizable the upc universal product code is a linear 1d barcode made up of two parts the barcode and the 12 digit upc number the first six numbers of the barcode is the manufacturer s identification number barcodes work through the combination of a symbology the barcode and a scanner that can read the symbols and convert them into useful information often information about an item s origin price type and location
a bar code often seen as a single word barcode is the small image of lines bars and spaces that is affixed to retail store items identification cards and postal mail to identify a particular product number person or location a barcode reader is used to read the code the reader uses a laser beam that is sensitive to the reflections from the line and space thickness and variation
the most common method of reading code 128 barcodes is with a linear barcode scanner most of the barcode scanners recommended by idautomation perform keyboard emulation and receive power from the usb port so no external power supply is required symbol size according to gs1 128 specifications the height of the barcode should be 15 % of the length or 0 50 inch 1 3 cm whichever is greater the x dimension may range from 10 mils 025 cm to 40 mils 1 cm
