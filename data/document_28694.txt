The Bologna process for standardisation of European higher education specified an undergraduate degree of at least three years called the licence or bachelor's degree, followed by a two-year diploma called the master's degree, then a doctorate, meant to be obtained in at least 3 years. In Belgium, possessing a master's degree means that one has completed a higher education (usually university or college) programme of 4 or 5 years.
