answers best answer the female may be gathering a clutch of eggs before sitting she may lay a clutch of five and start sitting from the second or third egg that way the babies will hatch 2 after 18 21 days and then every second day the problem with brooding the egg yourself is that the baby is very tiny when he hatches and will need to be fed every 1 1 2 hours round the clock the hen will sit on the eggs after she has laid a few you do not need a heated light 
laying eggs parakeet egg laying will start in about one or two days after the mating female parakeet will lay an egg every second day and there will be approximately 4 to 9 of them she will do that for about 18 to 19 days when the first bird should hatch the eggs need to be in a temperature close to the body temperature of the mommy parakeet that would be 40 to 43 degrees celsius 104 to 110 degrees fahrenheit
while waiting for eggs to hatch only the female will sit on them she will do that for about 18 to 19 days when the first bird should hatch the eggs need to be in a temperature close to the body temperature of the mommy parakeet that would be 40 to 43 degrees celsius 104 to 110 degrees fahrenheit
answers best answer if the parakeets mate died then chances are the eggs are not fertile they generally lay fertile eggs 3 10 days after mating as for your second pair it is possible they are fertile they can take 18 20 days to hatch from the date they start incubating not from the date they are laid they usually do not start incubating until at least 3 of the eggs are laid you can check if the eggs are fertile by using an led penlight if you don t have one a regular pen flashlight will work
