Runny nose (rhinorrhea) is a common symptom of heavy nasal discharges. This symptom can be super heavy in some people. It can be caused by an allergy, infection (e.g., cold or flu), inflammation, or physical irritation. Inflammation of the nose (called rhinitis) is a common cause of the runny nose. Other common causes include the common cold (upper respiratory infection), influenza (flu), and sinusitis (inflammation or infection of the sinuses). The running nose may be accompanied by redness, itching and/or sneezing.
This triggers swelling in the nasal passages and the production of excess mucus. As well as a runny nose with clear discharge, as you have, it can also cause sneezing, nasal congestion, or itching.Less common is chronic non-allergic rhinitis. People with this also have a constant runny nose, but there is no identifiable allergy causing the symptoms and usually no noticeable itching and sneezing.
A viral infection (the common cold) is the most common cause of a stuffy and/or runny nose, but allergies, influenza, and sinus infections also may cause these symptoms. Less commonly, anatomical obstructions (e.g. a deviated nasal septum, foreign bodies) may lead to nasal congestion.
When the sinuses are inflamed, it can cause a number of symptoms, including constant runny nose, loss of smell, cough, bad breath, fever, headache, nasal congestion, fatigue and sore throat.

In younger people, for example, a chronic runny nose, along with other symptoms such as congestion or sneezing, could be a symptom of allergies, a condition called allergic rhinitis. Or, as you mention, it is sometimes linked to non
