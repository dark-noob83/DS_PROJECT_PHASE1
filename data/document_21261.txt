Psychiatrists. Psychiatrists tend to make significantly more money than most psychologists. The average salary of a psychiatrist in the United States was $174,170 as of 2011, and half of all psychiatrists reportedly made more than $170,350 per year.
A psychiatrist's salary is definitely higher than that of a psychologist because of the difference in treatment procedures adopted by both. A psychiatrist can earn anywhere between US $50,000 - US $100,000. These figures can go up to as high as US $200,000 a year with increased experience.
A psychologist's average salary may differ based on the specialized field. For instance, a clinical psychologist's salary is higher than that of a sports or school psychologist. A psychologist may make anywhere between US $50,000 - US $95,000 based on specialization.
