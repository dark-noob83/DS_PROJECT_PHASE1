Deltas. When a river reaches a lake or the sea the water slows down and loses the power to carry sediment. The sediment is dropped at the mouth of the river. Some rivers drop so much sediment that waves and tides can't carry it all away. It builds up in layers forming a delta. Some deltas are so large that people can live on them. The Nile delta is a very important farming area in Egypt. Deltas have a fairly flat section called a delta plain that is above water. The river cuts many small channels through the delta plain.
A river delta is formed from the deposition of sediments carried by a river as the river enters an ocean, sea, lake, or another river. This is because the flow velocity decrea … ses significantly and the fluid loses the ability to transport sediment. A delta is formed when sediments and mud from a large river meet the salt water of a sea or ocean. It can be described as a low tract of alluvial land. Deltas often change in size based on ocean and river currents. A delta forms a mouth at the end of a lake.This makes it to where the lake can flow into the ocean.
A river delta is a land form that forms at the mouth of a river,  where the river flows into an ocean, sea, estuary, lake or  reservoir. They are formed from the deposition … of the sediment  carried by the river as the flow leaves the mouth of the river in  smaller channels and dis-tributaries.

A river delta is the structure at the mouth of a river that is formed by silt as the river reaches the ocean (or other large body of water). Here the water from the river slows considerably and the silt it is carrying begins to fall away. slide 1 of 6. 
A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or standing water. This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or (more rarely) another river that cannot transport away the supplied sediment. Despite a popular legend, this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus. Once a wave-or river-distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there's a lot of water around – such as floods or storm surges. These distributaries slowly silt up at a pretty constant rate until they fizzle out.
A river delta is low-lying plain or landform that occurs at the mouth of a river near where the river flows into the ocean or other body of water. Deltas are important to both human activities and fish and other wildlife because they are normally home to very fertile soil as well as a large amount of vegetation. The upper delta plain is the area nearest to the land. It is usually the area with the least water and highest elevation. The subaqueous delta is the portion of the delta that is closest to the sea or body of water into which the river flows. This area is usually past the shoreline and it is below water level.
Deltas are formed from the deposition of the sediment carried by the river as the flow leaves the mouth of the river in smaller channels called distributaries. Over long periods of time, this deposition builds the characteristic geographic pattern of a river delta. Conditions required to form deltas. 1. A delta is formed when sediments and mud from a large river meet the salt water of a sea or ocean. It can be described as a low tract of alluvial land. Deltas often change in size based on ocean and river currents. A delta forms a mouth at the end of a lake.This makes it to where the lake can flow into the ocean.
Save. River deltas are little streams that branch out from the mouth of the river into a sea, lake or ocean, giving it the appearance of an uprooted tree. Many of the world&#039;s biggest rivers also have river delta formations, including the Nile and Mississippi rivers. Formation. Deltas form when the mouth of the river enters the sea or ocean, depositing gravel, sand, clay and silt around the mouth. This causes the deposits to build in layers around the river&#039;s mouth, building a platform called an alluvium.
