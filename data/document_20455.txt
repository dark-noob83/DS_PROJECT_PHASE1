A tool that you can use to convert coordinates from degrees, minutes, and seconds to decimal degrees is available at the following U.S. Government Web site: To convert Seconds to decimals, divide by 3600. As an example, a latitude of 122 degrees 45 minutes 45 seconds North is equal to 122.7625 degrees North.
Degrees, Minutes, Seconds, and Decimals There are two different ways we can use degrees. One is a decimal measure, such as 24.5 degrees. The other is in degrees, minutes, and seconds, such as 24 degrees 30 minutes. As imagined, decimal degrees are useful when we are using a calculator. Degrees, minutes, and seconds are used for things like latitude and longitude on topographic maps.
Degrees, Minutes, Seconds to Decimal Degrees calculator and vice-versa. Overwrite the default numbers in the bright blue boxes below with the latitude or longitude of your location. Input positive numbers only (e.g. 0 to 360 deg).
How to convert decimal degrees to degrees,minutes,seconds. One degree (º) is equal to 60 minutes (') and equal to 3600 seconds (): 1º = 60' = 3600. The integer degrees (d) are equal to the integer part of the decimal degrees (dd): d = integer(dd). The minutes (m) are equal to the integer part of the decimal degrees (dd) minus integer degrees (d) times 60: m = integer((dd-d) × 60). The seconds (s) are equal to the decimal degrees (dd) minus integer degrees (d) minus minutes (m) divided by 60 times 3600: s = (dd-d - m/60) × 3600.
Decimal degrees (DD) express latitude and longitude geographic coordinates as decimal fractions and are used in many geographic information systems (GIS), web mapping applications such as OpenStreetMap, and GPS devices. Decimal degrees are an alternative to using degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS). As with latitude and longitude, the values are bounded by ±90° and ±180° respectively. Positive latitudes are north of the equator, negative latitudes are south of the equator.
