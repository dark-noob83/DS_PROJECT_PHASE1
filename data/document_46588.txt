Bran is most famous for Bran Castle [1] , which is more commonly referred to and marketed as Dracula's Castle. In reality, Vlad Tepes never called that castle home, and it is unknown whether he even visited. The exterior of the castle is truly impressive; inside, it is a bit of a disappointment.
Bran Castle, in Transylvania, modern day Romania, conjures up one name in most people's minds. Dracula! In actual fact, Bran Castle isn't quite as closely linked to Dracula as you might imagine (or the tourist-touts might tell you). Dracula, of course, is a fictional vampire created by Bram Stoker in 1897. The castle depicted in the novel Dracula matches some parts of Bran Castle-but it's far from being an exact match. The character of Dracula was, however, based on a real individual-Vlad the Impaler. Vlad's cruelty and bloodlust was truly inhuman-stranger than fiction.
Initially, the Bran Castle (in Slavic „brana” means „gate”) was a stronghold known as Dietrichstein, built by the Teutonic Knights in 1212, stronghold that was conquered by the Saxons living in Transylvania towards the end of the 13th century.
Because Bran Castle is the only castle in all of Transylvania that actually fits Bram Stoker’s description of Dracula’s Castle, it is known throughout the world as Dracula’s Castle.

Stoker is widely purported to have used the illustration of Bran Castle in Charles Boner’s book, Transylvania: Its Product and Its People, (London: Longmans, 1865) to describe his imaginary Dracula's Castle.
