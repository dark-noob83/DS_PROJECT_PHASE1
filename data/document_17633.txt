Carbon sequestration, a process where CO 2 is pulled from the atmosphere and stored for a long period of time, may be one way to slow or reverse the accumulation of CO 2 in the Earth’s atmosphere. Long-lived products – Wood and other products made from trees still contain the carbon absorbed by the plants that they came from. When a tree is utilized for wood, its ability to sequester carbon is extended, and the carbon is not released until the product burns or decomposes.
The large amount of carbon is locked up under the sea in the form of calciferous rock (limestone) formed by many small sea creatures dying, drifting to the ocean bed, and over … many years of great pressure being turned into rock. Carbon is also stored in coral reefs. A good estimate is that each tree stores up to 13 pounds of CO2 annually, and that half of a trees dry mass is made up of Carbon (mainly in the form of cellulose). Therefore, the most carbon is stored in trees.
Aboveground – Carbon is stored in the leaves, stems, and other parts of plants when they absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere and use it to grow. Trees are very important for carbon sequestration because they live a long time and can store their carbon for many years. Long-lived products – Wood and other products made from trees still contain the carbon absorbed by the plants that they came from. When a tree is utilized for wood, its ability to sequester carbon is extended, and the carbon is not released until the product burns or decomposes.
When you exhale, you are placing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon is found in the lithosphere in the form of carbonate rocks. Carbonate rocks came from ancient marine plankton that sunk to the bottom of the ocean hundreds of millions of years ago that were then exposed to heat and pressure. Carbon is also found in soil from dead and decaying animals and animal waste. Carbon is found in the biosphere stored in plants and trees. Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make the building blocks of food during photosynthesis. Carbon is found in the hydrosphere dissolved in ocean water and lakes. Carbon is used by many organisms to produce shells
Carbon is also found in the atmosphere where it's a part of carbon dioxide gas emitted when fossil fuels are burned and when living organisms breathe. It's in organic matter in the soil, and it's in rocks. But far and away the most carbon on Earth is stored in a surprising place: the ocean. There's estimated to be 38,000 to 40,000 billion metric tons of carbon in the ocean itself with a whopping 66 million to 100 million-billion metric tons of carbon in marine sediments and sedimentary rocks. It's enough to leave anyone wondering just what the heck carbon is and where the Earth is keeping all of it. Carbon is a chemical element, and a pretty common one. It's the sixth most common element in the universe and the 15th most common one in the Earth's crust. Unlike a lot of other chemical elements, you can actually see some forms of carbon
Forests store large amounts of carbon. In the US, forests make up 90% of the US carbon sink and sequester about 10-15% of US CO 2 emissions. There are four places where carbon can be stored: Long-lived products – Wood and other products made from trees still contain the carbon absorbed by the plants that they came from. When a tree is utilized for wood, its ability to sequester carbon is extended, and the carbon is not released until the product burns or decomposes.
It is always on the move! 1  Carbon moves from the atmosphere to plants. 2  In the atmosphere, carbon is attached to oxygen in a gas called carbon dioxide (CO 2). 3  With the help of the Sun, through the process of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is pulled from the air to make plant food from carbon. 1 Carbon moves from the atmosphere to plants. 2  In the atmosphere, carbon is attached to oxygen in a gas called carbon dioxide (CO 2). 3  With the help of the Sun, through the process of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is pulled from the air to make plant food from carbon. 4  Carbon moves from plants to animals.
One source of available carbon in the environment happens when an animal breathes out carbon dioxide. So carbon dioxide added to our atmosphere through the process of respiration is a carbon source. Carbon sinks are places where carbon is stored because more carbon dioxide is absorbed than is emitted. Carbon is also a very important element on Earth. Carbon is provided by the environment, moves through organisms and then returns to the environment again. When all this happens in balance, the ecosystem remains in balance too. In this section, let's follow the path of a carbon atom over many years and see what happens.
