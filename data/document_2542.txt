If you wish to replace the discs on the front an average price for a set of brake pads is approximately $60.00 - $111.00 but depending on the make and model of your car it could cost a lot more than that. 
1 For work on front and back brakes, CostHelper readers reported paying $273-$1,025 for an average of $567 at standard repair shops, or $280-$935 for an average of $578 at dealerships. Brake rotors/discs (the part the pads rub against to stop the vehicle) may last through two or three sets of pads before needing to be replaced; slightly scratched rotors can sometimes be resurfaced (shaving off enough metal to make them smooth again).
Depending on your car’s brake system, it may use between 4-8 brake pads. When you step on the brake pedal, the master cylinder sends fluid under pressure to the brake calipers (which hold the brake pads). The caliper presses the brake pad against the brake rotor, causing friction that slows down the car. Depending on where you drive (city driving tends to wear pads out quicker) brake pads usually last between 30,000-35,000 miles. Some vehicles (eg. BMW’s) are equipped with a low-pad-warning system.
Parts: $82 - $141. The average cost for a brake pad(s) replacement is between $179 to $264. Labor costs are estimated between $97 to $123 while parts are priced between $82 to $141. Get a personalized estimate based on your location and specific car. Estimate does not include taxes and fees. The brake rotors should be inspected when the pads are replaced, and depending on their condition, they may need resurfacing or replacement. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads.
Parts: $145 - $213. The average cost for a brake pad and rotor replacement is between $297 to $406. Labor costs are estimated between $152 to $193 while parts are priced between $145 to $213. Get a personalized estimate based on your location and specific car. Estimate does not include taxes and fees. Brake rotors should be measured at every brake pad replacement. If found to be at or below the manufacturer's minimum thickness specification, they will require replacement. These measurements should always be noted on your repair order. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads.
If the thickness of brake pads is less than 3mm, it is time to change the pads. Depending on where you drive (city driving tends to wear pads out quicker) brake pads usually last between 30,000-35,000 miles. Some vehicles (eg. BMW’s) are equipped with a low-pad-warning system. In these vehicles, you will also need to replace the brake sensors as part of the brake pad service
1 Edmunds provides do-it-yourself instructions for replacing brake pads, calling it an easier-than-expected DIY project that requires standard tools and takes about an hour, for a savings of about $250 in labor costs on most cars. Brake rotors/discs (the part the pads rub against to stop the vehicle) may last through two or three sets of pads before needing to be replaced; slightly scratched rotors can sometimes be resurfaced (shaving off enough metal to make them smooth again).
