So it is homozygous dominant or heterozygous (homozygous dominant = BB, heterozygous = Bb). Blue eyes are a recessive trait (homozygous recessive = bb). So, homozygous are carrying one single part of the trait, and heterozygous is carring a part of both traits.
Every gene has a dominant and recessive allele, homozygous is just when a gene has either two dominant alleles or two recessive alleles.
Brown eyes is a dominant trait. So it is homozygous dominant or heterozygous (homozygous dominant = BB, heterozygous = Bb). Blue eyes are a recessive trait (homozygous recessive = bb). So, homozygous are carrying one single part of the trait, and heterozygous is carring a part of both traits.
Homozygous and Heterozygous. If an organism has two copies of the same allele, for example AA or aa, it is homozygous for that trait. If the organism has one copy of two different alleles, for example Aa, it is heterozygous. Keep in mind that an organism can't simply be 'homozygous,' period.
Definition: Homozygous refers to having identical alleles for a single trait. Related Terms: Allele, Genes, Heterozygous. Examples: The gene for seed shape in pea plants exists in two forms, one form or allele for round seed shape (R) and the other for wrinkled seed shape (r).
