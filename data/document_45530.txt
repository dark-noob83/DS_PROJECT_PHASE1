Reactions and compounds. New substances are formed by chemical reactions. When elements react together to form compounds their atoms join to other atoms using chemical bonds. For example, iron and sulfur react together to form a compound called iron sulfide. Mixture of iron (grey) and sulfur (yellow) powders. Compounds usually have different properties from the elements they contain.
FIND OUT MORE. Most atoms join up with other atoms through chemical BONDS to form larger particles called molecules. They can join up with atoms of the same element or with atoms of different elements. Substances whose molecules contain different types of atom are called compounds.
When elements react, their atoms join with other atoms to form compounds [compound: A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements. ] . Chemical bonds form when this happens, which involves atoms transferring or sharing electrons.
Atoms are very, very small. A molecule is formed when atoms join together by chemical bonds. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other. They cannot be changed chemically into any different element.
