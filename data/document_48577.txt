Employee works 70 hours. Our fluctuating work week employee is still making the guaranteed $400 salary but now has 30 hours of overtime. That makes the employee’s regular rate of pay just $5.71 per hour ($400 divided by 70). That’s less than minimum wage so the fluctuating work week agreement would be invalid. So the fluctuating work week employee gets a better deal during the slow months. In the summer, that same employee might work 50 hours. The employee still gets the $400 guaranteed salary but when you look at the hourly rate, that employee is earning $8 per hour ($400 divided by 50).
Traditionally, with a fluctuating workweek a salary is paid for all hours worked, with half time for all hours worked after 40 hours. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employers utilizing this method must meet the following requirements: 1. 
Say the employer offers to pay the employee on a fluctuating work week by paying $400 each week, regardless of how many hours the employee works. In the winter, the employee might only work 30 hours, so that results in wages at $13.33 per hour ($400 divided by 30 hours). So the fluctuating work week employee gets a better deal during the slow months. In the summer, that same employee might work 50 hours. The employee still gets the $400 guaranteed salary but when you look at the hourly rate, that employee is earning $8 per hour ($400 divided by 50).
For the first week the employee is entitled to be paid $600; for the second week $600.00; for the third week $660 ($600 plus 10 hours at $6.00 or 40 hours at $12.00 plus 10 hours at $18.00); for the fourth week $650 ($600 plus 8 hours at $6.25, or 40 hours at $12.50 plus 8 hours at $18.75). If during the course of 4 weeks this employee works 40, 37.5, 50, and 48 hours, the regular hourly rate of pay in each of these weeks is $15.00, $16.00, $12.00, and $12.50, respectively.
Chinese Overtime. Chinese overtime, also known as the fluctuating work week, day rate, piece rate pay formula, is an informal term which refers to a situation where an employee receives half of their regular wage, instead of time-and-a-half, for hours worked over 40 in a single workweek. How Violations May Be Occurring. Employers are only permitted to pay Chinese overtime to employees who are paid using the fluctuating workweek method. These employees are those who earn a fixed salary each workweek for hours that vary from week to week.
(a) An employee employed on a salary basis may have hours of work which fluctuate from week to week and the salary may be paid him pursuant to an understanding with his employer that he will receive such fixed amount as straight time pay for whatever hours he is called upon to work in a workweek, whether few or many. If during the course of 4 weeks this employee works 40, 37.5, 50, and 48 hours, the regular hourly rate of pay in each of these weeks is $15.00, $16.00, $12.00, and $12.50, respectively.
The regular rate can go all the way down to the minimum wage, but that is it. Therefore, using the example of a guaranteed salary of $400.00 a week, the most the employee could work in a workweek under the fluctuating workweek overtime method for this example is 55 hours [$400.00 divided by $7.25 an hour = 55.17 hours]. FLUCTUATING WORKWEEK OVERTIME Fluctuating workweek overtime pay is a way to comply with the overtime pay requirements of time and half pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek when an employee’s time fluctuates from week to week.
To utilize the fluctuating work week overtime payment rules, the non-exempt employee must be paid a fixed salary for all hours worked, regardless of whether the employee works less than 40 hours or more than 40 hours in a given workweek (emphasis added). 1 In addition to the fixed salary, the employee must be paid overtime premiums for any hours worked over 40 in the workweek. 2  The overtime premium rate is 50% of the regular rate of pay for that workweek (can be tricky since the “regular rate of pay” may vary week to week, decreasing as the employee works longer hours).
The overtime half time pay cannot be a part of the $400.00 salary that is for the total straight time pay for all of the hours including the straight time pay for the hours over 40. The employee is still getting time and a half pay for the hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek. FLUCTUATING WORKWEEK OVERTIME Fluctuating workweek overtime pay is a way to comply with the overtime pay requirements of time and half pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek when an employee’s time fluctuates from week to week.
If the salary is for a 40-hour workweek, overtime is simple: divide the salary by 40 to get the regular rate, and then pay any overtime hours by multiplying 1.5 times the regular rate. However, if the salary is for a lesser workweek, such as 36 hours, divide the salary by 36 to get the regular rate. If the employee works 40 hours on such a basis, the total pay would be the salary for the 36 hours plus 4 hours times the regular rate.
