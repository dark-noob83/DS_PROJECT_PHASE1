Starch is a polysaccharide made from glucose. Since it is only made of glucose, starch is considered a homosaccharide. The basic chemical formula of starch, (C6H10O5) n, is similar to glucose, C6H12O6, - where n is the number of glucose molecules present.
Starch is found in potatoes, and in grains such as corn and wheat. Starch is made up of glucose repeat units. Click on the glucose to see it in 3-D. In your body, special proteins called enzymes (which are also polymers, by the way) break starch down into glucose, so your body can burn it for energy.
Starch is polysaccharides which contains long carbohydrate chains of glucose. Plants store starch as their energy source, which is used during plant growth and reproduction. Several types of starch storages are found in plants, including grains, legumes, and tubers. The two forms of starch found in plants are amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is composed of long, unbranched chains of glucose molecules, whereas amylopectin is made up of long, branched chains of glucose molecules.
Many sugar molecules linked together is a polysaccharide. Starch, therefore, is a polysaccharide. Specifically, starch is composed of the sugar glucose. Plants use glucose to produce energy, but they're not always making glucose, just as we're constantly eating to get our energy. Much like we store up energy reserves after eating, so do plants.
Starch is made of Carbon, Oxygen and Hydrogen. Starch is made of glucose mainly and this is why it is referred to  as a polymer of glucose. It has several units of glucose th â€¦ at are  linked together.
Starches are carbohydrates in which glucose sugar molecules are bonded together. It is a polysaccharide which plants use to store energy for later use. Foods such as potatoes, rice, corn and wheat contain starch granules which are important energy sources for humans.
