Medicare may pay some long-term care costs. Medicare is a federal program that pays for health care for people over age 65 and for people under age 65 with disabilities. If you meet all the necessary requirements for Medicare, it will cover up to 100 days of skilled care in a nursing home, per benefit period.
Costs increase on your birthday. The annual rate increases are generally 2-4 percent in your 50s but start to be 6 to 8 percent per-year in your 60s. In 2009, new buyers of individual long-term care insurance were the following ages: Under age 54 (26.5%).
Rates charged by different providers also vary significantly. According to a 2011 survey conducted by the American Association for Long Term Care Insurance, a typical comprehensive policy paying up to $150 per day for three years of care cost an average of $1,480 annually for a single person if purchased at age 55. However, premiums ranged from $1,325 to a high of $2,550.
Paying for Long­Term Care Without private insurance or public program coverage, the high cost of long­term care is unaffordable for most Americans. The average private pay cost of a nursing home stay in 2012 was about $88,000 per year and exceeded $100,000 in 10 states.
A long-term care insurance policy typically pays from $50 to $250 per day for nursing home care. To find out how much coverage you might need, call local nursing homes, home health care agencies, and adult day care centers in your area and ask about their cost for daily care.
