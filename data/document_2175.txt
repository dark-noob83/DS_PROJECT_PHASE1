Glomerular filtration is the process by which the kidneys filter the blood, removing excess wastes and fluids. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a calculation that determines how well the blood is filtered by the kidneys, which is one way to measure remaining kidney function.
Glomerular filtrate is the fluid that is filtered from blood in Bowman's Capsule that enters the nephron and eventually becomes urine. It is called glomerular filtrate because it is filtered through the glomerulus. See the wiki pages below.
in normal subjects the capillary endothelium of the glomerulus, by virtue of its fenestration, is permeable to all blood constituents except blood cells and colloids so that the glomerular filtrate has a close similarity to plasma and interstitial fluid but has a lower protein concentration than both of them.
A glomerulus is a network (as a tuft) of capillaries located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. It serves as the first stage in the filtering process of the blood carried out by the nephron in its formation of urine. The glomerulus is surrounded by a cup-like sac known as Bowman's capsule.
GFR-glomerular filtration rate is the best test to measure your level of kidney function and determine your stage of kidney disease. Your doctor can calculate it from the results of your blood creatinine test, your age, body size and gender.
glomerular filtration, the renal process whereby fluid in the blood is filtered across the capillaries of the glomerulus and into the urinary space of Bowman's capsule.
glomerular. pertaining to or of the nature of a glomerulus, especially a renal glomerulus. glomerular basement membrane. the structure located between endothelial cells of renal capillaries and the visceral epithelial cells of the glomerulus. It functions as a barrier to filtration of large molecules.
