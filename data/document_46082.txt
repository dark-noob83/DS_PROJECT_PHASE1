In the BARI trial (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation), 1,829 patients were followed for 5.4 years. (29) Annual mortality was 2.1% per year for bypass surgery and 2.7% per year for angioplasty. Event rate was 4% per year for surgery and 4.3% per year for angioplasty. In a 10 year study from St. Antonius Hospital in the Netherlands, 351 patients who had angioplasty were followed.(30) Annual mortality was 2% per year and cardiovascular event rate 10% per year.
A heart bypass procedure or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery can drastically improve survival rates and the quality of life for individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD). Quadruple bypass surgery prognosis depends on several factors including age, lifestyle, and general health.
In 9,212 patients with two vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, the annual mortality rate was 2.7 %. In 7,405 patients with two vessel disease undergoing coronary angioplasty the annual mortality rate was 2.3 %. For mortality related to age, see the National Medicare Experience below.
Oct. 15, 2007 -- The survival rates 10 years after coronary artery bypass surgery and angioplasty are similar, according to a new analysis of nearly 10,000 heart patients.
Another one stated she fully recovered after 5 months. Based on this triple bypass surgery survival rate discussion, the mortality rate of the patients who undergotriple bypass surgery is a low 1 out of 15 patients. Only one of them didnâ€™t make it and died.
In 17, 857 patients with disease of all three coronary arteries who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, the annual mortality rate was 3.3 %. In 1,294 patients with three vessel disease who underwent coronary angioplasty the annual mortality rate was 4.2 %.
In 2009, in-hospital mortality rates for patients who underwent bypass surgery was about 1.54 percent, the report said, compared to 3.23 percent in 1994.
The researchers evaluated the results of 23 clinical trials in which 5,019 patients were randomly assigned to get angioplasty with or without stents, also called catheter-based percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI, and 4,944 were assigned to get coronary artery bypass graft surgery, also called CABG.
