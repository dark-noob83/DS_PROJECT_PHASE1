Von Wagner distinguished soda, potash, double (soda and potash), and fixing (i.e., stabilizing) as types of water glass. The fixing type was a mixture of silica well saturated with potash water glass and a sodium silicate used to stabilize inorganic water color pigments on cement work for outdoor signs and murals. Sodium silicate solution is used to inexpensively, quickly, and permanently disable automobile engines. Running an engine with about 2 liters of a sodium silicate solution instead of motor oil causes the solution to precipitate, catastrophically damaging the engine's bearings and pistons within a few minutes.
Sodium silicate is the common name for compounds with the formula Na 2 (SiO 2) n O. A well-known member of this series is sodium metasilicate, Na 2 SiO 3. Also known as waterglass or liquid glass, these materials are available in aqueous solution and in solid form. Sodium silicate solution is used to inexpensively, quickly, and permanently disable automobile engines. Running an engine with about 2 liters of a sodium silicate solution instead of motor oil causes the solution to precipitate, catastrophically damaging the engine's bearings and pistons within a few minutes.
Sodium metasilicate anhydrous and sodium metasilicate pentahydrate are also known as types of sodium silicate, liquid glass or water glass. Pulp and Paper. One principal use of sodium metasilicate is in the pulp and paper industry. It is used in sizing and coating paper. It is also used, coupled with hydrogen peroxide, in the cellulose bleaching process, in which it acts as a buffer and stabilizing agent.
Toxicological summary for sodium metasilicate [6834-92-0] and its 01/2002 pentahydrate [10213-79-3] and nonahydrate [13517-24-3] Buckley, L.E. 1968. Letter, dated July 29, responding to an inquiry about the use of sodium metasilicate pentahydrate as a component of a fruit and vegetable washing mixture. Toxicological summary for sodium metasilicate [6834-92-0] and its 01/2002 pentahydrate [10213-79-3] and nonahydrate [13517-24-3] Inhalation of silicates causes fibrogenesis in the lungs but to a lesser extent than silica. Heavy prolonged exposure to silicates, however, produces characteristic lesions.
Solubility The maximum solubility of Metso Sodium Metasilicate Pentahydrate in water is dependent on the following: ■ The temperature. When making solutions at maximum concentration, it is important to maintain the tempera ture above the solubility point in order to avoid recrystallization. ■ The ion strength. Its multifunctional cleaning properties enhance the removal of fatty and particulate soil in both soft and hard water. The corrosion inhibiting properties of Sodium Metasilicate help protect both metal and non-metal surfaces.Metso Sodium Metasilicate Pentahydrate granules are white and free-flowing.
