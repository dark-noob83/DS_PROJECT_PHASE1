Make sure you plan to buy or rent a pressure washer ($40 to $200) before you start staining to strip away any dirt and grime on the wood. Deck staining supplies ($100 to $250) can be found at most home improvement stores. Water, wind, sunlight, and extreme temperatures all contribute to deck wear.

The overall cost of a concrete patio depends on the design and size of the patio. Prices usually start at around $6 per square foot up to $10 per square foot for a basic design without any colors or special designs.

The average price that homeowners pay for a concrete patio is around $2,800 to just over $4,000, but some homeowners report spending as little as $1,000 or as much as $6,500.

Tell your provider how much the new deck cost to build so that insurance coverage can be added to your policy. If the replacement value for your home is $200,000 and the deck cost $3,000, the policy will be increased to reflect the replacement cost of the new deck. The same holds true for any addition you make to your house whether it be a new garage, dormers or an additional room built on to your home. The magazine's survey indicates that a midrange wood deck addition that costs $10,350 in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. will recoup about 70 percent of its value at resale on the national average. In the same study, a composite deck addition that cost $15,579 recouped 62.8 percent on the national average.
