The joule (/ˈdʒuːl/), symbol J, is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred (or work done) to an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N·m).
1. A unit of work or energy transfer. One joule is equal to work done by a force of one newton moved about 1 m in the direction of the force. 2. (J) A unit of energy equal to the work done when a force of one newton is applied through a distance of one meter.
joule. 1. A unit of work or energy transfer. One joule is equal to work done by a force of one newton moved about 1 m in the direction of the force. 2. (J) A unit of energy equal to the work done when a force of one newton is applied through a distance of one meter. Used instead of calorie: 1 J = 0.239 cal.
Joule is the unit of energy used by the International Standard of Units (SI). It is defined as the amount of work done on a body by a one Newton force that moves the body over a distance of one meter.
The joule (pronounced DJOOL) is the standard unit of energy in electronics and general scientific applications. One joule is defined as the amount of energy exerted when a force of one newton is applied over a displacement of one meter.
joule-Computer Definition. The work done when a force of one newton applied to a point moves that application point one meter in the direction of application. Joule is named for James Prescott Joule (1818. A unit of energy in the MKS system.
