As of 2007, daylight time begins in the United States on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. On the second Sunday in March, clocks are set ahead one hour at 2:00 a.m. local standard time (which becomes 3:00 a.m. local daylight time). Not all places in the U.S. observe daylight time. In particular, Hawaii and most of Arizona do not use it. The most recent change to local daylight time policy was in 2006, when Indiana adopted the use of daylight time state-wide.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the City of Rochester, the Borough of Chatham and part of Strood Rural District were amalgamated to form the Borough of Medway, a local government district in the county of Kent. Gillingham chose to remain separate. In 1944 a Medway Towns Joint Amalgamation Committee was formed by the borough corporations of Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester, to discuss the possibility of the towns forming a single county borough.
When kids return from the summer break it takes a while to get back into the routine, to start on a Friday, and then go immediately to a two day weekend is counter productive and a waste of a day in my opinion. Then it irks me that school districts would still start on a Friday just to save one day at the end of the year. Getting students back into the flow of school should be the goal at the beginning. Coming in for a Friday and then off for 2 days is counter productive.
