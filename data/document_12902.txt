The Main Ingredients of Hummus. While the recipes vary, most hummus is made from mashing up chickpeas, mixing in some tahini, and then adding lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. The only real problem with hummus is that it’s made from chickpeas, as as we’ll soon see chickpeas are a no-go on Paleo.
Cauliflower replaces the chickpeas in this paleo version of hummus. Roasting the cauliflower gives it a nutty sweetness that works well with the traditional hummus ingredients — tahini, garlic and lemon.
PALEO ZUCCHINI HUMMUS. Hummus is a Middle Eastern sauce/dip that is traditionally made with ground chickpeas. This recipe uses zucchini instead to make it paleo-friendly, and includes olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, seasonings and tahini. Tahini is a paste made from ground sesame seeds.
To make hummus Paleo friendly you’ve got to get rid of the chickpeas, which requires a little creativity, and we’ve seen everything from zucchini to cauliflower to macadamia nuts or cashews used to replicate the taste and texture.
You can’t find pre-made paleo hummus — typically made from pureed chickpeas, lemon juice or vinegar, garlic, tahini (sesame seed butter), and olive oil — in any grocery store or restaurants across the country. But the thing is it is easy to make at home.
Yesterday, I noticed someone on twitter refer to “being hungry” so they ate “old hummus” and proceeded this with the #paleo hashtag. Now hummus, as you may or may not know, is made primarily from garbanzo beans (commonly referred to as chick peas) which by all Paleo standard is a no no. Legumes a definitely permitted.
To keep it short, No. The simple reason is that Hummus is made from Chickpeas (also known as Garbanzo Beans) and are classified as Legumes. Legumes such as Chickpeas, Peanuts, Lentils etc are not allowed on and as a result, Hummus is not a Paleo friendly food (Check out my list of foods not allowed on the Paleo diet).
