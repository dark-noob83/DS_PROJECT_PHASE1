The vertebrate cardiovascular system includes a heart, which is a muscular pump that contracts to propel blood out to the body through arteries, and a series of blood vessels. The upper chamber of the heart, the atrium (pl. atria), is where the blood enters the heart.
noun. The organ system in which the blood is pumped through the heart and circulates throughout the body through the blood vessels. Supplement. The cardiovascular system is a closed circulatory system seen in humans and other vertebrates. Its components include the heart, blood vessels, and blood.
Introduction to the Cardiovascular System. The cardiovascular system is sometimes called the blood-vascular, or simply the circulatory, system. It consists of the heart, which is a muscular pumping device, and a closed system of vessels called arteries, veins, and capillaries.
Structures of the Cardiovascular System. 1  Heart. 2  The heart is the organ that supplies blood and oxygen to all parts of the body. 3  This amazing muscle produces electrical impulses through a process called cardiac conduction. 4  These impulses cause the heart to contract and then relax, producing what is known as a heart beat.
Next Heart Anatomy: Blood Vessels. The heart is the organ that helps supply blood and oxygen to all parts of the body. It is divided by a partition or septum into two halves, and the halves are in turn divided into four chambers.
This system is comprised of the heart and the circulatory system. Structures of the cardiovascular system include the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The lymphatic system is also closely associated with the cardiovascular system.
