Size of the Sun as compared to Earth. The Sun has a diameter of about 1,392,000 km (~865,000 miles). Earth's diameter is 12,742 km (7,917.5 miles). The diameter of the Sun is thus 109 times as great as the Earth's diameter. In other words, you could line up 109 Earths across the face of the Sun. The Sun is about 109 times as large as Earth, in terms of diameter. The volume of a sphere varies as the cube of the sphere's diameter. Since the Sun's diameter is more than 100 times as large as the Earth's, the volume of the Sun is more than a million times the Earth's volume. To be more precise, the Sun's volume is roughly 1,304,000 times as great as Earth's.
It is 1,287,000 times bigger than a solitary Earth. The Sun has a diameter of 1,392,000 km (865,000 miles) while the Earth’s diameter is only 12,742 km (7,918 miles). In terms of weight, the Sun is 333,000 times heavier than the Earth and accounts for 98% of all mass in the solar system. Following are some other fun and interesting facts about the Sun. Temperature – The Sun’s surface is known as the photosphere and has a temperature of about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Big, Bigger, Biggest. Although the Sun looks small from Earth, it is really much, much bigger than our planet (and any other planet in the solar system). The Earth is actually one of the smaller planets compared to the giant planets in the outer solar system-Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
comparing the size of the Sun to Earth. The diameter of the Sun is 1,392,000 km, while the equatorial diameter of the Earth is 12,756 km. Compared to the Earth the Sun is HUGE. Join us on. Check out our new iSun|trek blog. There’s lots to discover on Sun|trek, so dive in and. start exploring here
At this particular moment in Earth’s history – although the sun’s diameter is about 400 times larger than that of the moon – the sun is also about 400 times farther away. So the sun and moon appear nearly the same size as seen from Earth. All the solar eclipses will be annular, with the moon not quite big enough to cover the sun completely. Bottom line: The sun’s diameter is about 400 times larger than that of the moon – and the sun is also about 400 times farther
The ratio of the Sun's radius to the Earth's radius is. 1,392,000/12756 = 109.1. This means the ratio of their volumes is 109.1 x 109.1 x 109.1, which is about 1,300,000,and that means that 1,300,000 Earths should fit inside the Sun. The diameter of the Sun is 1,392,000 km, while the equatorial diameter of the Earth is 12,756 km. Compared to the Earth the Sun is HUGE. Join us on. Check out our new iSun|trek blog.

Since the Sun is mostly made of hydrogen, which is much less dense than the rock that makes up most of Earth, the Sun outweighs our home planet to a lesser degree than it out-volumes Earth. The Sun's mass (1,989,100 x 10 24 kg) is only 333,000 times as great as Earth's (5.97 x 10 24 kg). The volume of a sphere varies as the cube of the sphere's diameter. Since the Sun's diameter is more than 100 times as large as the Earth's, the volume of the Sun is more than a million times the Earth's volume. To be more precise, the Sun's volume is roughly 1,304,000 times as great as Earth's.
It contains 99.86% of all of the mass of the entire Solar System. The Sun is 864,400 miles (1,391,000 kilometers) across. This is about 109 times the diameter of Earth. The Sun weighs about 333,000 times as much as Earth. It is so large that about 1,300,000 planet Earths can fit inside of it. Earth is about the size of an average sunspot! 1  Javascript must be enabled to use Cool Cosmos.
