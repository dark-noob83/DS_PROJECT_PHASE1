For example, a $5,000 well will cost $1 per square foot on a 5,000 s.f. house and $2 a s.f. on a 2,500 s.f. house. Since houses with low square footage of finished space still tend to have garages, porches, and all the other site costs, the cost per square foot tends to be higher.
Generally, turnkey costs will start at around $70 a square foot for a starter home in ideal conditions. An average level of finish will be more like $90-100. At $110-120 we are building a custom finish.
1. Local building permit costs & lay of property: Depending on what municipality/region you build in, pricing for building & development costs can range from as low as $10,000 to $30,000. For example, on a 1,800 square foot home, this translates to a difference of $11.00 per square foot.
At first glance, the average home building cost per square foot seems extremely high. People who do a lot of home improvement jobs are usually the first ones to question, because they know the cost of materials. The fact is that the materials are about 25-33 percent of the cost of a house.
1 It's possible to custom-build an 800-square-foot dome house for $1 million or a 12,000-square-foot rural ranch house for $400,000. 2  However, the $400,000 custom-built house is the exception rather than the rule.
1 A great deal depends on location plus the complexity of the project and the quality of the materials chosen. 2  It's possible to custom-build an 800-square-foot dome house for $1 million or a 12,000-square-foot rural ranch house for $400,000. 3  However, the $400,000 custom-built house is the exception rather than the rule.
1 A slab foundation for an average 1,600- to 1,800-square-foot family home might cost about $7,000-$16,000 or more, while a slab foundation for a 3,000- to 4,500-square-foot home might cost $13,000-$40,000 or more.
Home prices of $55, $66, $72, $80, $84, $92, $110, $118, and $328 per square foot combine to produce an average of $112 per square foot, which is probably a reasonable figure for many areas of the country. However, the difference between the lowest figure and the highest is very substantial.
An average commercial steel building costs between $16 and $20 per square foot, including building package (I-Beams, purlins, girts etc.) , delivery, foundation and the cost of construction.
