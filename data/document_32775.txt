According to the body temperature scale in Celsius, the temperature is normal when it is 37 degrees Celsius. Temperatures up to 37.3 and down to 36.7 are considered to be within the normal body temperature scale in Celsius. Hyperthermia occurs when the temperature rises above 37.3 degrees. The human body manages its own temperature within a normal range within which the body is designed to function. Different body systems and organs work properly when the body is at its optimum temperature.
The average normal human body temperature is 37 degrees C (98.6 degress F) but it can vary somewhat for an individual. The average adult temperature is 36.8 degrees C (98.2 degrees F). Older people will average a bit less. These values can also vary with time of day, with a typical individual range of 0.5 degrees C (0.9 degrees F). Temperatures can and will be markedly different with exposure to cold or hot environmental temperatures.
Most people think of a normal body temperature as an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) . This is an average of normal body temperatures. Your temperature may actually be 1°F (0.6°C) or more above or below 98.6°F (37°C) . 
The equivalent to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit is 37 degrees Celsius. This is the average normal human body temperature, which is slightly lower in adults. The range is 36.8 degr … ees plus or minus 0.7 degrees. Normal temperature range will vary, sometimes considerably, for individuals. The average adult temperature is 36.8 degrees C (98.2 degrees F). Older people will average a bit less. These values can also vary with time of day, with a typical individual range of 0.5 degrees C (0.9 degrees F). Temperatures can and will be markedly different with exposure to cold or hot environmental temperatures.
The normal core body temperature of a healthy, resting adult human being is stated to be at 98.6 degrees fahrenheit or 37.0 degrees celsius. This is the accepted standard temperature for the normal core body temperature. Axillary temperatures are an external measurement taken in the armpit or between two folds of skin on the body. This is the longest and most inaccurate way of measuring body temperature, the normal temperature falls at 97.6 °F or 36.4 °C.
The normal body temperatures for children are the same as an adult human and are considered to be between 36 to 36.8 degrees Celsius or 96.8 to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit. In a child, any temperature that exceeds 36 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is considered to be high and is medically classed as a fever.

The range is 36.8 degrees plus or minus 0.7 degrees. Normal temperature range will vary, sometimes considerably, for individuals.
Normal human body temperature, also known as normothermia or euthermia, depends upon the place in the body at which the measurement is made, the time of day, as well as the activity level of the person. Nevertheless, commonly mentioned typical values are: The body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change.
The normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F). In adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 33.2–38.2 °C (91.8–100.8 °F) for normal temperatures, depending on the gender and location measured. The body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change.
