The Income Classes The Upper Class At the top of the income classes is the upper class, also known as the 1% or as the 5% because this class makes up about 1-to-5% of the entire American population. However, some sources state that as much as 15% of the American population could fall into the upper class. The Median The median income amount is the amount that divides the U.S. incomes in half, with the median income being $50,054. Approximately half of Americans will fall below this household income amount, and the other half will fall above.
Standard Definition: $25,000-$100,000 a year is what most would consider as a middle class income. The $75,000 spread accounts for the wide cost of living differential between places like New York City and Fargo, North Dakota. Everybody who lives in NYC or San Francisco will tell you that $25,000 a year is poor. 
1 Income Range: There are some economists who say that anyone who makes between $25,000 and $100,000 a year is middle class. 2  That might be surprising to some, though. 3  Median Income: Others take a look at the median annual income, and then go $20,000 to either side. 1 For many tax policies, the cutoff often discussed is $250,000 (even though the fiscal cliff deal used $400,000 as the point for higher taxes), suggesting that some think that you can be considered to have a middle class income as long as you make less than $250,000 a year.
Middle class a matter of income, attitude. CINCINNATI -- Strictly speaking, the median, or middle, household income in the United States today is $50,054. That's easy. The hard part is figuring out how far above or below the middle someone's income can go and still be considered middle class. A 2008 Pew poll found that 40% of Americans with incomes below $20,000 – roughly equivalent to the poverty line – described themselves as middle class. And about one-third with incomes above $150,000 said they're middle class, too.
The U.S. Census Bureau breaks down the reported household incomes into quintiles (or five divisions). In 2007, the middle quintile reported an income range of $36,000 to $57,660. Many economists and politicians alike believe this range is too narrow to encompass the true middle class of America. Therefore, a more generous range would include the middle three quintiles, which makes the range from $19,178 to $91,705. Surveys conducted by the PewResearch Center confirm that salary, or income, range is not the only determining factor of what class a person considers himself. Four out of 10 Americans with incomes below $20,000 classify themselves as middle class.
1 Those whose incomes fall in the bottom 20% are considered poor. 2  Everyone else (the middle 60%) is middle class. 3  Income Range: There are some economists who say that anyone who makes between $25,000 and $100,000 a year is middle class. 4  That might be surprising to some, though. 1 For many tax policies, the cutoff often discussed is $250,000 (even though the fiscal cliff deal used $400,000 as the point for higher taxes), suggesting that some think that you can be considered to have a middle class income as long as you make less than $250,000 a year.
1 In 2010, the Census Bureau reports that the median income in the United States was $49,445, so if you go a little lower or higher, you get a middle class range of between about $30,000 and $70,000 a year. 2  Tax Policies: Of course, if you look at tax policies, the middle class grows substantially. 1 For many tax policies, the cutoff often discussed is $250,000 (even though the fiscal cliff deal used $400,000 as the point for higher taxes), suggesting that some think that you can be considered to have a middle class income as long as you make less than $250,000 a year.
Middle class is a tricky concept. Depending on where you live, you can feel middle class earning as much as $250,000 a year — about five times the US median income of $52,250 from the same time period. In this analysis, Pew defined middle class households as those earning 67%-200% of a state's median income. So ... 
Next is the lower-middle class, which is primarily comprised of lower-level, white-collar workers. These workers typically have college educations, but lack the graduate degrees needed to advance to higher levels of employment. Income for these workers generally falls between $32,500 and $60,000. Upper-middle-class workers typically have post-graduate degrees and work at high-level, white-collar positions. Household income for these workers is often above $100,000. According to the Census bureau, upper-middle-class, or professional class workers, earn enough to be in the top one-third of American incomes
