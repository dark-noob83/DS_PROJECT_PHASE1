Insects require oxygen to live, and produce carbon dioxide as a waste product, just as we do. To say insects breathe, though, might be a stretch. They don't have lungs, nor do they transport oxygen through their circulatory systems.
Insects do not breathe the same way that we do. Oxygen travels to insect tissues through tiny openings in the body walls called spiracles, and then through tiny blind-ended, air-filled tubes called tracheae.
Best Answer: They breath through their abdomen. @@@@ Unlike humans, spiders have an open circulatory system and therefore do not breathe through their mouth. Instead, spiders breathe through four respiratory organs found on their underside. Their respiratory system consists of two very different pairs of organs.
Spiders obtain their oxygen through four respiratory organs located on the underside of their abdomens. These organs are arranged into two pairs, an anterior pair at the very front end of the abdomen, and a posterior pair behind the anterior pair.
The Breathing System of Insects. The tracheal breathing system of insects. Insects do not breathe through their mouths as we do. The do not have lungs and their blood, which is a watery, yellowish liquid, does not carry oxygen and carbon dioxide around their bodies. Insects have a system of tubes, called tracheae, instead of lungs. These tracheae penetrate right through the insect's body.
The spider does breath through  it's legs, and they also smell through small scent detecting hairs  on their legs.   A few have rudimentary (book) lungs, but most don't breath - they  do their gas exchange via pores and allow diffusion (partial)  pressure to move gases in and out of cells.
