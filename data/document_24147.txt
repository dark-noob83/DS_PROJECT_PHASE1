Cooperation involves individuals or groups working together for the achievement of their individual or collective goals. In its simplest form, cooperation may involve only two people who work together towards a common goal. Two college students working together to complete a laboratory experiment, or two inter-city youths working together to protect their 'turf' from violation by outsiders are examples. In these cases, solidarity between the collaborators is encouraged and they share jointly the reward of their cooperation. Cooperation is important in the life of an individual that it is difficult for man to survive without it. C.H. Cooley says that Cooperation arises only when men realize that they have a common interest. They have sufficient theme, intelligence and self control, to seek this interest through united action.

The term is often used in the plural form, dynamic capabilities, emphasizing that the ability to react adequately and timely to external changes requires a combination of multiple capabilities. The basic assumption of the dynamic capabilities framework is that core competencies should be used to modify short-term competitive positions that can be used to build longer-term competitive advantage.
Intragroup dynamics (also referred to as ingroup-, within-group, or commonly just ‘group dynamics’) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms, roles, relations, and common goals that characterize a particular social group. The social group is a critical source of information about individual identity. An individual’s identity (or self-concept) has two components: personal identity and social identity (or collective self). One’s personal identity is defined by more idiosyncratic, individual qualities and attributes.
It takes time, but the results can be very worthwhile. Cooperation is working together for a common purpose or benefit (Oliphant 2011). Cooperation is essential to long-term group effectiveness and is frequently associated with trust (Dirks 1999). Trust in a person, a group, or an institution is based on the reliability, truthfulness, ability, or strength of that person, group, or institution (Walumbwa, Luthans, Avey, and Oke 2011). Trust is essential for individuals to work effectively in committees, clubs, communities, offices, or families.

Control may involve interactions between systems that are otherwise segregated or antagonistic. The human brain is characterized by a remarkable ability to adapt its information processing based on current goals. The extent to which large-scale brain systems can reconfigure their functional architecture in a context-dependent manner has also been demonstrated by studies that have examined interactions between the DMN and task-positive systems.
