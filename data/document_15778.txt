The infiltration rate is the velocity or speed at which water enters into the soil. It is usually measured by the depth (in mm) of the water layer that can enter the soil in one hour. An infiltration rate of 15 mm/hour means that a water layer of 15 mm on the soil surface, will take one hour to infiltrate. In dry soil, water infiltrates rapidly. This is called the initial infiltration rate.
Design infiltration rates, in inches per hour, for A, B, C, and D soil groups. Corresponding USDA soil classification and Unified soil Classifications are included. Note that A soils have two infiltration rates that are a function of soil texture.*. Link to this table.
This is called the basic infiltration rate (Table 7). The infiltration rate depends on soil texture (the size of the soil particles) and soil structure (the arrangement of the soil particles: see Volume 1) and is a useful way of categorizing soils from an irrigation point of view (see Table 8).
What it is: Infiltration is the downward entry of water into the soil. The velocity at which water enters the soil is infiltration rate. Infiltration rate is typically expressed in inches per hour. Water from rainfall or irrigation must first enter the soil for it to be of value.
