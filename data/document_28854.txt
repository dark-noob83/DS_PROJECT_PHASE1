Lava flows constitute the greatest volcanic hazard from these volcanoes. This report is concerned with lava flow hazards on Mauna Loa, the largest of the island shield volcanoes. Hilo lies 58 km from the summit of Mauna Loa, the Kona coast 33 km, and the southernmost point of the island 61 km. Hawaiian volcanoes erupt two morphologically distinct types of lava, aa and pahoehoe
Mauna Loa, or Long Mountain in Hawaiian, is located on the island of Hawaii. It is pictured above rising 13,680 ft. (4,170 m) above sea level (this photo was taken from over Loihi seamount, some 30 km or so to the south). Since 1832, Mauna Loa has erupted 39 times; its last eruption was in 1984. 
jeep trail. Mauna Loa is the largest volcano on earth. It is an active shield volcano, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (75,000 km³), although its peak is about 120 feet (37 m) lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea, another of five volcanoes that form the Island of Hawaiʻi. The Hawaiian name Mauna Loa means Long Mountain.. Mauna Loa's most recent eruption occurred from March 24, 1984, to April 15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the volcano have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, and the city of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late nineteenth century.
It is an active shield volcano with relatively gentle slopes, with a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles (75,000 km 3), although its peak is about 120 feet (37 m) lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea. Lava eruptions from Mauna Loa are silica-poor and very fluid, and they tend to be non-explosive. At 1 million to 700,000 years of age, Mauna Loa is the second youngest of the five volcanoes on the island, making it the third youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.
The Mauna Loa Volcano is the largest volcano on the planet as it rises over 4 kilometers above the sea level but the 4 kilometers that you see on top is not even half the size of the volcano. Activity. The Mauna Loa Volcano is not only a big size; it is also one of the most active volcanoes in the world. Since the first documented eruption in 1843 there have been an additional 32 eruptions.
As of 2011, minimal seismic activity indicates little likelihood that breakout flows will occur in the near future. Mauna Loa is a type of volcano called a shield volcano, which traditionally does not produce violent eruptions. In 1950, the eruption of Mauna Loa sent voluminous amounts of lava downslope through small villages in upper Ho'okena, destroying homes, a gas station, lodge, church and a cemetery. In 1984, flows came within four miles of Hilo, sparing the town but destroying the forests above.

At the summit of Mauna Loa, around Moku`aweoweo caldera, lie several deposits of ancient explosive debris. These deposits rest atop pahoehoe lava flows that spilled out from the top of the volcano around 1,000 to 1,500 years ago. Kilauea had violent steam-driven eruptions as recently as 1924, but Mauna Loa has not produced any major explosions in recorded history. Even though an explosive eruption from Mauna Loa has never been witnessed, ample geologic evidence for pre-historic explosive eruptions exists high atop Mauna Loa.
