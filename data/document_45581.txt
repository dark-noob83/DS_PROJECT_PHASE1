Base Salary Basics. If you receive a job offer with an annual base salary of $48,000, that amount is distributed to you over the year in periodic installments. If your company makes monthly payroll distributions, for instance, you receive $4,000 in gross pay with every installment.
DEFINITION of 'Base Pay'. An employee's initial rate of compensation, excluding extra lump sum compensation or increases in the rate of pay. An employee's base pay can be expressed as a base hourly rate of pay or as an annual salary.
Definition. Base salary is a fixed amount of money paid to an employee by an employer in return for work performed. Base salary does not include benefits, bonuses or any other potential compensation from an employer. Base salary is paid, most frequently, in a bi-weekly paycheck to an exempt or professional employee.
Minimum base salary is a term used when an organization's pay schedule includes ranges for each position. For example, if a company advertises a marketing position with a salary range of $40,000 to $47,000, the minimum base salary is $40,000. A job applicant knows that he'll be paid at least that amount.
