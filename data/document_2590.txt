Where RNA is Found. Cell Nucleus. Here RNA comes into existence as the newly created messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. It undergoes some modification before being transported out into the cytoplasm. Modifications include 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing.
DNA is found mostly in the cell nucleus, but another type of nucleic acid, RNA, is common in the cytoplasm. Watson and Crick proposed that RNA must copy the DNA message in the nucleus and carry it out to the cytoplasm, where proteins are synthesized.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is found in the cell's ribosomes, the specialized structures that are the sites of protein synthesis). Transfer RNA (tRNA) found in the cytoplasm which carries amino acids to the ribosomes for incorporation into a protein. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic blueprint copied from the sequence of bases in a cell's DNA. This blueprint specifies the sequence of amino acids in
Another major difference between DNA and RNA is that DNA is usually found in a double-stranded form in cells, while RNA is typically found in a single-stranded form, as shown in the illustration above. The lack of a paired strand allows RNA to fold into complex, three-dimensional structures.
RNA Can Also Be Found ... ... in the bacterial genome and also in viruses. There are also RNA viruses where the principal genetic material is RNA, and not DNA. It is usually single-stranded, but double-stranded forms exist too.
Report Abuse. the RNA bases are found in the nucleus, they form into an RNA chain when protein synthesis begins. once formed, the RNA travels through the cytoplasm to the golgi apparatus where the ribosomes are found.
