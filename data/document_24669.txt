A more advanced 100 square foot colored concrete patio installation costs homeowners between $713 and $933 on average, which includes $188 to $204 worth of materials and $525 to $728 worth of labor costs.
Each one is added right to the concrete in the concrete truck, mixed for about 5 minutes and the gray concrete is now the color you chose. Shake on color hardener concrete cost: $4.50 dollars per square foot, that includes the basic floor package and a shake-on color hardener. Shake-on color is color that is broadcast onto the surface of a concrete floor and floated into the surface to give it color.
Approximately 10 to 30% to the cost of the concrete itself. But it only adds a fraction to the total installed cost, since most colored concrete is mixed and finished in the same way as uncolored concrete.
A. The cost to add color to the concrete mix (in the truck) is about 35 - 40 dollars per bag. We add 1 bag per yard of concrete. The cost to use the color surface hardener is about 32 dollars a bag. A bag of surface hardener will cover about 100 square feet of concrete surface. For a 4 inch concrete floor, 1 yard of concrete will cover 80 square feet. The cost would be very close either way for a 4 inch concrete floor. If the floor is thicker than 4 inches, then the surface hardener is less money to use.
Some things that may add to that cost are: site and sub-base preparation, site access, small floors under 500 sq. ft., and thicker concrete. Integral colored concrete floor cost: $3.75 dollars per square foot, that includes the basic concrete floor package and adding color to the concrete.
