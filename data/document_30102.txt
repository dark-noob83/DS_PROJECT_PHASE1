Early and aggressive treatment increases the patient’s chances of survival and close monitoring is required. Recovery from mild sepsis is common, but mortality rates are approximately 15% and mortality rate for severe sepsis or septic shock is approximately 50%. For MRSA patients the mortality rate is 20 – 50%.
