1 The entire focuser can be rotated relative to the telescope tube thereby making orientation of the focus knobs convenient. 2  This also allows the positioning of objects and the location of guide stars much easier. 3  The focuser body is located in a tube adapter ring and locked in place with the focuser-locking ring.
For Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, the 2 focuser with either the 0.8, or the 1.5 draw tube will work. If the Schmidt-Cassegrain uses a fork-type mount, the 0.8 draw tube travel option, combined with the shorty adapter will provide clearance between the focuser and the fork-mounting in most cases.
Focuser. A focuser is part of the telescope mechanism which allows the telescope to adjust its focus, done by either turning a knob or gear in the telescope; thereby adjusting its eyepiece or mirror. There are many different types of focusers, varying in design, use, and models.
Many believe that magnification is the most important factor in a telescope. Well, this is partially true, because a telescope that does not magnify is pretty useless (single power reflex type finders notwithstanding). But, too much magnification causes a host of problems in the image.
A focuser is an integral part of a telescope, and one of the first parts of a telescope that is easily worn out due to being constantly used and moved. It is thus important for a focuser to be well made and be durable.
Includes focuser with adapters for the rear of any Meade LX200-ACF or LS model telescope and cord to plug into the focuser port of the telescope. This focuser is also compatible with LX200GPS models. Not compatible with LX200 Classic or Meade LX90 models.
If your telescope is a Newtonian, where the focuser axis will move in a generally horizontal direction, our standard 2 focuser should work fine. If however, the focuser axis of travel is perpendicular, as in Refractor and Schmidt-Cassegrain style telescopes, you may want to consider a focuser with an internal brake.
