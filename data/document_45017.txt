● A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table whose values must have matching values in the primary key of another (or the same) table. A foreign key is said to reference its primary key. Foreign keys are a mechanism for maintaining data integrity.
Primary Key Constraints. A table typically has a column or combination of columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in the table. This column, or columns, is called the primary key (PK) of the table and enforces the entity integrity of
Primary Key can't accept null values. Foreign key can accept multiple null value. By default, Primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the sequence of clustered index. Foreign key do not automatically create an index, clustered or non-clustered. You can manually create an index on foreign key. We can have only one Primary key in a table.
A primary key is a field or set of fields with values that are unique throughout a table. Values of the key can be used to refer to entire records, because each record has a different value for the key. Each table can only have one primary key.
A foreign key, simply stated, is another table's primary key. The values in a foreign key field match values in the primary key, indicating that the two records are related — for example, a customer and an order that she has placed. Unlike primary keys: A table can have more than one foreign key.
In a foreign key reference, a link is created between two tables when the column or columns that hold the primary key value for one table are referenced by the column or columns in another table. This column becomes a foreign key in the second table.
