If the 900 watts means the input power, then 1000 w inverter would be ok. If the microwave produces 900 w of cooking power, you will need a bit more, maybe 1200-1400 w if you don't know what the input power rating of the microwave is.
Power Ratings of inverters. Inverters come in size ratings all the way from 50 watts up to 50,000 watts, although units larger than 11,000 watts are very seldom used in household or other PV systems. The first thing you have to know about your inverter is what will be the maximum surge, and for how long.
The size you choose will depend on the watts of the appliance or tool you want to run (find the power consumption by referring to the specification plate on the appliance or tool). We recommend you to buy a larger model than you think you'll need (at least 10% to 20% more than your largest load).
Some small 400 Watt inverters plug into a cigarette lighter outlet and do a fine job. A good pure-sine inverter of this size will run your TV, DVD and Satellite. Or it will power a laptop or two and a printer. You could also install a small inverter permanently, say 400 or 500 Watts, to run home entertainment.
A very simple way to use an inverter for emergency power (such as during a power outage), is to use a car battery (with the vehicle running), and an extension cord running into the house, where you can then plug in electrical appliances.
All the other appliances together require about 300 Watts. So the minimum size inverter for our example is about 1500 Watts. If you plan to run the microwave and other high power items from the generator instead of the inverter you can use a smaller inverter.
If a microwave uses 1500 watts, and runs for 10 minutes, that is 1/6th of an hour x 1500, or 250 WH. When you buy power from your friendly utility (look at your last bill), they sell it to you at so much per kWh. A kWh is a kilowatt hour, or 1000 watts for one hour (or 1 watt for 1000 hours).
The size you choose will depend on the watts of the appliance or tool you want to run (find the power consumption by referring to the specification plate on the appliance or tool). We recommend you to buy a larger model than you think youâ€™ll need (at least 10% to 20% more than your largest load).
You'll need over 1,200 watts capacity. You'll also need at least 200AH (Amp Hours) of battery capacity (to run a microwave for brief periods). You'll need more battery reserve for longer periods and heavier loads. If you'll be cooking full dinners for 30 minutes, you'll need a 400AH battery capacity.
Short Answer: The size you choose depends on the watts (or amps) of what you want to run (find the power consumption by referring to the specification plate on the appliance or tool). We recommend you buy a larger model than you think you'll need (at least 10% to 20% more than your largest load).
