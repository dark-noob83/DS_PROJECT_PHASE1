Climate and Location. Health Issues. There are two types of tundra in the world, Arctic and Alpine. The arctic tundra is at the top of the world around the North Pole. The tops of tall cold mountains are alpine tundra.
The Rocky Mountains are in a tundra biome which means the tundra has one of the largest mountain range on Earth inside of its grasp! The tundra is mainly flat except for its occasional mountain ranges so it does not have any canyons.
The tundra biome is considered a carbon dioxide sink because it stores more carbon dioxide than it gives off. There are very few trees that grow in the tundra biome. Under the snow and ice, there is a thick layer of soil that remains frozen which does not allow deep rooted plants such as trees to grow.
Arctic Map. The Arctic is a region of the planet, north of the Arctic Circle, and includes the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Baffin Island, other smaller northern islands, and the far northern parts of Europe, Russia (Siberia), Alaska and Canada.
There are two types of tundra-arctic tundra and alpine tundra. The arctic tundra is located within the Arctic Circle while the alpine tundra is the area high in the mountains above trees. The plants that grow in the tundra biome often grow in clusters to help protect themselves from the severe winter winds.
The tundra biome covers about 20% of the Earth. Although Antarctica is not located in the Arctic Circle, it is considered to be a part of the tundra biome because of its very harsh temperatures. The tundra biome is the driest place on Earth. Rainfall averages ten inches a year. During the summer, it is daylight 24 hours a day.
Arctic Tundra Arctic tundra is found across northern Alaska, Canada, and Siberia. This biome has long cold winters and short cool summers. The Arctic tundra has low precipitation (less than 10 inches per year) and dry winds. These conditions make the Arctic tundra a desert-like climate (see climograph).
