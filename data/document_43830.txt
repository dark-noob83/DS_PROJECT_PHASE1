Fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas, are currently the world's primary energy source. Formed from organic material over the course of millions of years, fossil fuels have fueled U.S. and global economic development over the past century.
The three fossil fuels--oil, natural gas and coal--are the decayed remains of the plants and animals that lived and died more than 300 million years ago. Buried and compressed under layers of rock and sand in the earth and beneath the oceans, those remains became the deposits of fossil fuels.
Of the three fossil fuels, for a given amount of energy released, coal produces the most carbon dioxide and natural gas produces the least. Coal and oil release sulfur dioxide gas when they burn, which causes breathing problems for living creatures and contributes to acid rain.
Where Fossil Fuels Come From. There are three major forms of fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. All three were formed many hundreds of millions of years ago before the time of the dinosaurs – hence the name fossil fuels. The age they were formed is called the Carboniferous Period. It was part of the Paleozoic Era.
A fossil fuel is any hydrocarbon that may be used as a source of  energy. Coal, oil and natural gas are the three basic fossil fuels,  formed 300 million years ago from orga … nic plant and animal life  subjected to great heat and pressure under the ground. They are  classes as non-renewable sources of energy.
The three fossil fuels are natural gas, coal, oil. They were formed  in the earth from vegetation and other organic material 300 million  years ago.
