The precise origin of pole vaulting isn't known. It was likely discovered independently in a variety of cultures as a way of surmounting physical obstacles, such as streams or irrigation ditches. Egyptian relief sculptures from approximately 2500 B.C. depict warriors using poles to surmount enemy walls.
Pole vaulting is an athletic event where a person uses a long, flexible pole (which today are usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to leap over a bar. Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, as well as the Cretans and Celts.
Pole vaulting is an incredibly dynamic and complex sport that requires high levels of athleticism, precision, and skill. The process of the vault involves the transfer of energy from the vaulter to the pole, and finally back to the vaulter as he is launched into the air.
Pole vaulting originated in Europe, where men used a pole to cross canals filled with water. In this early form, the goal was distance rather than height. Colleges began competing in the pole vault in the late-1800's. Originally the vaulters competed on grass and used bamboo poles with a sharp point at the bottom.
