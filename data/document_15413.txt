Australian people. Australia is one of the most ethnically diverse societies in the world today. Almost one in four Australian residents were born outside of Australia and many more are first or second generation Australians, the children and grandchildren of recently arrived migrants and refugees. There were over 500 different clan groups or 'nations' around the continent, many with distinctive cultures, beliefs and languages. Today, Indigenous people make up 2.4 per cent of the total Australian population (about 460,000 out of 22 million people).
Other major religions represented in Australia today include Buddhism (2.4% of the population), Islam (2.1%), Hinduism (1.28%) and Judaism (0.45%). About 7,361 Australians practise Aboriginal traditional religions. About 22% of Australians have no religion. 30% of the population were born in another country. Of the overseas born, the major countries of birth are England, New Zealand and China. About 8.5% of Australians were born in non-English speaking countries [1] .
The proportion of the population who reported more than one ancestry increased from 22% in 2001 to 35% in 2006. For those who reported Australian ancestry, the second ancestries reported were mainly English (17% of the total Australian ancestry group), Scottish (4%) and Irish (3%). Australian residents who were previously nationals of the United Kingdom accounted for the largest group (21%) among the 103,350 people granted Australian citizenship in 2005-06 (table 14.41). This is consistent with the large numbers of United Kingdom-born people resident in Australia.
